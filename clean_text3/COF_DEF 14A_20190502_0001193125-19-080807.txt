Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, motivate and reward leaders who can foster strong business results and promote our long-term success. We believe our executive compensation program strongly links rewards with both business and individual performance over multiple time horizons, which aligns our executives' interests with those of our stockholders while supporting safety and soundness and appropriately balancing risk. 
2018 Company Performance 
Each year the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") and the other independent members of our Board (the "Independent Directors") review and evaluate the Company's qualitative and quantitative performance and make determinations regarding the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs") based on Capital One's pay-for-performance philosophy. The Committee's top priority is to implement a compensation program that aligns the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our stockholders. The Committee also seeks to directly link the compensation of the NEOs with the Company's performance, and the executives' contributions to that performance over appropriate time horizons. The Committee and the Independent Directors have the flexibility to adjust compensation decisions from year to year to take into account Company and individual performance, as well as evolving market practices. 
In 2018, Capital One delivered strong financial and operating results including record revenues and profits while continuing to invest in attractive long-term growth opportunities. We improved our franchise, unveiling new products and broadening our brand with marketing and advertising campaigns that drove awareness and growth. We delivered value to our customers and empowered them with great digital experiences and extended billions of dollars of credit to consumers, small business owners and commercial clients while maintaining our focus on risk and resilience. We attracted great talent and our people practices continue to garner recognition. We believe our investments will result in a company with the scale, brand, capabilities, talent and values to succeed as the digital revolution transforms our society and our industry.

Highlights of Our 2018 Compensation Programs 
We believe that our NEO compensation programs balance risk and financial results, reward NEOs for their achievements, promote our overall compensation objectives and encourage appropriate, but not excessive, risk-taking. Our compensation programs are structured to encourage our executives to deliver strong results over the short term while making decisions that create sustained value for our stockholders over the long term. Key features of our 2018 compensation programs include:

  ∎    No CEO Cash Salary. Our CEO does not receive a cash salary and 100% of his  compensation is at-risk based on his and the Companys performance.

While certain of our non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess  the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

See Appendix A for our reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in  accordance with GAAP.  
[END TABLE]

See Appendix A for our definition and reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with  GAAP.

2018 Compensation Decisions 
2018 CEO Performance Year Compensation. The CEO's compensation for the 2018 performance year was composed of equity awards designed to provide the CEO with an incentive to focus on long-term performance and the opportunity for a year-end incentive award based on the Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance and the CEO's contributions to that performance. Mr. Fairbank's total compensation for performance year 2018 was $17.5 million and consisted of:

The table above is presented to show how the Committee views compensation actions and to which year the compensation awards relate. This table differs substantially from the Summary Compensation Table required for this proxy statement beginning on page 81 and is therefore not a substitute for the information required in that table. See "Chief Executive Officer Compensation" beginning on page 56 for a description of the compensation paid to our CEO. 
2018 NEO Performance Year Compensation. NEO (other than the CEO) compensation for the 2018 performance year was composed of a mix of cash and equity-based compensation consisting of a base salary and an annual year-end incentive opportunity which consisted of a cash incentive and a long-term incentive opportunity. The long-term incentive opportunity was comprised of performance shares and stock-settled RSUs as determined by the Committee. The chart below shows the elements of NEO (other than the CEO) compensation as an approximate percentage of NEO 2018 actual total compensation: 
See "NEO Compensation" beginning on page 66 for a description of compensation to the NEOs (other than the CEO). 
Say on Pay and Response to Stockholder Feedback 
The Committee and the Board of Directors value the input of our stockholders. At our 2018 Annual Stockholder Meeting, more than 85% of our stockholders supported Capital One's named executive officer compensation. See "Consideration of 2018 Say on Pay Vote" beginning on page 53 for additional information regarding our Say on Pay vote. 
In recent years, in response to feedback received from our stockholders, the Committee and the Independent Directors have made significant improvements to Capital One's executive compensation program, practices and disclosures. The changes aim to simplify the program structure, further align our executive compensation practices with best practices and principles and enhance the transparency of our disclosures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Increased Alignment of CEO Pay and Performance. Beginning in 2019, the Committee and  the Independent Directors increased the alignment of CEO compensation with Company performance and stockholder interests by increasing the percentage of the CEOs total target compensation tied

     to a year-end evaluation of CEO and Company performance from 40% to 90%. The Committee and the Independent Directors believe that this structure further  aligns Mr. Fairbank's compensation with that of the Company's peers and provides a greater opportunity for the Committee and the Independent Directors to assess the Company and the CEO's performance after the completion of the  performance year. In addition, this structure enhances the Committee and the Independent Directors' ability to incorporate feedback from stockholders received during the year to ensure that the CEO's performance year compensation  appropriately reflects the Company's compensation philosophy, principles and business results. See "2019 CEO Compensation Program" beginning on page 65 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    New Performance Share Award Metrics. Beginning in 2018, the performance shares  awarded to the named executive officers vest based on two metrics: Common Dividends + Growth of Tangible Book Value per Share (D+TBV) and Adjusted ROTCE, each defined under Performance Share Award Metrics on page 59. The  Committee and the Independent Directors believe that these two performance metrics, in combination, provide a balanced and rigorous measurement of Company performance by balancing the creation of long-term stockholder value and the returns generated  on stockholders investment in the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Simplified NEO Compensation Program. In 2018, the Committee and the Independent  Directors modified the compensation program applicable to our NEOs (other than the CEO) to reduce the number of compensation vehicles, eliminating stock options and cash-settled RSUs, and more closely aligning the program vehicles and structure to  the programs used by the Companys peers. For 2018, this resulted in a greater percentage of such NEOs compensation awarded in the form of performance shares and an increase of NEO (other than the CEO) total target compensation linked to  Company and individual performance from 65% to 80%. See 2018 NEO Compensation Program beginning on page 66 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Enhanced Disclosures. We provided greater transparency regarding the  Committees use of discretion, particularly regarding the Companys performance and the year-end incentive awards granted to the NEOs, and introduced disclosure regarding the Companys approach  to environmental and social matters in addition to further detailing our governance principles and practices.

    Overview of Corporate Governance at Capital One

    Overview of Corporate Governance at Capital One   
[END TABLE]
Capital One is dedicated to strong and effective corporate governance that provides our Board of Directors ("Board") with the appropriate framework to engage in ongoing oversight of the Company's activities. Our Board believes that robust, dynamic corporate governance policies and practices are the foundation of an effective and well-functioning board, and are vital to preserving the trust of our stakeholders, including customers, stockholders, regulators, suppliers, associates and the general public. 
Information About Our Corporate Governance Policies and Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to formalize its governance practices and provide its view of effective governance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines embody many of our long-standing practices, policies and procedures, which collectively form a corporate governance framework that promotes the long-term interests of our stockholders, promotes responsible decision-making and accountability, and fosters a culture that allows our Board and management to pursue Capital One's strategic objectives. To maintain and enhance independent oversight, our Board regularly renews and refreshes its governance policies and practices as changes in corporate strategy, the regulatory environment and financial market conditions occur, and in response to investor feedback and engagement. 
The Board has also adopted Capital One's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("Code of Conduct"), which applies to Capital One's directors, executives and associates, including Capital One's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), Principal Accounting Officer and other persons performing similar functions. The Code of Conduct reflects Capital One's commitment to honesty, fair dealing, and integrity, and guides the ethical actions and working relationships of Capital One's directors, executives and associates in their interactions with investors, current and potential customers, fellow associates, competitors, governmental entities, the media, and other third parties with whom Capital One has contact. 
We encourage you to visit the "Corporate Governance" section of our website at www.capitalone.com. Select "About," then "Investors," to open the section where you can find our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Conduct, Committee Charters, Certificate of Incorporation, and Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws").

Our Perspectives on Overall Board Composition and Refreshment 
In recent years, the investor community has become increasingly focused on the composition of corporate boards and policies and practices that encourage board refreshment. At Capital One, we appreciate that our investors share our passion for cultivating a board that encompasses the optimal mix of diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills, expertise, qualifications, and an unwavering commitment to integrity and good judgment, in order to thoughtfully advise and guide management as they work to achieve our long-term strategic objectives. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee, under the direction of its Chair, who also currently serves as the Company's Lead Independent Director, assesses the composition of and criteria for membership on the Board and its committees on an ongoing basis. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Governance and Nominating Committee has taken a long-term view and continuously assesses the resiliency of the Board over the next ten to fifteen years in alignment with the Company's strategic direction to determine what actions may be desirable to best position the Board for success. The Governance and Nominating Committee considers a variety of factors, including the Company's long-term strategy, the skills and experiences that directors provide to the Board (including in the context of the Company's strategy), the performance of the Board and the Company, the Board's director retirement policy (as described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines), the Board's view that a resilient board should include members across a continuum of tenure, and the belief that valuable insights can be gained from gender and ethnic diversity among the Board's members. Over the last few years, the Governance and Nominating Committee has held discussions regarding director recruiting plans on a quarterly

 basis, and has provided regular updates to the Board on those plans. In support of the Board's long-term resiliency efforts, four new independent directors (representing more than 25% of the Board) have been appointed in the last five years. 
As a result of these long-term strategic resiliency assessments, the Governance and Nominating Committee has articulated a set of principles on board composition, which include:

The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews its effectiveness in balancing these considerations when assessing the composition of the Board, and has determined that all of our director nominees possess the personal characteristics, level of commitment to the Company, diversity, and skills and experience that align with the Company's long-term strategy and that enable the Board to operate in an engaged and effective manner. 
Specific Skills and Experience. The Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board regularly review the Board's membership in light of Capital One's business model and strategic goals and objectives, the regulatory environment and financial market conditions. In its review, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers whether the Board continues to possess the appropriate mix of skills and experience to oversee the Company in achieving these goals, and may seek additional directors as a result of this consideration. Our director nominees have specific experiences that, in the aggregate, meet an articulated set of director skills established by the Governance and Nominating Committee. These skills are not one-dimensional. Instead, these skills collectively allow our director nominees to leverage strategic and forward thinking, pattern recognition, and strong business acumen to inform Board discussions and create an engaged, effective, and strategically oriented Board.

When evaluating incumbent directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee also considers the director's performance throughout the year, including the director's attendance, preparation for and participation in Board and committee meetings, the director's annual evaluation, feedback received from fellow Board members, and the director's willingness to serve for an additional term, as further described in the section "Annual Assessment of Director Nominees" beginning on page 28. 
Process for Stockholder Recommendations of Director Candidates 
Stockholders may propose nominees for consideration by the Governance and Nominating Committee by submitting the names and other relevant information as required by Capital One's Bylaws, and further described in Capital One's Corporate Governance Guidelines, to the Corporate Secretary at Capital One's address set forth in the Notice. Capital One's Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Corporate Secretary to deliver a copy of the submitted information to the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee will consider potential nominees proposed by stockholders on the same basis as it considers other potential nominees. 
In addition, an eligible stockholder or group of stockholders may use Capital One's "proxy access" bylaws to include stockholder-nominated director candidates in the Company's proxy materials for annual meetings of stockholders. Our Bylaws permit up to 20 stockholders owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding

Director Independence 
Except for our CEO, who is the Company's founder, the Board has affirmatively determined that the other members of our Board are independent under Capital One's Director Independence Standards, which have been adopted by the Board as part of Capital One's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board has concluded this based on a thorough assessment of whether each of its non-management members is "independent" under these standards. These standards reflect the director independence requirements set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and other applicable legal and regulatory rules, and also describe certain categorical relationships that the Board has determined to be immaterial for purposes of determining director independence. The categorical relationships the Board has deemed immaterial for purposes of determining director independence are: (i) relationships between Capital One and an entity where the director serves solely as a non-management director; (ii) transactions between Capital One and a director or a director's immediate family (or their primary business affiliations) that fall below the numerical thresholds in the NYSE listing standards (or do not otherwise preclude independence under those standards), and that are ordinary course, on arm's-length market terms, and, in the case of extensions of credit, followed usual underwriting procedures, contain no other unfavorable features and are in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory rules; and (iii) discretionary contributions to not-for-profit organizations, foundations, or universities in which a director serves as an executive officer that in any of the last three fiscal years do not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of the organization's consolidated gross revenues. 
The Board has determined that each of the director nominees (excluding our CEO) is independent under these standards. The Board has also determined that Mr. Hay and Mr. Jenkins are independent under these standards. In making these determinations, the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board reviewed certain information obtained from non-management directors' responses to a questionnaire asking about their relationships with Capital One, and those of their immediate family members and primary business or charitable affiliations and other potential conflicts of interest, as well as certain information obtained through internal diligence conducted on Capital One's businesses related to transactions, relationships or arrangements between Capital One and a non-management director or their immediate family members, primary business or charitable affiliations. Following this review, the Board determined that the relationships or transactions complied with the Corporate Governance Guidelines and the related NYSE standards.

  Board Leadership Structure 
[END TABLE]
Our Board has carefully considered the critical issue of Board leadership in the context of Capital One's specific circumstances, culture, strategic objectives and challenges. The diverse backgrounds and experiences of our directors provide the Board with broad perspectives from which to determine the leadership structure best suited for Capital One and the long-term interests of Capital One's stockholders and other stakeholders. 
We believe that our existing Board leadership structure, with Mr. Fairbank acting as CEO and Chairman of the Board, provides the most effective governance framework and allows our Company to benefit from Mr. Fairbank's talent, knowledge, and leadership as the founder of Capital One and allows him to use the in-depth focus and perspective gained in running the Company to effectively and efficiently lead our Board. Capital One appropriately maintains strong independent and effective oversight of our business and affairs through our empowered Lead Independent Director; all-independent Board committees with independent chairs that oversee the Company's operations, risks, performance and business strategy; experienced and committed directors; and frequent executive sessions without management (including Mr. Fairbank) in attendance.     
Lead Independent Director 
Our Board believes that an active, empowered Lead Independent Director is key to providing strong, independent leadership for the Board. The Lead Independent Director position, elected annually by the disinterested independent directors upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, is a critical aspect of our corporate governance framework.

For an incumbent Lead Independent Director, the independent directors also consider the results of the candidate's annual Lead Independent Director assessment, as described in "Annual Assessment of the Lead Independent Director" below.

Annual Assessment of the Lead Independent Director 
To support the independent directors in electing a Lead Independent Director, the Governance and Nominating Committee oversees an annual process to evaluate the effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director. Each year the Governance and Nominating Committee designates one independent director as the facilitator, who solicits input and feedback from all directors on the performance and effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director. The facilitator shares the results with the Governance and Nominating Committee and, as appropriate, the Board, without the Lead Independent Director present. The independent directors consider the results of this assessment in the annual election of the Lead Independent Director. 
Our Lead Independent Director is currently Ms. Hackett. As Lead Independent Director, Ms. Hackett has a strong record of active engagement both inside and outside the board room, including regular meetings with federal regulators and company executives in one-on-one and group settings. Ms. Hackett is also an active member of Tapestry Networks' Lead Director Network, a select group of lead independent directors from America's most successful companies who share a commitment to improving corporate performance and earning stockholder trust through more effective board leadership. Leveraging her significant experience serving in leadership capacities in a variety of environments, Ms. Hackett has fostered a culture of collaboration, diligence, trust and mutual respect that allows the Board to work effectively to provide oversight of and effective challenge to management. Based on her performance, the independent directors unanimously supported Ms. Hackett's re-election as Lead Independent Director for a one-year term beginning May 2018.

Director Onboarding and Education 
The Company, in consultation with the Governance and Nominating Committee, has established a director onboarding and continuing education program to support our directors in fulfilling their responsibilities as members of the Board and to assist them in keeping current on industry, corporate, and other developments relevant to their work as directors. First, all new directors participate in the Company's director onboarding program to familiarize them with the Company's values, strategic plans, accounting policies, financial reporting, risk management, code of ethics, key regulatory issues, competition, and industry dynamics. During this program, over a period of 18 months, new directors meet with members of senior management from all of the business and staff areas, as well as Board Committee Chairs, the Lead Independent Director, and individual directors, to review and discuss information about the Company, the business, the boardroom, and individual director roles and responsibilities. Our continuing education program then helps keep directors current on industry, corporate and other developments relevant to their work as directors by providing: (i) semi-annual updates on director education programs offered by applicable regulators, professional organizations, and academic institutions; (ii) internal director education programs; (iii) various board-related publications to Board members; and (iv) access to peer-to-peer networks. Our directors are also encouraged to pursue other educational opportunities, at the Company's expense, that may enable them to better perform their duties. 
Executive Sessions 
Executive sessions of independent directors of the Board are led by the Lead Independent Director and are an important governance practice because they enable the Board to discuss matters, such as strategy, CEO and senior management performance and compensation, succession planning and board effectiveness without

 management present. Our independent directors meet in executive session without management at least once annually and, in 2018, the independent directors met four times in executive session. During these executive sessions, the independent directors have complete access to such members of the Company's senior executive management as they may request, including but not limited to the CEO, CFO, Corporate Secretary, General Counsel, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Audit Officer, Chief Credit Review Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. The Lead Independent Director and/or any director may request additional executive sessions of independent directors. 
Directors Are Actively Engaged Outside of Board Meetings 
Engagement outside of Board meetings provides our directors with additional insight into our business and our industry. It also provides our Board with valuable perspective on the performance of our Company, Board, CEO and other members of senior management. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our committee chairs and Lead Independent Director meet and speak regularly with each other and with both the CEO and  members of our management team, as well as with our federal regulators, usually independently of the CEO.

Annual Board and Committee Evaluations 
In order to monitor and improve their effectiveness, and to solicit and act upon feedback received, the Board and its committees hold a formal self-evaluation process. The Board believes that in addition to serving as a tool to evaluate and improve performance, evaluations can serve several other purposes, including the promotion of good governance, integrity of financial reporting, reduction of risk, strengthening of the board-management partnership, and helping set and oversee board expectations of management. In assessing their performance, the Board and its committees take a multi-year perspective to identify and evaluate trends and assure themselves that areas identified for improvement are appropriately and timely addressed. 
To ensure the process stays fresh and continues to generate rich insights, the Board follows a cyclical, programmatic approach when conducting Board and committee evaluations. This approach includes regular, holistic reviews of the evaluation framework, methodology and form. While the Board and each of its committees conducts a formal evaluation annually, the Board considers its performance and that of its committees continuously throughout the year and shares feedback with management.

Annual Assessment of Director Nominees 
Each year the Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee conducts an individual director assessment process. This process includes candid, one-on-one discussions between the Governance and Nominating Committee's Chair and each Board member regarding the individual performance and effectiveness of the directors nominated by the Board for re-election by Capital One's stockholders. Directors may also provide feedback on any other individual director's performance at any time, regardless of whether it is part of the formal assessment process. The Lead Independent Director is also assessed annually through a process facilitated by another independent member of the Board. See "Annual Assessment of the Lead Independent Director" beginning on page 25 for a description of that process. 
Annual Performance Assessment of the CEO 
Under the direction of our Lead Independent Director, the independent directors of the Board annually assess the performance of Mr. Fairbank as Capital One's CEO. The Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for developing and overseeing the process, facilitated by the Lead Independent Director and involving all independent directors, for conducting the CEO's annual performance evaluation. This process includes an in-depth discussion of performance by the independent directors in executive session during which directors consider a variety of factors to evaluate Mr. Fairbank's performance and feedback raised through Board discussion and self-assessment materials provided by Mr. Fairbank to the Board regarding his and the Company's performance and achievements for various subjective and objective metrics. For additional information, see "Chief Executive Officer Compensation" beginning on page 56. 
The annual CEO performance assessment is completed as part of the end-of-year compensation process. The Compensation Committee manages end-of-year compensation decisions within the context of such assessment, and the Lead Independent Director and Chair of the Compensation Committee jointly share the input and feedback of the CEO performance assessment with Mr. Fairbank in a closed session.

The Board's Role in Corporate Oversight 
Our Board is accountable for oversight of Capital One's business affairs and operations. In carrying out this responsibility, among other things, the Board oversees management's development and implementation of the Company's (i) corporate strategy; (ii) financial performance and associated risks; (iii) the enterprise-wide risk management framework, including cyber risk; and (iv) succession planning for the Company's CEO and other key executives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Boards Role in Overseeing Corporate  Strategy. The Board, in fulfilling its responsibility to manage risk and maximize long-term stockholder value, is accountable for reviewing and overseeing the creation and implementation of Capital  Ones corporate strategy. The Board expects management, with input from the Board, to develop, communicate, and implement a strategy that allows Capital One to: (i) invest in long-term capabilities and opportunities; (ii) secure  competitive, endgame positions in our key businesses; (iii) attract and retain customers; (iv) grow resiliently; (v) promote ethical behavior and compliance with applicable laws and regulations; (vi) withstand economic stress and  market volatility; and (vii) conform to the Boards established risk tolerance. These strategies should deliver long-term benefits and returns to our stakeholders, including our stockholders, regulators, customers, associates, and  communities in which we operate.  
[END TABLE]
The development of Capital One's strategy is an ongoing, iterative process that includes engagement from and between the CEO, Division Presidents, the CFO, the General Counsel, the Corporate Secretary, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Audit Officer, and the Board. Each year, the full Board participates in an annual Board Strategy Meeting that provides an opportunity for the Board to engage with the CEO and key senior leaders in assessing the competitive environment and Capital One's enterprise and divisional strategies, and to provide effective challenge, feedback, and input on the company's long-term strategy and investments. In addition, the Board approves the long-term strategic plan. As the year progresses, the Board remains engaged in overseeing the implementation and monitoring of Capital One's strategy through updates by the CEO on enterprise corporate strategy and by Division Presidents on business line strategies and results. These updates typically include business line performance and outlook, external and competitive trends, key investment opportunities, and risk evaluation and mitigation strategies. This approach allows the Board to engage in informed discussions with management regarding financial performance and trajectory, capital allocation, strategy implementation, and risk-mitigation plans, where appropriate. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Boards Role in Overseeing Financial Performance and Associated  Risks. The Board oversees the Companys financial performance by reviewing with management, on a regular basis, the Companys quarterly and annual financial statements. The Audit Committee  oversees the integrity of the Companys financial statements by, among other things, obtaining independent assurance as to the completeness and accuracy of its financial statements from an independent registered public accounting firm, whose  qualifications, independence and performance it reviews on an annual basis. The Audit Committee also oversees the integrity of the Companys internal controls over financial reporting by, among other things, reviewing periodic assessments of  the adequacy and effectiveness of the Companys financial controls performed by both the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and internal audit function. In addition, the Board, either directly or through the Risk  Committee, plays an integral role in the oversight of capital planning and adequacy, funding and liquidity risk management, market risk management, investment portfolio management, and other asset liability management matters.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Boards Role in Risk Oversight. The Board believes that effective  risk management and control processes are critical to Capital Ones safety and soundness, our ability to predict and manage the challenges that Capital One and the financial services industry face and, ultimately, Capital Ones long-term  corporate success.  
[END TABLE]
The enterprise-wide risk management framework defines the Board's appetite for risk taking and enables senior management to understand, manage and report on risk. The risk management framework is implemented enterprise-wide and includes eight risk categories: compliance, credit, legal, liquidity, market, operational, reputational and strategic. Management has developed risk appetite statements with accompanying metrics which are meaningful to the organization and reflect the aggregate level and types

 of risk Capital One is willing to accept in order to achieve its business objectives, clarifying both risks the Company is actively taking and risks that are purposely avoided. 
The Risk Committee is responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management for the Company, and is responsible for reviewing and recommending to the Board for approval certain risk tolerances taking into account the Company's structure, risk profile, complexity, activities, size, and other appropriate risk-related factors. Within management, enterprise risk management is generally the responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer, who has accountability for proposing risk tolerance and reporting levels related to all eight risk categories. The Chief Risk Officer is also responsible for ensuring that the Company has an overall enterprise risk framework and that it routinely assesses and reports on enterprise level risks. The Chief Risk Officer reports both to the CEO and to the Risk Committee. The Audit Committee also plays an important risk oversight function, and oversees elements of compliance and legal risk. Each committee of the Board oversees reputational risk matters within the scope of their respective responsibilities. Finally, the Board as a whole oversees the entire enterprise risk framework for the Company, including the oversight of strategic risk. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Boards Role in Overseeing Cyber Risk. As a financial services  company entrusted with the safeguarding of sensitive information, our Board believes that a strong enterprise cyber program is vital to effective cyber risk management. Accordingly, our Board is actively engaged in the oversight of the  Companys cyber risk profile, enterprise cyber program and key enterprise cyber initiatives. The Risk Committee receives regular updates from management on its cyber event preparedness efforts. The Risk Committee receives regular quarterly  reports from the Chief Information Security Officer on the Companys cyber risk profile and enterprise cyber program and meets with the Chief Information Security Officer at least twice annually. The Risk Committee also meets periodically with  third-party experts, as appropriate, to evaluate the Companys enterprise cyber program. The Risk Committee annually reviews and recommends the Companys information security policy and information security program to the Board for  approval. The Risk Committee is also responsible for overseeing cyber, information security, and technology risk, as well as managements actions to identify, assess, mitigate, and remediate material issues. At least annually, the Board reviews  and discusses the Companys technology strategy with the Chief Information Officer and approves the Companys technology strategic plan. Additionally, the Risk Committee receives and reviews reports from the Chief Information Officer and  the Chief Information Security Officer regarding significant cyber incidents impacting the Company, including managements assessment of the root cause and relevant learnings from the incident.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Boards Role in Succession Planning. Under the Corporate Governance  Guidelines, the Board is responsible for maintaining a succession plan for the CEO. The Board has in place an effective planning process to select successors to the CEO and annually reviews the CEO succession plan. Our Board believes that the  directors and the CEO should work together on succession planning and that the entire Board should be involved. Each year, as part of its succession planning process, our CEO provides the Board with recommendations on, and evaluations of, potential  CEO successors. The Board reviews the senior executive teams experience, skills, competencies and potential to assess which executives possess or can develop the attributes that the Board believes are necessary to lead and achieve the  Companys goals. Among other steps taken to promote this process throughout the year, the two levels of executives below the CEO, which include the CEOs direct reports, often attend Board meetings and present to the Board, providing the  Board with numerous opportunities to interact with our senior management and assess their leadership capabilities.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board also has established steps to address emergency CEO succession planning for an unplanned CEO succession event. Our emergency CEO succession planning is intended to enable our Company to respond to an unexpected CEO transition by continuing our Company's safe and sound operation and minimizing potential disruption or loss of continuity to our Company's operations and strategy. There is also available, on a continuing basis as a result of the process described above, the CEO's recommendation on a successor should the CEO become unexpectedly unable to serve. The Board also reviews annually the CEO's emergency successor recommendations.

Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices 
The Compensation Committee oversees all of our compensation policies and practices, including our incentive compensation policies and practices, with a view towards ensuring that such policies and practices encourage balanced risk-taking, are compatible with effective controls and risk management, and align with our business strategy. Annually, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Incentive Compensation Governance Policy which applies to all Company associates and governs incentive compensation decisions. The Incentive Compensation Governance Policy provides the framework for oversight of the design of incentive compensation programs. In setting executive compensation, the Compensation Committee assesses each of the named executive officers against one or more performance objectives specifically designed to evaluate the degree to which the named executive officers balanced risks inherent in their specific roles. The Compensation Committee also implements additional risk-balancing features for certain equity awards, as described in more detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 48. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company's named executive officer and other senior executive compensation programs as well as any other material incentive compensation programs. During these reviews, the Compensation Committee discusses the Company's most significant risks, including the Company's status with respect to managing those risks and the relationship of those risks to compensation programs. The review includes discussion and analysis of risk-balancing features embedded in these incentive compensation programs and other actions taken by the Company to appropriately balance risk and achieve conformance with regulatory guidance. The Compensation Committee also discusses these programs with the Company's Chief Risk Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, as appropriate. Based on these discussions, the Compensation Committee believes these compensation programs are consistent with safety and soundness and operate in a manner that appropriately balances risk. 
The Compensation Committee's active oversight, together with the Company's interactions and discussions with its regulators, has further enhanced the Company's risk management and control processes with respect to incentive compensation at the Company and supported our continued compliance with the interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation practices. 
We value the input and insights of our stockholders and are committed to continued engagement with investors. As a result, we engage in continuous outreach to enable meaningful engagement and report feedback to our Board to help them drive results. In 2018, we engaged in direct outreach and discussions with stockholders representing approximately 65% of our outstanding shares. Key topics of focus included environmental, social and governance matters, company strategy and results, board composition, our special meeting threshold, and executive compensation performance metrics. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Continuous Outreach. Our CEO, CFO, and Investor Relations team meet frequently with  stockholders and the investment community. In addition, members of management, including our Investor Relations, Corporate Governance, and Executive Compensation teams, as well as our General Counsel, Corporate Secretary and CFO, meet with key  governance contacts at our larger stockholders throughout the year.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Meaningful Engagement. Our goal is to engage in a manner characterized by both  transparency and respect, fostering collaborative and mutually beneficial discussions.

See  Environmental, Social and Governance Practices beginning on page 41 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Introduced new metrics for our performance share program, more closely aligning pay and performance, and increased the  rigor of relative Company performance governing payouts applicable to performance share awards. See Performance Share Award beginning on page 58 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Beginning in 2019, the Compensation Committee (the Committee) and the other independent members of our Board  of Directors (the Independent Directors) increased the alignment of CEO compensation with Company performance and stockholder interests by increasing the percentage of the CEOs total target compensation tied to a year-end evaluation of CEO and Company performance from 40% to 90%. The Committee and the Independent Directors believe that this structure further aligns Mr. Fairbanks compensation with that of the  Companys peers and provides the opportunity for the Committee and the Independent Directors to assess the Company and the CEOs performance at the end of the year and incorporate feedback from stockholders received during the performance  year to ensure that the CEOs performance year compensation appropriately reflects the Companys compensation philosophy and principles. See 2019 CEO Compensation Program beginning on page 65 for more information.   
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Stockholder Engagement on our Special Meeting Threshold. In 2018, following receipt  of a stockholder proposal requesting a reduction in the ownership threshold required for stockholders to request that the Company call a special meeting, the Company proposed a management proposal seeking stockholder ratification of the existing 25%  threshold. This ratification proposal passed (receiving the support of 54% of votes cast). As part of the Companys robust, ongoing year-around investor outreach program, the Company engaged with our stockholders to obtain their views on  governance matters, including our special meeting threshold. As part of this outreach, before the ratification vote, we contacted 30 of our largest stockholders representing approximately 62% of our outstanding shares, nine of which (representing  approximately 39% of outstanding shares) agreed to meet with us. In addition, following the ratification vote, we contacted 15 of our largest stockholders representing 55% of our outstanding shares, six of which (representing approximately 22%  of outstanding shares and including some stockholders we spoke to in advance of the ratification vote) agreed to meet with us. Over the course of those 15 discussions, our stockholders provided a wide range of views on special meeting thresholds in  general. However, in our engagement with stockholders following the ratification vote, none expressed strong views that the Board should take action to reduce the existing threshold and, as a result, we are not proposing any changes  to our stockholder meeting ownership threshold for this years annual meeting.

This review takes into account, among other factors, committee needs, director experience, committee succession planning and the desire to balance membership continuity with new insights. 
The Chair of the Governance and Nominating Committee facilitates discussions with management, committee chairs, the Chairman of the Board, and individual directors, as needed and shares that feedback with the Governance and Nominating Committee. The Governance and Nominating Committee makes recommendations for committee membership and Chairs to the full Board.

 CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION          2019 PROXY STATEMENT         39   
[END TABLE]
Our Board has approved a written Related Person Transaction policy, which sets forth policies and procedures for reviewing, and approving or ratifying, transactions with directors, director nominees, executive officers, stockholders holding 5% or more of Capital One's voting securities, or any of their immediate family members or affiliated entities (collectively, "Related Persons"). The policy covers transactions, arrangements and relationships where Capital One is a participant, the aggregate amount exceeds $120,000, and a Related Person has a direct or indirect material interest ("Related Person Transactions"). Under the policy, Related Person Transactions must be approved or ratified by the Governance and Nominating Committee, and may only be ratified or approved if the committee determines the Related Person Transaction is not inconsistent with the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
In reviewing Related Person Transactions, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances, which may include: the benefits to the Company from the transaction; the nature and extent of the Related Person's interest in the transaction; the impact, if any, on a director's independence; any implications under Capital One's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (including whether the transaction would create a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof); any concerns with respect to reputational risk; the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; and the terms of the transaction as compared to the terms available to unrelated third parties or to Capital One's associates, generally. 
The Governance and Nominating Committee has pre-approved the following types of Related Person Transactions as being not inconsistent with the best interests of Capital One and its stockholders: director and executive compensation otherwise disclosed in the Company's proxy statement and/or approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board; transactions in amounts that are not material and where the relationship arises only from a Related Person's position as an employee (other than as an executive officer) or a director of, or having immaterial financial holdings in, another entity; and financial services, including loans, extensions of credit, or other financial services and products provided by Capital One to a Related Person that are in the ordinary course, non-preferential, do not involve features unfavorable to the Company, and comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations (including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and Regulation O of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Guidelines). 
From time to time in the ordinary course of its business, Capital One issues loans and provides other financial services and products to directors, executive officers and/or nominees for director, or to a director's, executive officer's or director nominee's immediate family member, including persons sharing the household of such director, executive officer or director nominee (other than a tenant or employee). Such loans and other financial services and products are made in the ordinary course of business; are on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans and financial services and products with persons not related to the Company; and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to the Company. 
Matthew W. Cooper is Capital One's General Counsel. Mr. Cooper's brother-in-law is a partner at the international law firm of McGuireWoods LLP ("McGuireWoods"). Capital One has engaged McGuireWoods from time to time in the ordinary course of business and on an arm's length basis. The relationship between Capital One and McGuireWoods began before Mr. Cooper was employed by Capital One and also pre-dates Mr. Cooper's brother-in-law's association with McGuireWoods. Mr. Cooper's brother-in-law does not work on any Capital One matters and his ownership in the firm is less than 1%. In 2018, Capital One made aggregate payments to McGuireWoods of approximately $8.5 million for legal services. This relationship was ratified by the Governance and Nominating Committee. 
Trip Hall is Capital One's Chief Risk Officer. Mr. Hall's spouse is a Senior Director in our Human Resources department and has worked for Capital One for over 17 years. Mr. Hall's spouse received compensation of approximately $265,000 in 2018, including an annual salary and incentive awards commensurate with her qualifications, responsibilities and other employees holding similar positions. This relationship was ratified by the Governance and Nominating Committee.

While our approach to corporate social responsibility continues to evolve, each year we remain focused on three core elements: our people, our community, and our environmental footprint.

Section II - Director Compensation 
The Board of Directors ("Board") approves the compensation for non-management directors based on recommendations made by the Compensation Committee ("Committee"). The Board has designed the director compensation program to achieve four primary objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Attract and retain talented directors with the skills and capabilities to perpetuate Capital Ones success   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Fairly compensate directors for the work required in a company of Capital Ones size and scope   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Recognize the individual roles and responsibilities of the directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Align directors interests with the long-term interests of Capital One stockholders  
[END TABLE]
Management directors do not receive compensation for their service on the Board. In 2018, Mr. Fairbank was Capital One's only management director. 
The Committee annually reviews the compensation program for Capital One's non-management directors. Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") provides competitive compensation data and director compensation program recommendations to the Committee for review to assist in determining its recommendation. The competitive compensation data includes information regarding the compensation (cash, equity and other benefits) of the non-management directors within Capital One's peer comparator group. The Committee considers this information and FW Cook's recommendations, and finalizes a proposed director compensation structure for review and approval by the full Board, typically in the second quarter of each year. See the discussion under "Compensation Committee Consultant" on page 36 for further information on the role and responsibilities of FW Cook and "Market Data" on page 76 for further information on the selection of the Company's peer comparator group. 
Based on their review of competitive market data and guidance from FW Cook in the second quarter of 2018, the Committee determined that the Company's director compensation program meets the objectives listed above. 
On May 2, 2018, the Board approved a compensation program for Capital One's non-management directors for the period from May 3, 2018 through Capital One's 2019 Annual Stockholder Meeting that is similar to the program for the preceding year. The compensation program consists of an annual cash retainer of $90,000 for service on the Board. In addition, directors receive annual cash retainers for committee service and for service as committee chairs and Lead Independent Director. Under the most recently approved director compensation program, the retainers, unchanged from the previous year, are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Lead Independent Director Retainer: $50,000

Under the Capital One Financial Corporation Non-Employee Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, non-management directors may voluntarily defer all or a portion of their cash compensation and receive deferred income benefits. Participants in the plan can direct their individual deferrals among seventeen investments available through the plan. Participating directors receive their deferred income benefits in cash when they cease serving as directors, upon certain other distribution events specified in the plan, or at such earlier time as authorized by the Compensation Committee. Upon a change of control, Capital One will pay to each director within 30 days of the change of control a lump sum cash payment equal to such director's account balance as of the date of the change of control. 
Capital One offers non-management directors the opportunity to direct a contribution of up to $10,000 annually from Capital One to charitable organization(s) of their choice. Nine of the ten non-management directors serving on May 3, 2018 elected to make such a charitable contribution in 2018. In addition, all directors serving on May 3, 2018 were eligible, and seven directors elected, to participate in a Capital One broad-based charitable contribution program, which is available to Capital One associates, under which Capital One made a contribution of $5,000 to a charitable organization of their choice. 
Directors also receive reimbursements for certain board-related expenses including external educational seminars and travel-related costs incurred to attend Board meetings. Such reimbursements are not included as compensation for the directors in the table above. 
Capital One requires non-management directors to retain all shares underlying RSUs granted to them by Capital One until their service with the Board ends. The Board may grant an exception for any case where this requirement would impose a financial hardship on a director. In 2018, no directors were granted an exception to this requirement for any outstanding awards of RSUs.

2018 Company Performance and Compensation Highlights 
In 2018, we continued to build an enduringly great franchise, unveiled new products and broadened our brand with marketing and advertising campaigns that drove awareness and customer growth. Our digital and technology transformation is accelerating. We delivered value to our customers and empowered them with great digital experiences.

We extended billions of dollars of credit to consumers, small business owners, and commercial clients while maintaining our focus on risk and resilience. We attracted amazing talent and our people practices continue to garner recognition. 
Each year the Committee and the Independent Directors review and evaluate the Company's qualitative and quantitative performance and make determinations regarding the compensation of our named executive officers based on Capital One's pay-for-performance philosophy. The Committee's top priority is to implement a compensation program that aligns the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. The Committee also seeks to directly link the compensation of the NEOs with the Company's performance, and the executives' contributions to that performance over appropriate time horizons, while supporting safety and soundness and appropriately balancing risk. The Committee and the Independent Directors have the flexibility to adjust compensation decisions from year to year to take into account Company and individual performance, as well as evolving market practices. 
Company Performance Highlights 
In 2018, Capital One delivered strong financial and operating results and continued to invest in growth and transformation.

The information above is presented to show how the Committee and the Independent Directors viewed compensation awarded for 2018 and is not intended as a substitute for the Summary Compensation Table, which is required by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). See "2018 Summary Compensation Table" beginning on page 81 for a description of how the information above differs from the Summary Compensation Table. 
Consideration of 2018 Say on Pay Vote 
The Committee and the Board value the input of our stockholders and strive to foster a constructive dialogue with stockholders on matters of executive compensation and corporate governance. At our 2018 Annual Stockholder Meeting, more than 85% of the votes cast were in favor of our non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation ("2018 Say on Pay Vote"). Though the Committee recognized the 2018 Say on Pay Vote reflected support for the Company's executive compensation programs, the Committee remains committed to ongoing stockholder engagement. In 2018, we continued to strengthen our outreach to stockholders to maintain strong lines of communication with our stockholders and shared stockholders' perspectives with the Committee and the Board. From this outreach, the Committee and the Board gained valuable insight into our investors' views about the Company, including our executive compensation programs. As a result of the feedback received from investors during 2018, the Committee made the following enhancements to our executive compensation programs and disclosure: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Increased Alignment of CEO Pay and Performance. Beginning in 2019, the Committee and  the Independent Directors increased the alignment of CEO compensation with Company performance and stockholder interests by increasing the percentage of the CEOs total target compensation tied to a year-end evaluation of CEO and Company  performance from 40% to 90%.

     Independent Directors believe that this structure further aligns Mr. Fairbank's compensation with that of the Company's peers and provides a greater opportunity for the Committee  and the Independent Directors to assess the Company and the CEO's performance after the completion of the performance year. In addition, this structure enhances the Committee and the Independent Directors' ability to incorporate feedback  from stockholders received during the year to ensure that the CEO's performance year compensation appropriately reflects the Company's compensation philosophy and principles and business results. See "2019 CEO Compensation  Program" beginning on page 65 for more information.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    New Performance Share Award Metrics. Beginning in 2018, the performance shares  awarded to the NEOs vest based on two metrics: Common Dividends + Growth of Tangible Book Value per Share (D+TBV) and Adjusted ROTCE, each as defined under Performance Share Award Metrics on page 59. The Committee and the  Independent Directors believe that these two performance metrics, in combination, provide a balanced and rigorous measurement of Company performance by balancing the creation of long-term stockholder value and the returns generated on  stockholders investment in the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Simplified NEO Compensation Program. In 2018, the Committee and the Independent  Directors modified the compensation program applicable to our NEOs, other than our CEO, to reduce the number of compensation vehicles, eliminating stock options and cash-settled RSUs, and more closely aligning the program vehicles and structure to  the programs used by the Companys peers. See 2018 NEO Compensation Program beginning on page 66 for more information.

The Committee continues to actively engage with our stockholders with respect to executive compensation matters and has considered stockholder feedback in approving year-end incentive awards for 2018 and structuring and approving the 2019 compensation programs for the NEOs. For additional changes made to the 2019 compensation program, see "2019 CEO Compensation Program" beginning on page 65.

All of the terms and features described above, including the performance-based vesting and clawback provisions, apply to awards granted to all executive officers and not just the NEOs. 
Compensation Program Objectives 
Capital One's executive compensation program has four primary objectives. 
Strongly link rewards with both business and individual performance while appropriately balancing risk 
Capital One emphasizes pay-for-performance at all organizational levels. Typically, as an executive's level of responsibility increases, so does the proportion of the executive's pay that is subject to performance criteria. Therefore, the named executive officers have the highest proportion of their pay directly linked to Company and individual performance, as compared to other associates. Awards made to the named executive officers in January 2019 for the 2018 performance year were based on Company and individual performance, and on demonstrating specific leadership competencies assessed through a comprehensive performance management process that included an individual assessment specifically designed to evaluate the degree to which the executive balanced risks inherent to his or her role. The Chief Risk Officer compiled these risk assessments and the Chief Human Resources Officer reviewed the assessments for the NEOs. Separately, the Chief Auditor compiled and reviewed the risk assessment for the Chief Risk Officer. The Committee considered the assessments in making its determinations regarding individual performance and compensation levels.

[END TABLE]
Reward performance over multiple time horizons 
Our compensation programs are structured to encourage our executives to deliver strong results over the short term while making decisions that create sustained value for our stockholders over the long term. For 2018, approximately 76% of the CEO's total compensation was equity-based and at-risk to the performance of the Company's stock price, and 100% of his compensation was deferred for a three-year period. In addition, approximately 55% of total compensation for NEOs other than the CEO was provided through equity-based vehicles which were at-risk to the performance of the Company's stock price and subject to vesting over multiple time horizons. The use of deferred, equity-based compensation vehicles with multi-year vesting terms advances our goal of aligning the ultimate value realized by the named executive officers with the performance of the Company's stock over time because the value of these compensation vehicles increases and decreases based on the performance of the Company's stock price in both current and future periods. 
Attract, retain and motivate top executive talent 
To attract, retain and motivate exceptional leaders, we believe that compensation opportunities at Capital One must be competitive with the marketplace for talent. The Committee and the Independent Directors strive to preserve a competitive pay mix and total target compensation values in the executive compensation program, as well as provide competitive total rewards based on our selected peer group. 
Align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders 
The Committee and the Independent Directors are committed to designing incentive compensation programs that reward individual and Company performance and that are aligned with the creation of stockholder value over the long term. Because named executive officer compensation is primarily delivered through deferred, equity-based vehicles that vest over multiple time horizons, the named executive officers have a significant stake in the success of the Company. The Committee and the Independent Directors also have the flexibility to adjust compensation decisions from year to year to take into account the Company's performance and evolving market practices. In addition, we have established specific stock ownership policies that the named executive officers must meet and stock retention provisions applicable to certain equity awards. 
Use of Discretion 
The Committee believes that exercising discretion is an important element in reaching balanced compensation decisions that are consistent with our strategy and reward both current year performance and sustained long-term value creation, and supplements other aspects of Capital One's pay-for-performance philosophy. By applying discretion, the Committee seeks to mitigate the risks associated with a rigid and strictly formulaic compensation program, which could unintentionally create incentives for our executives to focus only on certain performance metrics, encourage imprudent risk taking, and not provide the best results for stockholders. In addition, the use of discretion allows the Committee to respond to changes in economic conditions, our operating environment, and other significant factors that may affect the long-term performance of Capital One or our lines of business. The use of discretion also allows the Committee to adjust compensation based on factors that would not be appropriately reflected by a strictly formulaic approach, such as risk management, championing company values, and the discrepancies between absolute and relative performance levels or recognition of individual performance levels. There are certain performance conditions for which the Committee would not exercise discretion, for example where the minimum performance metric is not met in the award of performance shares or if the performance-based vesting requirements applicable to certain other stock-settled awards are not met.

 approval. The Committee believes that the CEO's compensation should be entirely at-risk based on his and the Company's performance. The Committee considers the Company's and the CEO's historical performance and seeks to effectively align the CEO's interests with the interests of our stockholders over time, support safety and soundness and appropriately balance risk. 
When determining the structure and total target compensation opportunity for Mr. Fairbank's 2018 compensation program, as well as the value for each component awarded, the Committee and the Independent Directors considered the Company's performance during 2017 and Mr. Fairbank's contribution to that performance. In addition, the Committee and the Independent Directors considered the Company's performance in 2017 relative to the performance of peer comparator companies in 2017, the structure and amount of compensation awarded to the chief executive officers of the peer comparator companies and the structure and amount of Mr. Fairbank's compensation awards in prior years. The Committee and the Independent Directors also considered the Company's risk profile and the time horizon over which the deferred, equity-based awards will vest, as well as the fact that the ultimate value of Mr. Fairbank's deferred, equity-based awards will depend on the Company and Mr. Fairbank's performance over time as well as the value of Capital One's common stock at the time the awards vest. 
After considering these factors, in February 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors determined that a total target compensation amount of $17.5 million was appropriate for Mr. Fairbank's 2018 compensation program and that the program would continue to consist of performance shares granted at the beginning of the performance year and designed to provide Mr. Fairbank with an incentive to focus on long-term performance; and a year-end incentive award opportunity based on the Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance during the performance year. In addition, all of the CEO's compensation is subject to a three-year deferred vesting or payout schedule. In this manner, the CEO's compensation continues to be completely at-risk and aligned with the Company's performance over multiple time horizons. 
The table below summarizes the CEO compensation program that the Committee and the Independent Directors approved for the 2018 performance year.

2018 CEO Compensation Components 
The CEO's compensation for the 2018 performance year was composed of performance shares and an opportunity for a year-end incentive award that may be delivered in the form of an equity-based award, deferred cash, or both. Mr. Fairbank does not receive a cash base salary. All of the CEO's compensation is subject to a three-year deferred vesting or payout schedule. The charts below represent (i) the components of CEO compensation as an approximate percentage of the CEO's 2018 total target compensation, and (ii) the pay mix of

 the CEO's actual compensation for the 2018 performance year, including the year-end incentive opportunity which consisted of 60% deferred cash and 40% cash-settled RSUs. 
Performance Share Award 
The Committee and the Independent Directors believe the performance shares strengthen the alignment between the compensation of our NEOs and the Company's performance by linking the ultimate payout to pre-established absolute and relative performance goals, with the value of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%. The ultimate value of the performance shares upon vesting is determined by the Company's performance through its stock price. 
In February 2018, Mr. Fairbank was granted an award of performance shares under which he may receive from 0% to 150% of a target number of 100,268 shares of the Company's common stock based on the Company's performance over the three-year period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The performance shares had a grant date fair value of $10.5 million. See page 59 for additional information regarding the 2018 performance share award to Mr. Fairbank.

Performance Share Award Metrics 
Performance Share Awards Granted in 2018 and Beyond. Each year, the Committee and the Independent Directors evaluate the structure and amount of the equity awards provided to our NEOs, including the Company performance metrics applicable to such awards. In 2018, in order to further align our NEOs interests with those of our stockholders, as well as based on market practices, peer comparator information and in response to stockholder feedback, the Committee and the Independent Directors determined that performance share awards granted to the CEO and the other NEOs beginning in 2018 will be based on the following two metrics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Common Dividends + Growth of Tangible Book Value per Share (D+TBV)    ∎  D+TBV rewards strong operational results, balanced stewardship of capital, and long-term stockholder value creation by measuring the value distributed to  stockholders (common dividends per share) and the growth of company value created for common stockholders (tangible book value per share).   ∎  D+TBV is  calculated as the three-year average of the ratios, expressed as a percentage, of (a) the Companys tangible book value per share at the end of each year within the performance period, plus total common dividends per share paid during such  year, to (b) the Companys tangible book value per share at the beginning of each corresponding year within the performance period.

 Adjusted Return on Tangible Common Equity (Adjusted ROTCE)      ∎  Adjusted ROTCE rewards balanced capital management and stewardship while capturing current and historical business performance and profitability as  compared to the size of our stockholders investment in the Company. ROTCE is broadly used in banking as a key performance indicator and component in peer executive compensation programs.   ∎  Adjusted ROTCE is calculated as the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (a) the Companys net income available to common stockholders,  excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, the impact of impairment, amortization and re-measurement of intangible assets, to (b) the Companys average tangible  common equity.

[END TABLE]
The Committee and the Independent Directors believe that these two performance metrics, in combination, provide a rigorous measurement of Company performance by balancing the creation of long-term stockholder value and the returns generated on stockholders' investment in the Company. Beginning with performance year 2018, the performance share awards represent 60% of CEO total target compensation and an anticipated range of between approximately 30% and 55% of total target compensation for the other NEOs. 
To appropriately incentivize long-term value creation in line with the Company's strategic goals, two-thirds of each performance share award will vest based on D+TBV, and one-third of each performance share award will vest based on Adjusted ROTCE. The Company's performance on each metric will be assessed over the three-year period relative to the KBW Bank Index, excluding three non-traditional banks that do not focus on lending to consumers and businesses (the "KBW Index"). The Committee believes that the KBW Index is an appropriate index against which to assess the Company's performance because it reflects institutions of a comparable size, risk profile and business mix to the Company. After the end of the three-year performance period, the Committee will certify the Company's performance and issue the corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock, if any, in accordance with the relative performance hurdles illustrated below. The metrics will be calculated as indicated above, with the Committee excluding from such calculations the initial effects of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or regulations, or other laws or provisions affecting the reported results if the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. 
Performance Share Awards Granted Prior to 2018. For performance share awards granted prior to 2018, the Company's performance will be assessed on the basis of Adjusted ROA (as defined on page 73) relative to a comparator group consisting of companies in the KBW Index. The Committee selected relative Adjusted ROA as

[END TABLE]
 the metric to underlie performance share awards granted prior to 2018 in order to achieve a balance of incentivizing and rewarding management to pursue business strategies that reward stockholders over the long term, while discouraging excessive risk-taking or balance sheet leverage in pursuit of those goals. 
Performance Share Award Formula 
For all performance share awards, the ultimate number of performance shares earned at vesting is determined by a formula based on relative performance and absolute performance (in the form of a performance share reduction) measures, with the value of the payout ranging from 0% to 150%. In addition, the value of the performance shares upon vesting is determined by the Company's stock price performance. 
Relative Performance Measure. Each year, the Committee and the Independent Directors assess the Company's performance on the basis of the performance share award metric relative to the KBW Index comparator group. In 2017, the Committee and the Independent Directors revised the performance measures applicable to performance shares granted beginning in 2017, in part in response to stockholder feedback, to require a more rigorous set of relative Company performance hurdles related to the potential payouts made in connection with the awards. Under the revised performance hurdles, the Company's positive Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, must be at least at the 25th percentile of peers for any performance shares to vest, target payout will be achieved at the 55th percentile of peers, and the maximum payout can only be achieved if the Company performs at the 80th percentile of peers. If the Company's positive Adjusted ROTCE and D+TBV or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, is under the 25th percentile, none of the shares will vest and no payout will be made with respect to the award. The graph below represents these performance hurdles. After the end of the three-year performance period, the Committee will certify the Company's performance and issue the corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock, if any, in accordance with the graph below. Payouts will range between the values shown below for performance that falls between the points labeled in the graph. 
Absolute Performance Measure - Performance Share Reduction. All performance share awards are subject to a performance share reduction. For performance shares granted beginning in 2018, the performance share reduction will be based on the Company's Adjusted ROTCE, replacing Adjusted ROA, on an absolute basis. Under the performance share reduction feature, the number of shares issued at settlement will be reduced if the Company's Adjusted ROTCE for one or more fiscal years completed during the performance period is not positive, no matter how well the Company performs compared to the peer group. In each year that the Company does not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE, the executive will forfeit 50% of that year's worth of performance shares. If the Company's Adjusted ROTCE is not positive in each of the three fiscal years in the performance

Year-End Incentive Opportunity 
A portion of Mr. Fairbank's 2018 compensation consisted of an opportunity for a year-end incentive with a target value of $7.0 million based on the Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance during 2018 and Mr. Fairbank's contributions to that performance. The Committee and the Independent Directors may determine to award 0% to 150% of the year-end incentive target value. For purposes of the year-end incentive, the Committee and the Independent Directors assess the Company's performance based on the following four categories of quantitative and qualitative performance factors: financial and operating performance, governance and risk management, strategic performance and winning with our customers and associates (the "Performance Factors"). The Committee believes that these factors appropriately reflect and balance near term performance and long-term success for the Company's customers, associates, and stockholders. 
The year-end incentive may be awarded in the form of deferred cash, an equity-based award, or both as determined by the Committee and the Independent Directors at the time the award is granted. Both the equity-based award and the deferred cash bonus have a three-year cliff vesting and are subject to clawback provisions. The performance-based vesting provisions applicable to the equity-based award and the clawback provisions applicable to both awards are described in more detail under "Additional Performance Conditions and Recovery Provisions" beginning on page 71. 
2018 CEO Year-End Incentive Determination 
In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors approved year-end incentive awards for Mr. Fairbank totaling $7.0 million for 2018 based on their assessment of the Company's and Mr. Fairbank's performance with respect to the Performance Factors. Between performance year 2016 and performance year 2018, Mr. Fairbank's year-end incentive award has ranged from $4.5 million to $7.0 million, varying based on his and the Company's performance. For performance year 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors determined to award Mr. Fairbank's year-end incentive award using two vehicles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Restricted Stock Units. An award of 34,744 RSUs, which had a total grant date value  of approximately $2.8 million, which will vest in full on February 15, 2022, settle in cash based on the Companys average stock price over the 15 trading days preceding the vesting date, and is subject to performance-based vesting  provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Deferred Cash Bonus. A $4.2 million deferred cash bonus which is mandatorily  deferred for three years into the Companys Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan and will pay out in the first calendar quarter of 2022.

[END TABLE]
Including the year-end incentive opportunity, Mr. Fairbank's total compensation for the 2018 performance year consisted of 76% equity-based awards and 24% deferred cash. 
In determining the 2018 year-end incentive awards, the Committee and the Independent Directors rewarded Mr. Fairbank's stewardship in delivering resilient growth, strong financial performance across all major lines of business and driving strategies that advanced the Company's achievement of its long-term goals while accelerating the Company's ability to deliver strong, sustainable financial performance and enduring value to stockholders over the long term. In 2018, Capital One achieved record net income and industry-leading purchase volume growth in our Credit Card business, strong deposit growth and ending loans in our Consumer Bank business, and strong credit performance in our Commercial banking business. In addition, under Mr. Fairbank's visionary leadership, the Company continued to make transformational investments in talent, capabilities, and technology to create value today and over the long term. We continued to strengthen our risk and control environment, build risk identification and management capabilities, particularly in the areas of cybersecurity, credit monitoring, and capital planning, and are committed to effective, proactive, and sustainable operation of these capabilities. 
In an environment where the valuations and returns for consumer lending-focused companies have underperformed traditional banks, management has continued its investments in growth and transformation while also focusing on strong credit risk management and long-term resilience. Although these investments and choices may dampen near-term returns, the Committee and the Independent Directors believe that management continues to appropriately balance the inherent trade-offs between financial resilience, investing for the future, and delivering attractive returns over the short, medium, and long term. The Committee and Independent Directors recognize that the Company's one-, three-, and five-year TSR for 2018 lags the peer comparator group, but believe the Company's strategic investments will result in strong stockholder returns over time through continued growth, improved efficiency, strong profitability, and significant capital distribution. 
In January 2019, the Committee assessed the Company's quantitative and qualitative performance. In particular, the Committee considered:

The Committee believes that the actions taken by Mr. Fairbank and the other named executive officers throughout the year drove the Company's 2018 results and have advanced the Company toward creating enduring value, sustainable financial performance and the achievement of the Company's strategic goals over the long term. 
CEO Compensation by Performance Year 
Below is a table showing Mr. Fairbank's compensation awards as they are attributable to the performance years indicated. For the years shown in the table, Mr. Fairbank's total target compensation was $17.5 million. Mr. Fairbank's total compensation for performance year 2018 was $17.5 million. See "Year-End Incentive Opportunity" beginning on page 61 for additional information regarding the year-end incentive granted to Mr. Fairbank for performance year 2018.

[END TABLE]
The table above is presented to show how the Committee views Mr. Fairbank's compensation and to which year the compensation awards relate. This table differs substantially from the Summary Compensation Table beginning on page 81 and is therefore not a substitute for the information required in that table. There are two principal differences between the Summary Compensation Table and the table above: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The table above reports equity-based awards as compensation for the performance year for which they were awarded, even  if the award was granted in one year based on performance for the prior year. As a result, the cash-settled RSU award granted to Mr. Fairbank in January 2019 for the 2018 performance year, for example, is shown in the table above as 2018  compensation. The Summary Compensation Table reports equity-based awards in the year in which they were granted.

Additional Pay Elements 
As part of the CEO compensation program, the Committee and the Independent Directors also approved certain other programs intended to support Mr. Fairbank's productivity, well-being and security. These programs provide some level of personal benefit and are not generally available to all associates. For 2018, these programs included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Executive term life insurance with a benefit level of $5 million  
[END TABLE]

  ∎    The ability to participate in a comprehensive voluntary annual health screening

  ∎    Personal security detail that also provides transportation service for Mr. Fairbank

  ∎    The monitoring and maintenance of an electronic home security system

The Committee has determined that the nature and value of these programs are comparable to those offered to similarly situated executives at our peers. Additional details on these programs can be found in the "Named Executive Officer Compensation" section beginning on page 81. 
2019 CEO Compensation Program 
Each year, the Committee and the Independent Directors review the CEO compensation program in light of Company performance data, peer comparator group performance data, historical pay information, data on specific market practices and trends, stockholder feedback, and other relevant points of information. The Committee and the Independent Directors continue to believe that the CEO compensation program aligns Mr. Fairbank's compensation with the Company's performance over the appropriate time horizons and supports the Company's executive compensation goals and principles. In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors reviewed the compensation structure utilized in 2018 for Mr. Fairbank and determined that, for 2019, the CEO compensation program would continue to consist of an equity or equity-based award granted at the beginning of the year plus an opportunity for a year-end incentive award based on CEO and Company performance for 2019. In this manner, the CEO's compensation will continue to be completely at-risk based on the Company's and Mr. Fairbank's performance, and all CEO compensation continues to be subject to a three-year deferred vesting or payout. The Committee and the Independent Directors also determined that for Mr. Fairbank's 2019 compensation program, a total target compensation amount of $17.5 million, the same total target compensation for 2018, was appropriate. 
In connection with the review of the CEO compensation program and in response to feedback received from stockholders, the Committee and the Independent Directors modified the structure of the CEO compensation program to increase the percentage of the CEO's total target compensation granted following the completion of the performance year from 40% to 90%. Beginning with the 2019 performance year, the CEO's total target compensation will consist of two components: (i) 10% in the form of RSUs granted at the beginning of the

[END TABLE]
 performance year; and (ii) 90% in the form of an opportunity for a year-end incentive award, consisting primarily of performance shares, to be granted in early 2020 and based on the Company's performance in 2019. 
The Committee and the Independent Directors believe that this structure increases the alignment of CEO compensation with Company performance and stockholder interests by directly linking a greater portion of the CEO's compensation to the Company's performance. In addition, the revised structure provides a greater opportunity for the Committee and the Independent Directors to assess the Company and the CEO's performance after the completion of the performance year and incorporate feedback from stockholders received during the year to ensure that the CEO's performance year compensation appropriately reflects the Company's compensation philosophy and principles. 
2019 CEO Compensation Decisions 
Based on the revised CEO compensation program, in January 2019 the Committee and the Independent Directors granted to Mr. Fairbank 21,715 RSUs, which had a total grant date value of approximately $1.75 million which will vest in full on February 15, 2022, settle in cash based on the Company's average stock price over the 15 trading days preceding the vesting date, and is subject to performance-based vesting provisions. Mr. Fairbank does not receive a cash base salary. 
The Committee also determined that Mr. Fairbank will have an opportunity to receive an incentive award in early 2020. Any such award (i) will consist primarily of a performance share award under which he may receive from 0% to 150% of a target number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the Company's performance over the three year period from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2022; and (ii) may also consist of deferred cash, an equity-based award, or both. The Committee and the Independent Directors believe that a year-end incentive consisting primarily of performance shares, which provide for vesting and ultimate payout of the award based on pre-established absolute and relative Company performance goals over a three year period, provide a direct link between the Company's performance and the compensation received by Mr. Fairbank for the three year period. Any deferred cash or equity-based award will pay out or vest after a three-year deferral period. The Committee and the Independent Directors will have absolute discretion to determine whether to make the year-end incentive award, the form of the award and the value of the award relative to the target amount of $15.75 million. The Committee and the Independent Directors will base these determinations on the Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance in 2019 relative to the same factors described earlier under "Year-End Incentive Opportunity" related to financial and operating performance, governance and risk management, strategic performance and winning with our customers and associates and Mr. Fairbank's contribution to that performance. The Company expects that any such award will be subject to performance share reduction, performance-based vesting and clawback provisions similar to the provisions applicable to the performance shares and year-end incentive opportunity awards granted to the CEO for the 2018 performance year. 
In this section, "NEO Compensation," the term "NEO" refers to the named executive officers other than the CEO. The table below summarizes the NEO compensation program that the Committee and the Independent Directors approved for the 2018 performance year. 
2018 NEO Compensation Program 
The Committee annually reviews and approves the form, timing, and amount of compensation for all of our executive officers, including those who are ultimately reported as NEOs, and makes recommendations to the Independent Directors for final approval. The Committee takes into account each NEO's historical performance, individual roles and responsibilities, and contributions expected from each NEO in the future as well as the recommendations of the CEO, including his assessment of each NEO's performance. In February 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors approved the 2018 compensation program, which is designed to be consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy. 
Based on market practices and trends, a review of peer comparator information, and in response to stockholder feedback, the Committee determined to refine the NEO compensation program in 2018 to eliminate three of the

[END TABLE]
 six compensation elements previously used by the Company to compensate NEOs: stock options, cash-settled RSU awards, and cash-settled RSU salary. This change simplified the NEO compensation program, increased the proportion of NEO total target compensation that is performance-based from 65% to 80% and more greatly aligned the program elements and structure with the programs used by the Company's peers. Beginning with the 2018 performance year, NEO total target compensation is composed of 20% base salary, 25% cash incentive opportunity, and 55% long-term incentive opportunity, which will consist of performance shares and stock-settled RSUs as determined by the Committee. The Committee believes that this pay mix balances stockholder interests while effectively rewarding and motivating key talent. 
For the 2018 performance year, the NEOs received a mix of approximately 45% cash and 55% equity-based compensation as follows: cash salary, determined at the beginning of the performance year; and a cash incentive and long-term incentive awards, determined following the end of the performance year based on the Committee's evaluation of Company and individual performance during the past year. The long-term incentive awards granted for the 2018 performance year consisted of performance shares (approximately 30% of total target compensation) and stock-settled RSUs (generally 25% of total target compensation). All of the equity awards vest over a three-year period. The terms of the performance share awards are substantially similar to the terms of the performance share awards granted to our CEO in 2018, as described earlier under "Performance Share Award Metrics" beginning on page 59.

2018 NEO Compensation Components 
The total target compensation of the NEOs for the 2018 performance year was composed of base salary awarded at the beginning of the performance year and a year-end incentive opportunity that, if granted, may consist of equity awards in the form of performance shares and/or RSUs, and a cash incentive. The chart below shows the 2018 components of NEO compensation as an approximate percentage of NEO total target compensation: 
Base Salaries 
For the 2018 performance year, the Committee decreased the percentage of total target compensation paid to the NEOs in the form of a base salary from 35% to 20% and chose to defer a larger portion of each NEO's compensation until the end of the year. In February 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors approved 2018 cash base salaries for the NEOs, ranging from $1 million to $1.1 million. Individual details for each NEO are provided in the table below showing compensation by performance year. 
Year-End Incentive Awards 
A portion of the NEO's 2018 compensation consisted of an opportunity for a year-end incentive award based on Company and individual performance in 2018. This award, if granted, may consist of long-term incentive awards in the form of performance shares and/or RSUs, and a cash incentive award. In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors determined to award each NEO performance shares, a cash incentive award and RSUs as recognition of Company and individual performance in 2018. 
Cash Incentive Awards 
The cash incentive awards provided to the NEOs are based on the Committee's evaluation of the Company's performance during 2018. In February 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors established a target value for the cash incentive for each NEO consisting of approximately 25% of the NEO's total target

[END TABLE]
 compensation. The Committee and the Independent Directors may determine to award 0% to 150% of the cash incentive target value based on Company performance. For purposes of the cash incentive awards, the Committee and the Independent Directors assess the Company's performance based on the following four categories of quantitative and qualitative performance factors: financial and operating performance, governance and risk management, strategic performance and winning with our customers and associates (the "Performance Factors"). The Committee believes that these factors appropriately reflect and balance near term performance and long-term success for the Company's customers, associates, and stockholders. See "2018 CEO Compensation Program" beginning on page 56 for details regarding the Performance Factors. 
In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors approved cash incentive awards for the NEOs ranging from $1.5 million to $1.6 million, representing a payout at 120% of the target award values established by the Committee in February 2018 based on actual Company performance in 2018. Individual details for each NEO are provided in the table below showing compensation by performance year. The assessment of Company performance for the NEOs is consistent with the assessment performed in connection with the CEO year-end incentive award. The Committee and the Independent Directors determined that these awards were appropriate in light of the Company's performance as described under "Year-End Incentive Opportunity" beginning on page 61 in connection with the determinations by the Committee and the Independent Directors relating to the CEO's year-end incentive awards. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Long-Term incentive awards are equity awards designed to emphasize elements that are of particular importance to Capital One given the Company's unique goals and continually evolving business strategies and objectives. In determining the actual amounts to be awarded to each NEO, the Committee considered each NEO's contribution to the Company's performance for 2018, as well as the individual performance of each NEO. The Committee also received input from the CEO on his assessment of each NEO's individual performance and his recommendations for compensation of the NEOs. The CEO also assessed the degree to which the NEO balanced risks inherent in the NEO's role. These assessments included the use of both quantitative and qualitative risk measures and were compiled by the Chief Risk Officer and reviewed by the Chief Human Resources Officer, and separately the Chief Audit Officer compiled and reviewed the assessment for the Chief Risk Officer, before such assessments were presented to the Committee and the Independent Directors for their consideration. 
In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors granted long-term incentive awards, consisting of stock-settled RSUs and performance share awards, to the NEOs as recognition for individual NEO performance in 2018 and to drive further long-term performance. At Capital One, long-term incentive awards are linked to performance in two ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The size of the award is based on each NEOs individual performance assessment for the year just completed   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The ultimate value of the award is dependent on Capital Ones performance over time  
[END TABLE]
The terms of the performance share awards are substantially similar to the terms of the performance share awards granted to our CEO in 2018, as described earlier under "Performance Share Award Metrics" beginning on page 59. The NEO stock-settled RSUs vest ratably in one-third increments starting on the first anniversary of the grant date and are subject to performance-based vesting and clawback provisions as discussed below under "Additional Performance Conditions and Recovery Provisions" beginning on page 71. 
2018 NEO Year-End Incentive Compensation Decisions 
Mr. Blackley, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, was awarded a cash incentive of $1,500,000, 15,511 stock-settled RSUs, and a target amount of 18,613 performance shares with a total grant date fair value for both awards of $2,750,053. The Committee and the Independent Directors determined to grant these awards based upon Mr. Blackley's strategic leadership of the Company's finance organization, his efforts to leverage technology to drive significant improvements in the Company's financial reporting, and his management of disclosure and

 related controls. The Committee and the Independent Directors also considered Mr. Blackley's collaborative partnership, deep financial acumen and market orientation, and his focus on driving the Company's financial discipline by balancing financial performance and strategic investment decisions. 
Mr. LaPrade, the Company's Chief Enterprise Services Officer and Chief of Staff to the CEO, was awarded a cash incentive of $1,564,800, 16,165 stock-settled RSUs, and a target amount of 19,398 performance shares with a total grant date fair value for both awards of $2,866,022. The Committee and the Independent Directors determined to grant these awards based upon Mr. LaPrade's pivotal role in driving the modernization of the Company's infrastructure and capabilities to grow the Company's brand and elevate customer experience. In addition, the Committee and the Independent Directors also considered Mr. LaPrade's inspirational leadership, excellence in managing risk and strategic problem solving, and his focus on recruiting and retaining strong talent. 
Mr. Finneran, the Company's General Counsel through January 31, 2018 and Chief Risk Officer from February 1, 2018 to August 1, 2018 when he was appointed as Senior Advisor to the CEO and Corporate Secretary, was awarded a cash incentive of $1,623,600, 16,780 stock-settled RSUs, and a target amount of 20,136 performance shares with a total grant date fair value for both of $2,975,060. The Committee and the Independent Directors determined to grant these awards based upon Mr. Finneran's seamless and successful assumption of the Chief Risk Officer role during 2018 and his valuable guidance and oversight on legal, risk, and strategic governance matters. In addition, the Committee and the Independent Directors also considered Mr. Finneran's thought leadership in driving improvements in risk management, as well as his sound judgment and integrative advice. 
Mr. Yajnik, the Company's President, Financial Services, was awarded a cash incentive of $1,537,200, 17,465 stock-settled RSUs, and a target amount of 20,958 performance shares with a total grant date fair value for both awards of $3,096,509. The Committee and the Independent Directors determined to grant these awards based upon the strong performance of the Auto business in 2018, including disciplined lending and profitability, as well as Mr. Yajnik's execution of the long-term strategy for financial services. The Committee and the Independent Directors also considered Mr. Yajnik's motivational leadership and continued focus on driving technological innovation and transformational change in financial services to enhance the customer and partner experience.

 page 81 required to be included in this proxy statement and is therefore not a substitute for the information required in that table. There are two principal differences between the Summary Compensation Table and the above table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The table above reports equity-based awards as compensation for the performance year for which they were awarded, even  if the award was granted in one year based on performance for the prior year. As a result, the stock-settled RSUs and performance share awards granted in January 2019 for the 2018 performance year, for example, are shown in the above table as 2018  compensation. The Summary Compensation Table reports equity-based awards in the year in which they were granted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Summary Compensation Table reports the change in pension value and  non-qualified deferred compensation earnings and all other compensation. These amounts generally are not a result of current year compensation determinations and are not shown above.  
[END TABLE]
Additional Pay Elements 
The Committee provides certain other programs intended to support the NEOs' productivity, well-being and security. These programs provide some level of personal benefit and are not generally available to all associates. For 2018, these programs included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Executive term life insurance with a benefit level of $5 million  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The ability to participate in a comprehensive voluntary annual health screening  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    An automobile lease or the use of transportation services  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The monitoring and maintenance of an electronic home security system  
[END TABLE]
The Committee has determined that the nature and value of these programs are comparable to those offered to similarly situated executives at our peers. Additional details on these programs can be found in the "Named Executive Officer Compensation" section beginning on page 81. 
2019 NEO Compensation Program 
Each year, the Committee reviews the NEO compensation program in light of Company performance data, peer comparator group performance data, historical pay information, data on specific market practices and trends, stockholder feedback, and other relevant points of information. The program consists of multiple compensation vehicles that directly link the NEOs' compensation with the Company's performance over multiple time horizons, align the NEOs' interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders, support safety and soundness and encourage appropriate risk-taking. In January 2019, the Committee and the Independent Directors approved the 2019 compensation program for our NEOs which is substantially similar to the 2018 program.

Performance-Based Vesting Provisions 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance             Based Vesting               Provisions         We include performance-based vesting  provisions as part of each stock option, if any, and stock-settled RSU award to named executive officers and each cash-settled RSU award to the CEO. These provisions will reduce the total value delivered to the executive at vesting if the Company  does not meet certain performance thresholds during the three-year vesting period. The total value can be reduced to zero if the performance threshold is not met in any of the three years in the performance period.

These provisions will reduce the total value delivered to the executive at vesting if the Company  does not meet certain performance thresholds during the three-year vesting period. The total value can be reduced to zero if the performance threshold is not met in any of the three years in the performance period.

These provisions will reduce the total value delivered to the executive at vesting if the Company  does not meet certain performance thresholds during the three-year vesting period. The total value can be reduced to zero if the performance threshold is not met in any of the three years in the performance period.      
[END TABLE]
The ultimate value that our named executive officers receive from equity-based incentive awards is tied to our stock price performance over the vesting period. In addition, the Committee nevertheless determined that these awards should be subject to additional performance conditions so that the value received by the executives is also conditioned upon the Company continuing to meet certain operating performance thresholds for each and every fiscal year ending in the three-year vesting period. Any forfeitures will be cumulative over the three-year vesting period. In this manner, regardless of our executives' past performance and of our stock price performance, the awards subject to performance-based vesting remain at risk of complete forfeiture over the three-year vesting period. 
Performance-based vesting provisions apply to the following awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    All named executive officer stock option awards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    All named executive officer stock-settled RSUs  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    All CEO cash-settled RSUs  
[END TABLE]
These performance conditions do not present any upside potential for the named executive officers' compensation but instead create an additional at-risk element to the compensation that has been awarded to them. Imposing these additional performance conditions is designed to further reflect our approach of balancing risk and performance over the long term. 
For awards granted since January 2014, vesting is conditioned on the Company achieving positive Core Earnings (as defined below). If Core Earnings are not positive for any fiscal year in the vesting period, the named executive officer will automatically forfeit 50% of one year's worth of vesting (i.e., one-sixth of the total award). In addition, the Committee will determine the extent to which any named executive officer was accountable for the outcome and, based on such determination, the Committee will decide whether any or all of the remaining 50% of one year's worth of vesting will also be forfeited. The Committee may also decide to delay the vesting of the applicable portion of the award not so forfeited. For the NEOs, these determinations will be made each year prior to the scheduled vesting date, based on the Core Earnings for the fiscal year ended prior to such vesting date. For the CEO, these determinations will be made prior to the scheduled vesting date at the end of the three-year vesting period, taking into account Core Earnings for each fiscal year within the period. 
Core Earnings focuses on whether profits are being generated by our basic business, as opposed to other factors that may not reflect business fundamentals. The terms of the applicable award agreements define "Core Earnings" to mean the Company's net income available to common stockholders, excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, the impact of (i) impairment or amortization of intangible assets, (ii) the build or release of the allowance for loan and lease losses, calculated as the difference between the provision for loan and lease losses and charge-offs, net of recoveries, and (iii) the change in the combined uncollectible finance charge and fee reserve. The Committee believes that Core Earnings is an appropriate performance metric to employ for these performance-based vesting provisions because the metric captures major operational costs and risks to the Company's business, including charge-offs, operating expenses, market and competitive risks and costs to maintain adequate levels of capital and liquidity. Because the metric is based on net income available to common stockholders, it also includes the impact of discontinued operations.

Performance Share Reduction 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance         Share Reduction                   Each performance share award to the named  executive officers provides that the total value delivered at vesting will be reduced if for any year in the three-year performance period the Company does not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE (for awards granted in 2018 or later) or Adjusted ROA  (for awards granted prior to 2018). The total value can be reduced to zero if positive Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, is not achieved in all of the three years in the performance period. This reduction can occur regardless of where  Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, ranks relative to a comparator group.      
 Performance         Share Reduction                   Each performance share award to the named  executive officers provides that the total value delivered at vesting will be reduced if for any year in the three-year performance period the Company does not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE (for awards granted in 2018 or later) or Adjusted ROA  (for awards granted prior to 2018). The total value can be reduced to zero if positive Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, is not achieved in all of the three years in the performance period. This reduction can occur regardless of where  Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, ranks relative to a comparator group.      
 Performance         Share Reduction                   Each performance share award to the named  executive officers provides that the total value delivered at vesting will be reduced if for any year in the three-year performance period the Company does not achieve positive Adjusted ROTCE (for awards granted in 2018 or later) or Adjusted ROA  (for awards granted prior to 2018). The total value can be reduced to zero if positive Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, is not achieved in all of the three years in the performance period. This reduction can occur regardless of where  Adjusted ROTCE or Adjusted ROA, as applicable, ranks relative to a comparator group.      
[END TABLE]
"Adjusted ROTCE" means the ratio, expressed a percentage, of (a) the Company's net income available to common stockholders, excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, the impact of impairment, amortization and re-measurement of intangible assets, to (b) the Company's average tangible common equity, and shall exclude the initial effects of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or regulations, or other laws or provisions affecting the reported results if the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the 2004 Stock Incentive Plan or necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations. 
The performance share awards granted to the named executive officers prior to 2018 employ Adjusted ROA as the absolute performance metric, with the Company's performance assessed on the basis of Adjusted ROA relative to a comparator group consisting of companies in the KBW Index, excluding custody banks. All of the other features of the performance share reduction remains the same as described above, with Adjusted ROA being used in the place of Adjusted ROTCE. "Adjusted ROA" means the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of (a) the Company's net income available to common stockholders, excluding, on a tax-adjusted basis, the impact of impairment or amortization of intangible assets to (b) the Company's average tangible assets for the period. This metric is intended to reflect our earnings capacity by focusing on a component of our net income relative to our tangible assets. 
Misconduct Clawback Provisions 
[BEGIN TABLE]
             Misconduct               Clawback         Each incentive award to the named executive  officers, other than the cash incentive award granted to the named executive officers other than the CEO, is subject to clawback provisions that allow the Committee to seek recovery of all unvested portions of the awards in the event there has been  misconduct resulting in a violation of law or Company policy and the named executive officer committed the misconduct or failed in his or her responsibility to manage or monitor the applicable conduct or risks.      
             Misconduct               Clawback         Each incentive award to the named executive  officers, other than the cash incentive award granted to the named executive officers other than the CEO, is subject to clawback provisions that allow the Committee to seek recovery of all unvested portions of the awards in the event there has been  misconduct resulting in a violation of law or Company policy and the named executive officer committed the misconduct or failed in his or her responsibility to manage or monitor the applicable conduct or risks.

 has been misconduct resulting in either a violation of law or of Company policy that has caused significant financial or reputational harm to the Company and (ii) either the executive committed the misconduct or failed in his or her responsibility to manage or monitor the applicable conduct or risks. 
These clawback provisions have been designed to apply broadly, to a range of potential manifestations of misconduct at any level of the executive's organization. The unvested portions of all applicable incentive awards are subject to recovery and at risk of complete forfeiture. In each case, the Committee will determine the amount of compensation to recover, allowing the Committee to calibrate each recovery to the facts and circumstances giving rise to the need for such recovery. 
In the event the Committee exercises these clawback provisions, the Company intends to disclose the aggregate amount that the Committee has determined to recover, so long as the underlying event has already been publicly disclosed in the Company's filings with the SEC. 
Financial Restatement Clawbacks 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial             Restatement               Clawback         Each performance share award to the named  executive officers includes clawback provisions that allow the Company to recover shares under the award following a financial restatement.

[END TABLE]
All performance share awards to our executive officers include a clawback that is triggered in the event that the Company issues a restatement of its financial statements, or announces within three years after the vesting of an award that it expects to issue a restatement. If an executive would have been entitled to fewer shares on the vesting date under the restated financial statements, the executive may be required to return to the Company the excess shares awarded to him or her or, in the event he or she has sold or otherwise transferred the shares, he or she may be required to return the net proceeds from the sale or transfer. 
The Committee is actively engaged throughout the year and considers a number of factors in making compensation decisions with respect to the named executive officers. The Committee relies on a range of objective data including Company performance data, peer comparator group performance data, historical pay information, data on specific market practices and trends, stockholder feedback, and other relevant points of information to inform its business judgment.

Our Compensation Governance Cycle 
The Committee met nine times in 2018, with each meeting concluding with an executive session without management present. While specific topics may vary from meeting to meeting, the following graph describes the typical annual cycle of the Committee's compensation-related activities.

Use of Outside Consultants for CEO Compensation 
The Committee engages FW Cook to assist in the design of the CEO compensation program. FW Cook assists the Committee in a number of ways, including proposing and evaluating a peer comparator group, gathering relevant compensation data from the peer comparator companies, discussing relevant market trends and context and developing recommendations on possible plan designs. See the discussion under "Compensation Committee Consultant" in the "Corporate Governance at Capital One" section on page 36 for additional information about FW Cook. 
Use of Outside Consultants for NEO Compensation 
The Chief Human Resources Officer and other members of the Company's Human Resources department assist the CEO in developing compensation recommendations to the Committee for the NEOs. The Human Resources department typically uses multiple surveys as sources of market compensation data. FW Cook also provides additional market reference points that the Committee and the Independent Directors use when evaluating NEO compensation. Other outside consultants provide information to the Human Resources department regarding market practices and trends and research reports and provide subject matter expertise on specific concepts and technical issues related to executive compensation. However, these outside consultants do not recommend either the form or amount of compensation that is to be paid to the NEOs. The Human Resources department is responsible for analyzing the information obtained from the outside consultants and presenting it to the CEO. The CEO then considers all of the information provided by the Human Resources department and the Chief Human Resources Officer and makes his compensation recommendations for the NEOs to the Committee and the Independent Directors.

Management does not have a contractual arrangement with any compensation consultant to determine or recommend compensation programs for the NEOs. A consultant from FW Cook is present at Committee meetings during which CEO and NEO compensation is discussed and provides market data as well as an independent perspective regarding CEO and NEO compensation practices. FW Cook has no other engagement with, and performs no other services for, Capital One other than the services described above. 
Market Data 
The Committee reviews data from a group of peer comparator companies within the financial services industry. These organizations are intended to represent the marketplace of companies with whom Capital One competes for business and for executive talent. 
FW Cook plays a lead role in evaluating the peer comparator group on an annual basis. Each year, a consultant from FW Cook presents a comprehensive report to the Committee that highlights size, scope and performance information from the peer comparator companies across a variety of metrics. The Committee specifically considers the Company's percentile rank versus peer comparator companies across the following financial metrics:

After reviewing this information, the Committee recommends a final peer comparator group to the Independent Directors for approval. The peer comparator group is reviewed each year and adjusted, as appropriate, so that the size, scope, performance and business focus of the peer comparator companies reflect Capital One's competitive environment. For 2018, the peer comparator group was the same group for 2017 and included the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ∎ American  Express     ∎ Discover  Financial Services     ∎ Regions  Financial 
 ∎ Bank of America  Corporation     ∎ Fifth Third  Bancorp     ∎ SunTrust  Banks 
 ∎ BB&T  Corporation     ∎ J.P. Morgan  Chase     ∎ U.S.  Bancorp 
 ∎ Citigroup     ∎ PNC Financial  Services     ∎ Wells  Fargo & Company 
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that the peer comparator group reflects the competitive environment for the Company, particularly the performance and business focus of the companies in the peer comparator group and the competition for talent. The Committee determined to maintain the same peer comparator group for purposes of designing the 2019 compensation programs, and approved the comparator group in July 2018. 
Typically, compensation data from the peer comparator group is used to inform the Committee's determination of the total compensation target values for the named executive officers. As of December 31, 2018, Capital One was positioned at or near the median of the peer comparator group in terms of total assets, loans, deposits, revenues, net income, and market value. 
Tally Sheets 
In addition to considering market data from our peer comparator group (when available), the Committee also conducts an annual comprehensive review of tally sheets for the CEO and each NEO which reflect all components of compensation and include total compensation and potential payouts. Each tally sheet summarizes

[END TABLE]
 multiple components of current and historical compensation, as well as the potential value of post-termination arrangements. The tally sheets assist with the Committee's understanding of the historical context that is relevant to current compensation decisions, such as the CEO and each NEO's accumulated equity value. The tally sheets also help the Committee assess the potential downstream consequences of its decisions, such as the potential value to be received by the CEO and each NEO upon separation due to a change of control, retirement or other termination scenarios. 
Pension and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plans 
Capital One does not have any active pension plans for the NEOs. Each of our named executive officers participated in Capital One's Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("VNQDCP") in 2018, which is a voluntary, non-qualified deferred compensation plan that restores participating NEOs, excluding the CEO, to the level of savings they would have achieved if they had not been impacted by IRS limits governing our qualified 401(k) plan. It also allows the NEOs, excluding the CEO, to defer additional pre-tax compensation in order to save for retirement. The CEO participates in the VNQDCP on a non-voluntary basis, as the deferred cash portion of his year-end incentive is mandatorily deferred in the VNQDCP for three years. Capital One annually reviews programs and practices at our peer comparator companies and across the financial services industry. We also review changes in the legal and regulatory environment pertaining to retirement programs. 
Details of the VNQDCP can be found under "Capital One's Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Programs" beginning on page 89. 
Employment Agreements 
Capital One typically does not enter into defined term employment agreements with the named executive officers in order to maintain maximum flexibility in establishing separation terms at the appropriate time and considering their current circumstances. The Committee retains full discretion to approve employment agreements on an exception basis and has done so for exceptional circumstances in the past. None of the current NEOs have an employment agreement. 
Change of Control Agreements 
Each named executive officer is a party to an agreement providing certain benefits if the executive's employment terminates in connection with a change of control, as well as compensation and benefits protections during the two-year period following the change of control. 
The change of control agreements define compensation and benefits payable to named executive officers in certain merger and acquisition scenarios. The Committee believes these agreements provide the named executive officers with some certainty and allow the named executive officers to remain neutral and consider a full range of decisions that are focused on maximizing stockholder value. The change of control agreements are also intended to allow Capital One's businesses to operate with minimal disruption in the event of a change of control by providing each named executive officer with an incentive to remain in his or her leadership role up to and beyond the transaction date. In addition to compensation and benefits protections during a two-year protection period after a change of control, the named executive officers are entitled to severance-type benefits under the agreements if their employment is actually terminated as a result of (or in anticipation of) certain merger and acquisition scenarios. 
Both eligibility for participation and the structure of payments under these agreements are designed to be aligned with market practice in the banking and financial services industry. Our program is designed so that our stockholders are not faced with disproportionate severance costs that may impair potential merger opportunities. In addition, our change of control agreements for executive officers do not provide for excise tax "gross-up" payments.

[END TABLE]
Projections of potential payouts to the named executive officers under these agreements are included in the total compensation tally sheets reviewed by the Committee on an annual basis. Although the potential change of control payouts do not necessarily impact annual decisions on NEO pay, reviewing this information allows the Committee to fully understand the downstream implications of its decisions and the resulting impact to the Company and its stockholders. Additional details regarding these agreements can be found under "Payments Under Certain Termination Scenarios" beginning on page 91. 
Post-Employment Compensation Practices 
The CEO has no employment or severance arrangement with the Company other than the change of control agreement as described above. If an NEO, excluding the CEO, separates from Capital One, he or she is entitled to receive the amounts set forth in the Company's Executive Severance Plan, which provides for a payment of up to 30% of the NEO's then current total target compensation plus a pro-rated severance bonus based on the NEO's target cash incentive in the event of involuntary termination without cause due to restructuring. Additional benefits include partially subsidized health, dental and vision benefits for a period of up to 18 months through COBRA, and term life continuation and outplacement services for a period of up to one year following separation. The Committee may exercise its business judgment in approving additional amounts in light of all relevant circumstances, including the NEO's term of employment, past accomplishments, reasons for separation from the Company, potential risks and the NEO's willingness to restrict his or her future action(s), such as through an agreement not to compete or solicit the Company's customers or associates. In addition, following a separation from Capital One, certain equity-based awards will continue to vest according to their original terms, as described under "Payments Under Certain Termination Scenarios" beginning on page 91. 
Capital One has entered into agreements with certain NEOs that contain restrictive covenants related to confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and ownership of work product. For additional information, see "Restrictive Covenants" in the "Named Executive Officer Compensation" section beginning on page 91. 
Upon retiring from the Company, associates are generally entitled to receive certain retiree medical benefits, including subsidized medical benefits for qualified individuals. In addition, certain equity-based awards will continue to vest according to their original terms, as described under "Payments Upon Retirement" on page 92. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Requirements 
Consistent with their responsibilities to our stockholders, the executive officers are required to maintain a significant financial stake in the Company. To this end, the CEO and the NEOs must own shares of Capital One stock with a fair market value of at least the following annual cash salary multiples: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Role        Salary Multiple     
    CEO      6X 
    CEO      6X 
    Other NEOs and Executive  Officers      3X 
    Other NEOs and Executive  Officers      3X 
[END TABLE]
Given that the CEO's compensation program does not include a base salary, his ownership requirement is based on a notional salary established annually by the Committee and the Independent Directors, which is currently $1 million. In 2018, the Committee and the Independent Directors increased the stock ownership requirement of the CEO from 5 times to 6 times his notional salary amount to further align the CEO's requirement with that of the Company's peers. 
Ownership requirements may be fulfilled using the following shares:

  ∎    Shares owned without restriction

  ∎    Unvested restricted stock  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Committee reviews the guidelines and monitors the named executive officers' compliance with them. New executive officers are given five years from the date of promotion to or appointment as an executive officer to comply with these requirements. In the event that an executive officer is not in compliance with these requirements, the Committee has the right to take action, including reducing the executive officer's compensation. The named executive officers are currently in compliance with this requirement. 
In addition, the Company has stock retention requirements for certain equity awards made to the named executive officers. With respect to awards of performance shares and stock-settled RSUs that vest (i) during an executive's term of employment with Capital One or, (ii) as applicable, prior to the first anniversary of such executive's separation from Capital One, each executive must hold 50% of the after-tax net shares acquired for a period of one year after the acquisition date of the shares. These stock ownership and retention requirements apply to all of our executive officers. 
Prohibition of Hedging, Speculative Trading Activities and Pledging 
As part of the commitment by Capital One's leadership team to maintain public confidence in the long-term growth of Capital One's stock, Capital One maintains a policy prohibiting hedging and speculative trading activities. Specifically, the policy prohibits certain individuals from engaging in short sales, hedging transactions or speculative trading in derivative securities of Capital One stock. The policy applies to all Capital One directors, officers (as defined under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and together with Capital One directors, "Control Group Members"), associates that (i) serve at the Senior Vice President level, (ii) report directly to a Control Group Member, or (iii) are otherwise determined by Capital One's General Counsel to be an "insider," as well as any such individual's immediate family members. Capital One also prohibits its Control Group Members from using Capital One securities, including common stock, in a margin account or pledging Capital One securities as collateral for a loan. 
Equity Grant Practices 
Capital One strives to maintain equity grant practices that demonstrate high standards of corporate governance. Annual incentive awards generally are approved by the Committee and the Independent Directors (or by delegated authority to the Chief Human Resources Officer for certain associates who are not executive officers) at regularly scheduled meetings in the first quarter of each year. The date of grant is the actual date on which the Committee approves the awards. The Committee may grant awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options or other equity awards outside of the annual incentive cycle. The Committee has delegated authority to the CEO to award restricted stock and to the Chief Human Resources Officer to award stock-settled and cash-settled RSUs (but not options or other equity awards) to associates who are not executive officers, subject to a maximum amount of $2 million for any associate in any one year. These awards are designed to be used for new hires and for special programs designed by management to incentivize and reward current associates of the Company. The Committee reviews all grants made by delegation at least once per year. 
With respect to awards of stock options, the exercise price is always the Fair Market Value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. Under the terms of our 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, "Fair Market Value" is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. 
The Company does not seek to time equity grants to take advantage of material non-public information and in no event is the grant date set to a date that is prior to the date of approval. 
Tax Considerations 
The Committee carefully considers the tax impacts of its compensation programs on the Company, as well as on its executives. To maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers, the Committee does not require all

 CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION          2019 PROXY STATEMENT         79   
[END TABLE]
 compensation to be paid or awarded in a tax-deductible manner. However, it is the Committee's intent to maximize tax deductibility to the extent reasonable, provided the Company's programs remain consistent with the Company's overall executive compensation objectives. 
Historically, with respect to the named executive officers (other than the Chief Financial Officer), Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") limited the federal tax deduction for compensation paid to the executive to $1 million. Amounts in excess of $1 million were also eligible for the deduction if the compensation qualified as "performance-based." For this purpose, the Company's 2004 Stock Incentive Plan provides for the establishment of specific performance thresholds to be tied to equity-based awards that would allow awards to qualify as "performance-based" for the purposes of Section 162(m). 
On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted. This legislation repealed the exclusion for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. We expect that this transition relief will allow performance-based awards granted by Capital One on or before November, 2, 2017 to remain deductible under Section 162(m). Notwithstanding the above, the Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) if it determines that such modifications are consistent with Capital One's business needs.

Section IV - Named Executive Officer Compensation 
The Summary Compensation Table below provides information about compensation for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 for the named executive officers. As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 48, our executive compensation program is heavily weighted towards equity-based and at-risk elements of compensation. Under Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules, equity-based compensation is reported in the Summary Compensation Table below in the year in which it is awarded, which may not correlate to the year for which it is paid. 
With respect to the compensation reported below for our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    76% of the CEOs total compensation and performance year compensation is equity-based and at-risk to the performance of the Companys stock price, with 100% of his compensation deferred for at least three years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Amounts shown in the table below for the CEO for 2018 represent performance shares granted in February 2018 and a  deferred cash bonus awarded in January 2019 for 2018 performance. The CEO also was granted cash-settled restricted stock units (RSUs) in January 2019 for the 2018 performance year, which are not shown in the table below.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Amounts shown in the Stock Awards column for 2018 also include cash-settled RSUs granted to the CEO in  February 2018 for the 2017 performance year.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to the compensation reported below for the named executive officers ("NEOs") other than the CEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In 2018, base salary comprised approximately 20% of total target compensation and a cash incentive comprised  approximately 25% of total target compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In 2017 and 2016, base salary comprised approximately 35% of total target compensation, with a portion of base salary  paid in the form of cash throughout the year and a portion paid in the form of cash-settled RSUs that were granted in February each year and settled in cash in February in the following year. These cash-settled RSUs are included in the table below  in the Stock Awards column for 2016 and 2017. The NEOs were not eligible for a cash incentive prior to 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Amounts shown in the table below also include performance shares, stock-settled RSUs, stock options (prior to 2018) and  cash-settled RSUs granted in February each year for the prior performance year. The NEOs other than the CEO also were granted equity awards in January 2019 for the 2018 performance year, which are not shown in the table below.

The Grants of Plan-Based Awards table provides details on equity incentive plan awards granted in 2018, including performance shares, cash-settled RSUs and stock-settled RSUs. The columns reporting "Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards," "All Other Stock Awards" and "All Other Option Awards" relate to Capital One's equity-based incentives awarded to the named executive officers. 
2018 Grants to CEO 
For 2018, awards granted to the CEO consist of performance shares granted in February 2018 as part of the CEO's 2018 compensation program and cash-settled RSUs granted in February 2018 for 2017 performance. 
Performance Shares. The actual number of shares earned and issued with respect to performance shares will be based on the Company's D+TBV and Adjusted ROTCE (each as defined on page 59 under "Performance Share Award Metrics") over the three-year period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, relative to the KBW Index (as defined on page 59). In addition, the total value delivered at vesting will be reduced if the Company's Adjusted ROTCE for one or more fiscal years completed during the performance period is not positive, no matter how well the Company performs relative to the peer group. See "2018 CEO Compensation Program" in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 56 for more details on the 2018 performance share awards. Dividend equivalents are accrued on the performance shares at the same time as dividends are paid out to the Company's other stockholders and are paid out as additional shares only on the performance shares that actually vest based on the results certified by the Compensation Committee (the "Committee").

Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units. The cash-settled RSUs vest in full on February 15, 2021 and settle in cash based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the 15 trading days preceding the vesting date. Dividend equivalents are accrued on the cash-settled RSUs at the same time as dividends are paid to the Company's other stockholders and are paid at the time of vesting, adjusted for performance-based vesting results. 
2018 Grants to NEOs (other than the CEO) 
For 2018, the awards granted to NEOs other than the CEO consist of performance shares, cash-settled RSUs, and stock-settled RSUs granted in February 2018 for the 2017 performance year. 
Performance Shares. The terms of the performance shares for the other NEOs are the same as the terms of the CEO's performance shares described above. 
Stock-Settled Restricted Stock Units. The stock-settled RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on February 15 of the year after the date of grant. Dividend equivalents are accrued on the stock-settled RSUs at the same time as dividends are paid to the Company's other stockholders and are paid at the time of vesting, adjusted for performance-based vesting results. 
Cash-Settled Restricted Stock Units. The cash-settled RSUs vest in three equal annual installments beginning on February 15 of the year after the date of grant and settle in cash based on the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the 15 trading days preceding the vesting date. Dividend equivalents are paid on the cash-settled RSUs at approximately the same time as dividends are paid to the Company's other stockholders. 
The annual awards of stock-settled RSUs (as well as cash-settled RSUs for the CEO) reported below are also subject to performance-based vesting provisions that are associated with Core Earnings. As a result, the total number of shares delivered at vesting will be reduced if the Company does not achieve certain performance thresholds during the three-year vesting period. See "Additional Performance Conditions and Recovery Provisions" in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 48 for more details on the performance-based vesting provisions.

Capital One Pension Benefit Programs 
Capital One does not currently maintain a pension benefit program. Prior to November 1995, Capital One offered a Cash Balance Pension Plan ("CBPP") and an Excess Cash Balance Plan ("Excess CBPP") to all full-time salaried associates and certain executive officers. Both of these programs were frozen in December 1995; however, interest continues to accrue on plan balances on a quarterly basis for the CBPP and on a monthly basis for the Excess CBPP. The CBPP interest rate changes annually, based on the average yield of five-year U.S. Treasury Securities for the month of October of the prior plan year (2.02% for 2018). The Excess CBPP interest rate changes monthly based on the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate (4.99% annual average for 2018). 
Messrs. Fairbank and Finneran participated in these programs. The estimated annual payouts upon retirement in the CBPP and the Excess CBPP as of December 31, 2018, are $2,420 and $8,086, respectively, for Mr. Fairbank, and $1,770 and $1,335, respectively, for Mr. Finneran. As of December 31, 2018, the "Value of Accumulated Benefit" for both plans is equal to the account balance for each participant because both Messrs. Fairbank and Finneran have attained the normal retirement age of 65 and so are assumed to retire immediately under the actuarial valuation assumptions. Since both participants are assumed to retire as of the measurement date, the future interest rate does not apply. Accounts in both plans are distributed after separation from service. Distribution options from the CBPP plan are lump sum (eligible for rollover to another qualified plan or personal IRA) or an annuity option. The Excess CBPP will be distributed in the same form as the CBPP, as a lump sum (not eligible for rollover) or as an annuity. Since the CBPP and Excess CBPP are account-based defined benefit plans, years of service are not tracked.

(1)   In November 1995, Capital One amended the CBPP and the Excess CBPP to eliminate further  pay-based credits to participants as of December 31, 1995 and to provide that there would be no new participants in such plans on or after January 1, 1996. Interest continues to be credited on plan  balances on a quarterly (CBPP) or monthly (Excess CBPP) basis.

Capital One offers a Voluntary Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan ("VNQDCP") to eligible associates. In 2018, our NEOs excluding our CEO, could elect to contribute up to 50% of the cash portion of their respective base salaries and up to 90% of their cash incentive on a tax-deferred basis to the VNQDCP. Messrs. Blackley, LaPrade, Finneran and Yajnik participated in the program in 2018. In 2018, 100% of the CEO's deferred cash bonus was mandatorily deferred for three years under the VNQDCP and will be paid in a lump sum in the first quarter of 2021. In addition to participant deferrals, Capital One makes contributions under the VNQDCP. Company contributions vest immediately when posted to the VNQDCP. 
Participants in the VNQDCP have the option to direct their individual deferrals among seventeen different investment offerings made available by the plan: Fidelity Investments Money Market Government Portfolio - Institutional Class, iShares U.S. Aggregate Bond Index Fund Class K, PGIM Total Return Bond Fund Class R6, Dodge and Cox Balanced Fund, Dodge and Cox Stock Fund, T. Rowe Price Institutional Large Cap Value Fund, Northern Small Cap Value Fund, Fidelity 500 Index Fund - Institutional Premium Class, iShares Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index Fund Class K, Fidelity Capital Appreciation Fund - Class K, T. Rowe Price Institutional Large Cap Growth Fund, The Hartford MidCap Fund Class Y, The Hartford Small Company Fund Class Y, Dodge and Cox International Stock Fund, iShares MSCI Total International Index Fund Class K, Vanguard Total World Stock Index Fund International Shares, and Lazard Emerging Markets Market Equity Portfolio Institutional Shares. 
Distributions under the VNQDCP may be made to participants according to the schedule for distribution that they elect in accordance with plan terms. Distributions can occur based upon the following events: termination of employment (including for retirement), death, disability, in-service distribution election or change of control. The distribution schedules available under the plan include lump sum and, in the case of retirement, 5-, 10- or 15-year annual installments. 
Prior to December 31, 2005, Capital One offered its executives an Excess Savings Plan ("ESP"). The plan was frozen as of December 31, 2005: no additional participants have been permitted to enter the plan, and no compensation has since been taken into account after this date. Messrs. Fairbank, LaPrade, Finneran, and Yajnik participated in the ESP, and returns on these investments are reported for 2018. Effective January 1, 2008, the ESP was merged into the VNQDCP, and participants in the ESP have the option to direct their individual investments among the same offerings as the VNQDCP.

Overview 
The disclosure in the table below illustrates payouts that the named executive officers could receive under certain hypothetical termination scenarios. Actual circumstances resulting in the departure of a named executive officer cannot be predicted and may differ from the assumptions used in the information outlined below. The Company has adopted plans providing certain standards governing named executive officer separation payments (reflected in the table below) in order to protect the Company's interests in the event of an acquisition, as well as to provide competitive benefits to senior executives. 
The Committee reviews each executive officer's separation on a case-by-case basis and exercises its business judgment, with the approval of the other independent members of our Board of Directors (the "Independent Directors"), to customize the terms of such separations in consideration of the relevant circumstances, including:

Restrictive Covenants 
Capital One maintains a competitive advantage in part through the intellectual property developed and utilized by our senior executives. Capital One has asked certain NEOs to enter into various agreements that contain restrictive covenants related to confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation and ownership of work product, as described below. 
Non-Competition Agreements 
Messrs. Blackley and Yajnik have entered into non-competition agreements with the Company pursuant to which they may be restricted as to what competitive services they may provide to an entity following separation from Capital One. Messrs. Blackley and Yajnik have entered into non-competition agreements with the Company which provide for the following in exchange for the NEO complying with non-competition restrictions for up to two years following an involuntary termination, other than for cause, death or disability: payment equal to 15% of the NEO's total target compensation for each year of enforcement and up to 18 months of subsidized health insurance premiums under COBRA if the NEO is eligible and elects such coverage, subject to certain terms and conditions. The payments are made in two lump sums, the first following termination and the second upon successful completion of the enforcement period. In the event of a voluntary termination, the previously described payments are typically made for the second year of enforcement only for agreements with a two-year enforcement period. 
There are no payments under the non-competition agreements if benefits are payable under a change of control agreement. See "Change of Control" below for information regarding Change of Control Agreements applicable to the NEOs. In addition, payments related to the non-competition agreement are separate from any severance payments that may be made upon the NEO's departure. However, severance payments are typically offset in part by payments related to the non-competition agreement so that total payment amounts are consistent with the severance program's intent. 
Confidentiality, Work Product and Non-Solicitation of Employee Agreement 
Messrs. Blackley and Yajnik are parties to confidentiality, work product and non-solicitation of employee agreements. The confidentiality provisions of these agreements generally provide that at all times during and following employment with the Company, these NEOs may not use for personal benefit or the benefit of others, or divulge to others, any of Capital One's confidential information, except as expressly authorized by Capital One or required by legal process. These agreements also provide that for a period of two years following separation from Capital One, these NEOs shall not directly or indirectly solicit or induce any associate of Capital One to become employed by any person or entity engaged in competition with Capital One, and shall not directly or indirectly solicit or induce any associate of Capital One to end his or her employment based on confidential information these NEOs learned about the associate while they were employed by Capital One. 
Payments Under Certain Termination Scenarios 
Upon separation from the Company, the named executive officers, regardless of the reason for termination, receive certain earned, but previously unpaid, payments, such as accrued but unused vacation pay and amounts earned and vested under the Company's qualified and non-qualified retirement programs. In addition, cash-settled RSUs granted to NEOs, other than the CEO, after the end of a performance year continue to vest according to the original provisions of such grants upon separation for any reason other than cause or as soon as practicable following a "double trigger" change of control (as discussed below).

 CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION          2019 PROXY STATEMENT         91   
[END TABLE]
Voluntary Termination 
An NEO, other than the CEO, who voluntarily terminates employment with Capital One may receive payments related to non-competition covenants (described above, if applicable) and any contractual payments to which the NEO may otherwise be entitled. In addition, an NEO has the ability following separation to exercise vested but unexercised options for three months following voluntary termination. 
Involuntary Termination Without Cause 
An NEO, other than the CEO, whose employment with Capital One is terminated involuntarily, for performance or job elimination, is entitled to receive the amounts set forth in the Company's Executive Severance Plan in exchange for executing a release of claims against the Company. For 2018, potential payments under the Executive Severance Plan were 30% of total target compensation, plus a severance bonus based on the NEO's target cash incentive in the event of termination due to restructuring. Additional benefits include healthcare continuation subsidy under COBRA, continued coverage through broad-based and executive life insurance programs, outplacement services and any contractual payments to which the NEO may otherwise have been entitled. If an NEO's Non-Competition Agreement is enforced, cash payments under the Executive Severance Plan, other than the severance bonus, will be offset by any cash amounts paid under their respective Non-Competition Agreement and the NEO will be eligible for an additional payment of up to 90% of the severance payments in exchange for executing a release of claims against the Company. Generally, performance shares granted to NEOs prior to 2018 will vest on a pro rata basis based on actual Company performance during the performance period if an involuntary termination without cause occurs during the performance period, while performance shares granted to NEOs in 2018 will vest in full, based on actual Company performance, subject to the NEO's execution of a release of claims against the Company. Stock-settled RSUs granted to NEOs will continue to vest if an involuntary termination without cause occurs, subject to the NEO's execution of a release of claims against the Company. In addition, named executive officers have the ability following separation to exercise vested but unexercised options for two years. If a named executive officer's employment with Capital One is terminated as a result of death or disability, the named executive officer's unvested stock options, RSUs and performance shares will vest in full based on target Company performance. 
Payments Upon Retirement 
As with all executives who are eligible for retirement, named executive officers who retire from Capital One may receive the following amounts: payments related to non-competition covenants as if they had terminated voluntarily (described above); partially subsidized participation in retiree medical coverage (including dependents as applicable), for Messrs. Fairbank, Finneran, and Yajnik, who became eligible to retire on or before December 31, 2012; coverage through the executive life insurance program (at a reduced benefit); and any contractual payments to which he or she may otherwise be entitled. 
Upon retirement, all RSUs and stock options continue to vest according to their original terms based on actual performance, which, for stock-settled RSUs and stock options granted during or after 2012, also includes performance-based vesting provisions. In addition, performance shares granted to named executive officers will continue to vest after retirement, except the 2018 performance share grant to the CEO which would have been forfeited if he had retired on or before December 31, 2018. For stock options, the executive has until the expiration of the option term to exercise vested but unexercised options. 
Termination for Cause 
Generally, an NEO whose employment with Capital One is terminated for cause receives no additional benefits but is required to comply with any applicable restrictive covenants related to confidentiality, non-competition, non-solicitation of associates or customers, and ownership of work product, as described above. In addition, if terminated for cause, the NEOs have the ability following separation to exercise vested but unexercised options for three months.

[END TABLE]
Change of Control 
Each named executive officer is a party to an agreement (a "Change of Control Agreement") that provides for certain payments in the event his or her employment is terminated within two years following (or within one year prior to but in anticipation of) a change of control, either involuntarily without cause or voluntarily for good reason. Amounts payable in each of these scenarios are outlined below. 
Pursuant to the agreements, a "change of control" occurs if one or more of the following events take place: (i) an acquisition of 20% or more of Capital One's common stock or the combined voting power of the voting securities of Capital One by a person or group, (ii) certain changes in the majority of the Board, (iii) consummation of a reorganization, merger, share exchange or consolidation or similar transaction, sale of all assets or the acquisition of another company, except where all or substantially all of Capital One's stockholders receive 50% or more of the stock of the resulting company, at least a majority of the board of directors of the resulting company were incumbent Board members, and no person owns 20% or more of the resulting company who did not own such stock immediately before the business combination or (iv) approval by stockholders of a complete liquidation or dissolution of Capital One. In the event of a change of control, we do not provide for excise tax gross up payments. In addition, all equity awards granted to the named executive officers require a so-called "double trigger" for accelerated vesting in connection with a change of control. Upon a change of control, all equity awards continue to vest according to their original schedule. The vesting of such awards only accelerates if a named executive officer is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily terminates for good reason within the two years following a change of control. 
Termination for Cause in Connection with a Change of Control 
Named executive officers terminated involuntarily for cause following a change of control receive no additional benefits except with regard to options, which allow named executive officers to exercise vested but unexercised options for three months following a termination for cause. 
Voluntary Termination with Good Reason or Involuntary Termination Without Cause in Connection with a Change of Control 
In the event of a voluntary termination with good reason or an involuntary termination without cause, the potential payments that the named executive officers could receive under certain termination scenarios are based on a percentage of total target compensation. For the CEO, the potential payments are based on a multiple of his notional salary and year-end incentive opportunity. If a change of control of Capital One had occurred as of December 31, 2018, then following a voluntary termination with good reason or involuntary termination without cause, a named executive officer would have received certain benefits as outlined below: 
The CEO would be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    A lump-sum payment of 2.5 times the sum of his current notional salary and the  Highest Annual Bonus, which is the highest of (i) the target annual bonus for the year in which the change of control occurs (or the mid-point if no target is established), (ii) the target  annual bonus for the year immediately before the year the change of control occurs (or midpoint if no target is established), or (iii) the annual bonus paid or payable for the most recently completed fiscal year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The cash value, prorated through the date of termination, of the Highest Annual Bonus  
[END TABLE]
An NEO other than the CEO would be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    112.5% of the highest of (i) the NEOs current total target compensation, (ii) the NEOs total  target compensation for the prior year, or (iii) the NEOs actual total compensation for the prior year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The cash value, prorated through the date of termination, of the current years target cash incentive   
[END TABLE]
The CEO and each NEO would also be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    An amount equal to the employer contributions under the Companys qualified and  non-qualified retirement, healthcare and life insurance programs for 2.5 years, as well as access to such healthcare and life insurance plans for the named executive officer (and dependents as applicable)

(1)  Represents cash amounts paid for severance or in relation to enforcement of  non-competition covenants as described under "Restrictive Covenants" beginning on page 91. In cases where the NEO is eligible for both types of payments,  non-competition amounts typically offset severance amounts in whole or in part. Cash-settled RSUs granted after the end of a performance year are included in the "Acceleration and Continuation of Equity  Awards" column.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   Represents the value of projected contributions to retirement plans during the severance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)   Represents the value of equity where vesting is accelerated or continued by the triggering event. For stock options,  this represents the in-the-money value on December 31, 2018. For stock awards, this represents the fair market value of the shares on December 31, 2018. Most  currently unvested equity awards held by our retirement eligible executives will continue to vest according to their original terms following retirement, which includes a voluntary or involuntary termination not for cause after a named executive  officer becomes eligible for retirement. Messrs. Fairbank, Finneran, and Yajnik were the only named executive officers eligible for retirement as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)   Represents the value of potential payments made on the executive's behalf for continuation of medical and welfare  benefits during the non-competition or severance period, as applicable. Includes programs such as medical, dental, insurance, outplacement services and related benefits. Only includes programs that are  specific to the named executive officers; does not include the value of programs generally available to all associates upon separation from the Company.

(5)   Named executive officers are not eligible for excise tax gross-ups.

(6)   Mr. Fairbank receives no regular base salary. For 2018, Mr. Fairbank's payment in the event of a  termination following a change of control was based on a notional salary of $1 million and his Highest Annual Bonus (as defined above). The Committee reviews and establishes the notional salary amount on an annual basis, based on market trends  related to CEO compensation and recommendations provided by FW Cook. Mr. Fairbank is a party to a Change of Control Agreement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(7)   Represents potential payments and benefits upon change of control for involuntary termination without cause or  voluntary termination for good reason. "Acceleration and Continuation of Equity Awards" represents the value of equity where vesting is accelerated upon change of control, assuming, where applicable, that all performance metrics have been  achieved at their target level.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(8)   Unvested equity awards will be treated in a similar manner to a termination of a named executive officer's  employment following a termination of employment due to death or disability.  
[END TABLE]
The table above is intended to reflect potential payments to named executive officers across a range of potential separation scenarios, assuming the change of control or separation occurred on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown in the table do not include accrued salary and vacation pay as of the date of termination, and payments and benefits that are provided on a non-discriminatory basis to salaried associates generally upon termination of employment or retirement. The NEOs are also eligible to receive certain pension benefits and certain qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation amounts upon termination. These amounts are outlined in the 2018 Pension Benefits Table on page 88 and the 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table on page 90, respectively, and are not included in the table above. 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation, calculated in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K (the "Annual Total Compensation") of our median employee and the Annual Total Compensation of our CEO, Richard D. Fairbank. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Annual Total Compensation of the median compensated of all employees of our company (other than our CEO), was  $67,165  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Annual Total Compensation of Mr. Fairbank was $17,333,796  
[END TABLE]
Accordingly, the ratio of Mr. Fairbank's Annual Total Compensation to the median employee's Annual Total Compensation was 258 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's Annual Total Compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay

[END TABLE]
 ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
In determining our median employee for 2018, in accordance with SEC rules we have concluded that it would be appropriate to: (1) rely on the process we undertook in 2017 to identify the median employee (as described in our 2018 Proxy Statement), because we believe that since the 2017 determination, there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact our pay ratio; and (2) substitute the median employee for 2017 with another similarly compensated employee for 2018 because the 2017 median employee has since been promoted.

  Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting  Compliance 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), requires that Capital One's executive officers and directors, and persons that beneficially own more than 10% of Capital One's common stock, file certain reports of beneficial ownership of the common stock and changes in such ownership with the SEC, and provide copies of these reports to Capital One. As a matter of practice, our employees assist our executive officers and directors in preparing initial ownership reports and reporting ownership changes and typically file these reports on their behalf. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms in our possession and written representations furnished to us, we believe that in 2018 each of the reporting persons complied with these filing requirements.

In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Ernst & Young's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with Ernst & Young their independence from Capital One. Based on its review and discussions with management and Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors the inclusion of the audited financial statements in Capital One's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

Section IX - Election of Directors 
(Item 1 on Proxy Card) 
All of Capital One's directors are elected at each annual meeting of stockholders and hold such office until the next annual meeting of stockholders, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Each nominee is a current Board member who was elected by stockholders at the 2018 Annual Stockholder Meeting, other than Mr. Leenaars, who was appointed to the Board effective January 2019 and who previously served as a director of the Company in 2012 in connection with the Company's acquisition of ING Direct, and Mr. Locoh-Donou, who was appointed to the Board effective March 2019 and was recommended to the Governance and Nominating Committee by Spencer Stuart, a third-party director search firm. Each nominee has consented to serve a one-year term. Information about the proposed nominees for election as directors is set forth under "Biographies of Director Nominees" in the "Corporate Governance at Capital One" section beginning on page 18 of this proxy statement. 
In the event a nominee ceases to be available for election, the Board may designate a substitute as a nominee or reduce the size of the Board. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director. 
The nominees for election this year are:

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of these director nominees.

Section X - Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
(Item 2 on Proxy Card) 
The Audit Committee, pursuant to authority granted to it by the Board of Directors, is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of Capital One's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee evaluates the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence at least annually and periodically considers whether to continue to retain our current independent registered public accounting firm or engage another firm. In connection with applicable partner rotation requirements, the Audit Committee and its Chair are involved in considering the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm's new lead engagement partner. Additionally, Capital One has established policies to provide for adherence to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Sarbanes-Oxley Act") relating to the rotation of partners engaged in Capital One's audit by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
For 2019, the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young") as Capital One's independent registered public accounting firm. Ernst & Young has served in this role since 1994. The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Ernst & Young as Capital One's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of Capital One and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors is submitting this proposal to the vote of the stockholders as a matter of good corporate governance. If stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our stockholders' best interests. 
The fees billed for professional services provided by Ernst & Young for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are shown in the following table:

These policies and procedures involve annual pre-approval by the Audit Committee of the types of services to be provided by Capital One's independent registered public accounting firm and fee limits for each type of service on both a per engagement and aggregate level. Any service engagements that exceed these pre-approved limits must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval. In 2018, all of the Audit and Audit-Related Fees and related services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the policies and procedures described above. Under the policy adopted by the Audit Committee, Tax Fees are limited to 25% of combined Audit and Audit-Related Fees, and services that would fall under the category "All Other Fees" are prohibited. 
One or more representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Annual Stockholder Meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.

The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as Capital One's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Section XI - Advisory Approval of Capital One's 2018 Named Executive Officer Compensation 
(Item 3 on Proxy Card) 
We are offering to our stockholders a non-binding advisory vote to approve our 2018 named executive officer compensation, pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. While the vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors values the opinions that stockholders express through their votes and in any additional dialogue. The Board of Directors will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 48, our Board of Directors generally has provided compensation programs for the CEO and the other NEOs that are competitive with the market, performance-based and transparent and that align with our stockholders' interests over multiple time horizons. Our CEO's and other NEOs' compensation programs generally have consisted primarily of performance-based incentive opportunities, including multiple types of equity instruments with multi-year vesting schedules. The ultimate value of these equity-based awards is subject to Capital One's sustained performance over time, both on an absolute basis and relative to our peers. 
For 2018, approximately 76% of the CEO's total compensation is equity-based and at-risk to the performance of the Company's stock price, and 100% of his compensation is deferred for a three-year period. As discussed under "NEO Compensation" beginning on page 66, under the 2018 NEO compensation program applicable to our other NEOs, approximately 55% of total target compensation was provided through equity-based vehicles which were all at-risk based on the performance of the Company's stock price and subject to vesting over multiple time horizons. 
Additional information relevant to your vote can be found under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on pages 48 to 80 and "Named Executive Officer Compensation" section on pages 81 to 96. 
We ask for your approval of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that Capital One's stockholders hereby provide their advisory approval of the 2018 Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed pursuant to the rules of the SEC in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, the other compensation tables and the related notes and narratives in this proxy statement." 
The Board of Directors has resolved to hold annual advisory votes to approve executive compensation. Accordingly, the next advisory vote to approve executive compensation will occur at the 2020 Annual Stockholder Meeting, unless the Board of Directors modifies its policy on the frequency of holding such advisory votes. 
*** 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of our 2018 Named Executive Officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement.

Section XII - Approval and Adoption of the Capital One Financial Corporation Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan 
(Item 4 on Proxy Card) 
Overview 
In 2004 the Board of Directors adopted the Capital One Financial Corporation 2004 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan"), which was approved by the Company's stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on April 29, 2004. The 2004 Plan was subsequently resubmitted for approval, and approved, by stockholders, at the annual meetings held on April 27, 2006, April 23, 2009 and May 1, 2014 in order to increase the number of shares available for issuance under the 2004 Plan and to make certain other changes as detailed in the respective proxy statement proposals for stockholder approval. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved and adopted the Fourth Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan effective as of January 1, 2018 to make certain non-material changes. 
On January 31, 2019, the Compensation Committee adopted, subject to stockholder approval, an amended and restated version of the 2004 Plan (the "Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan") to address changes to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") resulting from the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Specifically, the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan addresses the repeal of the exclusion for performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
The Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan revises the 2004 Plan to account for changes to Section 162(m) of the Code as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Deletes certain defined terms that are no longer applicable in connection with the changes to Section 162(m) of the  Code, such as the terms Covered Employee and Performance-Based Compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Eliminates the distinction between performance criteria that were applicable to awards designed to comply with the  performance-based compensation exemption under Section 162(m) of the Code and other performance criteria that could be applied to awards granted under the 2004 Plan outside the scope of Section 162(m) of the Code; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Extends the Committees discretion in determining and modifying the allocation of the annual incentive pool to all  individual participants by removing the limitation applied to Covered Employees, a term no longer defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Although no longer required under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan maintains individual award limits at the levels previously approved by our stockholders. Additionally, the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan continues to prohibit a number of practices. For example, the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Does not allow for repricing or cashing out of out-of-the-money stock options or stock appreciation rights;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Does not allow reload stock option grants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Does not include evergreen provisions.  
[END TABLE]
The 2004 Plan, amended as of May 1, 2014, created a reserve of 55 million shares of Capital One common stock (each a "Share," collectively, the "Shares"). The 2004 Plan share reserve remains sufficient to cover the awards anticipated to be granted in 2019 and therefore we are not asking for stockholders to approve an increase in the 2004 Plan's share reserve at this time. This proposal does not include a request for an increase in the Share reserve under the 2004 Plan.

The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that compensating Capital One executives and associates with equity awards encourages the creation of long-term stockholder value and the delivery of consistent medium- and long-term results. 
Summary of Material Provisions of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan 
The material terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan are summarized below and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, which is provided as Appendix B to this proxy statement. Because this is a summary, it may not contain all the information that you may consider important, and thus, we encourage you to read the full text of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. Copies of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will also be available at your request at the Annual Stockholder Meeting. 
Types of Awards 
Awards under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan may be in the form of: (i) cash-based awards; (ii) options, which may be incentive stock options, as defined in the Code ("ISOs") (which are tax advantageous for the participant but with respect to which Capital One does not receive a deduction) or non-qualified stock options ("NQSOs"); (iii) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"); (iv) restricted stock; (v) restricted stock units ("RSUs"); (vi) performance shares; (vii) performance units; (viii) annual incentive pool awards; or (ix) other stock-based awards ("Other Stock-Based Awards") (collectively, "Awards"). 
Duration of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan 
The Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan was amended and restated as of January 1, 2018 (the "Restatement Effective Date") and will become effective upon stockholder approval. Unless terminated sooner as provided therein, the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will terminate on May 1, 2024, which is ten (10) years from the effective date of the Third Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, which was approved by stockholders on May 1, 2014. After the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is terminated, no new Awards may be granted under the 2004 Plan. Awards previously granted will remain outstanding in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan and as specified under the applicable grant agreement. 
Shares Available for Awards 
The total number of Shares available for issuance under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, subject to adjustment in accordance with certain anti-dilution provisions described below, is not being increased and therefore will not exceed an aggregate amount of 55 million Shares. 
Shares covered by an Award will only be counted as used under the authorized Shares and Award limits set forth in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan to the extent they are actually issued and delivered to a participant or such participant's designated transferee and are not forfeited by the participant and returned to Capital One. Any Shares that are related to Awards which terminate by expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, or otherwise without the issuance of Shares, which are forfeited by the participant to Capital One (including pursuant to performance based vesting conditions), which are settled in cash in lieu of Shares, or which (subject to the 2004 Plan's prohibition on repricing, cashing out or exchanging out of the out-of-the-money stock options or stock appreciation rights) are exchanged with the Compensation Committee's permission prior to the issuance of Shares for Awards not involving the issuance or delivery of Shares, will be available again for grant under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, if (i) the exercise price of any option granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is satisfied by tendering Shares to Capital One (by either actual delivery or by attestation), or (ii) a SAR is exercised, then only the number of Shares issued, net of the Shares so tendered or withheld, if any, will be deemed issued and delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan and the maximum number of Shares available for issuance as ISOs and NQSOs. Except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, the maximum number of Shares available for issuance under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will not be reduced to reflect any

 dividends or dividend equivalents that are reinvested into additional Shares or credited as additional restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares, or Other Stock-Based Awards.

  ∎    Cash-Based Awards.

Adjustments in Authorized Shares 
In the event of any corporate event or transaction (including, but not limited to, a change in the Shares or the capitalization of Capital One), such as a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, separation, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, split up, spin-off, or other distribution of stock or property of Capital One, combination of Shares, exchange of Shares, dividend in kind, extraordinary cash dividend or other like change in capital structure or distribution to stockholders of Capital One, or any similar corporate event or transaction, the Compensation Committee, in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of participants' rights under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, will substitute or adjust, as applicable, the number and kind of Shares that may be issued under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or under certain Awards, the number and kind of Shares subject to outstanding Awards, the exercise or grant price applicable to outstanding Awards, the annual award limits described above and other value determinations applicable to outstanding Awards. The Compensation Committee will also make appropriate adjustments or modifications in the terms of any Awards to reflect such corporate events or transactions, including the modification of performance goals and performance periods. Subject to applicable law, the Compensation Committee is also authorized to issue new Awards or assume awards granted under plans of other entities in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock or reorganization upon such terms and conditions it deems appropriate.

Administration 
The Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will have full and exclusive discretionary power to do all things that it determines to be necessary or appropriate in connection with the administration of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, including, without limitation: (a) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan and to define terms not otherwise defined therein; (b) to determine which persons are eligible for Awards granted thereunder and the timing of any such Awards; (c) to prescribe and amend the terms of the Award agreements, to grant Awards and determine the terms and conditions thereof; (d) to establish and verify the extent of satisfaction of any performance goals or other conditions applicable to the grant, issuance, retention, vesting, exercisability, settlement or recoupment of any Award; (e) to prescribe and amend the terms of or form of any document or notice required to be delivered to Capital One by participants under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan; (f) to determine the extent to which adjustments are required pursuant to the terms of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan; (g) to interpret and construe the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, any rules and regulations thereunder and the terms and conditions of any Award granted thereunder, and to make exceptions to any such provisions if the Compensation Committee, in good faith, determines that it is appropriate to do so; (h) to approve corrections in the documentation or administration of any Award; and (i) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for the administration of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. 
The Compensation Committee may delegate to one or more of its members or other members of the Board of Directors or to one or more officers or management committees of Capital One (including its subsidiaries and affiliates) or to one or more agents or advisors such duties or powers as it may deem advisable, and the Compensation Committee or any person to whom it has delegated duties or powers as aforesaid may employ one or more persons to render advice with respect to any responsibility the Compensation Committee or such person may have under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. In addition, the Compensation Committee may, by resolution, authorize one or more officers or management committees of Capital One to do one or more of the following on the same basis as can the Compensation Committee: (a) designate employees to be recipients of Awards; and (b) determine the type, number of Shares subject thereto and all other terms and conditions of any such Awards; provided, however, (i) the Compensation Committee may not delegate such responsibilities to any such officer or management committee for Awards granted to a director, an employee that is considered an Insider (as defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan); (ii) the resolution providing such authorization sets forth the total number of Shares that may be subject to Awards such officer(s) or management committee(s) may grant and any other limitations on the delegated authority that the Compensation Committee may deem appropriate or advisable; and (iii) the officer(s) or management committee(s) must report periodically to the Compensation Committee regarding the nature and scope of the Awards granted pursuant to the authority delegated in the manner and at such times as requested by the Compensation Committee. 
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law and subject to Capital One's Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Restated Bylaws, neither Capital One nor any member of the Compensation Committee will be liable for any action, omission or determination of the Compensation Committee relating to the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or any Award, and Capital One will indemnify and hold harmless each member of the Compensation Committee and each other person to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or any Award has been delegated against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Compensation Committee) arising out of any such action, omission or determination relating to the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or any Award. 
The Compensation Committee may enter into agreements with third parties, on such terms and conditions as it determines, pursuant to which such third parties may issue Awards to the participants in lieu of Capital One's issuance thereof or assume the obligations of Capital One under any Awards previously issued by Capital One. 
Eligibility 
All employees of Capital One, its affiliates and its subsidiaries and members of the Board are eligible to be granted Awards under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. Certain individual consultants, agents,

[END TABLE]
 advisors and independent contractors who render services to Capital One ("Third Party Service Providers") are also eligible to participate in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. As stated above, participants will be selected by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, from among those eligible. The approximate number of individuals eligible to be granted Awards under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as of December 31, 2018 were 47,600 employees,10 non-management directors and 23,000 Third Party Service Providers, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, there were no Third Party Service Providers with outstanding awards under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. 
In lieu of making Awards directly to employees, directors or Third Party Service Providers, the Compensation Committee may make Awards under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan through or to a trust or other funding vehicle which then makes Awards to participants or which issues interests in Awards held by it to participants, on such terms and conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
General Terms and Conditions of Awards 
In general, and subject to the terms and provisions of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan (including those described below), Awards may be granted to participants on such dates, in such form and number and upon such terms and conditions (including the effect, if any, of a Change of Control, death, Disability or Retirement (as each such term is defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan)) as determined from time to time by the Compensation Committee. Each Award granted will be evidenced by an Award agreement that will specify such terms and conditions. In addition, each participant's Award agreement will set forth the extent to which the participant will have the right to exercise, retain or receive an Award or to have such Award vest or pay out, as applicable, following the termination of such participant's employment with, or provision of services to, Capital One, its affiliates or subsidiaries, as the case may be. 
Except as otherwise provided in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, in a participant's Award agreement or as otherwise determined at any time by the Compensation Committee, no Award granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 
The Compensation Committee may specify in an Award agreement that the participant's rights, payments and benefits with respect to an Award will be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions. Failure by a participant to comply with any of the terms and conditions of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or any Award agreement will be grounds for the cancellation and forfeiture of such Award. 
Options. The Compensation Committee may grant to a participant the right to purchase Shares in such amounts and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee determines (including in satisfaction of Capital One's obligations pursuant to options with reload features granted under the prior stock incentive plans), subject to the following restrictions. An option may be granted as an ISO or as a non-qualified stock option, as determined by the Compensation Committee and as set forth in any applicable Award agreement. The exercise price per Share will be determined by the Compensation Committee and may be at, above or indexed to, the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant; provided that, in no event will the exercise price per Share be less than 100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. Options granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will vest and become exercisable at such time and upon such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Compensation Committee; provided that no option will be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its date of grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, options granted to participants outside of the United States may have a term of greater than ten (10) years. 
The purchase price for the Shares as to which an option is exercised will be paid to Capital One in full at the time of exercise (i) in cash or its equivalent; (ii) in Shares having a fair market value equal to the aggregate exercise price for the Shares being purchased and satisfying such other requirements as may be imposed by the Compensation Committee; (iii) partly in cash and partly in such Shares; (iv) by a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise; or (v) by any other method approved or accepted by the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an option granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without

 limitation, minimum holding period requirements, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed and/or traded, or under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares. 
The Compensation Committee is not permitted to grant options containing, or amend options previously granted to include, reload features providing for the automatic grant of options with respect to the number of already owned Shares delivered by the participant to exercise options. 
SARs. The Compensation Committee may grant to a participant an SAR independent of an option or in tandem with an option or designated portion thereof at the time the related option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise or cancellation of the related option. The grant price of an SAR that is either granted independently of any options or the exercise of which does not require the forfeiture of any rights under a related option (a "Freestanding SAR") will be determined by the Compensation Committee; provided that, in no event will the grant price per Share be less than 100% of the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. The grant price of an SAR that is granted in connection with a related option and the exercise of which requires the forfeiture of the right to purchase Shares under the related option (a "Tandem SAR") will be equal to the exercise price of the related option. 
The term of an SAR granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will be determined by the Compensation Committee; provided that no SAR will be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of the date of its grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, SARs granted to participants outside of the United States may have a term of greater than ten (10) years. 
Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon the terms and conditions as imposed by the Compensation Committee and Tandem SARs may only be exercised with respect to all or part of the Shares subject to the related option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related option. 
Upon the exercise of an SAR, the participant will be entitled to receive, with respect to each Share to which such SAR relates, an amount in cash and/or Shares, as the case may be, equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value of a Share on the date of exercise over (ii) the grant price of the SAR. The Compensation Committee may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an SAR granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, a requirement that the participant hold the Shares received upon exercise of an SAR for a specified period of time. 
Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee may grant to a participant Shares of restricted stock and/or RSUs. RSUs are similar to Shares of restricted stock except that no Shares are actually awarded to the participant on the date of grant. The Shares of restricted stock and/or the RSUs granted to a participant under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will not be transferable until the end of the applicable period of restriction established by the Compensation Committee (and in the case of RSUs until the date of delivery of Shares or other payment), or upon earlier satisfaction of any other conditions as specified by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will impose such other conditions and/or restrictions on any Shares of restricted stock or RSUs as it may deem advisable, including a requirement that the participant pay a stipulated purchase price for each Share of restricted stock or each RSU, restrictions based upon achievement of performance goals, service-based restrictions and/or restrictions under applicable laws or under the requirements of any stock exchange or securities market upon which such Shares are listed or traded. For the avoidance of doubt, imposing restrictions based upon the achievement of performance goals will not result in shares of restricted stock or RSUs being converted to performance shares or performance units for purposes of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, including for purposes of the annual award limits described above. 
Generally, Shares of restricted stock will become freely transferable by the participant after all conditions and restrictions applicable to such Shares have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of applicable tax withholding obligations) and RSUs will be settled in cash, Shares or a combination of cash and Shares, as the Compensation Committee determines. 
To the extent permitted by law, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee and set forth in an Award agreement, participants holding Shares of restricted stock will be granted the right to exercise full voting rights and to receive all dividends and other distributions paid with respect to those Shares during the period of

 restriction, while recipients of RSUs will not be granted such rights, dividends or distributions during the period of restriction, except as specifically determined by the Compensation Committee and as permitted by law. 
Performance Units and Performance Shares. The Compensation Committee may grant performance units and/or performance shares to participants under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan in such amounts and upon such terms as the Compensation Committee determines. Each performance unit will have an initial value that is established by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant and each performance share will have an initial value equal to the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant. In addition to any non-performance terms set forth by the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee will set performance goals which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the value and/or number of performance units or performance shares to be paid out to participants. Participants will be entitled to payment, in the form of cash and/or Shares, equal to the value and number of applicable performance units and performance shares earned by participants over the designated performance period following the end of such performance period. 
Cash-Based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant cash-based Awards and Other Stock-Based Awards to participants, in such amounts and upon such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may determine. Other Stock-Based Awards may include Awards designed to comply with or take advantage of the applicable local laws of jurisdictions outside of the United States. 
Each cash-based Award will specify a payment amount or payment range and each Other Stock-Based Award will be expressed in terms of Shares or units based on Shares, each as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may also establish any performance goals with respect to cash-based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards, in which case the number and/or value of cash-based Awards or Other Stock-Based Awards that will be paid out to the participant will depend on the extent to which the performance goals (and any other non-performance terms and conditions) are met. Payment with respect to a cash-based Award or Other Stock-Based Award will be made in accordance with the terms of the Award, in cash and/or Shares as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
Performance-Based Compensation. The Compensation Committee may grant Awards to participants that are subject to performance goals upon which the grant, payment or vesting of an Award may occur. The performance goals will be set at the discretion of the Compensation Committee and can include, but are not limited to, the following performance measures, either individually, alternatively, or in any combination, applied to either Capital One as a whole or to a business unit or subsidiary or affiliate or any combination thereof, either individually, alternatively or in any combination, and measured either annually or cumulatively over a period of years, on an absolute basis or relative to a pre-established target, to previous years' results or to a designated comparison group, in each case as specified by the Compensation Committee: net earnings or net income (before or after taxes); earnings per share; net sales growth; net operating profit; return measures (including, but not limited to return on assets, capital, equity or sales); cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and cash flow return on capital); cash flow per share; earnings before or after taxes, interest, depreciation and/or amortization; gross or operating margins; productivity ratios; share price (including, but not limited to, growth measures and total stockholder return); expense targets or ratios; charge-off levels; revenue growth; deposit growth; margins; operating efficiency; operating expenses; economic value added; improvement in or attainment of expense levels; improvement in or attainment of working capital levels; debt reduction; capital targets; consummation of acquisitions, dispositions, projects or other specific events or transactions; and any other performance goal that the Compensation Committee deems appropriate. 
The Compensation Committee may provide for accelerated vesting of any Award based on the achievement of performance goals pursuant to the performance measures set forth by the Compensation Committee with respect to such Award. 
The Compensation Committee will determine whether, with respect to a performance period, the applicable performance goals have been met with respect to a given participant and, if they have, to so certify and ascertain the amount of the applicable Award. The Compensation Committee may provide in any such Award that any evaluation of performance may include or exclude any of the following events that occurs during a performance period: (a) asset write-downs, (b) litigation or claim judgments or settlements, (c) the effect of changes in tax laws, accounting principles or regulations, or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, (d) any reorganization and restructuring programs, (e) extraordinary, unusual, and/or nonrecurring items of gain or loss as defined under

 United States generally accepted accounting principles for the applicable year, (f) mergers, acquisitions or divestitures, and (g) foreign exchange gains and losses. 
Annual Incentive Pool Awards. The Compensation Committee may designate employees who are eligible to receive a monetary payment in any plan year based upon a percentage of an incentive pool equal to the greater of (i) 3% of Capital One's Consolidated Operating Earnings for the plan year, (ii) 20% of Capital One's Operating Cash Flow for the plan year, and (iii) 5% of Capital One's Net Income for the plan year (as each such term is defined in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan). The Compensation Committee will allocate an incentive pool percentage to each participating employee for each plan year; provided that the incentive pool percentage for any one participant may not exceed 50% of the total pool, the sum of the incentive pool percentages for all participants cannot exceed 100% of the total pool and the monetary payment for any one participant may not exceed $10,000,000. As soon as possible following the determination of the incentive pool for a plan year, the Compensation Committee will calculate each participant's portion of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of the plan year. The Compensation Committee retains the discretion to adjust incentive pool downwards and provide for such other terms as it feels necessary or appropriate. 
Dividend Equivalents. The Compensation Committee may grant dividend equivalents to any participant based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award. Such dividend equivalents may be awarded or paid in the form of cash, Shares, restricted stock, RSUs or a combination thereof and will be determined by such formula and at such time and be subject to such accrual, forfeiture or payout restrictions or limitations as determined by the Compensation Committee in its discretion. 
Deferrals. The Compensation Committee may permit or require a participant to defer his or her receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such participant by virtue of the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Shares of restricted stock or RSUs, or the satisfaction of any requirements or performance goals with respect to performance shares, performance units, cash-based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and annual incentive pool Awards. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Compensation Committee will establish rules and procedures for such payment or Share delivery and any notional earnings to be credited on such deferred amounts, provided that in the case of any Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation," as such term was defined in Section 162(m) of the Code on December 21, 2017, such earnings will be in compliance with Code Section 162(m). 
Amendment, Modification, Suspension and Termination; No Repricings. The Compensation Committee may, at any time, alter, amend, modify, suspend or terminate the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan and any Award agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, that no amendment of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or an Award will be made without stockholder approval if stockholder approval is required by law, regulation, or stock exchange rule. Furthermore, other than in connection with a change in Capital One's capitalization, the Compensation Committee will not, without stockholder approval, reduce the exercise price or grant price of a previously awarded option or SAR and, at any time when the exercise price or grant price of the previously awarded option or SAR is above the fair market value of a Share, the Compensation Committee will not, without stockholder approval, cancel and re-grant or exchange such option or SAR for cash or a new Award with a lower (or no) exercise price or grant price or take any other action that would be considered a repricing for purposes of United States generally accepted accounting principles or any applicable stock exchange rule. 
No termination, amendment, suspension or modification of the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or an Award agreement will materially adversely affect any Award previously granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan without the written consent of the participant holding such Award. The Compensation Committee may, however, terminate any Award previously granted and any Award agreement relating thereto in whole or in part upon payment of certain consideration (as set forth in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan) or, in the case of options only, thirty (30) days after an acceleration of exercisability. 
The Compensation Committee may authorize the repurchase of any Award by Capital One at any time for such price and on such terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may determine, provided that without the prior approval of Capital One's stockholders, the Compensation Committee may not permit the repurchase by Capital One of options or SARs with an exercise price or grant price, respectively, above the fair market value of the Shares at the time of such repurchase. The Compensation Committee may make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the performance criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring

 events affecting Capital One or the financial statements of Capital One or of changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, whenever the Compensation Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the benefits to be made available under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan. 
Successors. All obligations of Capital One under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan with respect to Awards granted thereunder will be binding on any successor to Capital One, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of Capital One. 
Tax Withholding. Capital One may deduct or withhold, or require the participant to remit to Capital One, any taxes due as a result of or in connection with the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan or any Award. Participants may elect, or the Compensation Committee may require, the withholding of Shares to satisfy the participant's withholding obligations. 
Participants Based Outside of the United States. In order to comply with the laws in other jurisdictions in which Capital One, its affiliates or its subsidiaries operate or have employees, directors or Third Party Service Providers, the Compensation Committee will have the power to (i) determine which affiliates and subsidiaries will be covered by the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, (ii) determine which employees, directors and Third Party Service Providers outside of the United States are eligible to participate in the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, (iii) modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to participants outside of the United States to comply with foreign laws, (iv) establish subplans and modify exercise procedures and other terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable and (v) take any action that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approval. 
New Plan Benefits. Because benefits under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan will depend on the Compensation Committee's actions and the fair market value of the Shares at various future dates, it is not possible to determine the benefits that will be received by directors, executive officers and other employees if the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan is approved by stockholders. As of December 31, 2018, the closing price of our common stock was $75.59 per share.

Material Tax and Other Considerations Relating to the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan

 general information and does not make specific representations to any Award recipient. A recipient's particular situation may be such that some variation of the basic rules is applicable to him or her. In addition, the federal income tax laws and regulations frequently have been revised and may be changed again at any time. Therefore, each recipient is urged to consult a tax advisor before exercising any award or before disposing of any shares acquired under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan both with respect to federal income tax consequences as well as any foreign, state or local tax consequences. 
The grant of an option or SAR will create no tax consequences for the participant or Capital One. A participant will not generally recognize taxable income upon exercising an ISO (except that the alternative minimum tax may apply). Upon exercising an option other than an ISO, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the freely transferable and nonforfeitable Shares acquired on the date of exercise over the exercise price. Upon exercise of an SAR, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair market value of the freely transferable and nonforfeitable Shares received. 
Upon a disposition of Shares acquired upon exercise of an ISO before the end of the applicable ISO holding periods, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the Shares at the date of exercise of the ISO minus the exercise price, or (ii) the amount realized upon the disposition of the ISO Shares minus the exercise price. Otherwise, a participant's disposition of Shares acquired upon the exercise of an option (including an ISO for which the ISO holding periods are met) generally will result in capital gain or loss measured by the excess of the sale price over the participant's tax basis in such Shares (the tax basis generally being the exercise price plus any amount previously recognized as ordinary income in connection with the exercise of the option). 
Capital One generally will be entitled to a tax deduction equal to the amount recognized as ordinary income by the participant in connection with an option or SAR. Capital One generally is not entitled to a tax deduction relating to amounts that represent a capital gain to a participant. Accordingly, Capital One will not be entitled to any tax deduction with respect to an ISO if the participant holds the Shares in satisfaction of the ISO holding periods prior to disposition of the Shares. 
With respect to Awards other than options and SARs involving the issuance of Shares or other property that is restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the Shares or other property received at the first time the Shares or other property become transferable or no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. Under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan, a participant may be permitted or required to elect to be taxed at the time of receipt of Shares or other property rather than upon lapse of restrictions on transferability or substantial risk of forfeiture, but if the participant subsequently forfeits such Shares or property, the participant would not be entitled to any tax deduction, including as a capital loss, for the value of the Shares or property on which he or she previously paid tax. In such case, the participant must file any such election with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the Shares or other property. Capital One generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
With respect to Awards other than options and SARs granted under the Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Plan that result in the payment or issuance of cash or Shares or other property that is either not restricted as to transferability or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the participant must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair market value of Shares or other property received. Any deferral of the time of payment or issuance will generally result in the deferral of the time the participant will be liable for income taxes with respect to such payment or issuance. Capital One generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. 
Awards that are granted, accelerated or enhanced upon the occurrence of a change of control may give rise, in whole or in part, to "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Code Section 280G and, to such extent, will be non-deductible by Capital One and subject to a 20% excise tax by the participant.

Section XIII - Stockholder Proposal Requesting Stockholders' Right to Act by Written Consent 
(Item 5 on Proxy Card) 
Capital One has been notified that John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, intends to present a proposal for consideration at the Annual Meeting (the "Stockholder Proposal") that addresses stockholders' right to act by written consent. Mr. Chevedden has submitted documentation indicated that he is the beneficial owner of no fewer than 100 shares of Capital One common stock. The resolution being submitted by Mr. Chevedden to the stockholders for approval, if properly presented, is as follows: 
Proposal 5 - Right to Act by Written Consent 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written consent. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if most shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice. 
Our higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting (which may be unreachable due to time constraints and detailed technical requirements) is one more reason that we should have the right to act by written consent. 
Shareholder proposals such as this have taken a leadership role to improve the corporate governance rules of our company. For instance after Capital One received shareholder proposals Capital One then adopted better practices such as a rudimentary version of a shareholder right to call a special meeting (2015) and shareholder proxy access (2016). 
On the other hand the Capital One Board of Directors took a leadership role in the opposite direction. Under the leadership of Ann Fritz Hackett, who chaired the Capital One governance committee and who has been our Lead Director for 12-years, Capital One hired an outside law firm in 2018 with an annual business of more than $1 billion to prevent Capital One shareholders from even voting on improving our rudimentary version of a shareholder right to call a special meeting. Page one of this link lists the name of the outside law firm: https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cf-noaction/14a-8/2018/cheveddencapital022118-14a8.pdf 
Such counterproductive action may not seem to be surprising when one considers that Ms. Hackett (our Lead Director for 12 years) also chaired the corporate governance committee of Fortune Brands Home & Security Inc (FBHS). Fortune Brands has no shareholder right to call a special meeting and no shareholder right to act by written consent. Meanwhile the Fortune Brands stock price fell from $64 to $42 in the year leading up to November 2018. 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is better overseen by a more qualified and focused board. 
Please vote yes:

 CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION          2019 PROXY STATEMENT         117   
[END TABLE]
Statement in Opposition to the Stockholder Proposal 
Capital One already provides stockholders with a meaningful right to act in between annual meetings, and accordingly the Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote "AGAINST" the Stockholder Proposal. The Board believes the proposed change requested by the Stockholder Proposal is not necessary in Capital One's circumstances given our current governance practices and structures – including the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, our adoption of a standard proxy access right, and our strong year-around stockholder engagement practices – and is not in the best interests of our stockholders because it does not provide for an orderly and transparent discussion of all of our stockholders' views on a topic. 
In the Board's view, the Stockholder Proposal is not in the best interests of stockholders because action at a stockholder meeting (whether annual or special), supports stockholders' interests more than action by written consent. The Board believes matters sufficiently important to require a stockholder vote should be the subject of a stockholder meeting, which provides all stockholders with advance notice, the benefits of a well-structured process and publicly filed proxy materials, and the opportunity to consider and discuss the merits of a proposed action prior to a vote. Our governing documents ensure that all stockholders are provided with minimum advance notice and an opportunity to participate in determining any action subject to a stockholder vote. The Stockholder Proposal, however, does not provide for any of these protections. Thus, implementation of the Stockholder Proposal would mean that short-term or special interest stockholders could use the written consent procedure without providing advance notice or information to all stockholders on important pending stockholder actions, depriving many stockholders of the opportunity to engage in a transparent discussion and to exchange views with the Board and each other before stockholder action is taken. In addition, actions by written consent can cause confusion with multiple written consents being circulated that may be duplicative or contradictory. The vast majority of Capital One's peer companies (9 out of 12, as of February 2019) and S&P 500 companies (70% of the 469 S&P 500 companies surveyed by FactSet as of February 2019) do not provide stockholders with the right to act by written consent (or limit its use to unanimous written consent), for similar reasons. See page 76 of this proxy statement for Capital One's peer comparator group. 
The Board believes implementation of the Stockholder Proposal is unnecessary in light of Capital One's existing stockholder-friendly governance practices and structures. Capital One's robust corporate governance structures empower our stockholders, promote accountability and oversight and provide stockholders with an opportunity to express their views. These features include an annually elected Board; a proxy access right with standard terms; a majority voting standard for election of directors in uncontested elections; and independent Board leadership through a strong and active Lead Independent Director and independent committee chairs for key committees. In addition, a similar proposal to this Stockholder Proposal was voted on by our stockholders in 2017 and did not receive majority stockholder support, and in our ongoing engagement with stockholders since then, stockholders have not raised the right to act by written consent as a matter of significant concern. 
With respect to matters requiring stockholder action, either Capital One or its stockholders may present items for consideration at an annual or special meeting of the stockholders. Under our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, stockholders may propose business for a stockholder vote at our annual meeting by following the procedures set forth in our governing documents and stockholders owning at least 25% of the Company's voting stock (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation) may require the Company to call a special meeting of the stockholders in between annual meetings. The threshold, which was ratified by our stockholders last proxy season, allows for stockholders who represent a significant financial stake in our Company to call a special meeting and protects against a small minority of stockholders utilizing the mechanism of a special meeting for their own special interests, which may not be shared more broadly by stockholders of the Company. Capital One is dedicated to strong and effective corporate governance principles that promote the long-term interests of our stockholders, allow for responsible decision-making and accountability, and foster a culture that reflects the Company's high standards of independence, transparency and stockholder rights. The Board believes the governance practices and structures described above reflect our commitment to carefully consider corporate governance standards that operate for the benefit of all stockholders. 
Capital One's ongoing dialogue with stockholders also provides an open, transparent, and constructive forum for our stockholders to raise their concerns. As described more fully in this proxy statement under "Stockholder Engagement Program" on page 31, we proactively engage with our investors, including twice each

 year with their corporate governance representatives, who collectively own a significant percentage of our outstanding stock to ensure we are receiving feedback focused on important corporate governance matters and issues. This is in addition to our year-around engagement practices with our investors on business-related matters. Capital One values the input and insights of our stockholders and is committed to continued engagement with our investors. The wide breadth of our stockholder engagement activities gives our stockholders a variety of methods for communicating with management and the Board, and enables management and our Board to consider and effectively address the issues that matter most to our stockholders. 
In sum, we believe that implementation of this Stockholder Proposal is unnecessary, in light of Capital One's existing governance practices and structures combined with our ongoing dialogue with our stockholders, and is not in the best interests of our stockholders.

Section XIV - Other Business 
As of the date of this proxy statement, we know of no business that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Stockholder Meeting other than the items referred to above. If other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card will vote such proxy at their discretion. 
Capital One's Annual Report to Stockholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including consolidated financial statements, is being furnished along with this proxy statement to Capital One's stockholders of record. The Annual Report to Stockholders does not constitute a part of the proxy soliciting material. A copy of the Annual Report, as well as Capital One's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 ("Form 10-K") may be obtained without charge at the Annual Stockholder Meeting, at our website at www.capitalone.com under "About," then "Investors," or by contacting our Investor Relations department at Capital One's address set forth on the Notice. The Form 10-K, which is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), may also be obtained at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. 
To be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials for Capital One's 2020 Annual Stockholder Meeting ("Capital One's 2020 Annual Meeting"), stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and stockholder director nominations submitted pursuant to the proxy access provisions of our Bylaws must be received by Capital One's Corporate Secretary at the address on the Notice of Annual Stockholder Meeting no later than November 21, 2019 (and in the case of proxy access director candidates no earlier than October 22, 2019). Stockholders submitting proposals pursuant to Rule 14a-8 or submitting proxy access director candidates must also satisfy other procedural and qualification requirements set forth in Rule 14a-8 and our Bylaws, respectively. The submission of a stockholder proposal or proxy access nomination does not guarantee that it will be included in our proxy statement. 
Under our Bylaws, if you wish to present a stockholder proposal other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 or nominate a director candidate other than pursuant to our proxy access Bylaw provisions, then to be timely for consideration at Capital One's 2020 Annual Meeting, you must give proper written notice of such proposal and of such nomination to the Corporate Secretary no earlier than January 3, 2020, and no later than February 2, 2020.

Your notice must include the information specified in our Bylaws concerning the proposal or nominee. Our Bylaws set forth the information that must be furnished to the Corporate Secretary in order for any such notice to be proper. A copy of our Bylaws may be obtained from the Corporate Secretary at Capital One's address on the Notice of Annual Stockholder Meeting.

Section XV - Frequently Asked Questions 
Why did I receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials? 
Pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are furnishing the proxy materials to our stockholders via the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. This process allows us to expedite our stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs of printing and mailing the proxy materials and reduce the environmental impact of Capital One's 2019 Annual Stockholder Meeting ("Annual Meeting"). Accordingly, on March 20, 2019, we began sending our stockholders a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice"). If you received a Notice, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request one. The Notice provides instructions on how to access the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting via the Internet, how to request a printed set of proxy materials and how to vote your shares. 
What is the purpose of the proxy materials? 
The Board of Directors of Capital One ("Board of Directors" or "Board") is providing you these materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting. All stockholders who held shares of Capital One common stock as of the close of business on March 5, 2019 ("Record Date") are entitled to attend the Annual Meeting and to vote on the items of business outlined in this proxy statement. Whether or not you choose to attend the Annual Meeting in person, you may vote your shares via the Internet, by telephone or by mail. 
How do I access the proxy materials? 
The Notice provides instructions regarding how to view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting online. As explained in greater detail in the Notice, to view the proxy materials and to vote, you will need to visit www.proxyvote.com and have available your control number(s) contained in your Notice. 
How do I request paper copies of the proxy materials? 
You may request paper copies of the 2019 proxy materials by following the instructions at www.proxyvote.com, by calling 1-800-579-1639 or by sending an e-mail to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. 
What is the difference between a record holder and a holder of shares in street name? 
You are a record holder if you hold shares of Capital One common stock directly in your name through Capital One's transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. 
If you hold shares of Capital One common stock through a broker, bank, trust or other nominee, then you are a holder of shares in street name. As a result, you must instruct the broker, bank, trust or other nominee about how to vote your shares. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), if you do not provide such instructions, the firm that holds your shares will have discretionary authority to vote your shares only with respect to "routine" matters, as described below. 
Can I attend the Annual Meeting? 
If you held shares of Capital One common stock as of the Record Date, you may attend the Annual Meeting. Because seating is limited, only you and one guest may attend the meeting. Admission to the meeting is on a first-come, first-served basis. Registration begins at 9:00 a.m. You must present a valid government-issued picture identification and proof of Capital One stock ownership as of the Record Date. If you hold Capital One stock in street name, you must also bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date. Stockholders of record also may be represented by another person at the Annual Meeting by executing a legal proxy designating that person as the proxy holder. Each stockholder may appoint only one proxy holder or representative to attend the Annual Meeting on his or her behalf. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices are not permitted. If you require special assistance at the meeting because of a disability, please contact the Corporate Secretary at Capital One's address in the Notice. 
Am I entitled to vote? 
You are entitled to vote if you were the record holder of shares of Capital One common stock as of the Record Date. All stockholders of record are entitled to one vote per share of common stock held for each matter submitted for a vote at the meeting.

How many votes can be cast by all stockholders? 
A total of 469,344,331 votes, consisting of one vote for each share of Capital One common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date. 
How do I vote? 
In Person 
In addition to complying with the requirements described under "Can I attend the Annual Meeting?" above, if you are a record holder, you must fill out a ballot at the meeting, and if you are a street name holder, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank, trust or other nominee and present it to the inspector of elections with your ballot to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting. To request a legal proxy, please follow the instructions at www.proxyvote.com. 
By Internet 
You may vote via the Internet by going to www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions on the screen. Have your Notice, proxy card (for record holders) or voting instruction form (for holders of shares in street name) available when you access the web page. 
By Telephone 
You may vote by telephone by calling the toll-free telephone number on the proxy card (1-800-690-6903), which is available 24 hours a day, and following the prerecorded instructions. Have your proxy card available when you call. If you hold your shares in street name, follow the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. 
By Mail 
If you received your proxy materials by mail, you may vote by mail by completing the enclosed proxy card, dating and signing it and returning it in the postage-paid envelope provided or returning it to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge"), Vote Processing, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. If you hold your shares in street name, follow the voting instructions you receive from your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee. 
Time for Voting Your Shares By Internet, By Telephone or By Mail 
You may vote via the Internet or by telephone until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 1, 2019. If you vote by mail, your proxy card or voting instruction form, as applicable, must be received by May 1, 2019. If you own shares of Capital One through the Capital One Associate Savings Plan (Capital One Stock Fund) or Hibernia Corporation Supplemental Stock Plan, see "How do I vote my 401(k) shares?" below for more information. 
What if I hold my shares in street name and I do not provide my broker, bank, trustee or other nominee with instructions about how to vote my shares? 
You may instruct your broker, bank, trustee or other nominee on how to vote your shares using the methods described above. If you do not vote via the Internet or by telephone and do not return your voting instructions to the firm that holds your shares prior to the Annual Meeting, the firm has discretion to vote your shares only with respect to Item 2 (ratification of selection of independent registered public accounting firm), which is considered a "routine" matter under NYSE rules. Item 1 (election of members of the Board of Directors), Item 3 (advisory approval of 2018 Named Executive Officer compensation), Item 4 (approval and adoption of Fifth Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan), and Item 5 (stockholder proposal) are not considered "routine" matters, and the firm that holds your shares will not have discretionary authority to vote your shares for these Items if you do not provide instructions using one of the methods described above. Therefore, you are encouraged to return your voting instructions so that your shares are voted for non-routine matters at the Annual Meeting. If you hold shares in several accounts, you must provide voting instructions for each account to authorize all of your shares to be voted. 
How do I vote my 401(k) shares? 
If you own shares of Capital One through the Capital One Associate Savings Plan (Capital One Stock Fund) or Hibernia Corporation Supplemental Stock Plan, you may vote the number of shares equivalent

 to your interest in the Capital One as credited to your account on the Record Date. You will receive instructions on how to vote your shares via e-mail from Broadridge. The trustee of the Capital One Associate Savings Plan and the Hibernia Corporation Supplemental Stock Plan will vote your shares in accordance with your duly executed instructions if they are received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 29, 2019. If you do not send instructions, the trustee will not vote the share equivalents credited to your account. 
Can I revoke my proxy or change my vote? 
Yes, you may revoke any proxy that you previously granted or change your vote by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    submitting another timely vote via the Internet, by telephone or by mailing a new proxy card or voting instruction form;   
∎    attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, as indicated above under How do I vote?; or   
∎    if you are a record holder, giving written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary, Capital One Financial  Corporation, 1600 Capital One Drive, McLean, VA 22102.  
[END TABLE]
Your new vote or revocation must be submitted in accordance with the timeframes above under "Time for Voting Your Shares By Internet, By Telephone or By Mail." 
What constitutes a quorum? 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to transact business at the Annual Meeting. A quorum exists if the holders of a majority of the voting power of Capital One's outstanding shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors are present in person or represented by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted in determining if there is a quorum, but neither will be counted as votes cast. 
What is a broker non-vote? 
Under NYSE rules, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not submit voting instructions to the firm that holds your shares, the firm has discretionary authority to vote your shares only with respect to "routine" matters. For non-routine matters, which include the election of directors and Items 3, 4 and 5, if you do not submit voting instructions, the firm that holds your shares will not have discretion to vote your shares. This is called a "broker non-vote." 
Who will count the vote? 
Votes will be tabulated by Broadridge. The Board of Directors has appointed a representative of American Election Services, LLC to serve as the Inspector of Elections. 
Will a list of stockholders be made available? 
Capital One will make a list of stockholders available at the Annual Meeting and, for ten days prior to the meeting, at our offices at 1600 Capital One Drive in McLean, Virginia. Please contact Capital One's Corporate Secretary at (703) 720-1000 if you wish to inspect the list of stockholders prior to the Annual Meeting. 
How much did the solicitation cost? 
Capital One will pay the costs of the solicitation. We have retained Morrow Sodali to assist us in the solicitation of proxies for an aggregate fee of $12,500, plus reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. In addition to Capital One soliciting proxies via the Internet, by telephone and by mail, our directors, officers and associates may solicit proxies on our behalf, without additional compensation. 
What is "householding?" 
Under SEC rules, a single package of Notices may be sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family unless contrary instructions have been received. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate Notice within the package. This procedure, referred to as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate materials stockholders receive and reduces mailing expenses. Stockholders may revoke their consent to future householding mailings or enroll in householding by contacting Broadridge toll free at 1-866-540-7095 or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Capital One will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy was delivered. Stockholders who wish to receive a separate set of proxy materials now should contact Broadridge at the same phone number or mailing address.

Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered "votes cast" and thus do not have an effect on the outcome of the vote as to Items 1, 2, 3 and 5. With respect to Item 4, because the NYSE rules for equity compensation plans apply, which treat abstentions as "votes cast," abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered "votes cast" and thus will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on Item 4.

Appendix A – Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Our Compensation Committee believes that certain measures not defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), including adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted efficiency ratio, return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, help investors and users of our financial information understand the effect of adjusting items on our selected reported results and provide alternate measurements of our performance. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are reviewed by the Compensation Committee and the other independent members of our Board of Directors as part of their assessment of the Company's performance. While certain of our non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. The following tables present reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the applicable amounts measured in accordance with GAAP.

In addition, the Committee shall have the authority to determine whether to treat the service of a Participant who ceases to be an Associate but continues to be a Director or Third Party Service Provider as a continuation of Participant's employment relationship or as a termination of employment for purposes of the Plan or any outstanding Award. 
Unless the Committee determines otherwise, if a Participant is employed by, or provides services as a Third Party Service Provider to, an entity that ceases to be an Affiliate or a Subsidiary as the result of a corporate event or transaction, for purposes of any Award under the Plan, such Participant shall be deemed to have had his or her employment or services as a Third Party Service Provider terminated by the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries at the time of such cessation.

The Committee shall also make appropriate adjustments in the terms of any Awards under the Plan to reflect or related to such corporate events or transactions, changes or distributions and to modify any other terms of outstanding Awards, including modifications of performance goals and changes in the length of Performance Periods. The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding upon Participants, the Company, and all other interested persons. 
Subject to the provisions of Article 17, without affecting the number of Shares reserved or available hereunder, the Committee may authorize under the Plan the issuance of Awards or the assumption of awards granted under plans of other entities in connection with any merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, or reorganization upon such terms and conditions as it may deem appropriate, subject to compliance with the ISO rules under Section 422 of the Code, where applicable, and any other applicable laws or stock exchange rules.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein (including without limitation Section 20.11), in lieu of making Awards directly to Associates, Directors or Third Party Service Providers under the Plan, the Committee may make Awards under the Plan through or to a trust or other funding vehicle which in turn makes Awards to Participants or which issues interests in Awards held by it to Participants, in any case on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.

Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant Options in satisfaction of the Company's obligation to issue stock options pursuant to stock options with reload features granted under the Prior Plans. 
6.2 Award Agreement. Each Option grant shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Option Price, the maximum duration of the Option, the number of Shares to which the Option pertains, the conditions upon which an Option shall become vested and exercisable (including the effect, if any, of a Change of Control, death, Disability or Retirement), the Date of Grant and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine. The Award Agreement also shall specify whether the Option is intended to be an ISO or a NQSO. 
6.3 Option Price. The Option Price for each grant of an Option shall be as determined by the Committee and shall be specified in the Award Agreement. The Option Price may include (but not be limited to) an Option Price based on one hundred percent (100%) of the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, an Option Price that is set at a premium to the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, or is indexed to the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, with the index determined by the Committee, in its discretion; provided, however, the Option Price must be at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant. 
6.4 Duration of Options.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, for Options granted to Participants outside the United States, the Committee has the authority to grant Options that have a term greater than ten (10) years. 
6.5 Limitations on Grant of Incentive Stock Options. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  The aggregate Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock with respect to which "incentive stock options"  (within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code) are exercisable for the first time by a Participant during any Plan Year under the Plan and any other stock incentive plan of the Company shall not exceed $100,000. Such Fair Market Value shall be  determined as of the date on which each such incentive stock option is granted. In the event that the aggregate Fair Market Value of Shares with respect to such incentive stock options exceeds $100,000, then Incentive Stock Options granted hereunder  to such Participant shall, to the extent and in the order required by regulations promulgated under the Code (or any other authority having the force of regulations), automatically be deemed to be NQSOs, but all other terms and provisions of such  Incentive Stock Options shall remain unchanged.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  No Incentive Stock Option may be granted to an individual if, at the time of the proposed grant, such individual owns  stock possessing more than ten percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any "parent" or "subsidiaries" (within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code), unless (i) the Option  Price of such Incentive Stock Option is at least one hundred and ten percent (110%) of the Fair Market Value of a Share at the time such Incentive Stock Option is granted and (ii) such Incentive Stock Option is not exercisable after the  expiration of five (5) years from the date such Incentive Stock Option is granted.  
[END TABLE]

6.7 Payment. Options granted under this Article 6 shall be exercised by the delivery of a notice of exercise to the Company or an agent designated by the Company in a form specified or accepted by the Committee, or by complying with any alternative procedures which may be authorized by the Committee, setting forth the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is to be exercised, accompanied by full payment for the Shares. 
A condition of the issuance of the Shares as to which an Option shall be exercised shall be the payment of the Option Price. The Option Price of any Option shall be payable to the Company in full either: (a) in cash or its equivalent; (b) by tendering (either by actual delivery or attestation) previously acquired Shares having an aggregate Fair Market Value at the time of exercise equal to the Option Price; (c) by a combination of (a) and (b); (d) a cashless (broker-assisted) exercise in accordance with procedures approved by the Committee; or (e) any other method approved or accepted by the Committee in its sole discretion.

Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, all payments under all of the methods indicated above shall be paid in United States dollars. 
6.8 Restrictions on Share Transferability. The Committee may impose such restrictions on any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an Option granted under this Article 6 as it may deem advisable, including, without limitation, minimum holding period requirements, restrictions under applicable federal securities laws, under the requirements of any stock exchange or market upon which such Shares are then listed and/or traded, or under any blue sky or state securities laws applicable to such Shares. 
6.9 Termination of Employment or Service. Each Participant's Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the Option following termination of the Participant's employment or provision of services as a Director or Third Party Service Provider to the Company, its Affiliates and/or Subsidiaries, as the case may be. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the Award Agreement entered into with each Participant, need not be uniform among all Options issued pursuant to this Article 6, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination. 
6.10 Transferability of Options. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Incentive Stock Options. No ISO granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or  otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  Nonqualified Stock Options. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise  determined at any time by the Committee, no NQSO granted under this Article 6 may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution; provided that the  Board or Committee may permit further transferability, on a general or a specific basis, and may impose conditions and limitations on any permitted transferability. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or  otherwise at any time by the Committee, or unless the Board or Committee decides to permit further transferability, all NQSOs granted to a Participant under this Article 6 shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant.  With respect to those NQSOs, if any, that are permitted to be transferred to another person, references in the Plan to exercise or payment of the Option Price by the Participant shall be deemed to include, as determined by the Committee, the  Participant's permitted transferee.  
[END TABLE]
6.11 Notification of Disqualifying Disposition. If any Participant shall make any disposition of Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of an ISO under the circumstances described in Section 421(b) of the Code (relating to certain disqualifying dispositions), such Participant shall notify the Company of such disposition within ten (10) days thereof. 
6.12 Substituting SARs. Regardless of the terms of any Award Agreement, the Committee shall have the right to substitute SARs for outstanding Options granted to any Participant, provided the substituted SARs call for settlement by the issuance of Shares, and the terms of the substituted SARs and economic benefit of such substituted SARs are at least equivalent to the terms and economic benefit of the Options being replaced. 
Article 7. Stock Appreciation Rights 
7.1 Grant of SARs. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, SARs may be granted to Participants at any time and from time to time as shall be determined by the Committee. The Committee may grant Freestanding SARs, Tandem SARs, or any combination of these forms of SARs. 
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan, the Committee shall have complete discretion in determining the number of SARs granted to each Participant and, consistent with the provisions of the Plan, in determining the terms and conditions pertaining to such SARs. Any SAR granted in connection with an Option may be granted at

[END TABLE]
 the same time as its related Option is granted or at any time prior to the exercise, expiration or cancellation of its related Option. 
The Grant Price for each grant of a Freestanding SAR shall be determined by the Committee and shall be specified in the Award Agreement. The Grant Price may include (but not be limited to) a Grant Price based on one hundred percent (100%) of the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, a Grant Price that is set at a premium to the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, or is indexed to the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant, with the index determined by the Committee, in its discretion; provided, however, the Grant Price must be at least equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the FMV of the Shares on the Date of Grant. The Grant Price of Tandem SARs shall be equal to the Option Price of the related Option. 
7.2 SAR Agreement. Each SAR shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement that shall specify the Grant Price, the term of the SAR, and such other provisions as the Committee shall determine (including the effect, if any, of a Change of Control, death, Disability or Retirement). 
7.3 Term of SAR. The term of an SAR granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion; provided, however, that the Committee may extend the term of any SAR that would otherwise expire at a time when the Participant is not permitted by applicable law or Company policy to exercise such SAR; provided, further, except as determined otherwise by the Committee and specified in the SAR Award Agreement, no SAR shall be exercisable later than the tenth (10th) anniversary of its Date of Grant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for SARs granted to Participants outside the United States, the Committee has the authority to grant SARs that have a term greater than ten (10) years. 
7.4 Exercise of Freestanding SARs. Freestanding SARs may be exercised upon whatever terms and conditions the Committee, in its sole discretion, imposes, including a requirement that a Freestanding SAR be exercised only at the same time as a related Option. 
7.5 Exercise of Tandem SARs. Tandem SARs may be exercised with respect to all or part of the Shares subject to the related Option upon the surrender of the right to exercise the equivalent portion of the related Option. A Tandem SAR may be exercised only with respect to the Shares for which its related Option is then exercisable. 
Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, with respect to a Tandem SAR granted in connection with an ISO: (a) the Tandem SAR will expire no later than the expiration of the underlying ISO; (b) the value of the payout with respect to the Tandem SAR may be for no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the difference between the Option Price of the underlying ISO and the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the underlying ISO at the time the Tandem SAR is exercised; and (c) the Tandem SAR may be exercised only when the Fair Market Value of the Shares subject to the ISO exceeds the Option Price of the ISO. 
7.6 Payment of SAR Amount. Upon the exercise of an SAR, a Participant shall be entitled to receive payment from the Company in an amount determined by multiplying: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  The excess of the Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of exercise over the Grant Price; by  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  The number of Shares with respect to which the SAR is exercised.  
[END TABLE]
At the discretion of the Committee, the payment upon SAR exercise may be in cash, Shares, or any combination thereof, or in any other manner approved by the Committee in its sole discretion. The Committee's determination regarding the form of SAR payout shall be set forth in the Award Agreement pertaining to the grant of the SAR; provided, however, that the Committee may reserve the right to determine the form of such payout at any time subsequent to the grant, at which time it will give notice to the Participant. 
7.7 Termination of Employment or Service. Each Award Agreement shall set forth the extent to which the Participant shall have the right to exercise the SAR following termination of the Participant's employment with or provision of services as a Director or Third Party Service Provider to the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries, as the case may be. Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, shall be included in the Award Agreement entered into with Participants, need not be uniform among all SARs issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination. 
7.8 Nontransferability of SARs. Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise at any time by the Committee, no SAR granted under the Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or

 otherwise alienated or hypothecated, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. Further, except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Award Agreement or otherwise determined at any time by the Committee, all SARs granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be exercisable during his or her lifetime only by such Participant. With respect to those SARs, if any, that are permitted to be transferred to another person, references in the Plan to exercise of the SAR by the Participant or payment of any amount to the Participant shall be deemed to include, as determined by the Committee, the Participant's permitted transferee. 
7.9 Other Restrictions. The Committee shall impose such other conditions and/or restrictions on any Shares received upon exercise of an SAR granted pursuant to the Plan as it may deem advisable or desirable. These restrictions may include, but shall not be limited to, a requirement that the Participant hold the Shares received upon exercise of an SAR for a specified period of time. 
Article 8. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
8.1 Grant of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Plan, the Committee, at any time and from time to time, may grant Shares of Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units to Participants in such amounts as the Committee shall determine. Restricted Stock Units shall be similar to Restricted Stock except that no Shares are actually awarded to the Participant on the Date of Grant. 
8.2 Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.

All rights with respect to the Restricted Stock and/or Restricted Stock Units granted to a Participant under the Plan shall be available during his or her lifetime only to such Participant, except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or at any time by the Committee. 
8.4 Other Restrictions.

To the extent deemed appropriate by the Committee, if such certificates are issued at the time of grant, the Company may retain the certificates representing Shares of Restricted Stock in the Company's possession until such time as all conditions and/or restrictions applicable to such Shares have been satisfied or lapse. 
Except as otherwise provided in this Article 8, Shares of Restricted Stock covered by each Restricted Stock Award shall become freely transferable by the Participant after all conditions and restrictions applicable to such Shares have been satisfied or lapse (including satisfaction of any applicable tax withholding obligations), and Restricted Stock Units shall be settled in cash, Shares, or a combination of cash and Shares as the Committee, in its sole discretion shall determine.

Article 12. Annual Incentive Pool Awards 
12.1 Establishment of Incentive Pool. The Committee may designate Associates who are eligible to receive a monetary payment in any Plan Year based on a percentage of an incentive pool equal to the greater of: (i) three percent (3%) of the Company's Consolidated Operating Earnings for the Plan Year, (ii) twenty percent (20%) of the Company's Operating Cash Flow for the Plan Year, or (iii) five percent (5%) of the Company's Net Income for the Plan Year. At the beginning of the Plan Year, the Committee shall allocate an incentive pool percentage to each participating Associate for each Plan Year. In no event may (1) the incentive pool percentage for any one participating Associate exceed fifty percent (50%) of the total pool, (2) the sum of the incentive pool percentages for all participating Associates exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the total pool or (3) the monetary payment for any one participating Associate exceed $10 million. 
12.2 Determination of Participating Associates' Portions. As soon as possible after the determination of the incentive pool for a Plan Year, the Committee shall calculate each participating Associate's allocated portion of the incentive pool based upon the percentage established at the beginning of the Plan Year. Each participating Associate's Annual Incentive Pool Award then shall be determined by the Committee based on the participating Associate's allocated portion of the incentive pool subject to adjustment in the sole discretion of the Committee. The Committee shall retain the discretion to adjust all such Annual Incentive Pool Awards downward and provide for such other terms as it feels necessary or appropriate (including the effect, if any, of a Change of Control, death, Disability or Retirement). 
Article 13. Dividend Equivalents 
In the discretion of the Committee, any Participant selected by the Committee may be granted dividend equivalents based on the dividends declared on Shares that are subject to any Award during the period between the date the Award is granted and the date the Award is exercised, vests, pays out or expires. Such dividend equivalents may be awarded or paid in the form of cash, Shares, Restricted Stock, or Restricted Stock Units, or a combination, and shall be determined by such formula and at such time and subject to such accrual, forfeiture, or payout restrictions or limitations as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion. In no event shall dividend equivalents be granted with respect to Options or SARs. In addition, dividend equivalents granted with respect to Performance Shares or Performance Units shall not be distributed during the Performance Period or to the extent any such Award is otherwise unearned. 
Article 14. Beneficiary Designation 
Each Participant under the Plan may, from time to time, name any beneficiary or beneficiaries (who may be named contingently or successively) to whom any benefit under the Plan is to be paid in case of his or her death before he or she receives any or all of such benefit. Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant's lifetime. In the absence of any such designation, benefits remaining unpaid at the Participant's death shall be paid to the Participant's estate. 
Article 15. Deferrals 
The Committee may permit or require a Participant to defer such Participant's receipt of the payment of cash or the delivery of Shares that would otherwise be due to such Participant by virtue of the lapse or waiver of restrictions with respect to Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units, or the satisfaction of any requirements or performance goals with respect to Performance Shares, Performance Units, Cash-Based Awards, Other Stock-Based Awards and Annual Incentive Pool Awards. If any such deferral is required or permitted, the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, establish rules and procedures for such payment or Share delivery deferrals and any notional earnings to be credited on such deferred amounts, provided that in the case of any Award intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation," as such term was defined in Code Section 162(m) on December 21, 2017, such earnings shall be in compliance with Code Section 162(m).

Article 16. Rights of Participants 
16.1 Employment; Services. Nothing in the Plan or an Award Agreement shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries, to terminate any Participant's employment or service as a Director or Third Party Service Provider at any time or for any reason not prohibited by law, nor confer upon any Participant any right to continue his or her employment or service as a Director or Third Party Service Provider for any specified period of time. 
Neither an Award nor any rights arising under the Plan shall constitute an employment contract with the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries and, accordingly, subject to Articles 3 and 17, the Plan and any Award hereunder may be terminated at any time in the sole and exclusive discretion of the Committee without giving rise to any liability on the part of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries. 
16.2 Participation. No individual shall have the right to be selected to receive an Award under the Plan, or, having been so selected, to be selected to receive a future Award.

Article 17. Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination 
17.1 Amendment, Modification, Suspension, and Termination; No Repricings. Subject to Section 17.3, the Committee may, at any time and from time to time, alter, amend, modify, suspend, or terminate the Plan and any Award Agreement in whole or in part; provided, however, that no amendment of the Plan or an Award shall be made without shareholder approval if shareholder approval is required by law, regulation, or stock exchange rule. Furthermore, other than in connection with a change in the Company's capitalization (as described in Section 4.4), the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, reduce the Option Price or Grant Price of a previously awarded Option or Stock Appreciation Right and, at any time when the Option Price or Grant Price of the previously awarded Option or Stock Appreciation Right is above the Fair Market Value of a Share, the Committee shall not, without stockholder approval, cancel and re-grant or exchange such Option or Stock Appreciation Right for cash or a new Award with a lower (or no) Option Price or Grant Price or take any other action that would be considered a repricing for purposes of US generally accepted accounting practices or any applicable stock exchange rule. 
17.2 Adjustment of Awards Upon the Occurrence of Certain Unusual or Nonrecurring Events. The Committee may make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the performance criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 4.4 hereof) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under the Plan. The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding upon Participants, the Company, and all other interested persons. 
17.3 Awards Previously Granted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary (other than the provisos of Section 17.1  regarding shareholder approval), no termination, amendment, suspension, or modification of the Plan or an Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under the Plan, without the written consent of the  Participant holding such Award; provided, however, that the Committee may terminate any Award previously granted and any Award Agreement relating thereto in whole or in part provided that upon any such termination the Company in full consideration  of the termination of (i) any Option outstanding under the Plan (whether or not vested or exercisable) or portion thereof pays to such Participant an amount in cash for each Share subject to such Option or portion thereof being terminated equal  to the excess, if any, of (a) the value at which a Share received pursuant to the exercise of such Option would have been valued by the Company at that time for purposes of determining applicable withholding taxes or other similar statutory  amounts, over (b) the Option Price, or, if the Committee permits and the Participant elects, accelerates the exercisability of such Participant's Option or portion thereof (if necessary) and allows such Participant thirty (30) days to  exercise such

  (b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary (other than the provisos of Section 17.1  regarding shareholder approval), the Committee may authorize the repurchase of any Award by the Company at any time for such price and on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine in its sole discretion, provided, however, that,  without the prior approval of the Company's shareholders, the Committee may not permit repurchase by the Company of Options or SARs with an Option Price or Grant Price, respectively, above the Fair Market Value of the Shares at the time of such  repurchase.  
[END TABLE]
Article 18. Withholding 
18.1 Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes or similar charges, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of or in connection with the Plan or any Award. 
18.2 Share Withholding. With respect to withholding required upon the exercise of Options or SARs, upon the lapse of restrictions on Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units, or upon the achievement of performance goals related to Performance Shares, or any other taxable event arising as a result of or in connection with an Award granted hereunder, Participants may elect, subject to the approval of the Committee, or the Committee may require the Participant, to satisfy the withholding requirement, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax withholding obligation is to be determined equal to the amount required to be withheld, using the applicable statutory withholding rate or, to the extent determined by the Committee or its delegate, in its sole discretion, another tax withholding rate not exceeding the maximum applicable rate. Any and all such Participant elections to withhold shall be irrevocable, made in writing, and signed by the Participant, and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate. Any and all such Committee requirements to withhold shall either be set forth in the Award Agreement or otherwise communicated to the Participant by notice subsequent to the time of grant and shall be subject to any restrictions or limitations that the Committee, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.

20.11 Unfunded Plan. Except as provided in Section 5.3 herein: (a) Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company, its Subsidiaries, and/or Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under the Plan; (b) nothing contained in the Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other person; (c) to the extent that any person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company, its Subsidiaries, and/or Affiliates under the Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be; and (d) all payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in the Plan. The Plan is not subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. 
20.12 No Fractional Shares. No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Award. The Committee shall determine whether cash, Awards, or other property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
20.13 Retirement and Welfare Plans. Neither Awards made under the Plan nor Shares or cash paid pursuant to such Awards will be included as "compensation" for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under the Company's or any Subsidiary's or Affiliate's retirement plans (both qualified and non-qualified) or welfare benefit plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation shall be taken into account in computing a participant's benefit or except as the Committee may otherwise determine in its discretion. 
20.16 Nonexclusivity of the Plan. Neither the adoption of the Plan nor the grant of any Award shall be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or Committee to adopt such other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any Participant. 
20.17 No Constraint on Corporate Action. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to: (a) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company's or a Subsidiary's or an Affiliate's right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or, (b) limit the right or power of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate. 
20.18 Governing Law. The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of the Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, recipients of an Award under the Plan are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Delaware to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to the Plan or any related Award Agreement.
