PROXY STATEMENT
SOLICITATION AND REVOCATION OF PROXIES
The following information is furnished in connection with the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Barnwell Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), to be held on March 4, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Hawaii Standard Time, in Suite 210, Alakea Corporate Tower, 1100 Alakea Street, Honolulu, Hawaii.
Proxies are being solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (the "Board" or the "Board of Directors") of the Company to be used at the Annual Meeting and at any postponement or adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Barnwell is using the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") rule that allows companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet.  As a result, we mailed to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials (including the form of proxy, this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on January 17, 2019 (the "2018 Annual Report"), collectively, the "Proxy Materials") on or about January 17, 2019.  We also provided access to our Proxy Materials over the Internet beginning on that date.  The Notice contained instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report and how to vote online or by toll-free number.  Subsequent to receiving the Notice, all stockholders have the ability to access the Proxy Materials over the Internet and request to receive a paper copy of the Proxy Materials by mail.  Instructions on how to access the Proxy Materials over the Internet or to request a paper copy may be found on the Notice.  In addition, the Notice contains instructions on how stockholders may request to receive Proxy Materials electronically by e-mail.
Registered and beneficial stockholders may view and print this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report at www.proxyvote.com.
All stockholders may view and print this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report, which are located on the "Corporate Information" tab of Barnwell's website at http://www.brninc.com.
Proxies are being solicited from stockholders of Barnwell.  If a proxy is properly executed and returned, the shares represented by it will be voted and, where specification is made by the stockholder as provided in such proxy, will be voted in accordance with such specification.  Unless a stockholder specifies otherwise, all shares represented by valid proxies will be voted (i) FOR the election of the persons named in this Proxy Statement as nominees of Barnwell under the heading "Election of Directors;" (ii) FOR the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as Barnwell's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019; and (iii) at the discretion of the proxy holders on any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
Barnwell is paying all of the costs of soliciting proxies, including preparation costs, assembly, posting on the Internet, printing and mailing of the Proxy Materials, the Notice and any additional information furnished to stockholders.  Proxies are being solicited by Barnwell primarily by mail and the Internet, but in addition, the solicitation by these means may be followed by solicitation in person, or by telephone, e-mail or facsimile, by directors, officers and other employees of Barnwell without additional compensation.  Brokers, dealers, banks, voting trusts, custodians and other institutions, and their nominees, who are holders of shares of Barnwell's common stock on the Record Date, referred to below, will be requested to forward the soliciting material to the beneficial owners of such shares of common stock and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies.  Barnwell will, upon request, reimburse such institutions for their reasonable expenses in forwarding the Proxy Materials to their beneficial owners.
VOTING AT THE MEETING
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on January 7, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment thereof.  As of the Record Date, 8,277,160 shares of common stock, par value $0.50, of the Company (the "Common Stock") were issued and outstanding.  Each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Date is entitled to one vote on any proposal presented at the meeting.  The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders representing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting will constitute a quorum at the meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes (described below) are counted for the purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business.  The election of directors requires a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting.  Any other item on the agenda must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the item at the meeting in order to pass.  Abstentions are counted in the calculation of the votes cast with respect to any of the matters submitted to a vote and have the same effect as votes against the matter except in the election of directors.  Brokers and nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to all matters to be acted upon at the meeting, other than the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent auditors.  Thus, if you do not give your broker or nominee specific instructions, your shares may not be voted with respect to the election of directors.  A broker non-vote will not have any effect on any of the proposals.  A stockholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise by giving to the Secretary of Barnwell a written notice of revocation of the proxy's authority prior to the voting thereof or by submitting a later dated proxy by telephone, on the Internet or by mail, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting.
PROPOSAL NO. 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Seven directors of the Company are proposed to be elected at the meeting.  Each elected director shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until his successor is duly elected and qualified.  The persons named as proxies in the enclosed Proxy are executive officers of the Company and, unless contrary instructions are given, they will vote the shares represented by the Proxy FOR the election to the Board of Directors of the persons named below.  The Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any of the nominees for director will be unable to serve; however, in the event any of the nominees should withdraw or otherwise become unavailable for reasons not presently known, the persons named as proxies may vote for other persons in place of such nominees.
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of each of the following seven directors of the Company.
NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors held eight meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, except for Martin Anderson who attended three audit committee meetings and three board of directors meetings, all directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board of Directors and of the committees of the Board on which each director served.  The independent directors met on four occasions out of the presence of management during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
The following table sets forth, as to the nominees for election as directors:  (1) such person's name; (2) the year in which such person was first elected a director of the Company; (3) such person's age; (4) all positions and offices with the Company held by such person; (5) the business experience of such person during the past five years; (6) certain other directorships, if any, held by such person; and briefly discusses the specific experience, qualifications, attributes or skills that led to the conclusion that each such person should serve as a director of Barnwell.

Board Nomination Process
The Board of Directors has a standing Compensation Committee, a standing Audit Committee, a standing Executive Committee and a standing Reserves Committee.  It has no standing nominating committee and there is no nominating committee charter.  The Board of Directors believes that it is appropriate for the Company not to have a nominating committee because potential nominees are recommended to the full Board by a majority vote of the independent directors.  The Board identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board willing to continue in service.  Current members of the Board with skills and experience relevant to the Company's business and willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination.  If any member of the Board up for re-election at an upcoming annual meeting of stockholders does not wish to continue in service, the Board determines whether it is appropriate to replace the retiring member.  If deemed appropriate, the Board identifies the desired skills and experience of a new nominee.  The Board believes that potential directors should possess sound judgment, understanding of the business issues affecting the Company, integrity and the highest personal and professional ethics.  The Board seeks directors possessing a range of business, management and civic experience appropriate for the Board to discharge its responsibilities.  In the case of both incumbent and new directors, the Board seeks persons who are able to devote significant time and effort to Board and Board committee responsibilities.  Once nominees have been identified, the independent directors recommend to the Board such nominees, and the Board reviews and votes on such recommendation.
The Company does not have a specific policy regarding the diversity of the Board.  Instead, the Board considers its overall composition when considering director candidates, including whether the Board has an appropriate combination of professional experience, skills, knowledge and variety of viewpoints and backgrounds in light of the Company's current and expected future needs.  The Board also believes that it is desirable for new candidates to contribute to a variety of viewpoints on the Board, which may be enhanced by a mix of different professional and personal backgrounds and experiences.
The Board will consider potential nominees brought to its attention by any director or officer of the Company.  It will also evaluate recommendations for director nominees proposed by a stockholder who (i) has continuously held at least 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting of stockholders for at least one year prior to the date the stockholder makes the recommendation and (ii) undertakes to continue to hold such number of shares through the date of the upcoming annual meeting.  For possible inclusion in next year's proxy statement, any recommendation for a director nominee submitted by a qualifying stockholder must be received by the Company no later than the date for stockholder proposals set forth herein under the heading "Stockholder Proposals."  Any stockholder recommendation for a director nominee must be submitted to the Company's Chairman of the Board in writing and must include:
· a statement by the stockholder that such stockholder is the holder of at least 1% of the outstanding shares of the Company's Common Stock, that the shares have been held for at least one year prior to the date of the submission and that such stockholder will continue to hold the shares through the date of the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders;
· the candidate's name, age, contact information and current principal occupation or employment;
· the candidate's resume, which will include a description of the candidate's qualifications and business experience during, at a minimum, the last five years, including his/her principal occupation or employment and the name and principal business of any corporation or other organization in which the candidate was employed; and
· at least three (3) references for the candidate.
The Board will evaluate recommendations for director nominees submitted by directors, management or qualifying stockholders in the same manner, using the criteria stated above.  All directors and director nominees will submit a completed form of directors' and officers' questionnaire as part of the nominating process.
Stockholders may send any communication to the Board of Directors, as a whole, or individually, by mail to the Company's address listed on page one of this Proxy Statement, to the attention of Russell M. Gifford, Secretary.  All such communications will be forwarded to the Board of Directors or individual directors as appropriate.
The Company strongly encourages each member of the Board of Directors to attend the Annual Meeting.  Eight members of the Board of Directors attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, of which four attended in person and four attended by telephone.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE; RISK OVERSIGHT
The positions of Chairman and CEO were jointly held by Mr. Morton H. Kinzler from the time of his selection as Chairman of the Board in 1980 until December 2016.  From December 31, 2016 until September 30, 2017, Mr. Morton H. Kinzler was Chairman of the Board and Mr. Alexander C. Kinzler was Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. James S. Barnwell III became Chairman of the Board on October 1, 2017.  Barnwell Industries, Inc. is a smaller reporting company and the Board has determined that the current structure is appropriate at this time in that it enables Mr. Alexander C. Kinzler to handle the complexities of his role as a CEO while allowing Mr. James S. Barnwell III to continue to provide leadership on policy at the Board level.  Although the roles of CEO and Chairman are currently held by different persons, the Board regularly considers the appropriate leadership structure for the Company and has concluded that the Company and its stockholders are best served by not having a formal policy on whether the same individual should serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and the Board has not adopted such a policy.  The Board believes that it is important to retain the flexibility to make this determination at any given point in time based upon what it believes will provide the best leadership structure for the Company at that time.  This approach allows the Board to utilize its considerable experience and knowledge to elect the most qualified director as Chairman of the Board, while maintaining the ability to combine or separate the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles when necessary.  Accordingly, at different points in time in the Company's history, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles have been held by the same person.  At other times, they have been held by different individuals.  In each instance, the decision on whether to combine or separate the roles was made in the best interest of the Company's stockholders, based on the circumstances at the time.
The Board's primary function with respect to risk is oversight.  The Board administers its risk oversight function both as a whole and through its committees.  The Audit Committee reviews and makes inquiry as to risk management and reports to the Board on its findings.  The Board of Directors has an active role, as a whole and also at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risks.  Management is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk management activities.  Other Board committees also consider and address risk as they perform their committee responsibilities.  For example, the Compensation Committee, comprised solely of independent directors, discusses and reviews compensation arrangements for the Company's Executive Officers to avoid incentives that would promote excessive risk-taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The full Board is also apprised of particular risk management matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of corporate matters.  We believe the division of risk management responsibilities as described above is an effective approach for evaluating and addressing the risks facing the Company and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach because it allows our independent directors to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Compensation Committee are Mr. Anderson, Dr. Gardner, Mr. Takata and Mr. Barnwell, Chairman.  The Compensation Committee (i) determines the annual compensation of the Company's Executive Officers; (ii) recommends, if appropriate, new employee benefit plans to the Board of Directors; (iii) administers all employee benefit plans; and (iv) makes such other determinations regarding compensation or benefits as may be necessary or advisable.  The Compensation Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.  The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, a copy of which is available on our website.
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY
The Company currently has two executive officers (the "Named Executive Officers").  The following table sets forth the names and ages of all Named Executive Officers of the Company during fiscal 2018, their positions and offices with the Company and the period during which each has served.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Summary Compensation Table
The Summary Compensation Table below sets forth certain information regarding compensation paid during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 to (1) Morton H. Kinzler3, (2) Alexander C. Kinzler, our Chief Executive Officer3, President, Chief Operating Officer and General Counsel, and (3) Russell M. Gifford, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary.
No Named Executive Officer was granted a stock award or an option award in fiscal year 2018, 2017 or 2016. As a result, such columns have been omitted.
Our Pay for Performance Plan adopted in 2014 (the "Plan") is available to pay bonuses to our executives based on performance.  Performance measures and targeted goals for the Company's 2018 fiscal year performance period were established by the Compensation Committee in December 2017 and the Committee designated the CEO to be eligible to participate in the Plan for fiscal year 2018.  The material terms of such performance measures and targeted goals are as follows:
_________________________
[BEGIN TABLE]
 3   Mr. Morton H. Kinzler resigned as Chief Executive Officer in December 2016 and Mr. Alexander C. Kinzler was appointed Chief Executive Officer at that time.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that the sum of the following three components shall represent the maximum bonus that may be achieved under the Plan for fiscal 2018 by the CEO (the "2018 Maximum Bonus Amount"), which was designed so that the Company would be in compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"):
(a) an amount equal to 5% of the earnings before income taxes on a GAAP basis of the Company;
(b) for an increase in earnings attributable to the combined Land Investment and Residential Real Estate segments in the State of Hawaii on a GAAP basis over the prior fiscal year with respect to such segments, 20% of the first 100% of such increase and 10% of the remaining amount of such increase; and
 (c)  for an increase in the Company's market capitalization of up to 10%, determined by comparing the closing price of the Common Stock on September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2018, 10% of the amount of such increase.
Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits our federal tax deduction for compensation paid in any fiscal year to our CEO and our other "covered employees," as defined in Section 162(m), to $1,000,000.  In the past, an exception to this deduction limit was available for "performance-based" compensation that had been approved by our stockholders and otherwise satisfied certain requirements under Section 162(m) and applicable regulations.  As a result of new tax legislation that went into effect on December 22, 2017, this exception for performance-based compensation is not available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless such compensation qualifies for transition relief for written binding contracts that were in effect on November 2, 2017.  Barnwell was not party to any such binding contracts.  This legislation also expanded the definition of "covered employees" to include the chief financial officer and certain former named executive officers.  These changes in the tax laws have not had an effect on Barnwell, primarily because the compensation paid to such persons in our fiscal 2018 year, and in other recent fiscal years, has been below the $1,000,000 threshold.
The Compensation Committee continues to retain flexibility to make compensation decisions that are based on factors other than Section 162(m) and related consequences when necessary or appropriate (as determined by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion) to enable Barnwell to continue to attract, retain, reward and motivate its highly-qualified executives.  This flexibility may include amending or modifying the design elements of our historical compensation programs to the extent those design elements were principally adopted in an effort to comply with Section 162(m).
The 2018 Maximum Bonus Amount for each participant shall in no case exceed 150% of such participant's base salary as of January 2018.  Additionally, a decrease in earnings before income taxes or market capitalization will not decrease the amounts of the other respective components of the 2018 Maximum Bonus Amount.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to eliminate or reduce the 2018 Maximum Bonus Amount payable to the CEO pursuant to the bonus formula described above and in addition or alternatively to grant ordinary bonuses.
The Compensation Committee determined that, pursuant to the adopted performance measures and targeted goals, the maximum bonus grant which could have been payable as calculated under the Plan was $0 as to our CEO.  The Compensation Committee reviewed the performance of our CEO during fiscal 2018, analyzed the Company's results for the year, reviewed the overall performance of management for the fiscal year, reviewed with management various factors the Committee takes into account in setting compensation, including individual and corporate, financial and non-financial performance, the creation of value for our stockholders, the long-term commitment and contributions of management to the Company and certain events in the Company's oil and gas division, including the closing of a major oil acquisition at Twining.

AUDIT COMMITTEE
The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Inglima, Chairman, Dr. Gardner, and Messrs. Anderson, Takata, and Barnwell.  All of the members of the Audit Committee are independent (as independence is defined in Section 803 (A) of the NYSE American listing standards).  The Board of Directors has determined that the Audit Committee has an audit committee financial expert, Mr. Inglima, who is a financial expert based on his degree in finance, education in accounting, his work with an accounting and consulting firm on business valuation and litigation support services, as well as his many years of legal experience advising clients on matters of business, finance and taxation.  Mr. Inglima, while not a CPA, has in-depth financial and accounting expertise and has been determined by the Board of Directors to qualify as an Audit Committee financial expert.  The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is available on our website.  The Audit Committee reviews the services of the independent accountants employed by the Company to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Audit Committee periodically reviews major issues regarding accounting and auditing principles and practices, the adequacy of internal controls that could affect the consolidated financial statements as well as all related party transactions and potential conflicts of interest.  During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Audit Committee held four meetings.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management, and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committee; Related Amendments to PCAOB Standards; and Transitional Amendments to PCAOB AU Section 380.", as such may be modified or supplemented.  KPMG LLP has provided to the Company the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable PCAOB requirements regarding their communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. The committee also concluded that KPMG LLP's performance of tax services to us and our affiliates, as pre-approved by the committee and described in the next section, does not impair KPMG LLP's independence.  Based upon its discussions with management and with KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.
Audit Fees
The aggregate fees billed to the Company by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for professional services rendered in connection with the audit of the annual financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, review of financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and services to the Company in connection with statutory or regulatory filings or engagements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 totaled $532,500.  For the comparable services provided for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, KPMG LLP billed the Company $398,500.
Audit-Related Fees
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company did not incur and KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, did not bill the Company for assurance and related services that are not reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements and classified above with audit fees.
Tax Fees
The aggregate fees billed to the Company by KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 totaled $122,100 and for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 totaled $164,000.
All Other Fees
For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company did not incur and KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, did not bill the Company for any fees other than Audit Fees and Tax Fees.
Pre-approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee pre-approves all services provided to the Company by the independent registered public accounting firm through the following policies and procedures:  (1) the Audit Committee reviews with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm its audit plan and report thereon, including estimated Audit Fees, Audit-Related Fees, Tax Fees and Other Fees; (2) upon review of such audit plan and estimated fees, the Audit Committee may pre-approve the provision of such products and services and the payment therefor; and (3) at subsequent meetings of the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee reviews the status of the provision of all products and services from the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to the Company and payment therefor, and may pre-approve the provision of additional products and services as necessary.

RATIFICATION OF THE SELECTION OF THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS FOR 2019
The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG LLP to serve as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2019.  KPMG LLP has served as the Company's independent auditors since 1990 and is considered by management to be well qualified.  Although stockholder ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent auditors is not required, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of KPMG LLP to the stockholders for ratification.  If the stockholders fail to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors.  In addition, even if the stockholders ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee may in its discretion appoint a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that a change is in the best interests of the Company.  We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent auditors for fiscal year 2019.
KPMG LLP expects to have a representative available at the meeting who will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for fiscal year 2019.

Address the proposal to Barnwell's Secretary at the address shown on the cover page of this proxy statement.  The proposal must comply with Rule 14a-8, which lists the requirements for the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials.
If you wish to present a stockholder proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders that is not the subject of a proposal pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act, or if you wish to recommend to the Board the nomination of a person for election to the Board, you must follow the procedures outlined in Article I, Section 1.13 of our bylaws.  These procedures include the requirement that your proposal must be delivered to Barnwell's Secretary at the address shown on the cover page of this proxy statement not later than the close of business on the 90th day or earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting.  If the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days from such anniversary date, your notice must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day we publicly announce the date of the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
Stockholders may request a copy of the by-law provisions discussed above by writing to Barnwell's Secretary at the address shown on the cover page of this proxy statement.  Stockholders are urged to review all applicable rules and consult legal counsel before submitting a nomination or proposal to Barnwell.
The Company reserves the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.
GENERAL
No business other than those set forth in Items (1), (2), and (3) of the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected to come before the meeting, but should any other matters requiring a vote of stockholders properly arise, including a question of adjourning the meeting, the persons named in the accompanying Proxy will vote thereon according to their best judgment in the best interests of the Company.
 Insofar as any of the information in this Proxy Statement may rest peculiarly within the knowledge of persons other than the Company, the Company has relied upon information furnished by such persons.
