IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE SHAREHOLDER MEETING TO BE HELD ON MAY 8, 2019:  A complete set of proxy materials relating to First National Corporation's Annual Meeting of Shareholders are available on the Internet.  These materials, consisting of the notice of Annual Meeting, the proxy statement, the proxy card, and the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 may be viewed at http://materials.proxyvote.com/32106V.
GENERAL INFORMATION
This Proxy Statement is furnished to holders of common stock, $1.25 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of First National Corporation (the "Company") in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Company by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on May 8, 2019 at 10:00 a.m. at the First Bank Operations Center, 406 Borden Mowery Drive, Strasburg, Virginia, and any adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting").
We are furnishing our proxy materials primarily over the Internet rather than mailing paper copies of those materials to each shareholder.  On or about March 27, 2019, we first mailed an Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials on the Internet (the "Notice") to shareholders and posted our proxy materials on the Internet site referenced therein.  These proxy materials include the accompanying notice of Annual Meeting, this proxy statement, the proxy card and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Notice provides information regarding how to access these proxy materials on the Internet, vote your shares or request a paper copy of these materials.
Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  On the Record Date, there were 4,963,487 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and 544 shareholders of record and approximately 622 additional beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock.  
The principal executive offices of the Company are located at 112 West King Street, Strasburg, Virginia 22657.  
Voting
Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting.  A majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.
Shareholders are encouraged to vote using any of the methods available to our shareholders.  If you are a registered shareholder and attend the meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. "Street name" shareholders who wish to vote at the meeting will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds their shares. The Company is pleased to offer its shareholders the convenience of voting by phone and online via the Internet. Please review the Notice separately mailed to you or the proxy card, as applicable, for instructions. Please be aware that if you vote your shares by phone or over the Internet, you may incur costs or charges from your phone service or Internet access provider for which you are responsible. 
If you execute a proxy by completing and returning a proxy card or voting by phone or online in time to be voted at the Annual Meeting, the shares represented by it will be voted in accordance with your instructions.  Any shareholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised by (i) filing written notice thereof with the Secretary of the Company (Secretary, First National Corporation, c/o Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., P.O. Box 1342, Brentwood, NY 11717); (ii) submitting a subsequent vote using any of the methods described above; or (iii) appearing at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournment thereof and giving the Secretary notice of your intention to vote in person.  If your shares are held in "street name," and you want to change or revoke voting instructions you have given to the record holder of your shares, please follow the  directions given by the institution that holds your shares. Proxies solicited hereby may be exercised only at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment thereof and will not be used for any other meeting.
A shareholder may abstain or (only with respect to the election of directors) withhold his or her vote (collectively, "Abstentions") with respect to each item submitted for shareholder approval.  Abstentions will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.  Abstentions will not be counted as voting in favor of or against the relevant item.
A broker who holds shares in "street name" has the authority to vote on certain items when it has not received instructions from the beneficial owner.  Except for certain items for which brokers are prohibited from exercising their discretion, a broker is entitled to vote on matters presented to shareholders without instructions from the beneficial owner.  "Broker shares" that are voted on at least one matter will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting.  Where brokers do not have or do not exercise such discretion, the inability or failure to vote is referred to as a "broker nonvote."  Under the circumstances where the broker is not permitted to, or does not, exercise its discretion, assuming proper disclosure to the Company of such inability to vote, broker nonvotes will not be counted as voting in favor of or against the particular matter.  A broker is prohibited from voting on the election of directors, the advisory vote on executive compensation, and the advisory vote on the frequency of future votes on executive compensation without instructions from the beneficial owner; therefore, there may be broker nonvotes on Proposals One, Three, and Four.  We expect that brokers will be allowed to exercise discretionary authority for beneficial owners who have not provided voting instructions with respect to Proposal Two; therefore, no broker nonvotes are expected to exist in connection with this proposal.  
If no contrary instructions are given, each proxy executed and returned by a record shareholder will be voted for the election of the nominees described in this Proxy Statement, for Proposals Two and Three, and for "Three Years" on Proposal Four. The proxy also confers discretionary authority upon the persons named therein, or their substitutes, with respect to any other matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting.
Solicitation of Proxies
Solicitation is being made by the Board of Directors by mail and electronic notice and access to the Internet.  If sufficient proxies are not returned in response to this solicitation, supplementary solicitations may also be made by mail, telephone, electronic communication or in person by directors, officers and employees of the Company, its subsidiaries or affiliates, none of whom will receive additional compensation for these services.  The Company may retain an outside proxy solicitation firm to assist in the solicitation of proxies, but at this time does not have plans to do so. Costs of solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. Executive Officers Who Are Not Directors

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers, and any persons who own more than 10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, to file with the SEC reports of ownership and changes in ownership of Common Stock.  Officers and directors are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.  Based solely on review of the copies of such reports furnished to the Company or written representation that no other reports were required, the Company believes that, during fiscal year 2018, its officers and directors complied with all such reporting requirements.   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND OTHER MATTERS
General
The business and affairs of the Company are managed under the direction of the Board in accordance with the Virginia Stock Corporation Act and the Company's Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.  Members of the Board are kept informed of the Company's business through discussions with the Chairman of the Board, the President and Chief Executive Officer, and other officers, by reviewing materials provided to them and by participating in meetings of the Board and its committees.
Code of Conduct and Ethics
The Audit Committee of the Board has approved a Code of Conduct and Ethics for the Company's directors and employees, including the principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer.  The Code addresses such topics as protection and proper use of the Company's assets, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, accuracy and preservation of records, accounting and financial reporting, and conflicts of interest.  It is available on the Company's website at www.fbvirginia.com under "Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Documents."
Board and Committee Meeting Attendance
Meetings of the Board are regularly held, at least once per quarter, including an organizational meeting following the conclusion of each Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  There were five meetings of the Board in 2018.  Each incumbent director attended greater than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and meetings of committees of which the director was a member in 2018.
Director Independence
The Board has determined that the following directors are independent as that term is defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq"):
[BEGIN TABLE]
Jason C. Aikens Elizabeth H. Cottrell James R. Wilkins, III 
Emily Marlow Beck W. Michael Funk   
Boyce E. Brannock Gerald F. Smith, Jr.   
[END TABLE]
Dr. Miles K. Davis and Christopher E. French, each of whom did not stand for re-election at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, also were considered independent.
The Board considered all relationships that directors had with the Company in determining independence. Emily Marlow Beck is President of Marlow Motor Co., Inc., a business from which the Company purchased a company vehicle in 2018. The Company made payments, in the form of wages, to a family member of James R. Wilkins, III as part of a summer internship program. Most directors of the Company are directors, or hold similar positions, at multiple nonprofit and charitable organizations for which the Company made payments to sponsor events or in the form of charitable contributions. The Board determined that these transactions did not impair the independence of any director under Nasdaq listing standards.
There are no other transactions, relationships or arrangements between the Company and any of the other independent directors except as set forth in "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" in the Executive Compensation section of this Proxy Statement.   Committees
The Company has two standing committees, the Audit Committee and the Compensation and Governance Committee.  Information regarding these committees is provided below.
The members of the Audit Committee are:
Emily Marlow Beck (Chair)
W. Michael Funk
Gerald F. Smith, Jr.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling the Board's risk oversight responsibilities.  These responsibilities include ensuring the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications, independence, and performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and the performance of the internal audit function.  The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the work of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged for the purpose of preparing and issuing an audit report or performing other audit, review, or attestation services for the Company.  The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.fbvirginia.com under "Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Documents."
The Board has determined in its business judgment that all members of the Audit Committee satisfy the independence and financial literacy requirements for audit committee members under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC regulations.  In addition, the Board has determined that Mr. Gerald F. Smith, Jr. qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined by SEC regulations and has designated him as the Company's audit committee financial expert. 
The Audit Committee met four times during the year ended December 31, 2018.  For additional information regarding the Audit Committee, see "Audit Committee Report" in the Audit-Related Matters section of this Proxy Statement.

The Committee also reviews and recommends employment agreements for the Chief Executive Officer and other compensation related matters, including fees paid to directors of the Company.  The Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in developing a compensation philosophy for attracting, motivating, and retaining high-quality executives that will advance the interests of shareholders and delivering total compensation that is commensurate with performance.  The Compensation and Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities as to their oversight of management compensation and the organizational structure of the Company.   Management provides compensation recommendations for the Committee's consideration and administers the Company's executive compensation programs.  Direct responsibilities of management include, but are not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Providing an ongoing review of the effectiveness of the compensation programs, including competitiveness, and alignment with the Company's objectives; 
▪ Recommending changes, if necessary, to ensure achievement of all program objectives; and 
▪ Recommending pay levels and bonus payouts for executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation and Governance Committee is also responsible for identifying, evaluating, and recommending candidates and nominees for Board membership.  As part of that responsibility, the Committee conducts skills assessments of the directors, evaluates the adequacy of the current Board membership, and recommends changes where warranted.  The Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities as to their risk oversight of the Company, including corporate governance matters, such as the determination of Board and Committee independence. 
The Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation and Governance Committee.  The Compensation and Governance Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.fbvirginia.com under "Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Documents."
The Board has determined in its business judgment that all members of the Compensation and Governance Committee are independent as that term is defined in the listing standards of the Nasdaq.  The Compensation and Governance Committee met five times during the year ended December 31, 2018.   
Director Selection Process
The Company does not have a separate nominating committee.  The Compensation and Governance Committee performs the functions of a nominating committee in considering and recommending director nominees to the full Board.  The Committee has established procedures that provide guidance for evaluating the composition of the Board, current directors and director nominees.  Procedures include, but are not limited to the following processes and evaluation criteria:
The Process
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the existing Board and the need for additional Board positions; 
▪ Considering candidates for Board membership suggested by its members and other Board members, as well as management and shareholders; 
▪ Consulting about potential candidates with the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, and other directors as appropriate; 
▪ Evaluating the prospective nominee against the specific criteria established for the position, including, but not limited to the criteria below;  
▪ Interviewing the nominee, if the Committee decides to proceed with further consideration; 
▪ Recommending an action to the Board that makes the final determination whether to nominate or appoint the new director after considering the Committee's report; and 
▪ Generally maintaining criteria for Board positions which are utilized to evaluate directors and director nominees. 
[END TABLE]
 The Evaluation Criteria
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ The ability to represent the interests of the shareholders of the Company; 
▪ Standards of integrity, commitment, and independence of thought and judgment; 
▪ The ability to dedicate sufficient time, energy, and attention to the diligent performance of his or her duties, including the prospective nominee's service on other public company boards; 
▪ The extent to which the prospective nominee assists in achieving a mix of Board members that achieves the proper balance of skills, expertise, experience, independence, and community representation; 
▪ The extent of contribution to the range of talent, skill, and expertise appropriate for the Board; 
▪ The willingness to meet at least the minimum equity interest holding required by law; and 
▪ The willingness to serve on the Board for an appropriate period of time to develop comprehensive knowledge about the Company's principal operations. 
[END TABLE]
In the consideration of director nominees, including any nominee that a shareholder may submit (as described below), the Board considers, at a minimum, the above evaluation criteria factors for new directors, or the continued service of existing directors.
Shareholders entitled to vote for the election of directors may submit candidates for formal consideration by the Compensation and Governance Committee in connection with an Annual Meeting if the Company receives timely written notice, in proper form, for each such recommended director nominee.  If the notice is not timely and in proper form, the nominee will not be considered by the Company.  To be timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting, the notice must be received within the time frame set forth in "Shareholder Communications" in the Other Information section of this Proxy Statement.  To be in proper form, the notice must include each nominee's written consent to be named as a nominee and to serve, if elected, and information about the shareholder making the nomination and the person nominated for election.  These requirements are more fully described in Article II, Section F, of the Company's Bylaws, a copy of which will be provided, without charge, to any shareholder upon written request to the Secretary of First National Corporation, whose address is First National Corporation, 112 West King Street, Strasburg, Virginia 22657.
In addition to fulfilling the evaluation criteria, each director brings a strong and unique background and set of skills to the Board, providing the Board as a whole competence and experience in a wide variety of areas. 
Leadership Structure of the Board
The positions of Chairman of the Board and President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company have traditionally been held by separate persons.  The principal role of the President and Chief Executive Officer is to execute on Board developed strategies and to manage the business of the Company in a safe, sound, and profitable manner.  The role of the Board is to provide independent oversight of the President and Chief Executive Officer, formulate strategy and policy, and to monitor and measure risks within the Company.  
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board oversees risk management to be reasonably certain that the Company's risk management policies, procedures, and practices are consistent with corporate strategy and functioning appropriately. The Board performs its risk oversight in several ways.  The Board establishes standards for risk management by approving policies that address and mitigate the Company's most material risks. These include policies addressing credit risk, interest rate risk, capital risk, and liquidity risk.  The Board also monitors, reviews, and reacts to risk through various reports presented by management, internal and external auditors, and regulatory examiners.
The Board conducts certain risk oversight activities through its committees with direct oversight over specific functional areas.  The risk oversight activities of the Audit and Compensation and Governance Committees are described in the "Committees" and "Audit-Related Matters" sections of this proxy statement.  These committees are all comprised exclusively of independent directors.
The Board is empowered to create additional standing and ad hoc committees to facilitate regular monitoring and deeper analysis of matters that may arise from time to time.  The Board also meets regularly in executive session to discuss a variety of topics, including risk, without members of management present.
In the foregoing ways, the Board is able to monitor the Company's risk profile and risk management activities on an ongoing basis.
Attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
The Company encourages members of the Board to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  All of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
Communications with Directors
Any director may be contacted by writing to him or her c/o First National Corporation, 112 West King Street, Strasburg, Virginia 22657.  Communications to the non-management directors as a group may be sent to the same address, c/o the Secretary of First National Corporation.  The Company promptly forwards, without screening, all such correspondence to the indicated directors.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Company strives to attract, motivate and retain high-quality executives by providing total compensation that is performance-based and competitive with the various labor markets and industries in which the Company competes for talent.  The Company provides incentives to advance the interests of shareholders and deliver levels of compensation that are commensurate with performance.  Overall, compensation plans are designed to support the corporate business strategy and business plan.  Expectations are clearly communicated to executives with respect to goals and results and by rewarding achievement.  The Company focuses on retaining and recruiting talented executives that can create strong financial performance aligned with shareholders' interest.  The Company attempts to achieve these objectives through three key compensation elements:  base salary, performance-based cash compensation, and equity compensation, along with retirement and health benefits.  Summary Compensation Table

 Compensation Philosophy
In October 2016, the Board of Directors engaged Matthews, Young & Associates, Inc., a compensation consulting firm, to review the Bank's executive compensation, identify strengths, weaknesses, and voids, and make directional recommendations based on the Bank's philosophy and strategy.  Their work included a review of both corporate strategy and compensation strategy and examining external competitiveness of compensation and internal equity among the executive team on all components of compensation.  As a result of their evaluation, the Company retained its executive compensation program that serves to attract and retain the management talent needed to successfully lead the Company and increase shareholder value.  It rewards executives for their knowledge and skill used in carrying out their responsibilities, and motivates their behavior by rewarding desired performance or the meeting of established corporate objectives.
The Company's executive compensation program primarily consists of base salaries, annual incentive bonuses, long-term incentives in the form of equity-based compensation, and retirement compensation. 
Base salary represents the fixed component of the Company's executive compensation program and is designed to provide compensation to executives based upon their experience, duties, and scope of responsibilities. 
Annual incentive bonuses may be provided through the Company's Executive Incentive Plan and represents a variable component of compensation, and are intended to compensate executives for specific achievements or improvements in the Company's performance and individual accomplishments toward specific objectives.  
Long-term equity-based incentive compensation may be provided through the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, and represents a variable component which seeks to reward executives for performance that maximizes long-term shareholder value, while further aligning the executives' financial interests with those of our shareholders, and also serves as a retention tool. 
Retirement compensation is provided through supplemental executive retirement plans intended to provide additional incentives and supplemental retirement income and a 401(k) plan that is a variable component of compensation designed to allow the participants to accumulate assets which will assist in meeting their post-retirement needs.
The Chief Executive Officer recommends the compensation of named executive officers to the Compensation and Governance Committee, which may include base salary, performance goals for annual incentive plans, bonuses, and equity compensation.  The Compensation and Governance Committee reviews and recommends the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to the Board of Directors, which also includes base salary, performance goals for annual incentive plans, bonuses, and equity compensation.  
Executive Incentive Plan
In November 2012, the Board of Directors adopted a cash Executive Incentive Plan (the "EIP") to reward certain executive officers for achieving performance goals.  A revised EIP was adopted by the Board in March 2013.  The duration of the EIP is indefinite, and the EIP may be amended or terminated by the Board at any time.  Participation is limited to those employees selected by the Chief Executive Officer and approved by the Compensation and Governance Committee of the Board each  EIP year.  Scott C. Harvard, Dennis A. Dysart, and M. Shane Bell were selected to participate in the EIP along with certain other employees, effective January 1, 2018.  
Under the Plan, the Board is responsible for establishing and approving annual performance objectives for the Company and Plan participants, based upon such criteria as may be recommended by the Chief Executive Officer, and the award formula by which all incentive awards under the Plan are calculated.  Plan participants are entitled to a cash distribution under this Plan if, upon the approval of the Board, the Plan award is earned as a result of the attainment of Plan performance objectives and the participant is employed on the payment date.  Awards shall be paid on or after January 1 of the year following the performance period, and no later than March 15 of the year following the performance period.
In the event of a participant's termination of employment for any reason, including due to death, permanent disability, or retirement, any unpaid awards (including any earned but unpaid awards) shall be forfeited by such participant.  The Company has the right to recover compensation that the Company determines, in its sole discretion, was unjustly paid to an employee under the Plan.  Under the EIP, the Board reserves the right to withhold or adjust individual awards. The Board has not exercised its discretion to withhold bonus payments in the past.
In February 2019, the Company paid awards under the EIP to Scott C. Harvard, Dennis A. Dysart, and M. Shane Bell.  The awards were based on achievement of the Company's financial performance goals including loan growth, profitability ratios, and earnings.  These amounts are disclosed as Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation for 2018 in the Summary Compensation Table above.   
2014 Stock Incentive Plan
The Company's 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the "SIP") was adopted by the Board of Directors on March 12, 2014, and approved at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 13, 2014.  The Plan makes available up to 240,000 shares of common stock for the granting of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards.  The Board believes the Plan will be an important factor in attracting, retaining, and rewarding the high caliber individuals essential to the Company's long-term success.  The Board further believes that ownership of the Company's common stock will stimulate the efforts of those individuals upon whose judgment, interest, and efforts the Company is and will be largely dependent for the successful conduct of its business, and will further align the interests of those individuals with the interests of the Company's shareholders.
On February 14, 2018, the Company granted 3,309, 1,320, and 1,200 restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the SIP to Scott C. Harvard, Dennis A. Dysart, and M. Shane Bell, respectively.  The grants represented long-term compensation and enhanced retention of the named executive officers.  Each restricted stock unit represented a contingent right to receive one share of First National Corporation common stock.  One-third of the RSUs granted vested immediately, with the remainder vesting in two equal annual installments beginning February 14, 2019.
Employment Agreements
Effective as of May 22, 2014, the Company entered into an employment contract with Scott C. Harvard.  The term of the agreement began on May 22, 2014 and continued until May 21, 2015. On May 21, 2015, the agreement was extended for one year and has automatically extended each May 21 thereafter, until Mr. Harvard or the Company provides notice to the other party prior to the end of the applicable term. The agreement with Mr. Harvard contains restrictive covenants relating to the protection of confidential information, non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation.  The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants continue generally for a period of 12 months following the last day of his employment.
Mr. Harvard will not be entitled to any termination compensation and benefits if he breaches any of the covenants in the agreement relating to the protection of confidential information, non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation.  He will also not be entitled to any compensation or other benefits, other than payment for all time worked, if his employment is terminated for cause or if Mr. Harvard terminates his employment for other than good reason.
Effective as of October 1, 2002, the Company entered into employment contracts with Dennis A. Dysart and M. Shane Bell.  These contracts were amended December 1, 2008.  The term of the agreements for Mr. Dysart and Mr. Bell is at all times two years, which means that at the end of every day, the term of the agreements are extended for one day.
Material terms of these agreements include prohibiting the Company from decreasing the salary of the employee, to provide certain severance payments to the employee if terminated without cause or in the event of a change of control, and covenants related to the protection of confidential information, non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation.  The non-competition and non-solicitation covenants continue generally for a period of 12 months following the last day of employment.
Mr. Dysart and Mr. Bell will not be entitled to any termination compensation and benefits if any of the covenants in the agreement relating to the protection of confidential information, non-disclosure, non-competition, and non-solicitation are breached.  These employees will also not be entitled to any compensation or other benefits, other than payment for all time worked, if employment is terminated for "cause" or if Mr. Dysart or Mr. Bell terminates his employment for other than "good reason" (as those terms are defined in the agreements).
Retirement Benefits
The Bank had a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan for all full-time employees hired before May 1, 2011 who were over 21 years of age and had at least one year of credited service. Benefits were generally based upon years of service and average compensation for the five highest-paid consecutive years of service. The Bank's funding practice was to make at least the minimum required annual contribution permitted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  On September 14, 2016, the defined benefit pension plan was amended to be terminated. Under the amendment, benefit accruals ceased as of November 30, 2016. The Internal Revenue Service approved the termination on October 16, 2017 and the Company distributed all plan assets on March 8, 2018. 
The Company also maintained a 401(k) plan and an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) for all eligible employees.  All employees who are age nineteen or older are eligible for the 401(k) plan. On September 14, 2016, the ESOP was amended to freeze the plan to new participants and to cease all contributions, effective December 31, 2016. The amendment also directed matching contributions and certain other retirement contributions made by the Company to the 401(k) plan. On December 31, 2017, the ESOP was amended to be terminated and the Internal Revenue Service approved the  termination on May 3, 2018. The Company distributed all assets of the ESOP to participants or beneficiaries on October 10, 2018.
The Bank also has entered into supplemental executive retirement plans (the "SERP") with each of Mr. Harvard, Mr. Dysart and Mr. Bell.  The SERP agreements provide for a normal retirement benefit (equal to $66,667 per year for Mr. Harvard, $70,103 per year for Mr. Dysart and $64,926 per year for Mr. Bell), payable in 180 monthly installments, beginning upon the officer's separation from service at or after retirement age (68 for Mr. Harvard, and 65 for Mr. Dysart and Mr. Bell). In the event of an officer's early retirement or voluntary or involuntary separation from service prior to normal retirement age, he will be entitled to receive the portion of such benefit that has been accrued at that time.
In addition, the SERP agreements provides that the officer will be entitled to the present value of his normal retirement benefit upon his separation from service within two years of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the SERP).

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
Each employment contract with Mr. Harvard, Mr. Dysart, and Mr. Bell provides that the officer's employment may be terminated by the Company with or without cause.  If he resigns for "good reason" or is terminated without "cause" (as those terms are defined in the respective employment agreement), however, he is entitled to his salary and benefits for the remainder of his contract.  If his employment terminates for good reason or without cause within one year of a change in control of the Company, he will be entitled to severance payments approximately equal to 299% of his annual cash compensation for a period that precedes the change in control as determined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  The following table provides payments that could be due the named executive officers under different scenarios: Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control

There were no unvested stock awards outstanding for directors at December 31, 2018. Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
Some of the directors and officers of the Company are customers of the Bank.  No loans to directors or officers involve more than the normal risks of collectability or present other unfavorable features, or are non-accrual, past due, restricted, or considered potential problem loans.  All such loans were made in the ordinary course of business and were originated on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Company or the Bank.  The balances of loans to directors, executive officers, and their related interests totaled $2.5 million at December 31, 2018, or 4% of the Company's equity at that date.
The Company has adopted a formal written policy that covers the review and approval of related party transactions by the Board.  The Board reviews all such transactions that are proposed to it for approval.  During such a review, the Board will consider, among other things, the related party's relationship to the Company, the facts and circumstances of the proposed transaction, the aggregate dollar amount of the transaction, the related person's relationship to the transaction, and any other material information.  Based on the Company's Conflict of Interest Policy, the Board also has the responsibility to review conflicts of interest involving directors or executive officers.

 In this context, the Audit Committee has met and had discussions with management and Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C., the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed these consolidated financial statements with management and Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C., including the scope of the independent registered public accounting firm's responsibilities, critical accounting policies and practices used, and significant financial reporting issues and judgments made by management in connection with the preparation of such financial statements. 
The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with the independent auditors all communications required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), including those described in Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communication with Audit Committees," and Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the SEC, as modified or supplemented, and, with and without management present, discussed and reviewed the results of the independent auditors' examinations of the financial statements and internal controls. The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C.'s communications with the Audit Committee and discussed with Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. the firm's independence from the Company.  Moreover, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the audit services described above is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm.
Based upon its discussions with management and Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. and its review of the representations of management and the report of Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.  By recommending that the audited consolidated financial statements be so included, the Audit Committee is not providing an opinion on the accuracy, completeness or presentation of the information contained in the audited financial statements.

Policy for Approval of Audit and Permitted Non-Audit Services
All audit-related services, tax services, and other services, as described above, were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which concluded that the provision of such services by Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.  The Audit Committee Charter provides for pre-approval of the auditor's fees and is available on the Company's website at www.fbvirginia.com under "Investor Relations/Corporate Governance/Documents."  As provided for in the Charter, the Committee reviews, prior to the annual external audit, the scope and general extent of the auditor's audit procedures, including their engagement letter.  The Committee also reviews the extent of non-audit services provided by the external auditors in relation to the objectivity needed in their audit.  It was determined the external auditors maintained objectivity considering the non-audit services provided.  Auditor Fees and Services

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. served as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018, and has been appointed by the Audit Committee to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  Information concerning the fees paid to Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. is included in this proxy statement under the heading "Audit-Related Matters."  Representatives from Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.
Although our Bylaws do not require shareholder ratification or other approval of the retention of our independent registered public accounting firm, as a matter of good corporate governance, the Board of Directors is requesting that the shareholders ratify the appointment of Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. as the independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
Ratification of the appointment of Yount, Hyde & Barbour, P.C. as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm requires that a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting vote be in favor of the proposal.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and therefore will not affect the determination as to whether the ratification of the appointment of Company's independent registered public accounting firm is approved.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" PROPOSAL TWO – RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF YOUNT, HYDE & BARBOUR, P.C. PROPOSAL THREE:
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, usually referred to as the Dodd-Frank Act. Among the provisions of the act is the opportunity for our shareholders to vote their approval, on a non-binding basis, of the compensation of our executives as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In 2013, the Company's shareholders voted to hold this advisory vote on executive compensation every three years.  We also are asking our shareholders to consider the frequency of future shareholder votes on executive compensation again this year, as discussed further in Proposal Four.  If we continue to hold this advisory vote every three years, shareholders will be asked to vote to approve executive compensation again in 2022.  
In connection with the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company is providing you the opportunity, as a shareholder, to endorse or not endorse our executive pay programs and policies through the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission."
Non-binding approval of the Company's executive compensation program requires that a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting vote be in favor of the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and therefore will not affect the determination as to whether the Company's executive compensation program as disclosed in this proxy statement is approved.
Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors, overrule any decision made by the Board of Directors or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty by the Board of Directors. The Compensation and Governance Committee may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation agreements.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF PROPOSAL THREE - ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION. PROPOSAL FOUR:
ADVISORY VOTE ON FREQUENCY OF FUTURE 
ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In addition to the non-binding advisory vote regarding executive compensation, our shareholders also have the opportunity to vote, on an advisory basis, for their preference as to whether this advisory vote should be conducted every one, two, or three years in the future. This non-binding vote on "frequency" will be provided at least once every six years and was last considered by the Company's shareholders at the Company's 2013 Annual Meeting.
After careful consideration, our Board and Compensation and Governance Committee believe that conducting the "say-on-pay" advisory vote every three years is appropriate for the Company for the following reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a three-year voting cycle allows shareholders to review compensation, not just over current year information but over several years of compensation information that we report in our proxy statements, which also allows shareholders sufficient time to evaluate the impact of changes made in one year where outcomes may not be immediately known; 
• a three-year voting cycle is more closely aligned with a longer-term view of compensation; and 
• a three-year voting cycle allows sufficient time for the Compensation and Governance Committee to more fully evaluate philosophy and long-term compensation strategy, conduct more meaningful dialogue with shareholders, and implement and evaluate the impact of changes deemed appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
The Company recognizes that shareholders may have different views as to the best approach for the Company, and we look forward to hearing from our shareholders as to the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation. As with the advisory nature of the "say-on-pay" vote on executive compensation, the advisory vote on frequency of such voting is also non-binding on the Board and Compensation and Governance Committee. However, the Compensation and Governance Committee will give careful consideration to guidance expressed by the voting results of our shareholders.
The proxy card provides shareholders with the opportunity to choose among four options (rotating the vote every one, two or three years, or abstaining). The alternative receiving the greatest number of votes will be the frequency that shareholders approve.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR A THREE YEAR CYCLE OF VOTING ON FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  OTHER INFORMATION
