   DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS   
[END TABLE]
Directors are responsible for overseeing Associated's business consistent with their fiduciary duty to shareholders. This significant responsibility requires highly skilled individuals with various qualities, attributes and professional experience. The Board believes that there are certain general requirements for service on Associated's Board of Directors that are applicable to all directors, and that there are other skills and experience that should be represented on the Board as a whole but not necessarily by every director. The Board and the Corporate Governance Committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and Associated's current and future needs. 
In its assessment of each nominee for director, including those recommended by shareholders, the Corporate Governance Committee considers the nominee's judgment, integrity, experience, independence, understanding of Associated's business or other related industries and such other factors that the Corporate Governance Committee determines are pertinent in light of the current needs of the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee also takes into account the ability of a director to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to Associated. 
The Board and the Corporate Governance Committee require that each director be a person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field. Each director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, an appreciation of multiple cultures and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. In addition to the qualifications required of all directors, the Board conducts interviews of potential director candidates to assess intangible qualities including the individual's ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially. 
The Board believes that the combination of qualifications, skills and experiences of each of the director nominees will contribute to an effective and well-functioning Board. The Board and the Corporate Governance Committee believe that, individually and as a whole, the directors possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the business and quality advice and counsel to Associated's management. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the election of Mses. Greffin, Kamerick and van Lith and Messrs. Flynn, Bergstrom, Crowley, Gerken, Haddad, Hutchinson, Jeffe, Klappa, Lommen, Nettles and Williams to the Board of Directors.

   AFFIRMATIVE DETERMINATIONS REGARDING DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE   
[END TABLE]
Associated's Board has considered the independence of the nominees for election at the Annual Meeting and all individuals who served as directors during any portion of 2018, under the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. The Board has determined that all such directors are independent, or were independent at the time they served as directors, under the NYSE corporate governance rules, except for Mr. Flynn, President and CEO of Associated. Mr. Flynn is not independent because of his service as an executive officer of Associated and not because of any other transactions or relationships.  Table of Contents 
  INFORMATION ABOUT THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS     
[BEGIN TABLE]
   BOARD COMMITTEES AND MEETING ATTENDANCE   
[END TABLE]
The Board held seven meetings during 2018. During 2018, each director who was a director for all of 2018 attended at least 75% of the Board meetings held, and each such director attended at least 75% of the meetings of each committee of which he or she was a member. 
The Board convened an executive session of its non-management directors at all of its regular board meetings held in 2018. Executive sessions of Associated's non-management directors are presided over by the Chairman of the Board. 
All of the directors serve on the Boards of two of Associated's operating subsidiaries, Associated Bank, National Association and Associated Trust Company, National Association. The Board believes that a single governing body to advise and determine strategy for the organization provides the Board with a comprehensive picture of the level and trends in operational and compliance risk exposure for the entire organization and ensures comprehensive oversight of regulatory matters. 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, including a Code of Business Conduct and 
Ethics, which can be found on Associated's website at www.associatedbank.com, "Investor Relations," "Governance Documents." We will describe on our website any amendments to or waivers from our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations. 
It is Associated's policy that all directors and nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting attend the Annual Meeting, except under extraordinary circumstances. All directors and nominees for director at the time of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders attended the meeting. 
The Board has adopted written charters for all of its standing committees. The committee charters can be found on Associated's website at www.associatedbank.com, "Investor Relations," "Governance Documents." The following summarizes the responsibilities of the various committees. 
The following table lists the members of each of the standing committees as of February 15, 2019 and the number of meetings held by each committee during 2018.  Table of Contents
Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee of the Board reviews the adequacy of internal accounting controls, reviews with Associated's independent registered public accounting firm its audit plan and the results of the audit engagement, reviews the scope and results of procedures for internal auditing, reviews and approves the general nature of audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm, and reviews quarterly and annual financial statements issued by Associated. The Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint or replace the independent registered public accounting firm, subject to ratification by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. Both the internal auditors and the independent registered accounting firm meet periodically with the Audit Committee and have access to the Audit Committee at any time. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees management's bank regulatory compliance. 
Compensation and Benefits Committee  
The functions of the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board include, among other duties directed by the Board, administration and oversight of Associated's executive compensation, employee benefit programs and director compensation. The Compensation and Benefits Committee sets the strategic direction of Associated's executive compensation policies and programs, and oversees managements' execution of and compliance with that strategic direction. The Compensation and Benefits Committee determines the compensation of Associated's Chief Executive Officer (the "CEO") and, with input from the CEO, establishes the compensation of Associated's other NEOs. The Compensation and Benefits Committee also has responsibility for ensuring that Associated's incentive compensation programs do not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking that would threaten the value of Associated or the integrity of its financial reporting. As permitted under its charter, the Compensation and Benefits Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to advise it on the structure and amount of compensation of Associated's executive officers and Board of Directors, which is described in detail under "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis," beginning on page 21. 
Corporate Development Committee  
The functions of the Corporate Development Committee of the Board include, among other duties directed by the Board, reviewing and recommending to the Board proposals for acquisition or expansion activities. 
Corporate Governance Committee  
The functions of the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board include corporate governance oversight, review and recommendation for Board approval of Board and committee charters. The Corporate Governance Committee also reviews the structure and composition of the Board, considers qualification requirements for continued Board service, and recruits new director candidates. The Corporate Governance Committee also advises the Board with respect to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. 
Enterprise Risk Committee  
The functions of the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board include oversight of the enterprise-wide risk management framework of Associated, including the strategies, policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure and manage significant risks. 
Trust Committee  
The functions of the Trust Committee of the Board include the supervision of the trust and fiduciary activities of Associated Bank, National Association and Associated Trust Company, National Association to ensure the proper exercise of their trust/fiduciary powers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   SEPARATION OF BOARD CHAIRMAN AND CEO   
[END TABLE]
Associated's Corporate Governance Guidelines require the separation of the positions of Chairman of the Board and CEO. Currently, Mr. Hutchinson serves as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Flynn serves as CEO. These positions have been separated since Mr. Flynn joined Associated in December 2009, at which time the Board determined that Mr. Hutchinson, Associated's former Lead Director, serving as Chairman would enhance the effectiveness of the 
Board. The Board also recognized that managing the Board in an increasingly complex economic and regulatory environment is a particularly time-intensive responsibility. Separating the roles allows Mr. Flynn to focus solely on his duties as the CEO. Separation of these roles also promotes risk management, enhances the independence of the Board from management and mitigates potential conflicts of interest between the Board and management.

   BOARD DIVERSITY   
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance Committee considers attributes of diversity as outlined in the Corporate Governance Committee Charter when considering director nominees. While these attributes are considered on an ongoing basis, they are particularly considered in the recruitment and deliberation regarding prospective director nominees. The Corporate Governance Committee Charter outlines desired diversity characteristics for Board member experience and competencies. The Corporate Governance Committee believes that Associated's best interests are served by maintaining a diverse and active Board membership with members who are willing, able and well-situated to provide insight into current business conditions, opportunities and risks. The "outside" perspectives of the Board members are key factors in contributing to our success. The following diversity principles have been adopted:
The Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the effectiveness of these diversity principles. In light of the current Board's representation of diverse industry, background, communities within Associated's markets, professional expertise and racial and gender diversity, the Corporate Governance Committee believes that Associated has effectively implemented these principles. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   DIRECTOR NOMINEE RECOMMENDATIONS   
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance Committee will consider any nominee recommended by a shareholder as described in this section under the same criteria as any other potential nominee. The Corporate Governance Committee believes that a nominee recommended for a position on the Board must have an appropriate mix of experience, diverse perspectives, and skills. Qualifications for nomination as a director can be found in the Corporate Governance Committee Charter. At a minimum, the core competencies should include accounting or finance experience, market familiarity, business or management experience, industry knowledge, customer-base experience or perspective, crisis response, leadership, and/or strategic planning. 
A shareholder who wishes to recommend a person or persons for consideration as a nominee for election to the Board must send a written notice by mail, c/o Corporate Secretary, Associated Banc-Corp, 433 Main Street, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301, that sets forth (1) the name, age, address (business and residence) and principal occupation or employment (present and for the past five years) of each proposed nominee; (2) the number of shares of Associated beneficially owned (as defined by Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) and any other ownership interest in the shares of Associated, whether economic or otherwise, including derivatives and hedges, by each proposed nominee; (3) any other information regarding such proposed nominee that would be required to be disclosed in a definitive proxy statement prepared in connection with an election of directors pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act; and (4) the name and address (business and residential) of the shareholder making the recommendation; and (5) the number of shares of Associated beneficially owned (as defined by Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) and any other ownership interest in the shares of Associated, whether economic or otherwise, including derivatives and hedges, by the shareholder making the recommendation.

Shareholders and other interested parties may send written communications to the Board or any of the individual directors by mail, c/o Corporate Secretary, Associated Banc-Corp, 433 Main Street, Green Bay, Wisconsin 54301. All communications will be compiled by Associated's Corporate Secretary and submitted to the Board or the individual director, as applicable, on a regular basis unless such communications are considered, in the reasonable judgment of the Corporate Secretary, to be improper for submission to the intended recipient(s).

     STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

Associated's Compensation and Benefits Committee believes that robust security ownership guidelines are an important means of ensuring that the interests of Associated's executive officers and directors are fully aligned with long-term shareholder value. 
Associated's executive stock ownership guidelines, which apply to members of the Executive Committee (which is composed of colleagues that directly report to the Chief Executive Officer) and other key executives identified by the CEO, include:
Associated's director stock ownership guidelines require each independent member of the Board to own shares of Common Stock with a value equal to five times the value of the annual cash retainer payable to a director. Directors are required to attain such stock ownership goal no later than five years from the date on which they first were appointed to the Board. Balances in the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan and RSUs count toward satisfying this requirement. 
All Associated directors and NEOs are within the expected guidelines of the stock ownership requirements. 
Under Associated's Insider Trading Policy, directors and executive officers are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions with respect to Associated Common Stock and from pledging Associated Common Stock as collateral for loans, with the exception, for directors only, of pledges already in place when the prohibition on pledging was adopted in 2012. All of the NEOs are in compliance with this policy. Where applicable, shares pledged as collateral will not be counted for purposes of compliance with the stock ownership guidelines.

  PROPOSAL 2:     
    ADVISORY APPROVAL OF ASSOCIATED BANC-CORP'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION         
Associated's executive compensation program plays a key role in our ability to attract, retain and motivate the highest quality executive team. The principal objectives of Associated's executive compensation program are to align executive incentive compensation with long-term shareholder value creation, target executive compensation within competitive market ranges, and reward performance, without incenting unnecessary or excessive risk. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which begins on page 21, the Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") has designed the program to incorporate a number of features and best practices that support these objectives, including, among others:
Shareholders are encouraged to carefully review the "Executive Compensation" section of this Proxy Statement in its entirety for a detailed discussion of Associated's executive compensation program. 
As required under the Exchange Act, this proposal seeks a shareholder advisory vote on the approval of compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Associated's Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation rules of the SEC in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related materials."
Because this is an advisory vote, it will not be binding upon the Board of Directors. However, the Compensation and Benefits Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the advisory approval of Associated Banc-Corp's Named Executive Officer compensation, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and any related material). If a majority of the votes cast are voted "FOR" this Proposal 2, it will pass. Unless otherwise directed, all proxies will be voted "FOR" Proposal 2.  Table of Contents

     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   
[END TABLE]
Associated's executive compensation program is overseen by the Compensation and Benefits Committee (referred to in this section as the "Committee") and is intended to provide a balanced program that rewards corporate, business area, and individual results that support Associated's mission, with a focus on performance-based compensation. The program's strong pay-for-performance alignment is an important part of Associated's continuing commitment to enhancing long-term shareholder value. 
2018 Financial Performance  
2018 was Associated's most profitable year in its entire history. Associated continues to maintain a healthy balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity levels. Associated is committed to making investments to expand services, develop new products and services, and drive new business. The completed acquisition of Bank Mutual Corporation in 2018 and the announcement in the fourth quarter of 2018 of the acquisition of the Wisconsin branch banking operations of The Huntington National Bank, a subsidiary of Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, further demonstrates Associated's commitment to profitable growth. In addition, during the first half of 2018, Associated acquired Anderson Insurance & Investment Agency, Inc. and Diversified Insurance Solutions. 
Reflecting another year of progress, Associated reported GAAP earnings per common share ("EPS") of $1.89 and Return on Common Equity Tier 1 ("ROCET1") of 13.15%, which reflects a year-over-year non-tax adjusted growth of 33% and 26% respectively. 
Consistent with Associated's focus on delivering increased value and returning capital to its shareholders, dividends per common share increased 24% in 2018 to $0.62. In addition, in 2018 Associated repurchased over 9 million shares of Common Stock. 
Associated continued to grow its balance sheet with average loans increasing 10% year-over-year to $22.7 billion. In addition, average deposits of $24.1 billion for 2018 increased 10% from 2017. These results reflect the continuing commitment of colleagues and executive officers throughout Associated to serving the needs of Associated's customers and enhancing long-term shareholder value. 
Common Equity Tier 1, a non-GAAP financial measure, is used by banking regulators, investors and analysts to assess and compare the quality and composition of Associated's capital with the capital of other financial services companies. Management uses Common Equity Tier 1 along with other capital measures, to assess and monitor Associated's capital position. The Federal Reserve establishes regulatory capital requirements, including well-capitalized standards for Associated. Prior to 2015, the regulatory capital requirements effective for the Corporation followed the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. Beginning January 1, 2015, the regulatory capital requirements effective for Associated follow Basel III, subject to certain transaction provisions. Common Equity Tier 1 prior to Basel III requirements was calculated as Tier 1 capital excluding qualifying perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities. See Table 26 in Part II, Item 7 of the 2018 Form 10-K for a reconciliation of Common Equity Tier 1.  Table of Contents 
Key Elements of Associated's Executive Compensation Program  
The key elements of our executive pay program (Salary, Annual Incentive, and Equity Awards) support the Committee's philosophy of providing a balanced program of short- and long-term compensation that targets market-competitive levels that attract and retain top talent. 
Key Executive Compensation Governance Practices  
We believe our pay practices demonstrate our commitment to and alignment with stockholders' interests and our dedication to maintaining a compensation program supported by strong corporate governance. The Committee meets regularly and in addition to each member's own business knowledge of best practices, they receive guidance on best practices and market trends from the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC. Strong governance is exemplified by the detailed chart below which describes the practices that are included and excluded in our programs.  Table of Contents
   Shareholder Outreach and Response to 2018 Advisory Vote on NEO Compensation  
Associated's 2018 advisory shareholder vote on NEO compensation resulted in more than 79% of the votes cast in favor of the program. On an annual basis, the Company is in direct dialogue with between 50 and 100 institutional investors through regular attendance at industry conferences and investor events. This includes regular, private one-on-one dialogue with most of the Company's top 20 shareholders, which represents 52% of outstanding shares. In addition, management engages with investors through conference calls to discuss Company results, performance relative to industry trends, peer metrics, governance matters, and the Company's strategic direction. During 2018, key executive officers and senior leaders engaged in specific outreach with two significant shareholders and two shareholder advisory firms with respect to its compensation practices to gain an understanding of shareholder views on the Committee's decisions and to provide clarification on the use of common publicly reported metrics that align the performance plans with shareholder interests. The discussion focused on components of Associated's incentive compensation program and design choices by the Committee. These discussions and outcomes are described below. The Committee took comments into consideration and has made forward looking modifications, which are described below and discussed further on page 37 under Compensation Decisions for 2019. Table of Contents
   Key Topics from Shareholder and Advisory Firm Discussions  
Topic #1: We have enhanced the disclosure around the formulas used by Associated to determine the CEO and NEO pay determination for the Annual Incentive Award to make it clearer.
Topic #2: We have enhanced the description of the Long-Term Incentive Performance Plan, to provide a clearer description of the performance goals, including threshold, target and maximum.
Topic #3: Why does Associated use EPS in both the short- and long-term incentive plans?
   Key Changes to Executive Compensation Programs in 2018  
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Committee evaluates the market competitiveness of compensation for each of our executive officers in order to guide target compensation decisions for the coming year. With the assistance of Pay Governance, the Committee reviews the compensation of our executive officers against that of the Company's compensation peer group, as well as the financial services industry in general. At the beginning of 2018, after reviewing the competitive pay data provided by Pay Governance, the Committee decided to make no material changes to the target compensation levels for our NEOs. 
As described above, based on shareholder and shareholder advisory firm feedback on the annual short-term incentive plan, the Committee implemented a 20% upward cap and unlimited downward reduction to the individual executive performance calculation to bolster Associated's formulaic approach to the annual incentive plan calculations. The Committee believes that this addition will further minimize any discretionary aspect of the NEOs annual incentive determination and further align incentive compensation with the performance results of the Company.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     OVERVIEW OF COMPENSATION METHODOLOGY   
[END TABLE]
   Philosophy and Objectives  
Associated's executive compensation program is designed to provide each executive officer of Associated with a competitive total compensation package aligned with several objectives, including:
The Committee used the objectives listed above to drive the methodology for the design of the 2018 Executive Compensation Program with targeted total compensation for the NEOs and other executive officers to approximate median levels for executives with comparable responsibilities at financial institutions of comparable asset size. In addition to compensation levels, the Committee considers Associated's financial performance relative to its peers as part of the determination of total compensation opportunities. The Committee believes that peer comparison is important to the objectives of the program because Associated competes with a large number of financial institutions across the country for the services of qualified executive officers. Consideration was also given to individual factors based on performance evaluations. Where the Committee deems appropriate, total compensation opportunities may exceed the market median in order to attract currently employed, high-quality executives to join Associated and to retain experienced, high-performing executive officers. Conversely, Associated may target compensation below median market levels for newly promoted executives. The allocation of the various components of the NEOs' total compensation package is described below in the "Components of Total Executive Compensation for 2018" section beginning on page 27. 
   Peer Group  
The Committee, with the input of Pay Governance, reviewed the 2017 peer group and made no changes to the peer group for 2018. The Committee noted that the comprehensive review process determined that Associated's asset scope remained aligned with the peer group median. The Committee also ensured that the peer group was comprehensive and included peers that were larger in asset size to allow for aspirational growth comparisons. The 2018 peer group consisted of bank holding companies that the Committee and Pay Governance believe are appropriate for comparison purposes in terms of size (based on total assets) and business composition and consisted of companies ranging in asset size from approximately $22.6 billion to approximately $71.6 billion that were engaged in lines of business similar to Associated. The median asset size of the companies in the peer group was approximately $32.0 billion, compared to Associated's assets of $30.5 billion, as of December 31, 2017. The peer group companies were:  Table of Contents
While the peer group was a key point of comparison in the total compensation strategy, the Committee also took into account broader retail banking and financial services industry survey data as part of its compensation determinations to provide broader market context. Pay Governance analyzed compensation data from the Willis Towers Watson 2017 Executive Financial Services Survey of approximately 186 participants, including members of Associated's peer group. In analyzing the data, Pay Governance advised that the additional comparisons, beyond the peer group, provided a broader perspective from which to appropriately compare compensation, particularly for staff positions. When making compensation-related decisions, the Committee considered information that compared each executive officer's base salary and total compensation to the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of these market reference points. 
   Role of Independent Compensation Consultant  
The Committee has engaged Pay Governance LLC since 2010 to advise on a variety of matters relating to the executive compensation program. Pay Governance reports directly to the Committee and provides no other services to Associated. The Committee has established procedures that it considers sufficient to ensure that the compensation consultant's advice to the Committee remains objective and is not influenced by Associated's management, including:
Pay Governance performed a competitive analysis of Associated's senior executive compensation levels and provided financial performance and other market data with respect to the peer group and a broader financial services survey group as a context for the Committee's assessment of competitive compensation levels, as further described below. 
   Role of Management  
As part of the annual compensation review process, the CEO, the Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Deputy Chief Human Resources Officer interact with the Committee and Pay Governance, providing information about the current compensation structure, details regarding executive compensation, individual performance assessments, and descriptions of the job responsibilities of executive officers. The CEO typically makes recommendations to the Committee with respect to the compensation of NEOs, other than himself, and the Committee, determines CEO compensation in executive session without the CEO present. 
   Role of the Committee  
The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee all of Associated's executive compensation. The Committee works closely with Pay Governance to make program decisions about, and set the framework for, Associated's executive compensation program. Among other things, the Committee's responsibilities include: Table of Contents

   Composition of Total Compensation  
The Committee continually monitors the total compensation of the CEO and NEOs against Associated's pay philosophy and leverages research by Pay Governance in determining appropriate levels of compensation. The Committee focuses on determining the appropriate total compensation levels for the CEO and each NEO. The Committee utilizes input from Mr. Flynn (CEO) in decisions regarding NEO compensation and utilizes Mr. Flynn's assessment of NEO performance against financial and budgetary goal achievement, significant business line project and objective success, and other individual performance objectives. 
Total compensation packages for the CEO and NEOs are composed of both fixed and variable (performance-based) elements and include annual and long-term compensation. The Committee's objective is to deliver the majority of executive compensation through variable pay opportunities that are based on Associated's performance. 
For 2018, variable elements continued to constitute the majority of the CEO and each NEO's total compensation, with long-term, equity-based incentives comprising the majority of the variable component of compensation. With input from Pay Governance, the Committee assessed the competitiveness of Associated's executive compensation levels using multiple market references, including peer groups and industry data. In reviewing the CEOs and NEOs compensation, the Committee determined, with input from Pay Governance, the following with respect to Associated's competitive positioning: Table of Contents
The charts below illustrate the mix of variable (Annual Incentives, Equity Awards and Option Awards) and fixed (Salary) components of the 2018 total compensation awarded to the CEO and the average of the mix of variable and fixed components of the total compensation awarded to all other NEOs, each as presented in the Summary Compensation Table on page 40. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     ANNUAL TOTAL COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
   Base Salary  
The Committee's intention is to pay NEOs base salaries that approximate the midpoint of the market data provided by Pay Governance, with adjustments as the Committee deems necessary to account for individual performance and tenure, or other specific circumstances that may arise in a given year. 
In keeping with the Committee's focus on delivering the majority of executive compensation through variable opportunities that are based on Associated's performance, only one NEO received a market increase to base salary for 2018. The NEO received a market increase in order to move his base salary closer to the market median. Base salaries for the remaining NEOs were determined to be within the targeted market median range. 
   Annual Incentive Award  
Associated's core philosophy is that it takes all colleagues working together to serve our customers for the Company to be successful. That is why we designed our annual incentive program to pay all incentives, other than  Table of Contents commissions, from a single pool that is funded solely on the success of the Company as a whole. Associated's annual incentive program is referred to as the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"). All Participants are paid from a single corporate pool that includes NEOs, the Executive Committee, and all other incentive eligible colleagues. Participants are provided the opportunity to earn an annual incentive payment from a corporate pool, the total amount of which is determined based upon Associated's achievement of objective financial criteria selected by the Committee, but is limited by the annual individual maximum as set forth under the terms of the shareholder approved 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan. 
On an annual basis, the Committee establishes performance criteria and target performance levels for purposes of determining the targeted corporate pool, out of which all awards under the 2018 MIP are paid. The amount of funds available in the corporate pool for distribution to all participants under the MIP is a function of total EPS and ROCET1 Company performance and, for 2018, represented approximately 9.6% of Associated's pre-tax, pre-cash incentive profits. The actual funding amount for the corporate pool was higher than the actual corporate pool for 2017, as financial results exceeded the targeted metrics. 
The EPS and ROCET1 metrics were selected because they are both critical to the long-term success of the Company and are aligned with creating value for shareholders. Both metrics are transparent and are publicly available. When combined we believe these metrics create a balance between profitability and the quality of earnings and reflect the financial success of the Company while protecting the safety and soundness of the Company. 
The performance criteria established under the MIP for 2018 to fund the corporate pool were:
For 2018, the target corporate pool funding of 100% was based on a combination of two performance criteria: (1) EPS target of $1.58, which was set using the new effective corporate tax rate and represented a 4% increase from 2017's actual adjusted results, and (2) ROCET1 with a 100 basis point increase in targeted range of 11.0% to 12.0%. The following matrix sets forth the scale used for funding determinations under the MIP outlining the possible combinations of EPS and ROCET1 performance results, as well as actual 2018 results. 
The amount of funding for the corporate pool increases at each incremental $0.01 of EPS and each range of ROCET1, with ROCET1 to be interpolated outside the target range. In order to incentivize continued company-wide growth, the Committee expects to increase the MIP EPS and ROCET1 targets each year, relative to the prior year's actual performance.  Table of Contents
The graphic below demonstrates the corporate pool funding and distribution methodology. 
Once the amount of the corporate pool is determined, the funds are divided into business line sub-pools, including an executive incentive pool, out of which individual awards are paid. Sub-pools are determined for individual revenue-producing business lines based on actual financial results. The amount of each individual award is determined by the accountable Executive Committee members or, in the case of the members of the Executive Committee, by the Committee based upon the recommendations of the CEO. The target amount for each of the NEOs is based on the previous year's actual incentive payment. This strategy ensures further alignment with Company goals and objectives as the target mimics the rise and fall of corporate performance achievement. 
From time to time, the Committee may choose to distribute the award in multiple forms including cash and equity, as allowed under the 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2017 Plan"). For 2018, given the Company performance and extraordinary financial results, the Committee determined that a split payment of 85% cash and 15% restricted stock was appropriate to ensure continued focus on future earnings results and shareholder value creation. In the example below, Mr. Flynn's incentive amount was determined by multiplying the target incentive amount by the 2018 actual Company performance achievement. The Committee has the ability to modify the payment based on a number of factors as outlined in the 2017 Plan, such as mergers and acquisitions and tax law changes, but determined the calculated incentive award to be appropriate for 2018 without making such adjustments.  Table of Contents
As noted above, the Committee also approved in 2018 the addition of a cap for individual performance adjustments of 20% for upwards adjustments and unlimited downward adjustments of any NEO incentive award. Although our program is largely based on formulaic calculations, the Committee believed that the addition of the upwards cap would ensure that the majority of the incentive was tied to the achievements of the Company's objective performance goals. 
The Committee, utilizing the matrix as set forth above, reported EPS of $1.89 and ROCET1 of 13.15%. This resulted in the corporate pool being funded at 148% of the targeted funding level. The CEO and NEO's annual incentive opportunity are linked directly to Corporate EPS and ROCET1 performance. The incentive earned will rise and fall year to year based on these objective financial results within the MIP Matrix. 
The Committee approved these performance results for purposes of determining the aggregate amount available in the MIP pool for annual incentive payments to all eligible colleagues. The Committee then determined the amount of the MIP payments to each NEO based on the performance incentive formula which multiplies the incentive target by Company performance achievement. The Committee further made limited adjustments based on recommendations by Mr. Flynn based on his evaluation of achievement of strategic goals, business line and individual performance, and a number of individual performance and other qualitative and quantitative factors for each NEO, including, among others; 
Based on these evaluations relating to 2018 performance, Mr. Flynn recommended, and the Committee approved, payouts to Messrs. Del Moral-Niles, Utz, Erickson and Stein as detailed in the table below in the form of restricted stock and cash. NEO individual performance adjustments were minimal and incentive payment was closely aligned to Company performance achievement of 148%. 
Mr. Flynn received a payout detailed below which was in alignment with the Company's financial performance and the Committee's assessment of the CEO's continued positive performance.

     LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION   
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that a significant portion of an executives officers total pay should be represented by and tied directly to the performance of the Company to ensure that the interests of the executive officer and the shareholders are in close alignment. The Committee also believes that the performance of Associated's stock has a strong correlation to the actual total compensation an executive receives over time. To align these interests, the Committee has designed Associated's long-term incentive program to include three key long-term elements: stock options, restricted stock awards and performance-based restricted stock units ("RSUs"), which are granted under the Long-Term Incentive Performance Plan ("LTIPP") described below. For 2018, stock options and restricted stock each represent 25% of the long-term component of the overall program; with performance-based RSUs representing 50% of total long-term incentive. Individual grants, as a percent of base salary, are listed in the table below. 
   Stock Option Component  
Stock options represent a right to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the option is granted. As a result, recipients recognize a value only if and to the extent that the value of the Common Stock increases, aligning the value of the benefit with shareholder interests. The stock options granted in 2018 vest over a four-year period, with one-fourth of the grant vesting in each year, subject to the terms of the 2017 Plan. Long-term variable equity compensation is a significant portion of each NEO's compensation, as indicated by the charts included on page 28. When calculating the value of an option award for the purpose of making these grants, the Committee uses the grant date value of the options. 
   Restricted Stock Component  
Restricted stock represents an award of full value shares that vests over a defined period, the value of which varies based on the performance of Associated's Common Stock, which creates alignment between Executive realized pay and shareholder value. With input from Pay Governance on appropriate award types for the LTIPP, the Committee determined in 2018 that it would grant time-based Restricted Stock Awards (RSAs) in addition to performance-based RSUs as part of Associated's overall compensation mix. 
The RSAs granted in 2018 generally vest over a four-year period, with one-fourth of the grant vesting each year. The grants are subject to the terms of the 2017 Plan. When calculating the value of a restricted stock award for the purpose of making these grants, the Committee used the grant date value of the restricted stock determined on the same basis described on page 40 in the notes to the Summary Compensation Table for such awards. 
   Long-Term Incentive Performance Plan  
Under the LTIPP, participants receive awards of RSUs, calculated as a percentage of each participant's base salary at the inception of the performance period. Actual payouts from the LTIP plan will be based upon Associated's results during the specified measurement period relative to goals approved by the Committee with respect to the particular LTIPP performance measurement period. Grants under the 2018 LTIPP are subject to the terms of the  Table of Contents
2017 Plan. Grants under the 2016 LTIPP are subject to the terms of the Associated Banc-Corp 2013 Incentive Compensation Plan. 
   2018 LTIPP  
The 2018 LTIPP is based on a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2018, and will end on December 31, 2020. Based on the Company's performance during the period, the number of actual shares that vest can range from a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 150% of the target award. 
The performance criteria established by the Committee to determine the vesting of RSUs is based on Associated's cumulative EPS for the performance period and Associated's relative TSR versus its peer group, over the 2018-2020 performance period. The Committee determined that cumulative EPS is an appropriate metric in the LTIPP as Associated's goal is to sustain growth year-over-year (cumulative three-year EPS growth as provided in the LTIPP). The Committee believes that having these related measures in both the MIP and LTIPP (one-year measurement for the MIP and three-year measurement under the LTIPP) ensures focus on both short and long-term strategies that are in the best interests of our shareholders. Additionally, the Committee believes relative TSR, which includes the net change in stock price plus dividends paid during the applicable period, is a valuable measure because it is directly aligned with shareholder interests and encourages management to outperform peers in the creation of shareholder value. 
   2016 LTIPP  
The 2016 LTIPP was based on a three-year performance period that began on January 1, 2016, and ended on December 31, 2018, with the vesting opportunities ranging from a minimum of 25% to a maximum of 150% of the target award. 
The performance criteria established by the Committee to determine the vesting of RSUs was based on Associated's cumulative adjusted EPS for the performance period and Associated's TSR relative to the peer group, measured on the basis of reported TSR for the performance period. 
The vesting grid below was used to determine the vesting level of the 2016 LTIPP award (for performance during 2016-2018) at various EPS performance levels under the 2016 LTIPP, with a payout percentage target of 100% at targeted cumulative EPS of $4.02 and TSR performance between the 40.1 and 60th percentiles of the peer group.  Table of Contents
The target three year cumulative EPS growth rate is set based on the publicly available 20 year BKX Bank Index which takes into account the business cycle. 
As determined based on the vesting grid, tax rate adjusted EPS performance of $4.45 significantly outperformed targeted EPS of $4.02. EPS results in 2017 and 2018 have been tax adjusted to make the final EPS results comparable to the original target using the prior 35% corporate tax rate. The Committee approved the 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.67 to be used with previously approved 2017 adjusted EPS of $1.52 and 2016 reported EPS of $1.26. Combined with Associated's relative TSR ranking at the 20% percentile of the peer group, the RSU award grant applicable to the 2016-2018 performance period vested at 148.5% of target. 
   Risk Assessment  
The Committee, along with members of Associated's Executive Risk Committee, the Incentive Compensation Risk Assessment Committee (ICRA), the Chief Human Resources Officer and business executives responsible for the design and implementation of Associated's incentive compensation arrangements, conducted a full annual executive compensation risk assessment as part of an incentive and sales practice review. Under the governance of the Executive Risk Committee, ICRA was established to define and govern the annual incentive plan risk assessment process which evaluates the effectiveness of Associated's incentive compensation programs and ensures they are in alignment with the Company's safety and soundness principals. Following the reviews with members of Associated's Executive Risk Committee, ICRA, and business executives responsible for the design and implementation of incentive plans, the Committee determined that Associated's compensation plans do not encourage its senior executive officers or colleagues to take unnecessary or excessive risks that threaten the value of Associated, nor do such plans encourage behavior focused on short-term results to the detriment of long-term value creation. The Committee has determined that these plans do not encourage unnecessary risk taking and are consistent with preserving and enhancing the long-term health of Associated.  Table of Contents

     OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS   
[END TABLE]
   Deferred Compensation Plan  
Associated maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan to allow certain colleagues who are deemed to be highly compensated under IRS Section 414(q)(1)(B) to defer current compensation to accumulate additional funds for retirement. All NEOs were eligible to participate in the deferred compensation plan in 2018; however, none elected to participate in 2018. 
The plan allows eligible colleagues to defer up to 50% of base salary and up to 75% of cash incentive compensation. The participant receives payment of deferred amounts either in a lump sum, or five or ten equal annual installments beginning six months following the participant's separation from service or beginning on an in-service date elected by the participant, in either case pursuant to a distribution election made prior to the commencement of deferrals. The plan permits distributions during employment in the event of an unforeseeable emergency. Each participant may, on a daily basis, specify investment preferences from among various investment options for the account, subject to final approval by the Administrator and Trustee. The participant retains all rights to amounts in his or her account if employment terminates for any reason. Deferred compensation plan earnings are unsecured and are not supplemented by Associated. 
   Retirement Plans  
   Retirement Account Plan  
The Associated Banc-Corp Retirement Account Plan ("RAP") is a qualified defined benefit plan with cash balance features designed to provide participants with a monthly income stream in the form of an annuity at retirement. A colleague becomes eligible to participate effective the first day of the plan year in which the participant completes twelve months of service (service is defined as working a minimum of 1,000 hours within the year). Each participant receives an accrual of 3% of eligible compensation. Compensation is subject to the IRS annual limitation, which was $275,000 in 2018. The RAP provides for an annual earnings credit based on the 30-Year Treasury Rate. All participants become fully vested in their accrued benefit upon completion of three years of credited services, attainment of normal retirement (age 65) or upon death or disability while employed by Associated. All NEOs have completed three years of credited service and are 100% vested in their benefits under the RAP. Participants may be eligible to receive an early retirement benefit at age 55. Benefits are subject to an actuarial adjustment for early retirement benefits. 
   401(k) Plan  
Associated offers the Associated Banc-Corp 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan to eligible participants. Participants make contributions to the 401(k) Plan, subject to the limitations established by the IRS. Associated provides a discretionary matching contribution, which in 2018 was equal to 100% of the first 5% of each participant's contribution. Participants who work 1,000 hours during the calendar year and are employed with Associated on December 31 qualify for the matching contribution, with the exception of the participant's retirement, disability or death. All participants are fully vested in both their own contributions and Associated's matching contributions. 
   Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans  
In keeping with its objective of providing a market-competitive executive compensation program designed to attract and retain highly qualified individuals, Associated provides supplemental retirement benefits to a limited number of key colleagues under the Associated Banc-Corp Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, referred to as the "SERP." The SERP is a non-qualified plan into which Associated makes a restoration contribution for amounts that are otherwise restricted due to applicable IRS limitations under Associated's RAP and 401(k) Plan. Participation in the SERP is limited to members of Associated's Executive Committee, which includes the NEOs.  Table of Contents
Associated's contribution to the SERP is equal to the excess of the amount that would have been accrued under the RAP and the 401(k) Plan if not for the IRS annual limitation over the amount actually accrued by the participant for the plan year under those plans. Amounts under the SERP are unsecured and accrue at the same rate and time as accruals under the RAP and 401(k) Plan and incur gains and losses based on notional investment preferences specified by participants among various investment options. All participants in the SERP are fully vested in their SERP account. Distributions from the SERP are generally made in accordance with elections made by the participants. 
 Flynn SERP.    The Committee adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan for Philip B. Flynn effective January 1, 2012. Under Mr. Flynn's SERP, Mr. Flynn retains any and all accrued benefits under the SERP provisions of his expired employment agreement and receives accruals to his SERP account in an amount equal to a percentage of his annual cash base salary and cash incentive, less the amount of the IRS annual compensation limit. This percentage is initially set at 12.5%, although the Committee may decrease or increase this percentage at its discretion, subject to a maximum percentage of 20%. For 2018, the accrual percentage was 12.5%. Accruals based on Mr. Flynn's base salary accrue on the last day of each payroll period, and accruals based on any cash incentives paid to Mr. Flynn will accrue on the date any such cash incentive is paid. All accruals in Mr. Flynn's SERP account are unsecured and are fully vested on the date of such accrual and incur gains and losses based on investment preferences specified by Mr. Flynn among various notional investment options. Distributions from Mr. Flynn's SERP are generally made upon the earlier of his death or at various dates specified by Mr. Flynn prior to the beginning of any plan year. 
   Perquisites  
Limited perquisites provided to NEOs in 2018 included executive physical examinations, which the Committee believes are valuable to Associated by helping to ensure the health and well-being of participants; financial planning services, which are intended to permit the NEOs to focus as much of their time and attention as possible on their responsibilities as executive officers; and the payment of social and similar clubs dues to give the NEOs access to social and similar clubs for business purposes. NEOs are required to pay any other costs attributable to their personal use of social and similar clubs. The NEOs participated in certain other company-subsidized benefits that were also available to all eligible and/or participating colleagues. 
 Employment and Post-Termination Arrangements with Executive Officers  
Each of the NEOs, including the CEO, is currently employed on an "at-will" basis and none of them is party to an employment agreement with Associated. Associated does not generally enter into agreements with executives before or during their employment with respect to any post-termination benefits, nor does Associated guarantee any executive a severance benefit. The Committee believes that each executive officer separation situation should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. This arrangement provides the Committee with maximum flexibility to determine mutually beneficial arrangements for both Associated and its executive officers in the event of a separation. Any severance paid to a former executive will generally be paid pursuant to the Associated Banc-Corp Severance Pay Plan, a fully discretionary severance plan for management colleagues that limits the Committee's award of a severance benefit to a maximum of 200% of a former colleague's annual base salary. 
   Change of Control Agreements  
Recognizing certain trends in change in control agreements, the Committee concluded that it would replace the Change of Control Plan with more updated Change of Control Agreements in 2018 that cover each of the NEOs and certain other executives. The payments and benefits provided under the Agreements are similar in structure and amount to the previous plan, maintain a "double trigger" and are not payable upon (1) a termination of an executive's employment for "Cause" or a resignation by an executive without "Good Reason" or (2) any termination of an executive's employment prior to a "Change of Control" (each as defined in the Agreements). These Agreements are summarized in the "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control" section beginning on page 44.  Table of Contents

     COMPENSATION DECISIONS FOR 2019   
[END TABLE]
The Committee continues to review and make changes to the design of Associated's executive compensation program in order to help ensure that it will continue to meet the performance goals and objectives of the Company and create further value for our shareholders. 
As described on pages 23 and 24, feedback from our shareholders and shareholder advisory services has prompted the Committee to make modifications to the 2019-2021 Long-Term Incentive Performance Plan. Metrics for the 2019-2021 plans, EPS and relative TSR, remain as the selected metrics because the Committee believes those metrics are the most closely aligned to the creation of shareholder value. However, Associated has adopted an additive model for the Long-Term Incentive Performance Plan which will provide equal weighting between each metric. In addition, a threshold of 25% relative TSR has been added with no payout for that metric below threshold. The EPS metric has been further modified by adding a maximum and minimum range of plus or minus 20% of target. Achievement below the 20% minimum will result in no payout for the EPS metric. The payout range for the 2019-2021 LTIPP will range from 0% to 150%, which is a deviation from previous plans where minimum payment began at 25%. The Committee feels these modifications provide closer alignment to actual shareholder value results and strengthens the overall alignment between executive compensation and shareholder interests.

     POLICIES   
[END TABLE]
   Accounting and Tax Considerations  
Associated desires to maximize the return to its shareholders, as well as meet the objectives of the executive compensation program outlined above. As part of balancing these objectives, management (particularly the CEO and the Chief Human Resources Officer) considers the accounting and tax treatment to Associated and, to a lesser extent, the tax treatment to the executive, when making compensation decisions. FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, "Compensation-Stock Compensation" requires all share-based payments to colleagues to reflect the fair value on the date of grant and to be expensed over the applicable vesting period. 
With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act") in late 2017, Code Section 162(m) was significantly revised. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a federal income tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1,000,000 paid to certain covered individuals. The Act repealed "performance-based compensation" exception under 162(m), so, for incentive awards in 2018 and beyond, Associated and other  Table of Contents public companies will no longer have the ability to exempt certain cash and equity awards from the $1,000,000 deductibility limitation as performance-based compensation. This change applies prospectively so that awards qualifying as performance-based compensation payable pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on November 2, 2017, and that are not materially modified will continue to qualify under the performance-based compensation exemption. Additionally, the Act modified the definition of "covered individuals" to now include the CFO in addition to the three most highly compensated officers (other than the CEO and CFO). The Committee's policy with respect to Section 162(m) is to qualify executive compensation for deductibility where practicable and allowable. 
   Clawback of Compensation  
Since 2013, the Committee approved and Associated has had in place, a Clawback Policy that requires any members of the Executive Committee of Associated to repay or return cash incentives and equity awards granted through a performance incentive plan in the event that Associated issues a material restatement of its financial statements due to material noncompliance with securities laws where the restatement was caused by the colleague's intentional misconduct, or if Associated incorrectly calculated without misconduct the performance results of the applicable plans. Where Associated is required to restate any of its financial statements as defined above, Associated shall recover amounts in excess of the cash incentives and equity awards payable under Associated's restated financial statements from the above identified colleagues who received the excess cash incentives and/or equity awards. The Clawback Policy applies to Associated's Management Incentive Plan beginning with the 2013 performance period and to performance incentive plan equity awards beginning with grants made in 2013. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC has issued proposed rules relating to specific clawback requirements. However, the SEC and NYSE have not yet issued final rules relating to clawback requirements. Management will continue to monitor the rule-making process with respect to any revisions that may be required to comply with new regulations. 
   Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging Policy  
Associated's Insider Trading Policy prohibits executive officers and directors from engaging in hedging transactions with respect to Common Stock and from pledging Associated Common Stock as collateral for loans, with the exception, for directors only, of pledges already in place when the prohibition on pledging was adopted in 2012. 
   Security Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers  
Associated has adopted stock ownership guidelines which are applicable to the NEOs, other members of the Executive Committee and other key executives identified by the CEO. The executive stock ownership guidelines are described under "Stock Ownership – Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers and Directors".  Table of Contents
  COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS COMMITTEE REPORT

     POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL   
[END TABLE]
The Change of Control Agreements ("Agreements") provide for certain payments and benefits in the event of a termination without cause or for good reason following a change in control. 
The Agreements provide that upon a termination without Cause or a resignation with Good Reason generally during a two-year protected period (the "protected period") following a Change of Control (each such termination a "Qualifying Termination"), each executive would, in addition to any unreimbursed and accrued but unpaid amounts, be entitled to receive the following payments: Table of Contents
If the executive's employment is terminated during the protected period following a Change of Control due to death or "Disability" (as defined in the Agreements due to death or "Disability"), the executive would not be entitled to the benefits described in the immediately preceding bullets, except for the Prorated Cash Incentive. Additionally, in the event of executive's termination due to death or Disability during the protected period, executive (or executive's estate in the event of executive's death) is also entitled to any death or disability benefits, as applicable, equal to those provided prior to a Change of Control or, if more favorable, those in effect on the date of the executive's death or Disability. 
If an executive's merger related payments or benefits are subject to the 20% excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, then the Agreements provide that the executive will either receive all such payments and benefits subject to the excise tax and pay his or her own excise tax or such payments and benefits will be reduced so that the excise tax does not apply, whichever approach yields the best after tax outcome for the executive. The Agreements do not provide for an excise tax gross up. The Agreements also contain restrictive covenants, which provide for (1) a perpetual confidentiality and mutual non-disparagement and (2) restrictions on interfering with customers and colleagues for six months following any termination of employment. 
In addition to the payments that the NEOs would receive under the Agreements, all unvested options, shares of restricted stock and RSUs held by the NEOs vest upon such a separation within the two-year period following a change of control pursuant to the terms of the 2017 Plan. Additionally, in the event of a termination following attainment of retirement eligibility or the NEO's death or disability, all unvested options, shares of restricted stock and RSUs (performance-based RSUs still remain subject to the applicable performance criteria for determining vesting) held by the NEOs would vest upon such an event. Assuming one of the events in the prior  Table of Contents two sentences (each a "Vesting Event") occurred on December 31, 2018, the value (using the closing price of $19.79) of the accelerated stock is listed in the table below. 
A NEO may also be eligible to receive fully discretionary severance benefits in the event of such NEO's separation other than as a result of a change of control of Associated, pursuant to the Associated Banc-Corp Severance Pay Plan. Because these benefits are fully discretionary, they cannot be estimated for any particular NEO. See "Executive Compensation Discussion and Analysis, Employment and Post Termination Arrangements with Executive Officers." 
   CEO Pay Ratio  
As required by Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information: 
For fiscal 2018, our last completed fiscal year:
Due to several acquisitions during 2018, including the Bank Mutual transaction, the Committee determined to re-calculate the median annual total compensation. Based on this updated information, the ratio for 2018 of the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all colleagues is 96 to 1. 
We completed the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our colleagues and to determine the annual total compensation of our median colleague and CEO:  Table of Contents 
  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION     
The Board's philosophy for director compensation is to provide a balanced competitive total compensation program that allows for the attraction and retention of qualified directors and reflects the increasing demands of being a public company director, the increasing regulation of the banking industry and of publicly traded corporations in general, and the personal risk factors associated with being a director. The Committee evaluates the competitiveness of director compensation on an ongoing basis. The Committee engaged Pay Governance to perform a competitive analysis of Associated's director compensation program and evaluate the levels of pay, pay mix and form with respect to its director compensation programs. These evaluations, among others, have guided director compensation towards the market range of the S&P 400 (of which Associated is a component company). Based on the analysis performed by Pay Governance and other considerations, the Committee concluded that prospective RSU grants would have a one-year vesting requirement (as opposed to a four-year vesting requirement) to better align vesting requirements with peer companies. The material terms of the non-employee director compensation arrangements for 2018 are as follows:
Mr. Flynn does not receive any additional compensation for serving on the Board or chairing the Corporate Development Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     DIRECTORS' DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN   
[END TABLE]
Through its acquisition of other banks and bank holding companies, Associated became the sponsor of several directors' deferred compensation plans. To simplify ongoing administration, Associated established its own directors' deferred compensation plan and merged the predecessor plans into it effective July 1, 1999. Prior to 2013, Associated made monetary contributions into the Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Director Plan") for each non-employee director. Those contributions were required to be invested in an account the balance of which is based on the trading price of Associated Common Stock. 
Directors may defer any or all of their board fees, including retainers under the Director Plan. In an effort to provide directors additional flexibility with respect to managing their annual RSU grants, the Committee amended the Director Plan in late 2018 to permit directors to defer the settlement of some or all of the shares of Common Stock received upon the vesting of their RSU awards, beginning in 2019. Earnings under the Director Plan are based on the performance of plan investment alternatives and are not supplemented by Associated. With the exception of the investment of the Associated contribution referenced above, directors may realign investments as frequently as they wish. Distributions begin six months after a director ceases to serve on the Board, and payments are made according to elections made prior to the commencement of deferrals. Distributions are paid either in a lump sum, or in annual installments over a five-year or ten-year period.  Table of Contents

  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE     
Under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, Associated's directors and executive officers, as well as certain persons holding more than 10% of Associated's stock, are required to report their initial ownership of stock and any subsequent change in such ownership to the SEC, NYSE, and Associated within specified time limits. 
To Associated's knowledge, based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports furnished to Associated and upon written representations of directors and executive officers that no other reports were required, Associated's officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements during 2018, except as follows: one late Form 4 relating to dividend equivalent distributions was filed on behalf of Messrs. Bergstrom, Crowley, Gerken, Hutchinson, Klappa, Nettles and Williams and Mses. Greffin, Kamerick and van Lith; two late Forms 4 relating to a dividend equivalent distribution and a contribution in accordance with the Director Deferred Compensation Plan were filed on behalf of Messrs. Jeffe and Lommen; and one late Form 4 relating to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units was filed on behalf of James Payne in connection with his retirement as an executive vice president from the Company. Each of the late filings were due to administrative delays. 
  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS     
Certain officers and directors of Associated and its subsidiaries, members of their families, and the companies or firms with which they are affiliated were customers of, and had banking transactions with, Associated's subsidiary bank and/or investment subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business during 2018. Additional ordinary course transactions of this type may be expected to take place in the future. All loans and loan commitments were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Associated and, in management's opinion did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. At December 31, 2018, the aggregate principal amount of loans outstanding to directors, officers, or their related interests was approximately $18 million, which represented approximately 0.5% of consolidated stockholders' equity. Cory L. Nettles, a director of Associated since 2013, is the Founder and Managing Director of Generation Growth Capital, Inc. ("Generation Growth Capital"), a private equity fund manager. Prior to Mr. Nettles' appointment to the Board, Associated made aggregate financial commitments of $1.0 million and $1.1 million to Generation Growth Capital Fund I and Generation Growth Capital Fund II, respectively, each of which is managed by Generation Growth Capital. In 2016, Associated committed to an investment of up to $3.0 million in Generation Growth Capital Fund III, which is also managed by Generation Growth Capital. Each of these funds pays or will pay an annual management fee of up to 2.0% to 2.5% of total capital commitments to Generation Growth Capital, and Generation Growth Capital is or will be entitled to a customary 20% carried interest in each fund. Each of these investments was made in the ordinary course of Associated's business and on the same terms as other investors in the funds. Investments made after Mr. Nettles joined the Board were reviewed and approved by the Corporate Governance Committee (without the participation of Mr. Nettles) in accordance with Associated's Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures as described below. Michael T. Crowley, III, the son of Michael T. Crowley, Jr., a director of Associated since February 2018, received total compensation of approximately $120,000 since January 1, 2018 in his capacity as Vice President, Corporate Real Estate Integration Manager of the Company.

     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION POLICIES AND PROCEDURES   
[END TABLE]
We have adopted written Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures regarding the identification, review and approval or ratification of "interested transactions." For purposes of Associated's policy, an "interested transaction" is a transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which Associated and any "related party" are participants involving an amount that exceeds $120,000. Certain transactions are not covered by this policy, including: transactions involving compensation for services provided to Associated as a director or executive officer, ordinary course banking transactions, and transactions where all receive proportional benefits, such as dividends. A related party is any executive officer, director, nominee for election as director or a greater-than-5% shareholder of Associated, and any "immediate family member" of such persons. 
Under the policies and procedures, the Corporate Governance Committee reviews and either approves or disapproves any interested transactions. In considering interested transactions, the Corporate Governance Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. The Related Party Transaction Policies and Procedures can be found on Associated's website at www.associatedbank.com, "Investor Relations," "Governance Documents."  Table of Contents 
  PROPOSAL 3:     
    RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         
The Audit Committee has selected, and the Board has approved, KPMG LLP to serve as Associated's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG LLP audited Associated's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. It is expected that a representative of KPMG LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
If KPMG LLP declines to act or otherwise becomes incapable of acting, or if its appointment is otherwise discontinued, the Audit Committee will appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. If a majority of the votes cast is voted "FOR" this Proposal 3, it will pass. Unless otherwise directed, all proxies will be voted "FOR" Proposal 3. If the shareholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will take the shareholders' vote under advisement.

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and pre-approving any non-audit services to be performed by Associated's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has delegated its pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee to act between meetings of the Audit Committee. Any pre-approval given by the Chairman of the Audit Committee pursuant to this delegation is presented to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee or Chairman of the Audit Committee reviews and, if appropriate, approves non-audit service engagements, taking into account the proposed scope of the non-audit services, the proposed fees for the non-audit services, whether the non-audit services are permissible under applicable law or regulation, and the likely impact of the non-audit services on the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. 
During 2018, each new engagement of Associated's independent registered public accounting firm to perform audit and non-audit services was approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the Chairman of the Audit Committee pursuant to the foregoing procedures. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Associated considers that the provision of the services referenced above to Associated is compatible with maintaining independence by KPMG LLP.

     RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS   
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the selection of KPMG LLP as Associated's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  Table of Contents
  REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE     
The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of Associated's accounting functions and internal controls. The Audit Committee is currently composed of four directors, each of whom meets the independence requirements set forth under the Exchange Act requirements and in NYSE corporate governance rules. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board. The Charter can be found at Associated's website at www.associatedbank.com, "Investor Relations," "Governance Documents." Associated's Board has also determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are "audit committee financial experts" based upon their education and work experience. Associated believes Mr. Gerken is an "audit committee financial expert" based upon his status as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA), and his experience as a CEO overseeing the issuance of public company (mutual fund) financial statements. Associated believes Mr. Jeffe is an "audit committee financial expert" based on his experience as Co-Chair and Co-Founder of a private oil and gas company, his extensive investment banking experience and his service as chair of the audit committees of two private companies. Associated believes Mr. Klappa is an "audit committee financial expert" based upon his experience as Chairman, CEO and CFO of a large, public company. Associated believes Mr. Williams is an "audit committee financial expert" based on his experience as a CEO actively supervising chief financial officers. 
Management is responsible for Associated's internal controls and financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of Associated's consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and to issue a report thereon, as well as an audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the "PCAOB"). The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. In connection with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with management and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss the December 31, 2018 consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications With Audit Committees). The Audit Committee also received written disclosures from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence. 
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board include the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2018 Form 10-K, which has been filed with the SEC.

The foregoing Report of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement into any filing under the Securities Act or under the Exchange Act, except to the extent Associated specifically incorporates this information by reference and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such Acts.

  OTHER MATTERS THAT MAY COME BEFORE THE MEETING     
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Associated is not aware of any matters to be presented for action at the meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. If any matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy form sent herewith, if executed and returned, provides the designated proxies discretionary authority with respect to such matters. 
  SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS     
Proposals of a shareholder submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the SEC ("Rule 14a-8") for inclusion in the proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders to be held April 28, 2020, must be received by Associated at its executive offices no later than November 16, 2019. This notice of the annual meeting date also serves as the notice by Associated under the advance-notice Bylaw described below. A shareholder that intends to present business other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 at the next annual meeting, scheduled to be held on April 28, 2020, must comply with the requirements set forth in Associated's Amended and Restated Bylaws. To bring business before an annual meeting, Associated's Amended and Restated Bylaws require, among other things, that the shareholder submit written notice thereof to Associated's executive offices not less than 75 days nor more than 90 days prior to April 28, 2020. Therefore, Associated must receive notice of a shareholder proposal submitted other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 no sooner than January 29, 2020, and no later than February 13, 2020. If notice is received before January 29, 2020, or after February 13, 2020, it will be considered untimely, and Associated will not be required to present such proposal at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
