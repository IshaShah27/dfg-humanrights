Notice of revocation of your proxy prior to the Annual Meeting should be delivered to DCP Holding Company, Secretary, at the Company's corporate headquarters, 100 Crowne Point Place, Sharonville, Ohio 45241-5427.

PROPOSAL ONE
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Nominees 
Our Board of Directors is currently composed of eleven members and is divided into two classes, with Class I consisting of seven members and Class II consisting of four members. At the 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved a proposal to reduce the size of the Board of Directors from thirteen members to ten members, to be implemented over two years. The members of each class are elected to serve a two-year term with the term of office for each class ending in consecutive years. At this year's Annual Meeting, the terms of our Class I directors will expire, and Class I will be reduced to six members. The six nominees named below are current Class I directors who have been recommended by the Corporate Affairs Committee and nominated for re-election to the Board by a majority of the independent directors. Mr. Anthony A. Cook, our President and CEO, will not stand for re-election as a director. The term of office of each person elected as a Class I director will continue until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
You cannot vote for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this proxy statement. If for any reason any of the nominees is not a candidate when the election occurs (which is not expected), the Board of Directors intends that proxies will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee designated by the Board of Directors as recommended by a majority of the independent directors. The following information is furnished with respect to each person nominated for election as a director.
Recommendation 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of the six nominees listed below.

Meetings and Committees 
Our Board of Directors held a total of eleven meetings during 2017 and also took certain actions by written consent.

We invite, but do not require, our directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All of our directors attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Our Board appoints committees to help carry out its duties. In particular, Board committees work on key issues in greater detail than would be possible at full Board meetings. Each committee reviews the results of its meetings with the full Board. Our Board of Directors had four standing committees during 2017: Audit, Finance, Clinical Affairs and Corporate Affairs.
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee's members are James E. Kroeger, MBA, CPA, Chairman, Molly M. Rogers, MBA, CPA, and Michael J. Carl, DDS.

The Committee is also responsible for appointing, retaining, compensating, overseeing, evaluating and terminating the Company's independent auditors. The Audit Committee alone has the authority to approve all audit engagement fees and terms, as well as all non-audit engagements with the independent auditors. The independent auditors report directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also prepares the Audit Committee Report as it appears in this Proxy Statement. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Kroeger is an "audit committee financial expert", as defined under Regulation S-K Item 407(d)(5). In addition, Mr. Kroeger meets the independence standards applicable to Audit Committee members under the SEC's rules for companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. Mr. Kroeger and Ms. Rogers are "independent" as such term is defined for audit committee members by the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Audit Committee has a charter that includes its risk assessment duties and responsibilities. Periodically the Audit Committee discusses with senior management the Company's significant financial and non-financial risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and mitigate such risks. A copy of the charter is attached as an Appendix to this proxy statement. The charter is not available on the Company's website.
Finance Committee. The Finance Committee's members are Donald J. Peak, CPA, Chairman, Stephen T. Schuler, DMD, David A. Kreyling, DMD, James T. Foley, and Molly M. Rogers, MBA, CPA.

Clinical Affairs Committee. The Clinical Affairs Committee's members are Fred H. Peck, DDS, Chairman, Michael Carl, DDS, and Ronald L. Poulos, DDS. The Committee met twelve times during 2017. The Clinical Affairs Committee is charged with reviewing service patterns of providers and requests for pretreatment estimates that do not clearly meet Company standards. The Clinical Affairs Committee is also charged with retrospective review of covered services provided by dentists to determine whether the frequency and nature of the services are in compliance with standards adopted by the Clinical Affairs Committee. The Clinical Affairs Committee may recommend that the participating agreement of a dentist who is not in compliance with these standards be terminated, suspended or not renewed, or that benefits paid to the provider for particular services rendered by him or her be reduced. The Clinical Affairs Committee also has oversight over the credentialing of new dentist providers that apply to be participating providers in our provider networks. This committee oversees the periodic re-credentialing of dentist providers already in one of our existing provider networks and evaluates whether a dentist should be terminated from one of the provider networks if an action is filed against the dentist with a state department of insurance or other regulatory agency or the provider loses his medical malpractice insurance coverage due to an adverse claim. The Clinical Affairs Committee is also charged in part with determining whether all participating dentists maintain good standing with regulatory agencies. The recommendations of the Clinical Affairs Committee are forwarded to our Board of Directors for consideration and appropriate action.
Corporate Affairs Committee. The Corporate Affairs Committee's (the "Committee") members are Jack M. Cook, MHA, Chairman, James T. Foley, David A. Kreyling, DMD, Ronald L. Poulos, DDS, and Stephen T. Schuler, DMD. Jack M. Cook and James T. Foley are "independent" as such term is defined by the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Committee met six times during 2017. The Corporate Affairs Committee is responsible for the following functions:
1) Benefits and Compensation - The Committee is responsible for discharging the responsibilities of the Board with respect to the compensation of our executive officers. The Committee sets performance goals and objectives for the chief executive officer and the other executive officers, evaluates their performance with respect to those goals and sets their compensation based upon the evaluation of their performance. In evaluating executive officer pay, the Committee periodically retains the services of a compensation consultant and considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the Board with respect to goals and compensation of the other executive officers. The Committee also periodically reviews director compensation. All decisions with respect to executive and director compensation are approved by the Committee. The Committee is responsible for administering our management equity incentive plans. The Committee also periodically reviews compensation and equity-based plans and makes its recommendations to the Board with respect to those plans.
The Committee: (a) reviews and establishes the compensation and benefits for the Company's Named Executive Officers (defined below) and reports these decisions to the Board of Directors; (b) reviews the compensation and benefits for the Company's other senior executive officers; (c) reviews the design of and administers, as appropriate, the Company's broad-based incentive plans; (d) determines and establishes the appropriate retirement and severance packages and benefits to be given by the Company to our Named Executive Officers; (e) monitors the conformity of the aforementioned compensation and incentive packages with various laws and regulatory considerations pertaining to compensation matters; and (f) prepares the Report of the Corporate Affairs Committee for inclusion in this Proxy Statement.
2) Corporate Governance - The Corporate Affairs Committee: (a) reviews the independence and other qualifications of Board members; (b) considers questions of possible conflicts of interest among Board members or management and DCP Holding Company and its subsidiaries; (c) monitors all other activities of Board members or management that could interfere with such individuals' duties to DCP Holding Company; (d) provides periodic review of Board performance and compensation and reports its findings to the Board; and (e) makes recommendations to the Board concerning the composition, size, structure and activities of the Board and its committees.
3) Nominating - Another function of the Corporate Affairs Committee is to recommend to the full Board of Directors persons to be nominated for election as directors. The Corporate Affairs Committee considers nominees recommended by holders of Common Shares (each an "Eligible Nominating Shareholder"), provided that such nominations are submitted in writing to Stephen T. Schuler, DMD, 100 Crowne Point Place, Sharonville, Ohio 45241, not later than February 1 preceding the Annual Meeting. In its evaluation, the Committee does not distinguish between nominees identified by the Committee and nominees recommended by shareholders.
Director Nomination Process 
The Corporate Affairs Committee has adopted a policy regarding director nominations (the "Policy"). The Policy establishes qualifications and factors for selection of persons to be nominated to serve as directors. Those factors reflect the Corporate Affairs Committee's belief that a candidate for the Board should demonstrate experience or expertise needed to offer meaningful and relevant advice and guidance to management, possess the proven ability to exercise sound business judgment, and have consistently demonstrated the highest personal integrity and ethics. The Corporate Affairs Committee evaluates candidates taking into consideration, among other things, the current composition of the Board, the Company's operations and its plan for the future, long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders, and the need to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience, and capabilities. The Policy is subject to periodic review and amendment by the Corporate Affairs Committee in consultation with other independent directors serving on the Company's Board.
The Policy provides that the Corporate Affairs Committee will consider candidates who are duly recommended in writing by Eligible Nominating Shareholders. Each such submission must include a statement of the qualifications of the nominee, a consent signed by the nominee evidencing a willingness to serve as a director if elected, and a commitment by the nominee to meet personally with the Corporate Affairs Committee. In addition, in order for a recommendation to be considered by the Corporate Affairs Committee, the recommendation notice must contain, at a minimum, the following: the name, address, and telephone number of the Eligible Nominating Shareholder making the recommendation; the full legal name, address and telephone number of the individual being recommended, together with a reasonably detailed description of the background, experience and qualifications of that individual; a written acknowledgment by the individual being recommended that he or she has consented to that recommendation and consents to the Company's undertaking of an investigation into that individual's background, experience and qualifications in the event that the Committee desires to do so; any information not already provided about the person's background, experience and qualifications necessary for the Company to prepare the disclosure required to be included in the Company's proxy statement about the individual being recommended; the disclosure of any relationship of the individual being recommended with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether direct or indirect; the disclosure of any relation of the individual being recommended with the Eligible Nominating Shareholder, whether direct or indirect; and, if known to the Eligible Nominating Shareholder, any material interest of such Eligible Nominating Shareholder or individual being recommended in any proposals or other business to be presented at the Company's Annual Meeting of Shareholders (or a statement to the effect that no material interest is known to such Eligible Nominating Shareholder).
The Corporate Affairs Committee determines, and reviews with the Board of Directors on an annual basis, the desired skills and characteristics for directors as well as the composition of the Board of Directors as a whole. This assessment considers the directors' qualifications and independence, as well as diversity, age, skill and experience in the context of the needs of the Board of Directors. With respect to diversity considerations, the Committee seeks representation from general dentistry, dental specialists and oral surgeons for the dentist director seats on the Board. For the non-dentist director positions, the Committee looks for experience with key business areas such as corporate governance, financial reporting, risk management, insurance regulation, health care reimbursement and information technology. The Committee assesses the current directors relative to these diversity criteria and determines the qualifications needed from a new director candidate. In addition, the Committee periodically assesses the Board diversity criteria relative to the Company's current needs and business environment.
At a minimum, directors should share the values of the Company and should possess the following characteristics: high personal and professional integrity; the ability to exercise sound business judgment; an inquiring mind; and the time available to devote to Board of Directors' activities and the willingness to do so. In addition to the foregoing considerations, generally with respect to nominees recommended by shareholders, the Corporate Affairs Committee will evaluate such recommended nominees considering the additional information regarding them contained in the recommendation notices. When seeking candidates for the Board of Directors, the Committee may solicit suggestions from incumbent directors and management. Ultimately, the Corporate Affairs Committee will recommend to the Board of Directors prospective nominees who the Corporate Affairs Committee believes will be effective, in conjunction with the other members of the Board of Directors, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the Company's shareholders.
In 2012, the Corporate Affairs Committee retained a professional search firm to identify and evaluate prospective nominees to stand for election to the Board of Directors. Since 2012, the Committee has not retain a professional search firm for this purpose.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Corporate Affairs Committee of the Board (the "Committee") oversees DCP Holding Company's executive officer compensation and equity-based programs. The Committee reviews and establishes the compensation and benefits for DCP Holding Company's executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement (the "Named Executive Officers") and reviews the principles and strategies that guide the design of compensation plans and benefit programs for all of the Company's senior executive officers. The Committee is composed entirely of non-employee members of the Board.
Executive Summary
The compensation program for the Company's Named Executive Officers is closely linked to Company performance. In 2017, the Company achieved total operating revenue of approximately $107.6 million and net operating income of approximately $4.3 million. If this high level of Company performance continues, the Named Executive Officers may continue to be entitled to increased levels of compensation under the short-term and long-term incentive compensation awards made by the Committee.
Objectives of Compensation Program 
The Company's compensation programs are designed to help recruit, retain and motivate a group of talented and diverse executives, rewarding them for profitable corporate performance and providing incentives for them to create short-term and long-term corporate stability and growth. Accordingly, the key components of the Company's compensation package for its executives are base salary, benefits, short-term and long-term incentive cash compensation and other long-term incentives comprised of restricted share or unit awards. The level of these compensation components for the Company's Named Executive Officers is determined by the Committee.
The Committee's philosophy is that the Company will achieve its best results if its executives act and are rewarded as business owners. Ownership is not only about owning stock, but is also about being accountable for business results. Owners take initiative and responsibility for the assets of the business, including its employees. As executives progress to higher levels at the Company, their responsibilities and rewards will progress as well. Executive compensation programs affect all employees by setting general levels of compensation and helping to create an environment of goals, rewards and expectations. Because we believe the performance of every employee is important to our success, we are mindful of the effect of executive compensation and incentive programs on all of our employees.
We believe that the compensation of our executives should reflect their success as a management team, rather than individuals, in attaining key operating objectives, such as growth of membership, growth of operating revenue, growth of operating earnings and earnings per share and growth or maintenance of market share and long-term competitive advantage, and ultimately, in attaining an increased book value for our Common Shares. We believe that the performance of the executives in managing our Company, considered in light of general economic and specific company, industry and competitive conditions, should be the basis for determining their overall compensation. We seek to have the long-term performance of our Common Shares reflected in executive compensation through our management equity incentive plan.
Elements of Compensation; Determination of Amounts
Elements of compensation for our executives include: salary, short-term and long-term incentive compensation, health, disability and life insurance, limited perquisites and restricted share unit awards. Base salaries are typically set for our executive officers at the regularly scheduled November meeting of our Corporate Affairs Committee. At this meeting, the Committee also approves and adopts performance measures under the management equity incentive plan for the new fiscal year and typically grants restricted share unit awards to all of our executives and certain other eligible employees. These executives and other eligible employees have the option to elect to defer their restricted share unit awards under the Company's deferred compensation plan.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, including 2017, it has been the practice of the Committee to review the history of all the elements of each executive's total compensation and compare the compensation of the executives with that of the executives in an appropriate market comparison group. At the fall meeting referred to above, Anthony A. Cook, our CEO, makes compensation recommendations to the Committee with respect to the executives who report to him. Such executives are not present at the time of these deliberations. The Chairman of the Board then makes compensation recommendations to the Committee with respect to Mr. Cook, who is absent from that meeting. The Committee may accept or adjust such recommendations and also determines the Chairman of the Board's compensation.
We pay each element of compensation to attract and retain the executive talent, reward annual performance and provide incentive for a balanced focus on long-term strategic goals as well as short-term performance. The amount of each element of compensation is determined by or under the direction of the Committee, which uses the following factors, among others, to determine the amount of salary and other benefits to pay each executive:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• performance against corporate and individual objectives for the previous year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• difficulty of achieving desired results in the coming year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• value of their unique skills and capabilities to support long-term performance of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• performance of their general management responsibilities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• contribution as a member of the executive management team.  
[END TABLE]
These elements fit into our overall compensation objectives by helping to secure the future potential of our operations, facilitating our entry into new markets, providing proper compliance and regulatory guidance, and helping to create a cohesive team.
Our policy for allocating between long-term and currently paid compensation is to ensure adequate base compensation to attract and retain personnel, while providing incentives to maximize long-term value for our Company and our shareholders. Likewise, we provide cash compensation in the form of base salary to meet competitive salary norms and reward good performance on an annual basis and in the form of bonus compensation to reward superior performance against specific short-term goals. Historically, we have provided restricted share unit non-cash compensation to reward increased share value and as a means to retain the executive officer. The following items of corporate performance may be taken into account in setting compensation policies:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• membership, operating revenue and corporate earnings compared to our financial plan for that year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• achievement of our strategic objectives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the book value of our Common Shares.  
[END TABLE]
Following our 2017 annual meeting, the Committee also considered the results of the say-on-pay vote and determined that no significant change to the compensation program elements was warranted. The Company currently intends to seek a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation on an annual basis.
Compensation Consultant 
Every two years, with the assistance of an independent executive compensation consultant that reports directly to the Committee, the Committee evaluates the Company's plans and programs for the CEO against current and emerging compensation practices in the insurance industry, legal and regulatory developments and corporate governance trends. In 2016, the Committee engaged the Compensation Service Group ("CSG"), an independent compensation consultant, to evaluate the external competitiveness of Company's compensation program for the CEO. CSG utilized two data sources for this analysis: 1) published compensation surveys and 2) proxy statements of SEC-reporting companies with what CSG believed, generated comparable revenue and net income.
Annually, Mr. Cook, with the assistance of Employers Resource Association, evaluates the Company's plans and programs for the Company's executive staff against the current and emerging compensation practices in the insurance industry. This review provides assurance that the Company's compensation programs are designed to help attract and retain the talent necessary to maintain its long history of strong growth, profitability and shareholder returns.
The Committee annually examines the ongoing competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs, reviews both Company and individual executive performance and reports compensation levels for each Named Executive Officer to the Board. The Committee works to ascertain and establish competitive levels of base compensation, short-term incentive compensation and long-term incentive awards for the Named Executive Officers of DCP Holding Company. Annually, the Committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews compensation levels of the Named Executive Officers against independent surveys of managed care organizations and health insurance companies provided by our compensation consultants. As a part of this work, the Committee validates that total compensation paid is appropriate based on an analysis that compares the Company's performance to the performance reported in these independent surveys. The Committee does not benchmark compensation of our Named Executive Officers against any comparator group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ensures that a significant portion of the total compensation packages for the CEO and CFO are performance-based and that compensation opportunities are designed to create incentives for above-target performance and consequences for below-target performance.  
• Approves the base salary compensation for the Named Executive Officers.  
• Approves the target level of performance-based compensation for the Named Executive Officers and the Company performance goals that must be achieved in order for the Named Executive Officers to receive all or a portion of their performance-based compensation.  
• Approves long-term incentive awards, if any, in the form of grants of restricted share units under the management equity incentive plan and the deferred compensation plan.  
[END TABLE]
While the Committee is solely responsible for establishing the compensation level and components for Mr. Cook, Mr. Cook is responsible for evaluating the compensation level of the other Named Executive Officer(s) and making compensation recommendations to the Committee. Mr. Cook is also involved in establishing individual and departmental objectives and goals with the other Named Executive Officer(s) and evaluating their performance on an annual basis.
Named Executive Officer Compensation 
Base Salaries
It is the goal of the Committee to establish salary compensation for our executives based on our Company's operating performance relative to companies of comparable size in our industry over a three to five year period. In setting base salaries for fiscal 2017, the Committee reviewed the research provided by our compensation consultants in 2016 with respect to the salary compensation of officers with comparable qualifications, experience and responsibilities at comparable companies designated by the compensation consultant. The Committee established our target for the total compensation level for the Named Executive Officers of DCP Holding Company at the midpoint of the range of compensation for comparable positions from the independent surveys of companies within the health insurance industry provided by our compensation consultants. We believe that this gives us the opportunity to attract and retain talented managerial employees both at the senior executive level and below. The Committee, in determining the base salaries for both Mr. Cook and Robert C. Hodgkins, Jr., our CFO, considered several factors, including, but not limited to, the compensation payable to the chief executive officers and chief financial officers of various other companies, including other specialty insurance companies with comparable asset size and premium income. For 2017, the Committee increased the base salary for Mr. Cook from $427,000 to $441,500 and for Mr. Hodgkins from $258,677 to $269,014 in order to establish these base salaries at the appropriate point in the range of compensation for CEO and CFO positions at comparable companies. For 2018, the Committee increased the base salary for Mr. Cook to $454,745 and for Mr. Hodgkins to $277,084.
Short Term Non-Equity Incentive Compensation
The Company has a management non-equity incentive plan which is designed to reward our executives for the achievement of shorter-term financial goals, principally annual increases in plan membership, operating revenue and net operating income. These corporate goals are established at levels that the Committee determines are achievable but also a significant challenge for the executive management team. It is the practice of the Committee to establish these Company performance goals prior to the beginning of the applicable performance year. It is our general philosophy that management be rewarded for their performance as a team in the attainment of these goals, rather than individually. We believe that this is important to aligning our executives and promoting teamwork. As discussed above, the compensation structure is designed to promote the continued growth, profitability and long term financial health of the business.
In 2011, the Committee and Company management undertook an analysis of our compensation policies and practices and determined that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for all of our employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us. However, as a result of our analysis and our compensation objective of achieving an appropriate balance between revenue growth and profitability, the Committee modified the short term management non-equity incentive compensation parameters. For 2016, each executive was eligible to receive thirty percent (30%) of his or her award based on the performance of the Company relative to the established operating revenue goal and fifty percent (50%) of his or her award based on the performance of the Company relative to the established net operating income goal. The remaining twenty percent (20%) of these awards under the plan are granted at the discretion of the Committee in the case of Mr. Cook and at the discretion of the Committee and Mr. Cook in the case of Mr. Hodgkins, based upon achievement by the individual of pre-established individual performance objectives. In December 2016, the Committee established the corporate goals for 2017 of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Target operating revenue of $109,491,594 for 2017, with a threshold level of $98,542,435 and a maximum level of $142,339,072  
● Target net operating income of $4,261,098 for 2017, with a threshold level of $3,195,824 and a maximum level of approximately $5,539,427  
[END TABLE]
These target levels corresponded to our achievement of 100% of the operating revenue and 100% of the net operating income as set forth in our financial plan for fiscal 2017. Under the terms of this plan, the target bonus payable for Mr. Cook was established at 30% of his fiscal 2017 base salary. The target bonus amount for Mr. Hodgkins was established at 20% of his fiscal 2017 base salary.
The Company's total operating revenue for 2017 was $107,589,114. This operating revenue exceeded the threshold level of $98,542,435 but was less than the target level of $109,491,594. The Company's net operating income for 2017 was $4,320,009. This net operating income exceeded the target level of $4,261,098 but was less than the maximum level of $5,539,427. In addition, the Committee evaluated the performance of Mr. Cook relative to the achievement of his position-specific performance objectives, and Mr. Cook evaluated the performance of the other Named Executive Officer relative to his position-specific performance objectives. Based on these performance results, on March 8, 2018, the Committee awarded Mr. Cook a non-equity incentive compensation payment equal to 31.0% of his base salary. The Committee also awarded non-equity incentive compensation to Mr. Hodgkins equal to 30.2% of his base salary.
In December 2017, the Committee established the corporate goals for 2018 of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Target operating revenue of $112,576,623 for 2018, with a threshold level of $101,318,961 and a maximum level of $146,349,610  
● Target net operating income of $4,710,351 for 2018, with a threshold level of $3,532,763 and a maximum level of approximately $6,123,456  
[END TABLE]
These target levels corresponded to our achievement of 100% of the operating revenue and 100% of the net operating income as set forth in our financial plan for fiscal 2018. Under the terms of this plan, the target bonus payable for Mr. Cook was established at 30% of his fiscal 2018 base salary. The target bonus amount for Mr. Hodgkins was established at 20% of his fiscal 2018 base salary.
Long Term Non-Equity Incentive Compensation
In 2007, the Committee established a long term non-equity incentive compensation arrangement for Mr. Cook. This long-term non-equity incentive arrangement is intended to motivate Mr. Cook to achieve long term success for the Company as well as assist in the retention of Mr. Cook. This long-term non-equity incentive arrangement is designed to reward Mr. Cook for increasing the aggregate book value of our Common Shares over the four year period from 2008 through 2011 and was included in Mr. Cook's employment contract for 2008. Mr. Cook's employment contracts for 2009 and 2010 also included similar long term non-equity incentive arrangements for the period from 2009 through 2012 and 2010 through 2013, respectively. Mr. Cook's employment contract for 2011 included a long term non-equity incentive arrangement for the period from 2011 through 2014 whereby Mr. Cook is rewarded for increasing the aggregate book value of the Common and Preferred Shares over the four year period, adjusted for any Common Share dividends paid or provider withhold paid during the four-year period.
In 2011, the Committee changed from this long term non-equity incentive compensation arrangement to a long term equity incentive compensation arrangement for Mr. Cook for the three year period from 2012 – 2014 and for the three year period from 2013 – 2015. The Committee also made Mr. Hodgkins eligible to participate in these long term equity incentive compensation arrangements (see Long Term Equity Incentive Compensation). Then, in 2013, the Committee decided to discontinue the long term equity incentive compensation arrangement and to resume the long term non-equity incentive compensation arrangement for both Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins. The Committee made this decision in order to eliminate the dilutive effect of additional outstanding RSUs on the return on equity of the Company's Common Shareholders.
Mr. Cook's and Mr. Hodgkins's employment contracts for 2017 and 2018 included a long term non-equity incentive arrangement for the period from 2017 through 2019 and from 2018 through 2020 whereby Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins are rewarded for increasing the adjusted book value per Common Share over the three year period, adjusted for any Common Share dividends paid or provider withhold paid during the three-year period. The following is a summary of the results relative to these long term non-equity incentive compensation programs.
2008 – 2011 Period 
The threshold level for the aggregate book value of Common Shares was not achieved for the four year period. Accordingly, no incentive compensation was paid to Mr. Cook.
2009 – 2012 Period 
The threshold level for the aggregate book value of Common Shares was not achieved for the four year period. Accordingly, no incentive compensation was paid to Mr. Cook.
2010 – 2013 Period 
The threshold level for the aggregate book value of Common Shares was not achieved for the four year period. Accordingly, no incentive compensation was paid to Mr. Cook.
2011 – 2014 Period
The maximum level for the aggregate book value of Common and Preferred Shares was achieved for the four year period. Mr. Cook received a payment related to this incentive compensation of $23,417 in March 2014 and $117,087 was paid to Mr. Cook in March 2015.
2014 – 2016 Period
For the 2014 – 2016 period, the performance metric was changed from the aggregate book value of the Common and Preferred Shares to the aggregate book value of the Common Shares. The maximum level for the aggregate book value of the Common Shares was achieved for the three year period. Mr. Cook received a payment of $181,350, and Mr. Hodgkins received a payment of $106,650 in March 2017.
2015 – 2017 Period
For the 2015– 2017 period, the performance metric was the aggregate book value of the Common Shares. The target level for the aggregate book value of the Common Shares was $12,173,466. The maximum level for the aggregate book value of the Common Shares was achieved for the three year period. Mr. Cook received a payment of $194,997, and Mr. Hodgkins received a payment of $111,499 in March 2018.
2016 – 2018 Period
For the 2016 – 2018 period, the performance metric was the adjusted book value per Common Share. The target level for the adjusted book value per Common Share at December 31, 2018 is $1,346.60. At this time, the expected level for the adjusted book value per Common Share as of December 31, 2018 is the target level. Accordingly, the Company has established a compensation liability to Mr. Cook and to Mr. Hodgkins based on the target level of performance. If the target level is achieved as of December 31, 2018, the amount payable to Mr. Cook will be $64,050 and the amount payable to Mr. Hodgkins will be $38,802. In 2017, the Company increased the bonus payable liability related to this long term incentive compensation arrangement for Mr. Cook by $21,350 and for Mr. Hodgkins by $12,934. These amounts are included in the non-equity incentive compensation for Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins in the Summary Compensation Table.
2017 – 2019 Period
For the 2017 – 2019 period, the performance metric was the adjusted book value per Common Share. The target level for the adjusted book value per Common Share at December 31, 2019 is $1,476.82. At this time, the expected level for the adjusted book value per Common Share as of December 31, 2019 is the target level. Accordingly, the Company has established a compensation liability to Mr. Cook and to Mr. Hodgkins based on the target level of performance. If the target level is achieved as of December 31, 2019, the amount payable to Mr. Cook will be $66,225 and the amount payable to Mr. Hodgkins will be $40,352. In 2017, the Company increased the bonus payable liability related to this long term incentive compensation arrangement for Mr. Cook by $22,075 and for Mr. Hodgkins by $13,451. These amounts are included in the non-equity incentive compensation for Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins in the Summary Compensation Table.
2018 – 2020 Period
For the 2018 – 2020 period, the performance metric was the adjusted book value per Common Share. The target level for the adjusted book value per Common Share at December 31, 2020 is $1,610.90. At this time, the expected level for the adjusted book value per Common Share as of December 31, 2020 is the target level. Accordingly, the Company has established a compensation liability to Mr. Cook and to Mr. Hodgkins based on the target level of performance. If the target level is achieved as of December 31, 2020, the amount payable to Mr. Cook will be $68,212 and the amount payable to Mr. Hodgkins will be $41,563. In 2018, the Company increased the bonus payable liability related to this long term incentive compensation arrangement for Mr. Cook by $22,825 and for Mr. Hodgkins by $13,908.
Management Equity Incentive Plan 
Our Management Equity Incentive Plan is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentive compensation. We also regard our Management Equity Incentive Plan as a key retention tool. With respect to long-term incentive awards, the Committee implemented the 2006 DCP Holding Company Management Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, which ties a portion of executive compensation to restricted share unit awards that increase in value with the value of the Company's Common Shares.
Retention Incentive Plan
In 2017, the Committee granted to the Named Executive Officers a number of restricted share units ("RSUs") with a book value at the beginning of the year equal to approximately 5% of each individual's base salary. These grants were approved at the regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee which was held in December 2016 to be effective January 2, 2017. The Committee apprised the Board of Directors of these grants in December 2016. A Named Executive Officer must be a Company employee for more than one year before becoming eligible to receive RSU grants. These RSUs vest over the course of a four year period, with 10% vesting in year one, 20% vesting in year two, 30% vesting in year three and 40% vesting in year four. There are no performance criteria associated with the vesting of these RSUs. The only requirement for vesting is that the individual is an employee of the Company at the end of the applicable vesting year. The Committee made no grants of RSUs for 2018 as of the date of this Report.
Long Term Equity Incentive Plan
Mr. Cook's employment contract for 2012 included a long term equity incentive arrangement for the period from 2012 through 2014 whereby Mr. Cook is awarded restricted share units ("RSUs") in lieu of cash for achieving the Company's long term performance objectives. In addition the Committee decided to extend this long term equity incentive plan to Mr. Hodgkins, the CFO. This long term equity incentive plan was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2012. The parameters of Mr. Cook's and Mr. Hodgkins's long term equity incentive arrangements for the period from 2012 through 2014 are shown below.

The adjusted book value of the Company's Common and Preferred Shares as of December 31, 2014 was $12,869,694. Given that the adjusted book value of the Common and Preferred Shares is greater than the maximum level shown above, the 229 RSUs awarded to Mr. Cook and the 139 RSUs awarded to Mr. Hodgkins associated with the maximum performance level are now fully vested.
Mr. Cook's employment contract for 2013 included a long term equity incentive arrangement for the period from 2013 through 2015 whereby Mr. Cook is awarded RSUs in lieu of cash for achieving the Company's long term performance objectives. In addition the Committee decided to extend this long term equity incentive plan to Mr. Hodgkins, the CFO. This long term equity incentive plan was approved by the Board of Directors in February 2013.

Because of the evolution of regulatory, tax and accounting treatment of equity incentive programs and because it is important to us to retain our named executive officers, we determined that it is important to provide our executive officers with the ability to elect to receive the value of their vested RSUs as deferred compensation in lieu of taxable restricted share awards. Accordingly, the Company has established the DCP Holding Company Deferred Compensation Plan. Under the terms of the deferred compensation plan, our executives can elect to defer a portion of their cash compensation and their granted RSUs as they vest. Because deferred cash compensation and deferred RSUs can appreciate in value on a tax-deferred basis, we believe that this is a more efficient way to reward them for and motivate them toward superior long-term performance.
To measure the amount of our obligation to each participant under the plan, we maintain a separate bookkeeping record for each participant, which we refer to as an "account." Participants may direct the investment of the portion of the account allocable to that participant in certain mutual funds, or the participant may direct the investment to our tracking shares. We then credit or debit the participant's account with earnings or losses based upon the performance results of the notional investment options selected by the participant. The participant may change the allocation of his or her account among the investment alternatives then available under the plan.  For management employees, we pay deferred balances upon retirement, termination from employment, death or disability, or at a fixed date determined by the participant.  We pay deferred balances in cash. A Named Executive Officer may defer receipt of Common Shares that otherwise would be issued on the date that RSUs vest until after the person has a separation from service or until a fixed future date. 
Perquisites 
We limit the perquisites that we make available to our executives. Our executives are entitled to few benefits that are not otherwise available to all of our employees. In this regard it should be noted that we do not provide pension arrangements, post-retirement health coverage, or similar benefits for our executives or employees.
The perquisites we provided in fiscal 2017 are as follows: The Named Executive Officers each received a monthly car allowance and Mr. Cook was authorized to be reimbursed for club membership fees.
Our health and insurance plans are the same for all employees. In general, our employees that have elected the high deductible health plan with the health saving account pay approximately 22% of the health premium due and receive employer health savings account contributions. Our employees who elect the traditional PPO health plan pay approximately 35% of the health premium due. Employees that elect to not participate in the Company's health insurance plan receive a monthly health care cost allowance of $200.00. All employees who participated in our 401(k) plan received matching funds equal to 50% of the first 4% of their base salary that they elect to contribute into the 401(k) plan. All of our Named Executive Officers participated in our 401(k) plan and received matching funds. All employees are allowed to receive cash for unused vacation time in accordance with the provisions of the Company's Employee Handbook.
The vesting of certain of the equity and non-equity incentive plan compensation for the Named Executive Officers shown below will be contingent upon both the achievement of specific Company performance criteria over a three year period and continued employment with the Company.

 (1)   The long term non-equity incentive compensation plans for Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins for the three year period from 2017 – 2019 were approved on May 2, 2017. The target amounts for this long term non-equity incentive compensation plan were established at 15% of the 2017 base salaries of Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins of $441,500 and $269,014, respectively. The long term non-equity incentive compensation is based on the growth in the adjusted book value per Common Share from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019 (See Long Term Non-Equity Incentive Compensation)   On December 13, 2017, the short term non-equity incentive plan compensation target amount for Anthony Cook was established at 30% of his fiscal 2018 base salary of $454,745 or $136,424 for the short term non-equity incentive plan for 2018. The short term non-equity incentive plan compensation target amount was established at 25% of his fiscal 2018 base salary for Mr. Hodgkins. These performance target levels correspond to our achievement of 100% of operating revenue and 100% of net operating income as set forth in our financial plan for fiscal 2018.

 (2)   Represents the current book value of the RSUs granted to the Named Executive Officers pursuant to the Company's Retention Incentive Plan component of the 2006 Dental Care Plus Management Equity Incentive Plan in January 2017: Anthony A. Cook, 20 shares and Robert C. Hodgkins, Jr., 12 shares. Because each Named Executive Officer elected to defer receipt of these shares pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan, the shares are treated as phantom shares pursuant to the Company's Deferred Compensation Plan. Each phantom share is the economic equivalent to one Class B Common Share and under the Deferred Compensation Plan will be settled in cash when each Named Executive Officer terminates his status as an employee of the Company. The RSUs vest over a period of 4 years on the anniversary of the date of grant as follows: January 2017 grants - 10% 2017, 20% 2018, 30% 2019, 40% 2020. (See Retention Incentive Plan on)  
 (3)   The amounts relative to the Retention Incentive Plan reflected above assume a grant date fair value per Class B Common Share for the January 2017 grants of $1,109.56 as of December 31, 2016.

Other Post-Employment Payments 
All of our employees are employees-at-will and as such do not have employment agreements with us, except in the case of Anthony A. Cook, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Robert C. Hodgkins, Jr., Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also do not provide post-employment health coverage or other benefits; provided, however, upon termination of employment each Named Executive Officer is entitled to a lump sum payment for unused vacation time based on the Named Executive Officer's current salary.
Employment Agreements 
In May 2017, we executed a Twelfth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Anthony A. Cook for the year from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and in February 2018, we executed a Thirteenth Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Anthony A. Cook for the year from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 that is automatically extended for additional one year periods on the same terms and conditions unless on or prior to November 15th of any year the Company or Mr. Cook provides written notice to the other party of termination of the Employment Agreement at the end of the current one-year term. This agreement provides for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment, other than for cause. In the event that the Company is sold, transferred and/or merged with another entity, it will be not be deemed an event of good cause to terminate Mr. Cook. The benefits to be received by Mr. Cook whose employment is terminated without good cause include: receipt of a severance pay for up to 8 months at Mr. Cook's then current monthly salary, eligibility to receive a bonus pro-rated through the date of termination, and continuation of health, life and disability benefits for eight months after the termination of employment.
If a termination of the employment of Mr. Cook without good cause, or change in control, had occurred as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that the value of the benefits under his employment agreement and our management equity incentive plan (as discussed below) would have been as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     Severance Pay (1)       Continuation of Benefits (2)       Accelerated Vesting of RSUs (3)       Potential LTIC Cash Payment (4)       Total    
 Name     Severance Pay (1)       Continuation of Benefits (2)       Accelerated Vesting of RSUs (3)       Potential LTIC Cash Payment (4)       Total    
 (1)            In the event that the Company terminates Mr. Cook's employment agreement without good cause, or Mr. Cook terminates his employment agreement for good reason, such as a material breach by the Company of any provision of the agreement or if Mr. Cook is assigned duties that are materially inconsistent with his skill, position, and background, Mr. Cook is entitled to severance pay. Mr. Cook is also entitled to severance pay in the event of a change of control. A "change of control" means: (a) a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors, unless pursuant to the recommendation of the Corporate Affairs Committee of the Board; (b) the acquisition of the Company by another corporation or entity and (c) the sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. In accordance with Mr. Cook's employment agreement, severance pay is based on up to 8 months of his 2017 base salary; assumes payout of bonus at target. Mr. Cook would receive payment related to his assets in the deferred compensation plan.  
 (3)       Under our management equity incentive plan, on the date a change of control occurs, the restrictions applicable to all RSUs lapse and these awards fully vest. If a change of control had occurred on December 31, 2017, Mr. Cook would have received accelerated vesting with respect to 40.4 unvested RSUs, with a value of $48,896. The value for accelerated vesting of RSUs is determined by multiplying the per share book value of our common shares on December 31, 2017 of $1,210.29 by the number of RSUs as to which vesting would accelerate.

In May 2017, we executed the Second Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Robert C. Hodgkins, Jr. for the year from January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and in February 2018, we executed a Third Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Robert C. Hodgkins, Jr. for the year from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018 that is automatically extended for additional one year periods on the same terms and conditions unless on or prior to November 15th of any year the Company or Mr. Hodgkins provides written notice to the other party of termination of the Employment Agreement at the end of the current one-year term. This agreement provides for certain benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment, other than for cause. In the event that the Company is sold, transferred and/or merged with another entity, it will be not be deemed an event of good cause to terminate Mr. Hodgkins. The benefits to be received by Mr. Hodgkins whose employment is terminated without good cause include: receipt of a severance pay for up to 8 months at Mr. Hodgkins's then current monthly salary, eligibility to receive a bonus pro-rated through the date of termination, and continuation of health, life and disability benefits for eight months after the termination of employment.
If a termination of the employment of Mr. Hodgkins without good cause, or change in control, had occurred as of December 31, 2017, we estimate that the value of the benefits under his employment agreement and our management equity incentive plan (as discussed below) would have been as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     Severance Pay (1)       Continuation of Benefits (2)       Accelerated Vesting of RSUs (3)       Potential LTIC Cash Payment (4)       Total

 (1)            In the event that the Company terminates Mr. Hodgkins's employment agreement without good cause, or Mr. Hodgkins terminates his employment agreement for good reason, such as a material breach by the Company of any provision of the agreement or if Mr. Hodgkins is assigned duties that are materially inconsistent with his skill, position, and background, Mr. Hodgkins is entitled to severance pay. Mr. Hodgkins is also entitled to severance pay in the event of a change of control. A "change of control" means: (a) a change in the majority of the members of the Board of Directors, unless pursuant to the recommendation of the Corporate Affairs Committee of the Board; (b) the acquisition of the Company by another corporation or entity and (c) the sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company. In accordance with Mr. Hodgkins's employment agreement, severance pay is based on up to 8 months of his 2017 base salary; assumes payout of bonus at target. Mr. Hodgkins would receive payment related to his assets in the deferred compensation plan.  
 (2)     Also in accordance with Mr. Hodgkins's 2017 employment agreement, continuation of benefits is based on continuation of 401(k) match, all medical, dental, vision and disability benefits, and payment of accrued vacation time as of December 31, 2017.  
 (3)     Under our management equity incentive plan, on the date a change of control occurs, the restrictions applicable to all RSUs lapse and these awards fully vest. If a change of control had occurred on December 31, 2017, Mr. Hodgkins would have received accelerated vesting with respect to 24.4 unvested RSUs, with a value of $29,531. The value for accelerated vesting of RSUs is determined by multiplying the per share book value of our common shares on December 31, 2017 of $1,210.29 by the number of RSUs as to which vesting would accelerate.  
[END TABLE]
Payments on Change of Control 
In addition to the payments on termination of employment and change of control for Mr. Cook and Mr. Hodgkins discussed above, our other key employee is entitled to certain benefits on a change of control. 
Definition of Change of Control.    Under our management equity incentive plan, a "change of control" means any of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the acquisition by any entity of beneficial ownership of 50% or more of the combined voting power of our then-outstanding voting securities (other than any acquisition directly from us or any of our affiliates or employee benefit plans); or  
• during any period of 24 consecutive months, a change in a majority of the members of our Board, other than directors approved by a vote of at least a two-thirds of the incumbent directors; or  
• the occurrence of any transaction requiring shareholder approval for the acquisition of the Company or DCP (other than by us, DCP, or any other affiliate) through purchase of assets, by merger, or otherwise; or  
• our shareholders approve the complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or DCP.  
[END TABLE]
Payments on Change of Control.    Under our management equity incentive plan, on the date a change of control occurs, the restrictions applicable to all RSUs lapse and these awards fully vest. If a change of control had occurred on December 31, 2017, our other key employee would have received benefits with respect to unvested RSUs, with such value for the accelerated vesting of the RSUs determined by multiplying the per share book value of our common shares on December 31, 2017 by the number of RSUs as to which vesting accelerated.

For 2017, director compensation includes an award of eighteen (18) RSUs for each non-employee director with a grant date fair value of $1,109.56.

Overview of Director Compensation and Procedures 
Director compensation is the responsibility of the Corporate Affairs Committee (the "Committee"). The director compensation objectives and principles established by the Committee are that: (1) directors should be appropriately compensated for their time and effort; and (2) director compensation should be approached on an overall basis, should motivate behavior and be aligned with the long-term interest of the shareholders. The Committee reviews the level of compensation of our directors every two years. To determine how appropriate the current level of compensation for our directors is, we have historically obtained data from a number of different sources including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• publicly available survey data describing director compensation ranges for reporting companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• information obtained from the National Association of Corporate Directors.  
[END TABLE]
 The Committee has determined that the compensation of our directors for 2016 is within the bottom quartile of the compensation of directors of companies of comparable size in our industry based upon these sources.
Director Compensation 
We compensated non-employee members of the Board through a combination of cash and equity-based compensation. For 2017, each non-employee member of the Board received total compensation of $44,972, with the exception of the Chairman of the Board who received $78,972, the Chairman of the Audit Committee who received $64,772, the Chairman of the Finance Committee who received $49,972, the Chairmen of the Corporate Affairs Committee and the Clinical Affairs Committee who both received $47,472, and James T. Foley who received $54,972. Dr. Bronson and Dr. Hamilton only received $19,291 because they only served on the Board for the first 5 months of 2017.
In 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company formed a Special Committee consisting of Stephen T. Schuler, James T. Foley, James E. Kroeger and Anthony A. Cook to evaluate and make recommendations to the Board regarding strategic alternatives available to the Company. In 2017, Stephen T. Schuler received $10,000, James T. Foley received $9,800 and James E. Kroeger received $9,800 for serving on the Special Committee. These amounts are included in the totals above.
Our directors may defer receipt of some or all of their annual fees earned under The DCP Holding Company / Dental Care Plus, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Plan"). Under this Plan, directors may either invest deferred compensation in DCP Holding Company stock equivalents or in a tax-managed mutual fund.
In December 2016, our non-employee directors each were granted a restricted share unit award for 2017 entitling each of them to receive 18 restricted share units with a book value of $1,109.56 per unit as of December 31, 2016. All twelve non-employee directors elected not to defer this compensation. The vesting of these restricted share unit awards was conditioned upon the attendance by each director of at least 75% of their scheduled meetings during 2017. In January 2018, DCP Holding Company management determined that all twelve non-employee directors met the 75% attendance requirement for 2017. Accordingly, all of these restricted share awards for these twelve non-employee directors are now fully vested. As of the date of this Report, no restricted share awards have been granted to our non-employee directors for 2018.
REPORT OF CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE 
The Corporate Affairs Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the "CD&A") with management for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement.
By the Corporate Affairs Committee of the Board of Directors:
Jack M. Cook, MHA, Chairman
James T. Foley
David A. Kreyling, DMD
Ronald L. Poulos, DDS
Stephen T. Schuler, DMD
CORPORATE AFFAIRS COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
Our Corporate Affairs Committee currently consists of Jack M. Cook, MHA, James T. Foley, David A. Kreyling, DMD, Ronald L. Poulos, DDS, and Stephen T. Schuler, DMD. No interlocking relationship exists between any member of our Board of Directors or Corporate Affairs Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company, nor has any such interlocking relationship existed in the past. No member of the Corporate Affairs Committee is or was formerly an officer or an employee of DCP Holding Company. 
PROPOSAL TWO
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Executive compensation is an important matter for the Company's shareholders. As discussed in Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"), a fundamental principle the Company's executive compensation philosophy and practice continues to be to pay for performance. The Company believes that the Company's Named Executive Officers and other key executives are compensated in a manner consistent with the Company's strategy, competitive practice, sound corporate governance principles, and shareholder interests and concerns. The Company believes that the Company's compensation programs are strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. You are urged to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement for additional details on the Company's executive compensation, including the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives and the 2017 compensation of the Named Executive Officers.
In 2010, Congress enacted legislation that was signed into law by President Obama that requires a non-binding advisory "say-on-pay" vote on executive compensation. Therefore, the Company is asking shareholders to vote on the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, compensation paid to the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement at CD&A, the compensation tables and related narrative disclosure.
As an advisory vote, this proposal is non-binding. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Corporate Affairs Committee value the opinions of our shareholders, and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for the Company's Named Executive Officers. The non-binding advisory vote on our executive compensation requires an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by our Common Shares, voting as a group, present in person or by proxy at the meeting. Absentions will count as votes against the proposal and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome.
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that the shareholders vote "FOR" the proposal set forth above.   
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS, PROMOTERS AND CERTAIN CONTROL PERSONS 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
A related party transaction is a transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K or any other similar transaction involving (i) the Company and the Company's subsidiaries and (ii) any Company employee, officer, director (including a nominee), 5% shareholder or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing without regard to the dollar amount involved.
It is also the policy of the Company that a related party transaction as defined above will not be prohibited merely because it is required to be disclosed or because it involves related parties. Instead, it must be disclosed in advance to the Company and then may be approved by the Corporate Affairs Committee or, under certain circumstances, by the Board of Directors, if it does not present any improper conflicts of interest.
The Corporate Affairs Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for applying the Company's policies and procedures relative to related party transactions. The Audit Committee has been assigned the responsibility of monitoring potential related party transactions and reporting them to the Corporate Affairs Committee. The development of the Company's policies and procedures relative to related party transactions and the Company's adherence to these policies are documented in the meeting minutes of the Board of Directors and the Corporate Affairs and Audit Committees.
Transactions with Related Persons 
Seven members of the Company's Board of Directors are participating providers in the Company's dental plans. One dentist director, Ronald Poulos, received claims payments of $441,925 in 2017. The payments made to Dr. Poulos were for dentist claims that he submitted as a participating dentist in the Company's dental plans and were made on the same terms as those applicable to other participating dentists. The seven dentist directors combined received claims payments of $698,658 in the aggregate in 2017.
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2019 ANNUAL MEETING
Any shareholder proposals intended to be presented at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received by the Secretary of the Company at 100 Crowne Point Place, Sharonville, Ohio, 45241-5427 on or before December 22, 2018, for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. As to any proposal that a shareholder intends to present to shareholders other than by inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the proxies named in the management's proxy for that meeting will be entitled to exercise their discretionary voting authority on that proposal unless the Company receives notice of the matter to be proposed not later than March 23, 2019. Even if proper notice is received on or prior to March 23, 2019, the proxies named in the Company's proxy for that meeting may nevertheless exercise their discretionary authority with respect to such matter by advising the shareholders of that proposal and how they intend to exercise their discretion to vote on such matter, unless the shareholder making the proposal solicits proxies with respect to the proposal to the extent required by Rule 14a-4(c)(2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of DCP Holding Company's Common Shares to file initial reports of ownership on Form 3 and changes in ownership on Form 4 or Form 5 with the SEC. These executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all such forms that they file.  Based on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, we believe that during fiscal 2017 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders were complied with.
OTHER MATTERS
Principal Accountant Fees and Services
The following table sets forth the fees paid or accrued by us for services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, for each of our last two fiscal years:

 Total    $ 367,690     $ 415,278   
[END TABLE]
(1) Includes professional services rendered for audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements and a statutory audit of our insurance subsidiary.
(2) Includes assurance and related services such as the 2017 service organization report (under SSAE 18), and consents and reviews of reports filed with the SEC.
 Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services by category, including audit-related services, tax services and other permitted non-audit services, if any, to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Company. In accordance with the policy, the Audit Committee regularly reviews and receives updates on specific services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
All services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP to the Company are permissible under applicable laws and regulations. During 2017, all services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the Committee's pre-approval policy. We have selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP, which served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm during 2017, are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Miscellaneous
If the enclosed proxy card is executed and returned to us, the persons named in it will vote the shares represented by that proxy at the meeting. The form of the proxy permits specification of a vote for the election of directors as set forth under "Election of Directors" above, the withholding of authority to vote in the election of directors, or the withholding of authority to vote for one or more specified nominees. The form of proxy permits specification of an advisory vote on the compensation of our executive officers, as a vote "FOR", "AGAINST", or "ABSTAIN". When a choice has been specified in the proxy, the Common Shares represented will be voted in accordance with that specification. If no specification is made, those Common Shares will be voted at the meeting to elect directors as set forth under "Election of Directors" above and "FOR" approval of the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. Under Ohio law broker non-votes and abstain votes will not be counted in favor of or against any nominee but will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum has been achieved at the meeting. As stated above, director nominees who receive the greatest number of affirmative votes will be elected directors. All other matters to be considered at the meeting require the approval of a majority of the Common Shares represented at the meeting in person or by proxy (or such different percentage as established by applicable law). If any other matter properly comes before the meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their judgment.

DCP Holding Company
Audit Committee Charter
Amended and Restated – November 7, 2017
Purpose
The purposes of the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors (the "Board") of DCP Holding Company (the "Company") are (i) to assist the Board in overseeing (a) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company and the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, (b) the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, when required, (c) the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (d) the Company's independent auditor's qualifications and independence, and (e) the performance of the Company's independent auditor; and (ii) to prepare the report required by the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to be included in the Company's annual proxy statement.
In addition to those set forth in this Charter, the Committee will have such additional authority and responsibilities as may be granted to or imposed on audit committees from time to time by applicable law, SEC rules, or applicable listing standards, if any, and shall discharge all of its authority and responsibilities in accordance therewith. The Committee may conduct or authorize the conducting of such investigations within the scope of its authority and responsibilities as it considers appropriate, and may retain, at the Company's expense, such legal, accounting or other advisers as the Committee considers necessary or advisable for the full and faithful execution thereof. In discharging its responsibilities, the Committee is not responsible for planning or conducting audits or for any determination that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable rules and regulations. These matters are the responsibility of management and the independent auditor.
Composition and Member Qualifications 
The Committee shall be comprised of at least three directors. Except as provided below, each member of the Committee must be independent, as the term "independent" is defined for purposes of applicable federal securities laws and the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the "NASDAQ") or such other listing standards selected by the Committee. Each Committee member must meet the financial literacy and experience standards applicable to him or her under applicable law, SEC rules and NASDAQ or other listing standards. At least one member of the Committee must be an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. Each Committee member must be free of any relationship that, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with his or her exercise of independent judgment. The members of the Committee will be appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the Board. The Board has the sole authority to remove Committee members and to fill vacancies on the Committee. The Board will appoint the chairperson.
Notwithstanding the above, at the discretion of the Board, the Committee may include additional two members, who because they or their businesses are providers in the Company's dental network are not independent as the term independent is defined under applicable federal securities laws and the listing standards of the NASDAQ or other applicable listing standards, who are (i) otherwise affirmatively determined by the Board to be independent of management, (ii) financially literate, and (iii) able to exercise independent judgment. At least annually, the Board shall review and confirm the qualifications of each Committee member. Members of the Committee shall not serve on more than three public company audit committees simultaneously unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the member's ability to serve effectively on the Committee.
