PROXY STATEMENT
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board," the members of which are referred to as "Directors") of The Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Fund to be held on Monday, May 13, 2019, at 9:30 a.m., local time, at The Cole Auditorium, The Greenwich Library, 101 West Putnam Avenue, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830 (the "Meeting"), and at any adjournments or postponements thereof.

In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, officers of the Fund and officers and regular employees of Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), the Fund's transfer agent, and affiliates of Computershare or other representatives of the Fund may also solicit proxies by telephone, Internet, or in person. In addition, the Fund has retained Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for an estimated fee of $1,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. The Fund will pay the costs of the proxy solicitation and the expenses incurred in connection with preparing, printing, and mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and/or Proxy Statement and its enclosures. If requested, the Fund will also reimburse brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of its shares.

If the proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees as Directors as described in this Proxy Statement, unless instructions to the contrary are marked thereon, and at the discretion of the proxy holders as to the transaction of any other business that may properly come before the Meeting. Any stockholder who has submitted a proxy has the right to revoke it at any time prior to its exercise either by attending the Meeting and voting his or her shares in person, or by submitting a letter of revocation or a later dated proxy to the Fund at the above address prior to the date of the Meeting.
A "quorum" is required in order to transact business at the Meeting. A quorum of stockholders is constituted by the presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Fund entitled to vote at the Meeting. In the event a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or in the event that a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposed items are not received, the chairperson of the Meeting may propose one or more adjournments of such Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. If a quorum is present, a stockholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received for approval and it is otherwise appropriate. If a quorum is present, the persons named as proxies will vote those proxies which they are entitled to vote "FOR" any proposal in favor of such adjournment and will vote those proxies required to be voted "AGAINST" any proposal against any such adjournment. Absent the establishment of a subsequent record date and the giving of notice to the holders of record thereon, the adjourned meeting must take place not more than 120 days after the record date. At such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the original Meeting. The Fund may postpone or cancel a meeting of shareholders, and if it does the Fund will make a public announcement of such postponement or cancellation prior to the meeting. The postponed meeting may not be held more than 120 days after the initial record date.
The close of business on March 21, 2019, has been fixed as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and all adjournments or postponements thereof.
The Fund has two classes of capital stock outstanding: common stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Common Stock"), and 6.00% Series B Cumulative Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Preferred Stock"). The holders of the Common Stock and Preferred Stock are each entitled to one vote for each full share held. On the record date, there were 18,757,524 shares of Common Stock, and 965,548 shares of Preferred Stock, outstanding.
Set forth below is information as to those stockholders to the Fund's knowledge that beneficially own 5% or more of a class of the Fund's outstanding voting securities as of the record date.
As of the record date, there were no persons known to the Fund to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of the Fund's outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.
SUMMARY OF VOTING RIGHTS ON PROXY PROPOSALS
PROPOSAL: TO ELECT FOUR (4) DIRECTORS OF THE FUND
Nominees for the Board of Directors
The Board consists of thirteen Directors, eleven of whom are not "interested persons" of the Fund (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")). The Fund divides the Board into three classes, each class having a term of three years. Each year, the term of office of one class will expire. Mario J. Gabelli, Thomas H. Dinsmore, Daniel D. Harding, and Werner J. Roeder have each been nominated by the Board for election to serve for a three year term to expire at the Fund's 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualify. Messrs. Gabelli and Cerutti have served as Directors of the Fund since the June 5, 1989 organizational meeting of the Fund. Mr. Zizza became a Director of the Fund on April 24, 1991, Mr. van Ekris became a Director of the Fund on February 11, 1992, Dr. Roeder became a Director of the Fund on August 15, 2001, Messrs. Dinsmore and Harding became Directors of the Fund on November 18, 2015, Messrs. Enright and Nakamura became Directors of the Fund on August 17, 2016, Ms. Foley became a Director of the Fund on February 23, 2017, Messrs. Birch and Melarkey became Directors of the Fund on February 22, 2018, and Mr. Colavita became a Director of the Fund on May 16, 2018. All of the Directors of the Fund are also directors or trustees of other investment companies for which Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser") or its affiliates serve as investment adviser, with the exception of Mr. Dinsmore, who only serves as Director of this Fund. The classes of Directors are indicated below:

Under the Fund's Articles of Amendment and Restatement, Articles Supplementary, and the 1940 Act, holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, are entitled to elect two Directors, and holders of the Fund's outstanding Common Stock and Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, are entitled to elect the remaining Directors. The holders of the Fund's outstanding Preferred Stock would be entitled to elect the minimum number of additional Directors that would represent a majority of the Directors in the event that dividends on the Fund's Preferred Stock become in arrears for two full years and until all arrearages are eliminated. No dividend arrearages exist as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Mr. Colavita and Dr. Roeder are currently the Directors elected solely by the holders of the Fund's Preferred Stock. Mr Colavita's term as Director is scheduled to expire at the Fund's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Therefore, he is not standing for election at this Meeting. A quorum of the Preferred Stockholders must be present in person or by proxy at the Meeting in order for the proposal to elect Dr. Roeder to be considered.
Unless instructions are provided to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy "FOR" the election of the nominees named above. Each nominee has indicated that he or she has consented to serve as a Director if elected at the Meeting. If, however, a designated nominee declines or otherwise becomes unavailable for election, the proxy confers discretionary power on the persons named therein to vote in favor of a substitute nominee or nominees. Each nominee is qualified to serve as a Director under the Fund's governing documents.

The Board believes that each Director's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of other Directors lead to the conclusion that each Director should serve in such capacity. Among the attributes or skills common to all Directors are their ability to review critically and to evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Directors, the Adviser, the sub-administrator, other service providers, counsel, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as Directors. Each Director's ability to perform his/her duties effectively has been attained in large part through the Director's business, consulting, or public service positions and through experience from service as a member of the Board and one or more of the other funds in the Fund Complex, public companies, non-profit entities, or other organizations as set forth above and below.

Directors â Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities
Overall responsibility for general oversight of the Fund rests with the Board. The Board has appointed Mr. van Ekris as the Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director presides over executive sessions of the Directors and also serves between meetings of the Board as a liaison with service providers, officers, counsel, and other Directors on a wide variety of matters including scheduling agenda items for Board meetings. Designation as such does not impose on the Lead Independent Director any obligations or standards greater than or different from other Directors. The Board has established a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee to assist the Board in the oversight of the management and affairs of the Fund. The Board also has an ad hoc Proxy Voting Committee that exercises beneficial ownership responsibilities on behalf of the Fund in selected situations. From time to time, the Board establishes additional committees or informal working groups, such as an ad hoc Pricing Committee related to securities offerings by the Fund, to address specific matters, or assigns one of its members to work with directors or trustees of other funds in the Fund Complex on special committees or working groups that address fund complex-wide matters, such as the multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of the Chief Compliance Officer for all the funds in the Fund Complex and a separate multi-fund ad hoc Compensation Committee relating to the compensation of certain other officers of the closed-end funds in the Fund Complex.
All of the Fund's Directors, other than Messrs. Mario J. Gabelli and Thomas H. Dinsmore, are Independent Directors, and the Board believes it is able to provide effective oversight of the Fund's service providers. In addition to providing feedback and direction during Board meetings, the Independent Directors meet regularly in executive session and chair all committees of the Board.
The Fund's operations entail a variety of risks, including investment, administration, valuation, and a range of compliance matters. Although the Adviser, the sub-administrator, and the officers of the Fund are responsible for managing these risks on a day to day basis within the framework of their established risk management functions, the Board also addresses risk management of the Fund through its meetings and those of the committees and working groups. As part of its general oversight, the Board reviews with the Adviser at Board meetings the levels and types of risks being undertaken by the Fund, and the Audit Committee discusses the Fund's risk management and controls with the independent registered public accounting firm engaged by the Fund. The Board reviews valuation policies and procedures and the valuations of specific illiquid securities. The Board also receives periodic reports from the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer regarding compliance matters relating to the Fund and its major service providers, including results of the implementation and testing of the Fund's and such providers' compliance programs. The Board's oversight function is facilitated by management reporting processes designed to provide visibility to the Board regarding the identification, assessment, and management of critical risks, and the controls and policies and procedures used to mitigate those risks. The Board reviews its role in supervising the Fund's risk management from time to time and may make changes at its discretion at any time.
The Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate for the Fund because it enables the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over matters under its purview, allocates responsibility among committees in a manner that fosters effective oversight, and allows the Board to devote appropriate resources to specific issues in a flexible manner as they arise. The Board periodically reviews its leadership structure as well as its overall structure, composition, and functioning, and may make changes at its discretion at any time.
Beneficial Ownership of Shares Held in the Fund and the Family of Investment Companies for each Director and Nominee for Election as Director
Set forth in the table below is the dollar range of equity securities in the Fund beneficially owned by each Director and nominee for election as Director and the aggregate dollar range of equity securities in the Fund Complex beneficially owned by each Director and nominee for election as Director.
Set forth in the table below is the amount of shares beneficially owned by each Director, nominee for election as Director, and executive officer of the Fund.
Set forth in the table below is the amount of interests beneficially owned by each Independent Director, nominee for election as an Independent Director or his or her family member, as applicable, in a person, other than a registered investment company, that may be deemed to be controlled by the Fund's Adviser and/or affiliates (including Mario J. Gabelli) and in that event would be deemed to be under common control with the Fund's Adviser.
The Fund pays each Independent Director an annual retainer of $3,000 plus $750 for each Board meeting attended. Each Independent Director is reimbursed by the Fund for any out of pocket expenses incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members receive $500 per meeting attended, the Audit Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $3,000, the Nominating Committee Chairman receives an annual fee of $2,000, and the Lead Independent Director receives an annual fee of $1,000. A Director may receive a single meeting fee, allocated among the participating funds, for participation in certain meetings held on behalf of multiple funds. The aggregate remuneration (excluding out of pocket expenses) paid by the Fund to such Directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to $74,406. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Directors of the Fund met four times, all of which were regular quarterly Board meetings. Each Director then serving in such capacity attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and of any committee of which he is a member.
The Audit Committee and Audit Committee Report
The role of the Fund's Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of (i) the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statement reporting process and the independent audit and reviews thereof; (ii) the Fund's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls, and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain of its service providers; (iii) the Fund's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and (iv) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, independence, and performance. The Audit Committee also is required to prepare an audit committee report pursuant to the rules of the SEC for inclusion in the Fund's annual proxy statement. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter (the "Audit Charter") that was most recently reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors on February 21, 2019. The Audit Charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Governance Section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Pursuant to the Audit Charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for conferring with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing annual financial statements, approving the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, and overseeing the Fund's internal controls. The Audit Charter also contains provisions relating to the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services to be provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers"), the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, to the Fund and to the Adviser and certain of its affiliates. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing, and financial matters affecting the Fund. As set forth in the Audit Charter, management is responsible for maintaining appropriate systems for accounting and internal control, and the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. The independent registered public accounting firm is ultimately accountable to the Board of Directors and to the Audit Committee, as representatives of stockholders. The independent registered public accounting firm for the Fund reports directly to the Audit Committee.
In performing its oversight function, at a meeting held on February 19, 2019, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management of the Fund and PricewaterhouseCoopers the audited financial statements of the Fund as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the conduct of the audit of such financial statements.
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers the accounting principles applied by the Fund and such other matters brought to the attention of the Audit Committee by PricewaterhouseCoopers as required by Auditing Standard No. 16, as amended (AICPAAU-C Section 260), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee also received from PricewaterhouseCoopers the written disclosures and statements required by the SEC's independence rules, delineating relationships between PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Fund, and discussed the impact that any such relationships might have on the objectivity and independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers as the independent registered public accounting firm.
As set forth above, and as more fully set forth in the Audit Charter, the Audit Committee has significant duties and powers in its oversight role with respect to the Fund's financial reporting procedures, internal control systems, and the independent audit process.
The members of the Audit Committee are not, and do not represent themselves to be, professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management, or internal control purposes. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and/or financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (United States).
Based on its consideration of the audited financial statements and the discussions referred to above with management and PricewaterhouseCoopers, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Audit Committee set forth in the Audit Charter and those discussed above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Fund's Board of Directors that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Fund's Board of Directors
Vincent D. Enright, Chairman  John Birch  Salvatore J. Zizza
February 19, 2019
The Audit Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee is composed of three of the Fund's Independent Directors, Messrs. Enright (Chairman), Birch, and Zizza. Each member of the Audit Committee has been determined by the Board of Directors to be financially literate. Mr. Enright has been designated as the Fund's audit committee financial expert, as defined in Items 407(d)(5)(ii) and (iii) of Regulation S-K (the "Audit Committee Financial Expert").
Nominating Committee
The Board of Directors has a Nominating Committee composed of three of the Fund's Independent Directors, Messrs. Colavita (Chairman), Roeder, and Zizza. The Nominating Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Each Nominating Committee member is an Independent Director as determined under guidelines of the NYSE. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying and recommending qualified candidates to the Board in the event that a position is vacated or created. In considering candidates submitted by stockholders, the Nominating Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board, the qualifications of the candidate, and the interests of stockholders.
The Nominating Committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a Director of the Fund are that the individual demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board of Directors' oversight of the business and affairs of the Fund and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. In addition, the Nominating Committee examines a candidate's specific experiences and skills, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest, and independence from management and the Fund. The Fund has adopted specific Director qualification requirements that can be found in the Fund's Bylaws and are applicable to all individuals who may be nominated, elected, appointed, qualified or seated to serve as Directors. The qualification requirements include: (i) age limits (at least 21 years of age and such maximum age as the Directors may in the future determine); (ii) prohibitions regarding any legal disability; (iii) limits on service on other boards; (iv) restrictions on relationships with investment advisers other than the Fund's adviser; and (v) character and fitness requirements. Additionally, each Independent Director must not be an "interested person" of the Fund as defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act and may not be or have certain relationships with a stockholder beneficially owning five percent or more of the Fund's outstanding shares or specified levels of interest in registered investment companies. The Fund's Bylaws also provide that a majority of the Directors then in office may determine by resolution that a failure to satisfy a particular qualification requirement will not present undue conflicts or impede the ability of the candidate to discharge the duties of a Director or the free flow of information among Directors or between the Fund's adviser and the Board. Reference is made to the Fund's Bylaws for more details.
The Nominating Committee also considers the overall composition of the Board, bearing in mind the benefits that may be derived from having members who have a variety of experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills useful in overseeing a publicly traded, highly regulated entity such as the Fund. The Directors have not determined a maximum age. The Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying director candidates. For a discussion of experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills supporting the appropriateness of each Director's service on the Fund's Board, see the biographical information of the Directors above in the section entitled "Information about Directors and Officers."
The Board of Directors adopted a Nominating Committee charter on May 12, 2004, and amended the charter on November 17, 2004. The charter is available in the Closed-End Funds â Corporate Goverance Section on the Fund's website at www.gabelli.com.
Other Board Related Matters
The Board of Directors has established the following procedures in order to facilitate communications among the Board and the stockholders of the Fund and other interested parties.
Receipt of Communications
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact the Board or any member of the Board by mail or electronically. To communicate with the Board or any member of the Board, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or the Board member(s) with whom you wish to communicate either by name or title. All such correspondence should be sent to The Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund Inc., c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422. To communicate with the Board electronically, stockholders may go to the corporate website at www.gabelli.com under the heading "Contact Us/Email Addresses/Board of Directors (Gabelli Closed-End Funds)".
Forwarding the Communications
All communications received will be opened by the office of the General Counsel of the Adviser for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to one or more Directors. The office of the General Counsel will forward promptly to the addressee(s) any contents that relate to the Fund and that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service, or patently offensive or otherwise objectionable material. In the case of communications to the Board of Directors or any committee or group of members of the Board, the General Counsel's office will make sufficient copies of the contents to send to each Director who is a member of the group or committee to which the envelope or e-mail is addressed.
The Fund does not expect Directors or nominees for election as Director to attend the Meeting. No Director or nominee for election as Director attended the Fund's annual meeting of shareholders held on May 14, 2018.
The following table sets forth certain information regarding the compensation of the Directors by the Fund and officers, if any, who were compensated by the Fund rather than the Adviser for the year ended December 31, 2018.
COMPENSATION TABLE
FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,  
Required Vote
The election of each of the listed nominees for Director of the Fund requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a plurality of the applicable class or classes of shares of the Fund present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present. A "plurality" vote means that the nominees who receive the largest number of votes cast (even if they receive less than a majority) will be elected as directors. Since the nominees are running unopposed, each nominee only needs one vote to be elected if there is a quorum present at the Meeting.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH APPLICABLE NOMINEE.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017, has been selected to serve as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers acted as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Fund knows of no direct financial or material indirect financial interest of PricewaterhouseCoopers in the Fund. A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers will not be present at the Meeting, but will be available by telephone and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if asked, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Set forth in the table below are audit fees and non-audit related fees billed to the Fund by PricewaterhouseCoopers for professional services received during and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.
The Fund's Audit Charter requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund, and all non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund's Adviser and service providers controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Fund's Adviser ("affiliates") that provide ongoing services to the Fund (a "Covered Services Provider"), if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund. The Audit Committee may delegate its responsibility to pre-approve any such audit and permissible non-audit services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, and the Chairman must report his decision(s) to the Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting after the Chairman's pre-approval of such services. The Audit Committee may also establish detailed pre-approval policies and procedures for pre-approval of such services in accordance with applicable laws, including the delegation of some or all of the Audit Committee's pre-approval responsibilities to other persons (other than the Adviser or the Fund's officers). Pre-approval by the Audit Committee of any permissible non-audit services is not required so long as: (i) the aggregate amount of all such permissible non-audit services provided to the Fund, the Adviser, and any Covered Services Provider constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by the Fund to its independent registered public accounting firm during the year in which the permissible non-audit services are provided; (ii) the permissible non-audit services were not recognized by the Fund at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and (iii) such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee and approved by the Audit Committee or the Chairman prior to the completion of the audit. All of the audit, audit related, and tax services described above for which PricewaterhouseCoopers billed the Fund fees for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All other fees for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 reflected in the table above represent services provided in review of the registration statement.
For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018, PricewaterhouseCoopers has represented to the Fund that it did not provide any non-audit services (or bill any fees for such services) to the Adviser or any Covered Services Provider.
The Audit Committee was not required to consider whether the provision of non-audit services that were rendered to the Adviser or Covered Service Providers that were not pre-approved was compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence.

Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act and Section 30(h) of the 1940 Act, and the rules thereunder, require the Fund's executive officers and Directors, executive officers and directors of the Adviser, certain other affiliated persons of the Adviser, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Fund's securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE and to furnish the Fund with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on the Fund's review of the copies of such forms it received, if any, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Fund believes that during that year such persons complied with all such applicable filing requirements, with the exception of Mr. Birch who had one late Form 3 filing and Mr. Harding who had one late Form 4 filing.
Broker Non-Votes and Abstentions
For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, abstentions (or "withheld votes" with respect to the election of Directors) and broker "non-votes" (that is, proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present but that have not been voted. Accordingly, stockholders are urged to forward their voting instructions promptly.
Because the Fund requires a plurality of votes to elect each nominee for Director, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast, but will have no effect on the result of the vote. Abstentions and any broker non-votes, however, will be considered to be present at the Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum.
Brokers holding shares of the Fund in "street name" for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares on Proposal 1 before the Meeting. Under the rules of the NYSE, such brokers may, for certain "routine" matters, grant discretionary authority to the proxies designated by the Board to vote if no instructions have been received from their customers and clients prior to the date specified in the brokers' request for voting instructions. Proposal 1 is a "routine" matter and accordingly beneficial owners who do not provide proxy instructions or who do not return a proxy card may have their shares voted by broker-dealer firms in favor of Proposal 1. A properly executed proxy card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner's shares should be voted on Proposal 1 may be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the proposal.
Stockholders of the Fund will be informed of the voting results of the Meeting in the Fund's Semiannual Report for the six months ended June 30, 2019.
"Householding"
Please note that only one document (i.e., an annual or semiannual report or set of proxy soliciting materials) may be delivered to two or more stockholders of the Fund who share an address, unless the Fund has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of a document, or for instructions regarding how to request a separate copy of these documents or regarding how to request a single copy if multiple copies of these documents are received, stockholders should contact the Fund at the address and phone number set forth above.
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE MEETING
The Directors of the Fund do not intend to present any other business at the Meeting, nor are they aware that any stockholder intends to do so. If, however, any other matters, including adjournments, are properly brought before the Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote thereon in accordance with their discretion.
STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND PROPOSALS
All proposals by stockholders of the Fund that are intended to be presented pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act ("Rule 14a-8") at the Fund's next Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held in 2020 (the "2020 Annual Meeting") must be received by the Fund for consideration for inclusion in the Fund's 2020 proxy statement and 2020 proxy relating to that meeting no later than December 5, 2019. Rule 14a-8 specifies a number of procedural and eligibility requirements to be satisfied by a stockholder submitting a proposal for inclusion in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8. Any stockholder contemplating submissions of such a proposal is referred to Rule 14a-8.
The Fund's Bylaws require stockholders that wish to nominate Directors or make proposals to be voted on at an Annual Meeting of the Fund's Stockholders (and which are not proposed to be included in the Fund's proxy materials pursuant to Rule 14a-8) to provide timely notice of the nomination or proposal in writing. To be considered timely for the 2020 Annual Meeting, the stockholder notice (and information summarized below and described fully in the Fund's Bylaws) must be sent to the Fund's Secretary, c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422, and must be received by the Secretary no earlier than December 15, 2019 and no later than January 14, 2020; provided, however, that if the 2020 Annual Meeting is to be held on a date that is earlier than April 18, 2020 or later than June 7, 2020, such notice must be so received not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which notice of the date of the annual meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such annual meeting was made, whichever occurred first. In no event shall the adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting, or the public announcement of such an adjournment or postponement, commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above.
In order for a stockholder of record to propose a nominee for Director, such stockholder must furnish written notice setting forth specified information about the nominee and associates of the nominee, the stockholder(s) of record (and if different, each beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is being made) and associates of the stockholder(s), as well as an executed certificate by the nominee relating to the nominee's disclosure of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with any person or entity other than the Fund in connection with service as a Director of the Fund, the nominee's consent to serve as a Director if elected and the nominee's satisfaction of the Director qualifications set forth in the Fund's Bylaws. If requested by the Nominating Committee, the proposing stockholder will need to also submit a completed and signed director's questionnaire, including a supplement, relating to the nominee's satisfaction of the qualifications requirements set forth in the Bylaws.
The foregoing description of the procedures for a stockholder of the Fund properly to make a nomination for election to the Board or to propose other business for the Fund is only a summary and is not complete. Copies of the Fund's Bylaws, including the provisions that concern the requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals, are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The Fund will also furnish, without charge, a copy of its Bylaws to a stockholder upon request, which may be requested by writing to the Fund's Secretary, c/o Gabelli Funds, LLC, One Corporate Center, Rye, NY 10580-1422. Any stockholder of the Fund considering making a nomination or other proposal should carefully review and comply with those provisions of the Fund's Bylaws.
IT IS IMPORTANT THAT PROXIES BE RETURNED PROMPTLY.
STOCKHOLDERS MAY PROVIDE THEIR VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR THE INTERNET BY FOLLOWING THE INSTRUCTIONS ACCOMPANYING THE PROXY CARD, VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM OR SET FORTH IN THE NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS.
