To our fellow stockholders: 
Primerica achieved many successes during fiscal 2018. Our Board of Directors continues to work to create stockholder value and achieve success through effective business strategies, performance-aligned compensation programs and thoughtful risk management. We remain committed to serving middle-income households throughout the United States and Canada and have created a culture that aligns the needs of our clients, the sales force and our employees. This letter highlights a few of our company's accomplishments, and we strongly encourage you to review the entire Proxy Statement for a more comprehensive discussion of last year's achievements. 
Financial Accomplishments 
We are proud of the results that we delivered in fiscal 2018, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Growth of 32.8% in diluted adjusted operating income per share compared with fiscal 2017;

Distribution Results 
Our investments business achieved new records in fiscal 2018 while our life insurance business saw slight declines, especially during the latter half of the year:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Continued Alignment of Compensation and Performance 
Our compensation philosophy includes a strong commitment to provide compensation programs that link executive pay to company performance. The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors continues to spend significant time reviewing our executive compensation program with independent experts as part of our ongoing effort to appropriately align compensation with performance. As part of this effort, the Compensation Committee is focused on ensuring that our key executives are incentivized to execute on the strategic priorities of our company. Please read a message from the Compensation Committee beginning on page 36.

Corporate Strategy 
Primerica, Inc. (the "Company" or "Primerica") is a leading provider of financial products to middle-income households in the United States and Canada with 130,736 licensed sales representatives at December 31, 2018. We assist our clients in meeting their needs for term life insurance, which we underwrite, and mutual funds, annuities, managed investments and other financial products, which we distribute primarily on behalf of third parties. We insured approximately five million lives and had over two million client investment accounts at December 31, 2018. Our distribution model uniquely positions us to reach underserved middle-income consumers in a cost-effective manner and has proven itself in both favorable and challenging economic environments. 
Our mission is to serve middle-income families by helping them make informed financial decisions and providing them with a strategy and means to gain financial independence. We believe there is significant opportunity to meet the increasing array of financial services needs of our clients. We intend to leverage the sales force to provide additional products and services that meet such client needs, which will drive long-term value for all of our stakeholders. Our strategy is organized across four primary areas: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maximizing sales force growth, leadership and productivity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Broadening and strengthening our protection product portfolio;  
[END TABLE]

PROXY SUMMARY 
Corporate Performance 
The bar graphs below depict our performance over the past five fiscal years for the four metrics that we use to measure corporate performance under our incentive compensation program. These metrics do not reflect financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). See "Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures" in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement for a reconciliation to 2018 GAAP results. Reconciliations for earlier years are available through the Financials section of our investor relations website at http://investors.primerica.com. 
Corporate Governance Highlights 
See "Governance" beginning on page 9 for more information. 
Our Board of Directors (the "Board" or our "Board of Directors") consists of eleven members. With the retirement of Mr. Mark Mason at the Annual Meeting, the size of the Board will remain unchanged but there will be a vacancy that the Board is seeking to fill. We are pleased that our Board reflects the diversity of the communities that we serve, with female directors comprising 30% of our director nominees and directors with racial or ethnic diversity comprising 20% of our director nominees. 
PROXY SUMMARY 
In fiscal 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new Equal Employment Opportunity and Anti-Harassment Policy. This new policy documents certain aspects of the Company's Code of Conduct and employee handbook, and includes information about complaint and investigation procedures relating to alleged discrimination incidents.

Executive Compensation Highlights 
See "Executive Compensation" beginning on page 36 for more information. 
The Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee") of our Board of Directors has structured our executive compensation program to pay for performance and, over the long term, to provide compensation to our executive officers that is market competitive. Further, a meaningful percentage of compensation is tied to the achievement of challenging corporate performance objectives. Set forth below is a brief description of our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Components include base salary, annual cash incentive awards and long-term equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
PROXY SUMMARY 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee set cash award targets for each of the four members of our executive team (the "Executive Team") at the beginning of 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Cash incentive awards are based on the Company's achievement of pre-determined performance goals related to  operating revenues, net operating income, adjusted net operating income return on adjusted stockholders' equity ("ROAE") and size of life-licensed sales force at year end and can be increased or decreased by the Compensation Committee  by up to 20% for personal performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    The corporate performance award was equal to 105.9% of the target award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    The Compensation Committee elected not to make any personal performance adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The grant values of long-term equity awards granted to our Executive Team members in February 2019 were fixed at the beginning of fiscal 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    Equity award value is split equally between time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance stock units ("PSUs").   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    The RSUs vest in equal installments over three years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  –    The PSUs will be earned based on the Company's ROAE over a three-year performance period of 2019 through 2021, and the executives will receive between 0%  and 150% of the awarded shares in March 2022.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of our Executive Team members has an employment agreement that provides for severance payments upon a termination of employment without cause or a  resignation for good reason.  
[END TABLE]
Although the Company provides only limited perquisites, during fiscal 2018 the Compensation Committee adopted an Executive and Director Perquisites Policy. The new policy provides that all perquisites paid to directors and senior executives must be approved by the Compensation Committee and it lists certain categories of perquisites that have been pre-approved. 
The table below highlights the fiscal 2018 compensation for our Chief Executive Officer (also referred to as our "CEO") and, on average, for the other named executive officers as disclosed in the summary compensation table on page 61.

[END TABLE]
MATTERS TOBE VOTED ON 
Proposal 1: 
Election of Directors 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• What am I voting on? The Board is asking our stockholders to elect each of the ten director nominees named in this Proxy Statement to hold office until  the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 (the "2020 Annual Meeting) and until his or her successor is elected and qualified.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting Recommendation: "FOR" the election of the ten director nominees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote Required: A director will be elected if the number of shares voted "FOR" that director exceeds the number of votes "AGAINST" that  director.  
[END TABLE]
See "Board of Directors" beginning on page 19 for more information. 
We ask that our stockholders elect the ten director nominees named below to our Board of Directors to serve a one-year term commencing at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors has adopted majority voting for directors in uncontested elections. As a result, each director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, meaning that each director nominee must receive a greater number of shares voted "FOR" such director than the shares voted "AGAINST" such director. If an incumbent director does not receive a greater number of shares voted "FOR" such director than shares voted "AGAINST" such director, then such director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In that situation, the Corporate Governance Committee of our Board (the "Corporate Governance Committee") would make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. Within 90 days from the date the election results are certified, the Board will act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and will publicly disclose its decision and rationale behind it. In a contested election – a circumstance we do not anticipate at the Annual Meeting – director nominees are elected by a plurality vote. Any shares that are not voted (whether by abstention or otherwise) will have no impact on the outcome of the vote. The following table provides summary information about each director nominee, all of whom currently serve on our Board.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  For a description of the factors that caused the Board of Directors to waive the Corporation's director retirement age for Senator Chambliss, see  "Board of Directors – Board Members – C. Saxby Chambliss."  
[END TABLE]
MATTERS TO BE VOTED ON 
Each director nominee attended more than 80% of the aggregate of all meetings of our Board of Directors and each committee of which he or she was a member during fiscal 2018. 
Senator C. Saxby Chambliss was elected to our Board in June 2017. Mr. G. Williams was elected to the Board and promoted to Chief Executive Officer as of April 1, 2015. The remaining eight director nominees have served at least since the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Unless otherwise instructed, the members of the Proxy Committee (as defined in "Information About Voting and the Annual Meeting") will vote the proxies held by them "FOR" the election to our Board of Directors of the nominees named above. 
Proposal 2: 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay)
[BEGIN TABLE]
• What am I voting on? The Board is asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers as described  in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting Recommendation: "FOR" the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote Required: Approval requires a "FOR" vote by at least a majority of the shares present in person or represented by valid proxy and entitled  to vote.  
[END TABLE]
See "Executive Compensation" beginning on page 36 for more information. 
We most recently sought stockholder approval of our executive compensation program in conjunction with our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At such meeting, approximately 93.4% of votes were cast in favor of our executive compensation program. In addition, in May 2017 our stockholders supported the Board's recommendation to hold an annual Say-on-Pay vote. As a result, the next Say-on-Pay vote (after that taken at the Annual Meeting) will take place at the 2020 Annual Meeting. The Say-on-Pay vote is not binding on the Company, our Board of Directors or the 
 Compensation Committee. Our Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against our executive compensation program as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A")", our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate, and retain our named executive officers, each of whom is critical to our success. Under this program, our named executive officers are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term, strategic and corporate goals as well as the realization of increased stockholder value. The Compensation Committee continually reviews and modifies the compensation program for our named executive officers to ensure that it achieves the desired goals of aligning our executive compensation structure with our stockholders' interests and current market practices. Please read the CD&A section for additional details about our executive compensation program, including information about the compensation of our named executive officers for fiscal 2018. 
The advisory vote in this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, it relates to the overall compensation of our named executive officers, as well as the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Our stockholders may vote for or against, or abstain from voting on, the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and any related material disclosed in such proxy statement." 
MATTERS TO BE VOTED ON 
Proposal 3: 
Ratification of the Appointment of KPMG LLP as Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• What am I voting on? The Board is asking our stockholders to ratify the selection by the Audit Committee of our Board (the "Audit Committee") of  KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 ("fiscal 2019").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting Recommendation: "FOR" the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote Required: Approval requires a "FOR" vote by at least a majority of the shares present in person or represented by valid proxy and entitled  to vote.  
[END TABLE]
See "Audit Matters" beginning on page 77 for more information. 
We ask that our stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. 
The Audit Committee has authority to retain and terminate the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for fiscal 2019, as well as the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Although stockholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG is not required, our Board of Directors believes that submitting the appointment to our stockholders for ratification is a matter of good corporate governance. If our stockholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG, then the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. We paid KPMG an aggregate of $2.9 million in fiscal 2018 and $2.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"). 
One or more representatives of KPMG are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. The representatives will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. 
GOVERNANCE 
Our Board oversees the business and affairs of the Company, and our directors believe that good corporate governance is a critical factor in our continued success and also aligns management and stockholder interests. Through the Governance section of our investor relations website at http://investors.primerica.com, our stockholders have access to key governing documents such as our Code of Conduct, Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters of each committee of the Board. 
Board Structure 
Our Board currently consists of eleven directors. After the Annual Meeting, our Board will consist of eleven directors but there will be a vacancy that the Board is seeking to fill. The Company's governance documents provide our Board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. Currently, the Company has a non-executive Chairman of the Board and an independent Lead Director. Our Board believes that this structure is the most appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time and is in the best interests of our stockholders because it provides decisive and effective leadership and, when combined with the Company's other governance policies and procedures, provides appropriate opportunities for oversight, discussion and evaluation of decisions and direction by our Board. 
Mr. R. Williams has served as non-executive Chairman of the Board since April 2015. He previously served as Chairman of the Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer. Mr. G. Williams has served as Chief Executive Officer since April 2015. He previously served as President since 2005. Mr. Benson, one of our independent directors and Chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee, has served as the Lead Director of our Board since February 2014 and he joined our Board in April 2010. As the primary interface between management and our independent directors, the Lead Director provides a valuable supplement to the non-executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer roles and serves as a key contact for the non-employee directors, thereby enhancing our Board's independence from management. The responsibilities of our Chairman of the Board and our Lead Director are set forth below.

GOVERNANCE 
All directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at our Board and committee levels. In addition, directors have full and free access to members of management, and our Board and each committee has authority to retain independent financial, legal or other advisors as they deem necessary without consulting, or obtaining the approval of, any member of management. Our Board holds separate executive sessions of its non-employee directors and of its independent directors at least annually. 
Director Independence 
Independence Determinations 
Mr. R. Williams and Mr. Addison are not independent because they previously served as the Company's Co-Chief Executive Officers. Mr. G. Williams, our Chief Executive Officer, is not independent because he is a member of management and an employee of the Company. Senator Chambliss is not independent because he is a partner of a law firm that the Company uses for legal work that arises from time to time in connection with certain specialized legal matters. Senator Chambliss does not perform this work and the underlying transactions were completed prior to both the date that he joined the Board and the date that he affiliated with the law firm. 
Our Board annually assesses the outside affiliations of each director to determine if any of these affiliations could cause a potential conflict of interest or could interfere with the independence of the director. Based on information furnished by all directors regarding their relationships with Primerica and its subsidiaries and research conducted by management and discussed with our Board with respect to outside affiliations, our Board has determined that none of the remaining directors who served on our Board during fiscal 2018 has or had a material relationship with Primerica other than through his or her role as director and, except as set forth above, each is independent because he or she satisfies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The categorical standards set forth below;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independence standards set forth in Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Exchange Act"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The criteria for independence set forth in Section 303A.02(b) of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listed Company Manual.   
[END TABLE]
A determination of independence under these standards does not mean that a director is disinterested under Section 144 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Each director, relevant committee and our full Board may also consider whether any director is interested in any transaction brought before our Board or any of its committees for consideration. 
Independence of Committee Members 
Throughout fiscal 2018, the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees have been fully independent in accordance with the NYSE Listed Company Manual and our Board's director independence standards described above, except that Senator Chambliss served as a member of the Corporate Governance Committee until April 2018. He resigned from such committee immediately after Institutional Shareholder Services notified the Company that it believed that Senator Chambliss would not be considered independent, notwithstanding the procedural safeguards that had been implemented in connection with the law firm's work for the Company. In fiscal 2018, no member of these committees received any compensation from Primerica other than directors' fees, and no member of the Audit Committee was or is an affiliated person of Primerica (other than by virtue of his or her directorship). Members of the Audit Committee meet the additional standards of audit committee members of publicly traded companies required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act"). Throughout fiscal 2018, members of the Compensation Committee qualified as non-employee directors as defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. 
GOVERNANCE 
Categorical Standards of Independence 
The Company has established categorical standards of independence for our Board, which are described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. To be considered independent for purposes of the director qualification standards, (i) the director must meet independence standards under the NYSE Listed Company Manual and (ii) our Board must affirmatively determine that the director otherwise has no material relationship with the Company, directly or as an officer, shareowner or partner of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. 
To assist it in determining each director's independence in accordance with the NYSE's rules, our Board has established guidelines, which provide that a director will be deemed independent unless: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(a)  (1) the director is an employee, or an immediate family member of the director is an executive officer, of the Company or any of its affiliates, or  (2) the director was an employee, or the director's immediate family member was an executive officer, of the Company or any of its affiliates during the immediately preceding three years;

(b)  (1) the director presently receives during any consecutive 12-month period more than $120,000 in direct  compensation from the Company or any of its affiliates, or an immediate family member of the director presently receives during any consecutive 12-month period more than $120,000 in direct compensation for  services as an executive officer of the Company or any of its affiliates, excluding director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on  continued service), or (2) the director or the director's immediate family member had received such compensation during any consecutive 12-month period within the immediately preceding three years;   
(c)  (1) the director is a current partner or employee of a firm that is the Company's internal or independent auditor, (2) an immediate family  member of the director is a current partner of such a firm, (3) an immediate family member of the director is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the Company's audit, or (4) the director or an immediate family  member of the director was, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d)  (1) an executive officer of the Company serves on the board of directors of a company that, at the same time, employs the director, or an immediate  family member of the director, as an executive officer, or (2) Primerica and the company of which the director or his or her immediate family member is an executive officer had such relationship within the immediately preceding three years;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(e)  (1) the director is a current executive officer or employee, or an immediate family member of the director is a current executive officer, of another  company that makes payments to or receives payments from the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any single fiscal year, exceeds the greater of $1 million, or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues, or  (2) Primerica and the company of which the director is an executive officer or employee or his or her immediate family member is an executive officer had such relationship within the immediately preceding three years;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(f)  the director serves as an executive officer, director or trustee, or his or her immediate family member who shares the director's household serves  as an executive officer, director or trustee, of a charitable organization, and within the last three years, discretionary charitable contributions by the Company to such organization, in the aggregate in any one year, exceed the greater of  $1 million or 2% of that organization's total annual charitable receipts;   
[END TABLE]
GOVERNANCE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(g)  the director has any interest in an investment that the director jointly acquired in conjunction with the Company;

Board Diversity 
Diversity is very important to us. We strive to offer an inclusive business environment that offers and benefits from diversity of people, thought and experience. This also holds true for our Board. Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board annually reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics of its members in light of the current composition of our Board, and diversity is one of the factors used in this review. In addition, in identifying a director candidate, the Corporate Governance Committee and our Board consider and discuss diversity, among the other factors discussed under "— Director Nomination Process," with a view toward the role and needs of our Board as a whole. The Corporate Governance Committee and our Board generally view diversity expansively to include, without limitation, concepts such as race, gender, national origin, differences of viewpoint and perspective, professional experience, education, skill and other qualities or attributes that together contribute to the successful functioning of our Board. 
Director Nomination Process 
Our Board maintains a robust process in which the members focus on identifying, considering and evaluating potential board candidates. Our Corporate Governance Committee leads this process, considering the Company's current needs and long-term and strategic plans to determine the skills, experience and characteristics needed by our Board. The Corporate Governance Committee seeks input from other Board members and senior management, and also considers and evaluates any candidates recommended by our stockholders. 
Our Board has determined that its members should bring to the Company a broad range of experience, knowledge and judgment. A successful board candidate must be prepared to represent the interests of the Company and all of its stockholders. The factors considered by the Corporate Governance Committee and our Board in their review of potential candidates include whether: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate has exhibited behavior that indicates he or she is committed to the highest ethical standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate has had business, governmental, non-profit or professional experience at the Chairman, Chief Executive  Officer, Chief Operating Officer or equivalent policy-making and operational level of a large organization that indicates that the candidate will be able to make a meaningful and immediate contribution to our Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate has special skills, expertise and background that would complement the attributes of the existing directors, taking into consideration the diverse  communities and geographies in which the Company operates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate has financial expertise;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate will effectively, consistently and appropriately take into account and balance the legitimate interests and concerns of all of our stockholders and  our other stakeholders in reaching decisions, rather than advancing the interests of a particular constituency;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate possesses a willingness to challenge management while working constructively as part of a team in an environment of collegiality and trust; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The candidate will be able to devote sufficient time and energy to the performance of his or her duties as a director.   
[END TABLE]
GOVERNANCE 
The Corporate Governance Committee carefully reviews all current directors and director candidates in light of these factors based on the context of the current and anticipated composition of our Board, the current and anticipated operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of our stockholders. In reviewing a candidate, the Corporate Governance Committee considers the integrity of the candidate and whether the candidate would be independent as defined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE Listed Company Manual. The Corporate Governance Committee expects a high level of involvement from our directors and, if applicable, reviews a candidate's service on other boards to assess whether the candidate has sufficient time to devote to Board duties. 
The Corporate Governance Committee decides whether to further evaluate each candidate, which would include a thorough reference check, interviews, and discussions about the candidate's qualifications, availability and commitment. Upon the completion of such evaluation, the Corporate Governance Committee makes a recommendation to our Board with respect to the election of a potential candidate to our Board. Our Board expects that all candidates recommended to our Board will have received the approval of all members of the Corporate Governance Committee. 
Any stockholder who wishes to have the Corporate Governance Committee consider a candidate for election to our Board is required to give written notice of his or her intention to make such a nomination. For a description of the procedures required to be followed for a stockholder to nominate a director, see "Other Stockholder Information —Proxy Access Director Nominees" and "Other Stockholder Information – Other Proposals and Director Nominees." A proposed nomination that does not comply with these requirements will not be considered by the Corporate Governance Committee. There are no differences in the manner in which the Corporate Governance Committee considers or evaluates director candidates it identifies and director candidates who are recommended by our stockholders. 
Proxy Access 
A stockholder or group of no more than 20 stockholders that has owned at least 3% of our common stock for at least three years may nominate directors to our Board and have the nominees included in our proxy materials to be voted on at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The maximum number of stockholder nominees that will be included in our proxy materials with respect to any such annual meeting is the greater of (i) two or (ii) 20% of directors to be elected. A stockholder who seeks to nominate a director or directors to our Board must provide proper notice to the Company's Corporate Secretary under our by-laws. See "Other Stockholder Information — Proxy Access Director Nominees." 
Majority Voting Standard for Director Elections 
In an uncontested election, directors are elected by a majority of "FOR" votes cast by stockholders. (An uncontested election is an election where the number of nominees is the same as the number of directors to be elected.) If an incumbent director does not receive a greater number of shares voted "FOR" such director than shares voted "AGAINST" such director, then such director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In that situation, the Corporate Governance Committee would make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. Within 90 days from the date the election results are certified, the Board will act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and will publicly disclose its decision and rationale behind it. In a contested election, director nominees are elected by a plurality vote. Under the plurality standard, the number of persons equal to the number of vacancies to be filled who receive more votes than other nominees are elected to the Board, regardless of whether they receive a majority of votes cast. An election is considered contested under our by-laws if, outside of the proxy access process, a stockholder has submitted notice of a director nomination to the Company's Corporate Secretary. 
GOVERNANCE 
Board Evaluation Process 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the Corporate Governance Committee conduct an annual review of Board performance and further requires that each standing committee conduct an annual evaluation of its own performance. To facilitate those evaluations, each independent committee prepares a written self-assessment questionnaire that is completed by the members of the committee. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee prepares a written Board assessment questionnaire that is completed by all members of the Board. The questions are designed to gather suggestions to improve Board and committee effectiveness and solicit additional feedback. The Board self-assessment is conducted at a different time during the year than the committee self-assessments, so that the directors have adequate time to reflect on the functioning of the Board as a whole. The Company's Corporate Secretary compiles the results of each self-assessment and shares those results with all directors. The committee chairs lead discussions during their committee meetings of the results of the self-assessments, highlighting areas that require additional attention. The Corporate Governance Committee discusses the Board self-assessment and the Lead Director leads a discussion of the self-assessment among the full Board. Management then discusses with the Lead Director any specific items that require additional attention and a plan is developed to address such action items. 
In fiscal 2019, the Corporate Governance Committee expects to retain a third party to facilitate in-depth Board and Committee assessments, consistent with the process it followed during fiscal 2017. The third party will meet in person with each director and solicit feedback on Board function and meetings, composition, leadership, as well as other matters. The facilitator will then compile results from the interviews and provide an in-person oral report to each of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors with recommendations for improvement. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board is ultimately responsible for overseeing the Executive Team's management of the various risks facing the Company as well as the Company's compliance culture and overall risk tolerance. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for regularly monitoring the oversight of our enterprise risk management (ERM) program. The Board and each Board committee actively oversee and monitor the management of risks that could impact the Company's operations in connection with their respective subject matter areas:

Management identifies, assesses and assigns responsibility for risk management through our enterprise risk assessment process and internal control environment. In fiscal 2018, management's Business Risk and Control Committee regularly monitored the major risks facing the Company and our Chief Risk Officer presented a risk profile and quarterly status updates to the Board and each Board committee that has oversight responsibility for one or more key risks. Management re-evaluates and ranks the Company's risks annually, and the rankings are shared with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. In addition, at the Board's request, a cross-functional group of management-level employees provides a quarterly update on significant risk areas, which includes an assessment of cybersecurity risks and an overview of legal and regulatory matters. At least annually, this presentation also includes information on system readiness and protection, our incident response plan, recent internal training exercises and recovery plans. 
Further, our Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee. Our Chief Internal Auditor presents quarterly to the Audit Committee with respect to Internal Audit findings and recommendations and meets in executive session with the Audit Committee at least quarterly. The Audit Committee uses the results of its discussions with our Chief Internal Auditor to monitor the Company's internal audit plan.

Our stockholders and other interested persons may communicate with our directors, or any specified individual director, by addressing such communications to them in care of the Company's Corporate Secretary, at the Company's principal executive office located at One Primerica Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30099.

Stockholder Engagement

GOVERNANCE 
 included Board diversity, ESG matters, proxy access and other governance matters and executive compensation.

 disclosure generally. To enable the Board, the Compensation Committee and the Corporate Governance Committee to consider direct stockholder feedback, information about these investor conversations is shared with the Board. The table below describes requests received during these conversations and our responses to those suggestions.

Senator Chambliss brings to our Board legal and cybersecurity expertise as well as years of government experience at the state and federal levels. 
Waiver of Director Retirement Age 
The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director may serve on the Board until the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company next following his or her 75th birthday, and may not be reelected after reaching 75, unless this requirement has been waived by the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee considered whether to waive this retirement requirement for Senator Chambliss, who reached age 75 in late 2018. The Corporate Governance Committee believes it is important to exercise judgment when considering whether to grant such a waiver in order to retain existing Board members who otherwise possess the requisite expertise, engagement and abilities to fulfill their duties while providing for regular Board refreshment. The Corporate Governance Committee also believes consideration should be given with respect to the overall composition of the Board to ensure it has the right balance of skills and experience. 
In reviewing a potential waiver for Senator Chambliss, the Corporate Governance Committee considered several factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senator Chambliss brings to our Board years of legal knowledge and experience as well as governmental expertise at the state and federal levels;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board recognizes the importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, clients, and employees, and devotes significant attention to  oversight of cybersecurity risk. As an expert on cybersecurity, Senator Chambliss has been particularly valuable in the Board's oversight responsibilities in this area;  
[END TABLE]
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senator Chambliss is in excellent health and remains an active and engaged Board member; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board has no prior history of waiving the retirement requirement. In fact, a director retired from the Board in May 2018 as a result of the director  retirement age.  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance Committee recommended that the Board waive for fiscal 2019 the retirement requirement for Senator Chambliss. Upon the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board concluded that Senator Chambliss' experience, expertise, and engagement as a Board member warranted such a waiver. Therefore, in February 2019, the Board granted a one-year waiver of the retirement requirement and re-nominated Senator Chambliss to be considered for election at the Annual Meeting.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Director Compensation 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and considering any revisions to director compensation. The Compensation Committee reviews a competitive market analysis of director compensation prepared by its independent compensation consultant at least bi-annually as part of its process of evaluating and setting compensation for non-employee directors. The next such review will occur in fiscal 2019. 
The Compensation Committee does not seek to benchmark or set compensation at any specific level relative to the peer data. Instead, the Compensation Committee uses this information primarily as background with respect to compensation plan design decisions and as a general reference point for pay levels. For a list of the peer companies and a description of how they were selected, see "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and 
 Analysis ("CD&A") — Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation – The Compensation Setting Process – Use of a Peer Group." 
Our Board reviews the Compensation Committee's recommendations and determines the amount of director compensation annually. Executive officers have no role in determining or recommending director compensation. Our Board has determined that compensation for non-employee directors should be a mix of cash and equity-based compensation. Directors who are employees of Primerica do not receive any fees or additional compensation for their service on our Board. The interests of our non-employee directors are aligned with the interests of our stockholders by linking a portion of their compensation to stock performance. 
The Board approved the following compensation program for directors in fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Board    Annual Cash Retainer     $75,000 (2)     Annual RSU  Award(3)     $100,000 (4)

 Corporate Governance    Annual Chair Cash Fee     $15,000     Annual Member Cash Fee     $10,000   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  All cash retainers and cash fees are paid in quarterly installments.  
(2)  For fiscal 2019, the Board increased the annual cash retainer to $90,000.  
(3)  The RSUs vest in four quarterly installments and delivery of the shares underlying the RSUs is made on the applicable vesting date.   
(4)  For fiscal 2019, the Board increased the annual RSU award to $130,000.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Lead Director receives a cash fee of $25,000 and the Chairman of the Board receives a cash fee of $100,000. The Company reimburses all directors for travel and other related expenses in connection with attending Board and committee meetings and Board-related activities.

(1)  Includes the cash portion of the annual retainer as well as fees for Lead Director, Chairman roles and committee service.  
(2)  Each non-employee director was granted 1,054 RSUs, representing the number of whole shares of our common stock  (or, at the director's election, deferred stock units) equal to $100,000 divided by $94.80 (the closing market price per share of our common stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date of May 16, 2018). At  December 31, 2018, each non-employee director had 527 unvested RSUs (or, if he or she so elected, deferred stock units).  
(3)  Represents dividends paid on unvested equity awards and, for Mr. Addison, consulting fees. Omits perquisites and other personal benefits as these  amounts did not exceed $10,000 for any director.  
(4)  Elected to receive the annual cash retainer in the form of deferred stock units under the Primerica, Inc. Nonemployee Directors' Deferred  Compensation Plan. See "— Deferred Compensation."  
(5)  Elected to receive equity compensation in the form of deferred stock units under the Primerica, Inc. Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation  Plan. See "— Deferred Compensation."  
[END TABLE]
At December 31, 2018, our non-employee directors each held 527 unvested equity awards that had been granted on May 16, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, these awards had a market value of $51,493, based on the closing price per share of our common stock on the NYSE on that date of $97.71. All RSUs and deferred stock units granted in fiscal 2018 vest in equal installments on the three month, six month, nine month and twelve month anniversary of the grant date (or, if earlier, the final tranche vests on the date of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in the year following the year of grant). 
Deferred Compensation 
Our Board adopted the Primerica, Inc. Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Nonemployee Director Deferred 
 Compensation Plan") in November 2010, under which non-employee directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their directors' fees. At the director's option, we convert all or a portion of his or her cash fees otherwise payable during a calendar quarter to deferred stock units equal in number to the maximum number of shares of our common stock, or fraction thereof (to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of one share), which could be purchased with the dollar amount of such fees at the closing market price of our common stock on the last trading day of the calendar quarter. These deferred stock units will be fully vested on such date. 
At the director's option, we credit his or her deferral account with deferred stock units equal in number to the number of equity awards to which the director was otherwise entitled. Any deferred stock units that are issued upon 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
 deferral of equity awards are subject to the same vesting provisions as the equity awards themselves. We also credit the deferral account with deferred stock units equal in number to the maximum number of shares of our common stock, or fraction thereof (to the nearest one hundredth (1/100) of one share), which could have been purchased with the cash dividend, if any, which would have been payable had the participant received restricted stock awards to which he or she was otherwise entitled. The deferred stock units credited in lieu of the payment of dividends on equity awards are fully vested on the dividend payment date. 
We pay all deferred compensation in the form of our common stock, at the director's election, within 60 days of termination of Board service or, in the case of an installment election, within 60 days of termination of Board service and up to five anniversaries of such date. 
During fiscal 2018, Messrs.Chambliss, Crittenden, and R. Williams, and Ms. Day and Ms. Perez, deferred director compensation into the Nonemployee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Our non-employee directors are required to own shares with a value at least equal to five times their annual cash retainer. In determining compliance with these guidelines, stock ownership includes shares beneficially owned by the director (or by immediate family members) and unvested RSUs and deferred stock units. The participants have five years from the date of their initial election to our Board to achieve the targeted level of stock ownership. The stock ownership of each of our non-employee directors exceeds the required ownership guidelines. 
Other Director Matters 
Mr. Crittenden served as the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup from March 2007 to March 2009. In July 2010, Mr. Crittenden entered into an order with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") in which the SEC found that he should have known that certain statements made by Citigroup, while he was the Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup, were materially misleading and pursuant to which he paid a civil monetary penalty of $100,000. Mr. Crittenden did not admit any wrongdoing in connection with the matter or disgorge any amount to Citigroup, and he did not face a ban from any future activities. In considering Mr. Crittenden's nomination to our Board, our Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the SEC order and related matters and concluded that they do not raise any concerns about his qualification to serve on our Board. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Committee Message 
To Our Fellow Stockholders, 
Our Company and management team performed well in 2018, against an ambitious set of financial and operating goals. These results earned our executives and incentive-eligible employees a short-term incentive payout slightly above target. Page 47 of this Proxy Statement presents the results for each of the performance metrics of the short-term incentive plan. 
The market price of our common stock performed well for much of the year, up 18.7% at September 30, 2018 versus year-end 2017. However, the fourth quarter was difficult for most U.S. equities and our common stock ended the year with a 3.8% annual decrease in market price. Despite the increase in our common stock dividend in 2018, the 12th increase in eight years, total stockholder return for 2018 was -2.9%. As shown in the graph on page 42 of this Proxy Statement, these results nonetheless exceeded market comparisons for both the S&P 500 Insurance Index and the S&P MidCap 400. 
Since December 31, 2018, the market price of our common stock has regained all of the fourth quarter losses, with the stock trading in mid-March 2019 at levels comparable to that of September 2018. This encourages us to believe that the fourth quarter stock price performance was largely related to overall market moves. 
Short-Term Incentives 
For our Executive Team, payouts under our short-term incentive plan are tied solely to corporate performance objectives established at the beginning of each year. These same corporate performance objectives are also used to determine a portion of the incentive compensation paid to other eligible employees, with more senior officers having a higher portion of their incentive tied to corporate performance (versus individual performance) than other participants. The corporate portion of the payout of short-term incentive awards depends on how actual results compare to those original objectives. Although actual performance exceeded objectives in 2018, the outperformance was less than the outperformance in 2017. This resulted in short-term incentive awards for 2018 that were often less than the awards that were paid for the 2017 performance year, at least in part due to the ambitiousness of 2018's objectives. This type of outcome has the potential to be demotivational, although the Compensation Committee designed the program specifically to avoid automatic compensation escalation and based the design on a pro-stockholder premise that management is paid to create incremental value every year. The Compensation Committee spent significant time in 2018 engaging with management on this issue and considering the benefits and drawbacks of plan modifications. Based on such engagement, the consensus is that our existing short-term incentive plan design is well-understood and considered reasonable and fair throughout the Company. The Compensation Committee, therefore, made no changes to the short-term incentive plan design for fiscal 2019. 
For fiscal 2019, we made no changes to the metrics or weightings used in the short-term incentive plan. We believe that this is the right approach to accomplish the 2019 goals set by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee will continue to assess the appropriateness of the different components of our short-term incentive plan each year. 
As discussed in our proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, for the 2018 performance year we increased the short-term incentive targets for our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, and also increased the fixed equity award level for our Chief Operating Officer. While the increases were relatively modest, we believe it was important to recognize their outstanding performance not only in taking on more responsibility, but also in providing support more broadly to our CEO and expanding their leadership within the Company. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Long-Term Incentives 
The long-term incentive plan for our Executive Team consists of annual equity awards, the grant value of which is set in February of each performance year. The awards are granted the following February, after the close of the performance year. Fifty percent of the equity award is granted in RSUs that vest ratably over three years, and 50% is awarded in PSUs that cliff vest in three years and whose ultimate share payout is tied to the Company's ROAE over the three-year performance period. The total economic payout, however, is heavily dependent on changes to the market price of our common stock over the performance period. The equity awards granted to our Executive Team in February 2019 were consistent with the fixed values approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2018. 
The first award of PSUs to our Executive Team was made in February 2016 and vested on March 1, 2019. The number of shares ultimately delivered increased to 123.8% of the number of shares originally awarded, as actual ROAE during the 2016-2018 period of 20.7% exceeded the target ROAE of 18.9%. As previously disclosed, this target was adjusted upward to neutralize for the net financial benefits associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Reform"). However, the PSUs are designed to be highly leveraged to our stock price. The total economic payout of the 2016 PSUs benefited meaningfully from the increase in our stock price from $41.88 on the February 23, 2016 grant date to $97.71 on December 31, 2018. The total payout of the 2016 awards was 288.8% of the original grant value (giving effect to the above-target performance as well as the stock price increase over the period), aligned with a return of 133.3% realized by stockholders over the same period, in each case excluding dividends. 
Our goal is to select one or more performance metrics for PSUs that are highly correlated to stock price but are largely in management's control and not depending on broader equity market trends. As witnessed in the outcome of the 2016 PSU grant, the choice of ROAE as the performance metric and the current overall design of the plan produced results for our executives that were highly aligned to stockholder returns over the performance period. Drivers of stock performance can change over time, and the Compensation Committee, the Board and management regularly reviewed relevant analyses during 2018 and we will continue to do so. For the 2019 PSU awards, ROAE continues to be the single performance metric. 
From time to time, investors have questioned why the ROAE metric is used for PSUs as well as being one of four metrics used in the short-term incentive plan. There are two reasons. One, we want our executives to remain focused on ROAE both in the short-term (ie, one year) and the long-term, and the two plans use different measurement periods. The ROAE objective for the short-term plan is set annually while the long-term plan uses a three-year average target set at the beginning of the performance period. Two, the short-term plan applies to a broader population. All of our officers and certain employees below officer level (around 330 people) received a portion of their annual incentive awards based on the results of the 2018 corporate performance metrics. The Committee and management believe it is healthy to have a common metric and focus for both our executive and non-executive leaders. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the current structure and mix of our executive equity program, combined with the ownership guidelines discussed on page 57, are effective in underscoring longer-term value creation. 
Other Matters 
In addition to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has oversight responsibility for a broad range of policies and programs that relate to employee compensation. We commend management for their multi-year efforts in creating a quality 401(k) plan, which has resulted in an extremely high employee participation rate of 96% as of June 2018. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Finally, while Primerica provides only limited benefits that could be considered perquisites or "perks," the Compensation Committee recently adopted a Director and Executive Perquisites Policy that is discussed on page 54 of this Proxy Statement. 
The Compensation Committee always welcomes the observations and input of our fellow stockholders on matters related to employee compensation and incentives.

Timeline of Executive Compensation Process 
Our executive compensation process begins in the fall, with preparations for the next compensation season. Following the conclusion of our fiscal year at the end of December, the Compensation Committee reviews proposed payouts under previously-established compensation programs in January and finalizes such payouts in February. Some of these compensation awards may be tied to the fiscal year just ended and some of them will be tied to multi-year performance periods. In February, the Compensation Committee also reviews and establishes compensation programs for the new fiscal year or for the commencement of new multi-year performance periods. 
Compensation Program Changes 
The Compensation Committee approved the following program enhancements for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased the short-term target for Ms. Rand from $400,000 to $500,000, resulting in a 5.3% increase in her target direct compensation based on  consideration of the additional leadership role she has assumed within the Company along with a comparison to peer compensation data;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased the short-term target for Mr. Pitts from $400,000 to $500,000, and his fixed equity award from $900,000 to $1,000,000, resulting in a 11.1% increase in his target direct compensation based on consideration of the additional leadership role he has assumed within the  Company along with a comparison to peer compensation data;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In light of Tax Reform, eliminated the requirement within the executive compensation program that each Executive Team's incentive award not exceed a  designated percentage of operating income before taxes; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adopted a new Director and Executive Perquisites Policy, which outlines the types of items that the Company is required to disclose as perquisites in the proxy  statement and requires Compensation Committee approval of all perquisites paid to directors and senior executives.

Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation 
The total compensation paid to our named executive officers for fiscal 2018, as set forth under the heading "— Compensation Tables – Summary Compensation Table", is shown below. The Compensation Committee believes that historical compensation trends demonstrate its focus on the alignment of pay and performance. The Chief Executive Officer's 2018 total compensation declined by 1.9% compared to his 2017 total compensation, consistent with the more aggressive corporate performance metric targets used in determining a significant portion of his compensation for fiscal 2018. This does not reflect $500,000 of short-term incentive bonus that was waived by the Chief Executive Officer to fund a new senior field leader incentive program. Giving effect to such waiver, his 2018 total compensation declined by 11.4% compared to his 2017 total compensation.

Pay-for-Performance 
The Compensation Committee structured our 2018 executive compensation program so that a meaningful percentage of compensation is tied to the achievement of challenging levels of both short-term and long-term corporate performance as well as meeting strategic objectives. More than half of the compensation paid to members of our Executive Team is in the form of long-term incentive equity compensation. Further, because our Chief Executive Officer has greater responsibilities than our other named executive officers and is ultimately responsible for the Company's strategic direction and overall results, our pay-for-performance approach provides for a larger portion of the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation to be "at-risk" in the form of performance-based awards. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The following pie charts reflect the mix of salary, target short-term bonus, RSUs and PSUs (based on the fixed award value) as a percentage of total compensation for fiscal 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer and other Executive Team members (based on their aggregate compensation):     
Corporate Strategy

Short-Term Corporate Performance Objectives 
For purposes of short-term incentive compensation, corporate performance for fiscal 2018 was measured based on four separate objectives, which were derived from the 
 Company's 2018 business plan and corporate strategy. The following table describes the performance metrics and links each metric to the relevant components of the Company's strategy:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Board of Directors approves an annual business plan with financial and operational targets. The Compensation Committee typically ties the annual corporate performance targets to the metrics contained in that business plan. The 2018 corporate performance targets were intended to be challenging. Each of the fiscal 2018 performance objectives demonstrated rigor, reflecting values that exceeded actual fiscal 2017 performance. 
The weighting of each objective was intended to emphasize areas on which our Compensation Committee expected the management team to focus its attention. Specifically, the size of the life-licensed sales force was given the highest weighting because the Compensation Committee believes that this metric has historically driven the success of the business and it sought to incentivize management to focus on initiatives to grow the sales force. Further, the Compensation Committee believes that this metric reflects "social" factors, which supports the Company's ESG program and is at the heart of the Company's mission to help families become financial independent. 
For all corporate performance metrics, payout levels at various levels of performance are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Payout Level   50% of Target   100%   200% of Target 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Represents performance at 85% of target, or 90% for the size of the life-licensed sales force  
(2)  Represents performance at 115% of target, or 110% for the size of the life-licensed sales force  
[END TABLE]
The payout is zero for results below threshold performance and, for results between threshold and maximum levels, the actual payout factor is interpolated. The Compensation Committee intentionally narrowed the performance band for the size of the life-licensed sales force metric compared to the other metrics because it believes that performance in only the narrower band would justify an incentive payout. 
The graph below shows the actual results for the fiscal 2018 corporate performance metric for the Executive Team members at 105.9% of target and shows the corporate performance and targeted goal for each metric for fiscal 2018.

Targets for fiscal 2018 were aggressive, exceeding fiscal 2017 targets by at least 7.8% and exceeding fiscal 2017 actual performance by at least 6.8% as shown below.

Adjustments to Compensation Targets 
Financial measures for the short-term and long-term equity incentive programs are developed based on expectations about our planned activities and reasonable assumptions about the performance of our key business drivers for the applicable period. The Compensation Committee spends considerable time determining appropriate targets for these programs and, because both the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that management is tasked with reacting appropriately to external challenges, the Compensation Committee is reluctant to change the measures of success during a performance period. As a result, the Compensation Committee does not expect to modify corporate performance targets absent extraordinary circumstances. 
From time to time, however, discrete items or events may arise that were not contemplated by these plans or assumptions and that would result in inappropriate executive compensation payouts if such items or events were not given special consideration. Such items or events could include items such as changes in generally accepted accounting principles, restructuring and write-off charges, and the impact of significant unplanned acquisitions or dispositions. 
Under the Compensation Committee's adjustment guidelines, the Compensation Committee may adjust the calculation of financial results for these incentive programs to eliminate the effect of the types of items or events described above. In making these adjustments, the Compensation Committee's policy is to seek to neutralize the impact of the unexpected or unplanned items or events, whether positive or negative, in order to provide consistent and equitable incentive payments that the Compensation Committee believes are reflective of Company performance. In considering whether to make a particular adjustment under its guidelines, the Compensation Committee will review whether the item or event was one for which management was responsible and accountable, treatment of similar items in prior periods, the extent of the item's or event's impact on the financial measure, and the item's or event's characteristics relative to normal and customary business practices. 
The Compensation Committee determined that Tax Reform would have resulted in a windfall for our Executive Team members absent an adjustment of targets for the PSU plans that had been adopted prior to December 2017. Therefore, the Compensation Committee increased the 2018 and 2019 ROAE targets that are reflected in the ROAE target for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance periods as the most effective way of ensuring that these targets reflect the level of performance that was intended when the awards were originally granted. 
Personal Performance Objectives 
Each member of our Executive Team had personal performance objectives for fiscal 2018 that were approved by our Board of Directors. The goals support the Company's strategic objectives and include matters such as leadership development, the introduction of new 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 products and technology initiatives, strategic planning, and capital deployment. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee did not make any personal performance adjustments to the cash incentive award for any Executive Team member. 
Mr. Kelly is not a member of the Executive Team and, as a result, he participates in the general management incentive compensation program. 
 The Chief Executive Officer approved Mr. Kelly's target incentive award value, as well as Mr. Kelly's personal performance objectives. For executives at his level, incentive compensation is based 55% on corporate performance and 45% on personal performance. Further, the individual payout percentage can range from 0% to 135% of the target award value. For fiscal 2018, the payout factor for Mr. Kelly based on his personal performance was set at 120%. 
Payout of Performance Stock Units 
Payouts for the 2016-2018 PSU cycle were based on actual ROAE compared to target ROAE during that three year period. The performance achieved against the threshold, target and maximum payouts for the 2016-2018 PSU cycle, and the resulting percentage earned by members of the Executive Team, are set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Payout Factor    50%   100%   150%     123.8%  
 Performance Range    80% of Target   100% of Target   120% of Target         
 Average Operating ROAE from 2016-2018    15.1%   18.9%   22.7%     20.7%  
[END TABLE]
The value of the PSU payouts reflects two factors: (1) the number of PSUs earned is based on the Company's performance compared to the targeted ROAE and (2) the value of each PSU earned is based on the Company's stock price on the vesting date. In addition, dividends on the PSU awards accrue during the performance period and are paid in a lump sum following the vesting date. The table below shows the PSU awards granted in 2016 and associated payouts to each executive in terms of both units and value.

The chart below shows our CEO's 2016-2018 PSU award from the grant date value, as adjusted by the Company's performance against the metric set by the Compensation Committee, to realized value, which reflects the increase in the Company's stock price during the performance period. 
Say-on-Pay 
In 2017, our stockholders approved an annual Say-on-Pay vote. The Company's most recent advisory vote on executive compensation occurred at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Approximately 93.4% of votes cast approved our executive compensation program as described in our proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and the Compensation Committee has not taken any action in response to that Say-on-Pay vote. 
Tax Implications 
The Compensation Committee has historically considered Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), in structuring incentive compensation. In late 2017, Section 162(m) was amended to provide that beginning in 2018 any compensation over $1 million that is paid to any of our executive officers, whether or not such compensation is "performance-based", is not deductible. Although the new rules included certain grandfathering provisions, the Company was not able to take advantage of those provisions due to the adjustments of the targets discussed under "—Adjustments to Compensation Targets." While the Compensation Committee believes that tax deductibility of compensation is an important consideration, the ultimate goal of the Compensation Committee is to provide compensation that is in the best interests of the Company. Therefore, to maintain flexibility to compensate our executives in a manner designed to promote long-term corporate goals and objectives, the Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy with respect to the deductibility of executive compensation or requiring that executive compensation have favorable accounting treatment to the Company. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Program Objectives 
Our executive compensation program was designed to achieve the following four primary objectives: 
Company Tenure 
Most of the members of the Company's management team have been with the Company for many years, and the tenure of the Company's named executive officers ranges from 18 years to 38 years, with an average tenure of over 29 years. The Company's management and the Compensation Committee both believe that the long tenure of a talented executive management team has been an important element in the Company consistently achieving its production and financial goals. In addition, long tenure enabled the Company to avoid the costs of turnover. Further, we believe that tenure is an important factor in the Company's successful of its business strategies. The Company's distribution model is unique and understanding the nuances of a large and diverse sales force can take many years. The Company's compensation policies are designed to promote this long tenure, which the Compensation Committee believes benefits the Company's stockholders. At the same time, the Corporate Governance Committee oversees succession planning and talent development, and members of the Corporate Governance Committee receive regular updates from management to ensure that the Company is growing future leaders.

Compensation Elements: Base Salary 
Base salary is a fixed amount based on an individual's skills, responsibilities and experience. The Compensation Committee generally reviews these amounts in February of each year and intends for them to provide a competitive fixed rate of pay recognizing different levels of responsibility. The annual salaries of the members of our Executive Team were unchanged for fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 and the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 ("fiscal 
 2016"). See "— Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation." 
Compensation Elements: Performance-Based Awards 
Incentive awards are granted to reward executives for achieving critical corporate and strategic goals. A portion of the incentive awards are equity-based to motivate executives to create long-term stockholder value. Together, cash and equity incentive awards represent the majority of the compensation paid to our named executive officers. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The executive compensation program is divided into a short-term cash incentive program and a long-term equity incentive program. For our Executive Team, cash incentive targets for fiscal 2018 performance were set by the Compensation Committee in February 2018. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined the cash incentive award to each Executive Team member based on the achievement of the Company's previously established fiscal 2018 corporate performance objectives, with an adjustment of up to 20% (upward or downward) based on personal performance. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee did not make any personal performance adjustments to the cash incentive award for any Executive Team member. 
The value of the long-term equity incentive award granted to each member of our Executive Team in February 2019 was based on fixed award values that were set by the Compensation Committee in February 2018. The Compensation Committee further determined to grant the award 50% in the form of RSUs and 50% in the form of PSUs. The value of the PSUs will only be recognized if the Company achieves specified levels of ROAE over the years 2019 through 2021. 
The Compensation Committee selected ROAE as the sole performance metric because it incorporates both earnings performance and the effective use of capital, and management believes it is the single measure by which the Company is most assessed by major investors. The use of this metric allows our stockholders to evaluate our financial achievements relative to other organizations. We believe this metric has a significant influence on the value our stockholders place on the Company. The Compensation Committee intends to reevaluate the performance metric(s) used for PSUs every grant year. 
For Mr. Kelly, 55% of incentive compensation was tied to corporate performance and 45% of incentive compensation was tied to personal performance. His incentive award is delivered 50% in cash and 50% in RSUs. 
A visual depiction of our Executive Team incentive award formula is set forth below (with the Chief Executive Officer's short-term award for fiscal 2018 performance and fixed long-term award in February 2019 in italics as an example).

[END TABLE]
The grant date of each stock award is the date the final award (as opposed to the fixed value of the award) is approved by the Compensation Committee. We do not coordinate equity grants with the release of material information. Further, we do not accelerate or delay equity grants in response to material information, nor does the Company delay the release of material information for any reason related to the granting of equity awards. All incentive compensation awards were made under the Second Amended and Restated Primerica, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan, referred to herein as the Incentive Plan, which was approved by our stockholders on May 17, 2017. 
Compensation Elements: Benefits 
As with other employees, our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our employee health benefit programs, including health and dental insurance plans and a life insurance program, on the same terms as regular employees. In addition, all regular employees, including our named executive officers, receive dividends on unvested RSUs and are entitled to a Company match of employee contributions to our 401(k) plan. 
Compensation Elements: Perquisites 
The Company provides only limited perquisites to our executive officers. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed executive perquisites and adopted a new Director and Executive Perquisites Policy. This policy outlines the items that the Company is required to disclose as perquisites in the proxy statement and requires Compensation Committee approval of all perquisites paid to directors and senior executives. During fiscal 2018, perquisites primarily included spousal travel to Company events, executive physicals and entertainment and gifts provided during Company-sponsored events. 
The Compensation Setting Process 
Historical Compensation 
The Compensation Committee reviews historical compensation for the named executive officers at least annually. The Compensation Committee uses this information, which sets forth the components of executive compensation over time, as a basis for understanding the history of our executive compensation and the potential impact of recommended changes to the elements of our executive compensation program. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Use of a Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee reviews executive compensation at peer companies as part of its process of evaluating and setting compensation for members of our Executive Team. The Compensation Committee does not seek to benchmark or set compensation at any specific level relative to the peer data. Instead, the Compensation Committee uses this information primarily as background with respect to compensation plan design decisions and as a general reference point for pay levels. 
In selecting peer companies, the Compensation Committee sought companies operating in similar industries (life insurance, financial services), with a similar business model (target customer, independent sales force and profitability) and similar size (revenue and market capitalization) as well as the marketplace for certain skills needed by our executives (direct marketing). This approach reflects the uniqueness and complexity of Primerica's product and service mix, as opposed to focusing on a more narrow view of Primerica as a traditional life insurance company, and it enables the Compensation Committee to make judgments based on the type of business in which the Company is engaged. Because of the unique nature of our business model, not all selected peer companies fit all identified criteria. The peer group for fiscal 2018 executive compensation was unchanged from that used in fiscal 2017. 
Although used as a primary basis for developing a peer group by certain proxy advisory firms, the Compensation Committee did not consider the Global Industry Classification Standard ("GICS") code of potential peer companies. Although the Company's GICS code characterizes it as an insurance company, the GICS code of many of the peers classifies them as diversified financial services companies. As a result, the peer group considered by the Compensation Committee may differ from the peer group considered by certain proxy advisory firms. 
In fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee completed a peer group compensation analysis based on individual executive comparisons. The Compensation Committee considered these analyses and findings as part of its overall decision-making process regarding fiscal 2018 executive compensation. The peer group compensation analysis will next be completed during fiscal 2019. 
The compensation peer group for fiscal 2018 is set forth below:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Insurance Survey 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews an aggregated insurance industry compensation survey that shows compensation levels for insurance companies of various sizes. The Compensation Committee uses this information as additional background data and as a general reference point for pay levels. 
Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer as its independent compensation consultant for fiscal 2018. Pearl Meyer reviewed management recommendations regarding compensation programs, provided competitive market data and information regarding peer companies, assessed proposed plan designs, provided periodic updates on trends and developments in executive compensation and made recommendations with respect to executive compensation. Pearl Meyer does not provide services to management or the Company, but management works closely with Pearl Meyer as requested by and on behalf of the Compensation Committee. 
In accordance with SEC requirements, the Company has affirmatively determined that no conflicts of interest exist between the Company and Pearl Meyer (or any individuals working on the Company's account on Pearl Meyer's behalf). In reaching such determination, the Company considered the following enumerated factors, all of which were attested to or affirmed by Pearl Meyer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During fiscal 2018, Pearl Meyer provided no services to, and received no fees from, the Company other than in connection with the engagement;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of fees paid or payable by the Company to Pearl Meyer in respect of the engagement represented (or are reasonably certain to represent) less than 0.5%  of Pearl Meyer's total revenue for fiscal 2018;

Management's Role in Setting Executive Compensation 
Our Chief Executive Officer participated in setting the compensation of our other Executive Team members for fiscal 2018 by providing feedback on each individual's personal performance and making compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee and he set the compensation for Mr. Kelly. Our named executive officers do not directly participate in determining their compensation, although they provide the Compensation Committee, and the Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, with detailed reports on their personal achievements during the year. In making his recommendations, our Chief Executive Officer considered the individual's performance and past contributions to the Company and the achievement of the Company's strategic objectives, the potential future contribution of the individual to the Company, and achievement of the Company's business and financial goals, including the potential for the individual to make even greater contributions to the Company in the future than he or she has in the past, the risk that the 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 individual may be recruited by a competitor, and market compensation data. With respect to our Executive Team members, the Compensation Committee discussed these recommendations with our Chief Executive Officer and in executive session with its independent compensation consultant. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer and President authority to approve, within defined maximum award limits and outside of the annual equity award process, grants of equity awards to employees other than our named executive officers. 
Post-Employment Compensation 
The Company has no executive deferred compensation plan or defined pension plan and has no agreements that trigger payouts solely due to a change in control of the Company. The Compensation Committee has approved employment agreements with each member of our Executive Team that provide for severance and, in some cases, change of control benefits if the officer's employment terminates upon a qualifying event or circumstance, such as being terminated without cause or leaving employment for good reason. Additional information regarding the employment agreements is found under "— Employment Agreements" below, and a quantification of benefits that would have been received by our named executive officers had termination occurred on December 31, 2018 is found under "— Potential Payments and Other Benefits Upon Termination or Change of Control." 
The Compensation Committee believes that severance benefits are an important part of a competitive overall compensation arrangement for our Executive Team members and are consistent with the objective of attracting, motivating and retaining highly talented executives. The Compensation Committee also believes that such benefits will help to secure the continued employment and dedication of our Executive Team members, mitigate concern that they might have regarding their continued employment prior to or following a change of control, and encourage independence and objectivity when considering possible transactions that may be in the best interests of our stockholders but may possibly result in the termination of their employment. Finally, the Compensation Committee believes that post-employment non-disclosure, non-competition and non-solicitation covenants to which our Executive Team members have agreed in consideration for the Company providing these severance benefits are highly beneficial to the Company. 
Compensation Policies 
Compensation Clawbacks 
The Incentive Plan provides that the Compensation Committee may require the reimbursement of cash or forfeiture of equity awards if it determines that an award that was granted, vested or paid based on the achievement of performance criteria would not have been granted, vested or paid absent fraud or misconduct, an event giving rise to a restatement of the Company's financial statements or a significant write-off not in the ordinary course affecting the Company's financial statements. The Company will adopt a clawback policy as required by the SEC in a manner consistent with final rules expected to be adopted in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). 
Stock Ownership 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee recognizes the critical role that executive stock ownership has in aligning the interests of management with those of our stockholders. As such, we maintain stock ownership guidelines under which our Executive Team members are required to acquire and hold our common stock in an amount representing a multiple of base salary. In determining compliance with these guidelines, stock 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 ownership includes shares beneficially owned by the participant (or by immediate family members) as well as unvested RSUs. Until the ownership guidelines are satisfied, our Executive Team members are required to hold 75% of the net shares received under the Company's equity-based incentive compensation program (after having shares withheld to satisfy taxes associated with the exercise of options and the vesting RSUs). The Compensation Committee reviews compliance with our stock ownership guidelines at least annually. 
PSUs, which represent 50% of the annual equity award to members of our Executive Team, and stock options do not count towards satisfaction of the guidelines. The Compensation Committee believes that it is general industry practice to exclude PSUs and stock options from the calculation of stock ownership for purposes of the guidelines, since their dependency on stock price and/or future performance makes their realization, and the amount that may be realized, highly uncertain. As a result, the current holdings reflected below do not represent actual interests in our common stock. 
The following table sets forth the minimum stock ownership requirements and current holdings for our Executive Team members as of March 1, 2019.

The stock ownership of each of our Executive Team members exceeds the required ownership guidelines. Our non-employee directors are also subject to stock ownership guidelines, which are described under "Board of Directors – Director Compensation – Director Stock Ownership Guidelines." 
Hedging, Pledging and Insider Trading Policy 
Our insider trading policy expressly bars ownership of financial instruments or participation in investment strategies that hedge the economic risk of owning our common stock. We also prohibit officers and directors from pledging Primerica securities as collateral for loans. In addition, we prohibit our officers, directors and employees from purchasing or selling Primerica securities while in possession of material, non-public information, or otherwise using such information for their personal benefit. 
Pre-Set Trading Plans 
Our executives and directors are permitted to enter into trading plans that are intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act so that they can prudently diversify their asset portfolios and exercise their stock options before scheduled expiration dates. During fiscal 2018, all of our named executive officers were parties to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans that provided for the sale of shares at certain designated prices or on certain designated dates. The purpose of such plans was to enable our executive officers to recognize the value of their compensation and diversify their holdings of our common stock during periods in which they would otherwise be unable to buy or sell such stock because important information about Primerica had not been publicly released. 
Equity Awards to Sales Representatives 
The Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer authority to approve, within defined maximum award limits, widespread performance-based grants to members of the sales force, who are independent contractors of the Company. The sales force awards are determined based on specific formulas that are intended to motivate performance, and factors include successful life insurance policy acquisitions and sales of investment and savings products. The following chart details all equity awards, including awards to the sales force, granted by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2018.

Risks Related to Compensation Policies and Practices 
The Compensation Committee has assessed our compensation programs for all employees, including our named executive officers, and concluded that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. As part of its review, the Compensation Committee discussed with management the ways in which risk is effectively managed or mitigated as it relates to our compensation programs and policies. The following factors supported the Compensation Committee's conclusion: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Oversight of programs (or components of programs) by independent committees of our Board, including the Compensation Committee;   
• Internal controls that are designed to keep our financial and operating results from being susceptible to manipulation by any employee, including our named  executive officers;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Multiple measures in the short-term incentive plan, and multiple award types in the long-term incentive plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive awards focused primarily on the use of reportable and broad-based financial metrics, with no one factor receiving an excessive weighting;

(1)  For Executive Team members, represents a fixed value of time-based RSUs and PSUs granted in February 2018. The fixed value is split equally between  time-based RSUs and PSUs. If maximum performance is achieved over the three-year performance period, then the executive would receive shares of our common stock representing 150% of the PSU awards. This results in PSUs with a grant date value of a  maximum of $2.1 million for Mr. Williams, $1.1 million for Mr. Schneider, $750,000 for Ms. Rand and $675,000 for Mr. Pitts. For Mr. Kelly, represents time-based RSUs granted in February 2018 for performance in  fiscal 2017. The per share value of each RSU and PSU was the closing price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date. See "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion & Analysis  ("CD&A") – Fiscal 2018 – Adjustment of Compensation Targets" for a discussion of certain adjustments that were made to the PSUs as a result of Tax Reform.  
(2)  Represents incentive awards paid in cash in March 2019 for performance in fiscal 2018. For Mr. Williams, reflects the amount approved by the  Compensation Committee; Mr. Williams waived $500,000 of short-term incentive bonus to fund a new senior field leader incentive program.  
(3)  Represents the positive changes in the present value of the pension benefits for each named executive officer under The Citigroup Pension Plan and The  Travelers Retirement Benefits Equalization Plan (the "Travelers Nonqualified Plan").

Bonus (Column D) 
Primerica has not awarded any non-incentive compensation (other than salary) to our named executive officers. 
Stock Awards (Column E) 
The dollar amounts for the awards represent the grant date fair value computed in accordance with GAAP, which is consistent with the value that the Compensation Committee considered when they determined the size of the awards except for minor discrepancies due to the inability to issue a fractional stock award. The ultimate value of the award will depend on the price of our common stock on the date that the award vests.

Option Awards (Column F) 
The dollar amounts for the awards represent the grant date fair value computed in accordance with GAAP and will vary from the actual amount ultimately realized by our named executive officers.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards (Columns C, D and E) 
These amounts reflect the annual incentive compensation amounts that could have been earned under the Incentive Plan during fiscal 2018 based upon the achievement of performance goals. The target and maximum levels for Executive Team members are set annually by the Compensation Committee and no cash incentive award is paid if threshold levels of corporate performance are not met. For Mr. Kelly, the target amount is set annually by the Chief Executive Officer and the incentive program provides for a maximum payout of 200% of target for corporate performance and 135% of target for individual performance. Further, no cash incentive award is paid if threshold levels of corporate performance are not met. The annual cash incentive compensation earned in fiscal 2018 by our Executive Team members was approved by the Compensation Committee in February 2019 and paid in March 2019. These amounts are reflected in column (G) of the "Summary Compensation Table." 
Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards (Columns F, G and H) 
For our Executive Team members, these amounts reflect the PSUs that were awarded in February 2018. Shares of common stock underlying those awards will be delivered in March 2021 only if pre-established performance goals are satisfied over the three year performance period of 2018 through 2020. The number of shares of common stock ultimately delivered will range from 0% to 150% of the number of PSUs, depending on performance. For Mr. Kelly, the incentive award is paid 50% in cash and 50% in equity so these amounts are identical to those disclosed under Columns C, D and E and the estimated future payouts cannot be disclosed as a number of awards. 
All Other Stock Awards (Column I) 
For Executive Team members, this column represents time-based RSUs granted in February 2018. For Mr. Kelly, this column represents time-based RSUs granted in February 2018 for fiscal 2017 performance. The restrictions on these RSUs lapse in equal installments on March 1 of each of the subsequent three years. Further, the restrictions on the RSUs lapse automatically upon the death of the grantee and upon the retirement of any employee so long as he or she is at least 55 years of age and his or her age plus years of service equals at least 75. Upon disability of the grantee, the RSU continues to vest for 12 months and, if the grantee remains on approved disability leave, then the unvested portion vests as of the first anniversary of the commencement of such disability leave. Holders of RSUs do not have the right to vote or dispose of their RSUs, but the awards do receive dividend equivalents. 
Grant Date Fair Value of Stock Awards (Column J) 
The grant date fair value of RSUs in this table is equal to the number of time-based RSUs awarded multiplied by the closing price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the grant date.

[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Citigroup Pension Plan 
The purpose of this broad-based, tax-qualified retirement plan is to provide retirement income on a tax-deferred basis to all U.S. employees of Citigroup, including Primerica's employees through April 7, 2010, the closing date of the IPO. Effective January 1, 2002, this plan adopted a single cash balance benefit formula for most of the covered population, including our named executive officers. This benefit is expressed in the form of a hypothetical account balance. Benefit credits accrued annually at a rate between 1.5% and 6% of eligible compensation; the rate increased with age and service. Interest credits are applied annually to the prior year's balance, and are based on the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Employees became eligible to participate in The Citigroup Pension Plan after one year of service, and benefits generally vested after three years of service. Effective December 31, 2006, The Citigroup Pension Plan was closed to new members, and effective December 31, 2007, future cash balance plan accruals ceased. All of our named executive officers were eligible for benefit accruals under this plan and continue to earn interest credits, like other participants. 
Eligible compensation generally includes base salary and wages, plus shift differential and overtime (including any before-tax contributions to a 401(k) plan or other benefit plans), incentive awards paid in cash during such year, including any amount payable for such year, but deferred under a deferred compensation agreement, commissions paid during such year, any incentive bonus or commission granted during such year in the form of restricted stock or stock options under The Citigroup Capital Accumulation Plan, but excluding compensation payable after termination of employment, sign-on and retention bonuses, severance pay, cash and non-cash fringe benefits, reimbursements, tuition benefits, payment for unused vacation, any amount attributable to the exercise of a stock option, or attributable to the vesting of, or an 83(b) election with respect to, an award of restricted stock, moving expenses, welfare benefits, and payouts of deferred compensation. Annual eligible compensation was limited by Internal Revenue Service rules to $225,000 for 2007 (the final year of cash balance benefit accrual). 
The normal form of benefit under The Citigroup Pension Plan is a joint and survivor annuity for married participants (payable over the life of the participant and spouse) and a single life annuity for unmarried participants (payable for the participant's life only). Although the normal form of the benefit is an annuity, the hypothetical account balance is also payable as a single lump sum, at the election of the participant. The Citigroup Pension Plan's normal retirement age is 65 years old. All optional forms of benefit under this formula available to our named executive officers are actuarially equivalent to the normal form of benefit. Benefits are eligible for commencement under the plan upon termination of employment at any age, so there is no separate eligibility for early retirement. 
The Travelers Retirement Benefits Equalization Plan 
The Travelers Nonqualified Plan, a nonqualified retirement plan, provides retirement benefits using the applicable Citigroup Pension Plan formula, but based on The Citigroup Pension Plan's definition of compensation in excess of the Code's qualified plan compensation limit ($170,000 for 2001), or benefits in excess of the Code's qualified plan benefit limit ($140,000 for 2001). In 1994, the Travelers Nonqualified Plan was amended to limit qualifying compensation under the plan to $300,000 and was further amended in 2001 to cease benefit accruals after 2001 for most participants (including our named executive officers). 
All other terms of the Travelers Nonqualified Plan are the same as under The Citigroup Pension Plan, including definitions of eligible compensation and normal retirement age. The optional forms of benefit available under the Travelers Nonqualified Plan and their equivalent values are the same as those under The Citigroup Pension Plan. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Potential Payments and Other Benefits Upon Termination or Change of Control 
As required by the rules of the SEC, this section describes payments that would have been made under employment agreements or, for Mr. Kelly, in accordance with Company policy, as of December 31, 2018. 
The employment agreements with our Executive Team members in place as of December 31, 2018 included change-of-control provisions that were designed to provide protection to the executives so they are not distracted by their personal, professional and financial situations at a time when Primerica needs them to remain focused on their responsibilities, which is in Primerica's best interests and those of all its stockholders. These agreements provided for a "double-trigger" payout only in the event of both: (i) a change in control; and (ii) the named executive officer is either terminated from his or her position other than for cause or terminates his or her employment for good reason within a limited period of time before or after the transaction. 
Potential payments to our named executive officers in the event of a change of control are reported below. These disclosed amounts are estimates only and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts that would be paid to the named executive officers, which would only be known at the time that they become eligible for payment. The amounts shown in the table are the amounts that could be payable under plans and arrangements in place as of December 31, 2018 if the named executive officer's employment had terminated as of that date. The table below does not include amounts to which our named executive officers would already be entitled that are described in the compensation tables appearing earlier in this Proxy Statement, including the value of equity awards that have already vested. The definitions of "cause," "good reason" and "change of control" that were included in the agreements as of December 31, 2018 follow the table.

A =  Severance arrangement for termination without cause or for good reason

 executive's habitual substance abuse; (iii) the executive's willful and continued failure (other than as a result of physical or mental incapacity) to perform the duties of the executive's position or to follow the legal direction of our Board following written notice from our Board specifying such failure; (iv) the executive's being convicted of, or pleading guilty or nolo contendere to a felony or a crime involving moral turpitude; (v) the executive's willful theft, embezzlement or act of comparable dishonesty against the Company; or (vi) a material breach by the executive of his or her employment agreement, which breach is not (if curable) cured by the executive within 30 days following his receipt of written notice thereof. 
For purposes of the definition of "cause," no act or failure to act by the executive shall be considered willful unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the executive's action or omission was in the best interests of the Company. 
Good Reason means: in the absence of the executive's written consent, (i) a material diminution by the Company in the executive's annual base salary or a material diminution in the executive's target bonus opportunity as a percentage of the executive's annual base salary; (ii) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities, provided that a change in the executive's reporting relationship shall not constitute "good reason"; (iii) the Company requiring the executive's principal business location to be at any office or location more than 50 miles from the executive's principal business location as of immediately prior to such relocation (other than to an office or location closer to the executive's home residence); or (iv) any material breach of the executive's employment agreement by the Company. 
Change of Control means: (i) any person is or becomes a beneficial owner of securities of the Company representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (other than through acquisitions from the Company); (ii) any plan or proposal for the dissolution or liquidation of the Company is adopted by the stockholders of the Company; (iii) individuals who constitute our Board (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of our Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a director whose election, or nomination for election by our stockholders, was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding for this purpose any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than our Board; (iv) all or substantially all of the assets of the Company are sold, transferred or distributed; or (v) there occurs a reorganization, merger, consolidation or other corporate transaction involving the Company, in each case, with respect to which the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction do not, immediately after the transaction, own more than 50% of the combined voting power of the Company or other entity resulting from such transaction in substantially the same respective proportions as such stockholders' ownership of the voting power of the Company immediately before such transaction. 
Pay Ratio 
In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer. Registrants must comply with the pay ratio rule for the first fiscal year beginning on or after January 1, 2017. The stated purpose of the new disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization. The Company's principal executive officer is Mr. G. Williams, our Chief Executive Officer. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Management considered whether recalculation of the median employee was necessary or appropriate and determined that there have been no material changes to its workforce composition or compensation arrangements. As a result, as permitted by the rule, the median employee used for the 2018 calculation is unchanged from the median employee used for the 2017 calculation. In determining the median employee, a listing was prepared of all employees as of December 1, 2017. The list of 2,699 employees included 601 employees who are characterized as "hours worked only employees", most of whom teach insurance licensing classes, and excluded 34 of such employees with zero earnings in fiscal 2017. It excluded individuals who are affiliated with the Company solely as independent contractors. For simplicity, the median employee was identified based on earnings reflected on forms W-2 and T4. We annualized wages and salaries for those employees that were not employed for the full year of 2017 and applied a Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate to the compensation elements paid in Canadian currency. The median amount was represented by an employee who works as a supervisor in the life operations group at the Company's home office in Duluth, Georgia. The annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer was $5,145,317 and for the median employee was $56,557. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median employee for fiscal 2018 is estimated to be 91 to 1. As previously discussed in this Proxy Statement, our Chief Executive Officer waived $500,000 of his 2018 incentive compensation in order to fund a new senior field leader incentive program. Giving effect to this waiver, the resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median employee for fiscal 2018 would have been estimated to be 82 to 1. 
The Company believes that the pay ratio set forth above is a reasonable estimate that has been calculated in a manner consistent with the SEC's rules. The SEC allows for multiple approaches and permits companies to rely on a number of assumptions in calculating its pay ratio. Therefore, our method of calculating pay ratio will differ from that used by other companies and investors should not consider pay ratio in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's executive compensation program. Further, our Compensation Committee does not consider pay ratio in its development of the Company's executive compensation program and does not use it in its determination of our CEO's compensation.

Positions and Employment Period 
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. G. Williams was appointed Chief Executive Officer and he has served on our Board since April 1, 2015. His employment agreement and each employment agreement for the other Executive Team members had an initial three-year term, followed by annual automatic one-year renewals unless terminated by either party within 90 days prior to the completion of the term. His agreement has automatically renewed for a term expiring on April 1, 2020.

The employment agreements provide that the annual base salary for Mr. Schneider is $550,000 and for each of Ms. Rand and Mr. Pitts is $500,000, subject to increase or decrease as a result of annual review by the Compensation Committee pursuant to its normal performance review policies for senior executives. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Annual Cash Bonus 
The Chief Executive Officer will be eligible to receive an annual cash bonus upon achieving certain performance targets that shall be established in good faith by the Compensation Committee, with the threshold and target annual cash bonus amounts being set by the Compensation Committee annually. Each other Executive Team member will be eligible to receive an annual cash bonus upon achieving certain performance targets that shall be established by the Compensation Committee, with such executive's target annual cash bonus opportunity to be determined by the Compensation Committee based upon the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Each Executive Team member is eligible to receive, in the good faith discretion of the Compensation Committee, annual equity compensation awards granted pursuant to the Company's long-term incentive compensation arrangements. Any outstanding long-term incentive awards will vest upon the termination of the executive's employment: (i) by the Company without cause or due to the executive's disability or death; or (ii) by the executive for good reason. 
Post-Termination Payments 
The material terms and conditions of the severance provisions of the employment agreements are set forth below. 
For Cause or By the Executive Without Good Reason 
If an executive terminates his or her employment without good reason, then the Company shall pay the executive any accrued but unpaid annual base salary, any accrued but unused vacation pay, any accrued but unpaid annual bonus for the fiscal year prior to the year of termination and any amounts or benefits due to the executive as of the date of his or her termination under the Company's plans or programs (together, "Accrued Compensation"). If an executive is terminated by the Company for cause, then the executive shall be entitled to receive from the Company the Accrued Compensation, except that he or she will not be entitled to his or her annual bonus for the previous fiscal year of the Company. 
Death or Disability 
If an executive's employment is terminated as a result of his or her death or disability, then the Company shall pay to the executive or his or her estate (if termination results from the executive's death) the Accrued Compensation and a pro-rated annual bonus (based on actual performance) for the fiscal year of the termination (the "Pro-Rated Bonus"). In addition, the Company shall provide to the executive and his or her dependents for a period of 18 months following the date of such termination medical (including vision and dental) benefits equal to those that would have been provided to the executive and to such dependents under a Company-sponsored plan if the executive's employment had not been terminated (so long as the executive pays any applicable premiums and is not employed with another employer and covered by an employer-sponsored plan providing substantially equivalent medical or life insurance benefits). During this 18-month period, the Company will pay to the executive a monthly amount equal to the premium required to be paid by the executive for such benefits (the "Health Benefits"). 
By Executive For Good Reason or by the Company Without Cause 
If the Chief Executive Officer's employment is terminated: (i) by the Chief Executive Officer for good reason; or (ii) by the Company for any reason other than cause, death or disability, then, subject to the Chief Executive Officer's timely execution and delivery of a release of claims against the Company, the Company shall: (a) pay to the Chief Executive Officer the Accrued Compensation and Pro-Rated Bonus; (b) pay to 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 the Chief Executive Officer in a lump sum in cash, no later than the 60th day following his termination, an amount equal to two times the sum of the Chief Executive Officer's annual base salary and target bonus as of the date of his termination; and (c) provide to the Chief Executive Officer the Health Benefits. 
If any other Executive Team member's, other than the Chief Executive Officer's, employment is terminated: (i) by such executive for good reason; or (ii) by the Company for any reason other than cause, death or disability, then, subject to the executive's timely execution and delivery of a release of claims against the Company, the Company shall: (a) pay to such executive Accrued Compensation and the Pro-Rated Bonus; (b) pay to such executive in a lump sum in cash, no later than the 60th day following the executive's termination, an amount equal to one times the sum of the executive's annual base salary and target bonus as of the date of the executive's termination, provided that such amount shall be one and one-half times the sum of his or her annual base salary and target bonus as of the date of termination if his or her termination occurs during the six months prior to or during the two-year period following a change of control; and (c) provide to such executive the Health Benefits. 
Defined Terms 
The terms "cause" and "change of control" are defined in the applicable employment agreement and are summarized above under "— Potential Payments and Other Benefits Upon Termination or Change of Control." The term "good reason" was modified in the revised employment agreements to mean, in the absence of the executive's written consent: (i) a material diminution by the Company in the executive's annual base salary or a material diminution in the executive's target bonus opportunity as a percentage of the executive's annual base salary, unless replaced by one or more other bonus or incentive opportunities with a comparable aggregate bonus and incentive opportunity; (ii) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities; (iii) the Company requiring the executive's principal business location to be at any office or location more than 50 miles from the executive's principal business location as of immediately prior to such relocation (other than to an office or location closer to the executive's home residence); or (iv) any material breach of the executive's employment agreement by the Company. 
Restrictive Covenants 
Each executive is prohibited from disclosing any confidential information or trade secrets of the Company during the period of his or her employment and for an 18-month period (two-years for the Chief Executive Officer) (in each case, the "Restricted Period") following his or her termination, and the Company retains ownership of any work product and inventions developed by the executive during the period of his or her employment (but the Chief Executive Officer retains the right to use speeches, addresses and presentations made during such period). Additionally, during the period of the executive's employment and during the Restricted Period, each executive is prohibited from recruiting, except during the period of his or her employment in connection with satisfying his or her duties to the Company, any person who is or was at any time during the previous six months an employee or representative of the Company or any of its affiliates. Finally, each executive is prohibited from competing with, or soliciting the business of any of the clients of, the Company during the period of his or her employment and the Restricted Period. This restriction on competition extends to any business or entity that engages in, or is working to engage in, the network marketing of life, auto or property insurance products, mutual funds, variable annuities or securities similar to those offered by the Company, to the extent operating in the United States, Canada or any other territory in which the Company operates prior to, or on the date of, termination of the executive's employment. In addition, if the Chief Executive Officer is terminated under circumstances that result in the receipt of severance payments, then during the Restricted Period he is prohibited 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
 from providing full-time services to any entity that engages in the network marketing of any products direct to the consumer, provided that he may avoid applicability of this provision by repaying to the Company any and all severance payments that he has received. 
AUDIT MATTERS 
Audit Committee Report 
Committee Composition and Skills 
The Audit Committee has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. At December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee was composed of three non-employee directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" and financially literate and that at least one member has accounting or other related financial management expertise, in each case as such qualifications are defined under the Listing Standards of the NYSE. Our Board of Directors has also determined that each of Mr. Crittenden and Ms. Day qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. All of the Audit Committee members attended 100% of the meetings of the Audit Committee held during fiscal 2018. See "Board of Directors – Board Members" for a description of the business background of each continuing Audit Committee member. 
Responsibilities of the Audit Committee, Management and the External Auditor 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of KPMG LLP ("KPMG"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Further, it is responsible for monitoring and overseeing the Company's financial reporting, internal controls and internal audit functions, as set forth in the written charter adopted by our Board. In connection with its oversight of the Company's internal audit function, the Audit Committee reviewed the internal audit plan, competencies and staffing for fiscal 2018. The Company's Chief Internal Auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee and meets with the Audit Committee in executive session at least quarterly. In addition, the Audit Committee oversees the Company's risk function and it receives quarterly reports from the Company's 
 Chief Risk Officer on changes to the Company's risk profile and risks on which the management team has been devoting attention. The Audit Committee also ensures that management has established procedures relating to any complaints received by the Company regarding accounting, internal controls, or auditing matters, and the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters. Finally, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses the quarterly and annual earnings press releases, consolidated financial statements (including the presentation of non-GAAP financial information) and Form 10-Q and Form 10-K disclosures under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition and Results of Operations" with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee Charter is available in the Governance section of our investor relations website at http://investors.primerica.com. During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee held nine meetings. 
Management is responsible for:

AUDIT MATTERS 
KPMG was responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") as well as an audit of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed KPMG's Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in the 2018 Annual Report related to its audits. 
Appointment, Compensation and Oversight of KPMG 
KPMG has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since before the IPO in 2010. Prior to retaining KPMG for fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee evaluated KPMG's performance with respect to fiscal 2017. In conducting this annual evaluation, the Audit Committee reviewed responses to questionnaires completed by members of the Audit Committee and management that covered areas such as independence (including the extent of non-audit services and fees), technical expertise, industry knowledge and communications with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also considered KPMG's tenure and the impact on the Company of changing auditors. In addition, in August 2018, the Audit Committee met with representatives of KPMG's audit practice leadership group to discuss KPMG's control environment and its process for managing audit inspections performed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The dialogue was productive, and the Audit Committee will continue to monitor KPMG's results in these areas. 
After determining to retain KPMG for fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee reviewed the proposed engagement letter, which included proposed fees for fiscal 2018. Throughout fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chairman (pursuant to delegation by the Audit Committee) reviewed engagement letters for additional audit or non-audit projects, and the related fees, that were outside the scope of the previously approved fiscal 2018 engagement letter. 
Discussions with KPMG 
The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 1301. In addition, KPMG has provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the firm's independence. 
Audited Consolidated Financial Statements 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 with management and KPMG, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2018. Based on these discussions with and reports of management and the independent auditors of the Company and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management, as well as the discussions referenced above, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that the audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2018 be included in the 2018 Annual Report for filing with the SEC.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock (the "Reporting Persons") to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Reporting Persons are required by SEC rules to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on a review of the copies of such forms furnished to the Company and written representations from the executive officers and directors, the Company believes that the 
 Reporting Persons complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements since the beginning of fiscal 2018 except that Ms. Rand inadvertently acquired shares over a period of approximately four years pursuant to dividend reinvestment that had been activated with respect to a third party investment account without her knowledge or permission. As a result, she filed a late Form 4 in early 2019 that reported 19 share acquisitions, each of which should have been reported on a separate Form 4. In addition, Ms. Rand filed a late Form 5 that reported a charitable contribution that should have been reported on an earlier Form 5. 
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures Governing Related Party Transactions 
Our Board has adopted a written policy with respect to related party transactions. This policy provides procedures for the review, and approval or ratification, of certain transactions involving related parties required to be reported under applicable rules of the SEC. The policy, which is administered by the Audit Committee, applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which we or one of our subsidiaries is a participant, the amount involved exceeds or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any fiscal year and a related party has a direct or indirect material interest. Certain transactions that we entered into prior to the IPO are excluded from the definition of related party transactions. Under the policy, a related party includes (i) any person who is or was, since the beginning of the last fiscal year, a director, executive officer or nominee for election as a director, (ii) a greater than 5% beneficial owner of any class of our voting securities, (iii) an immediate family member of either of the foregoing persons or (iv) any entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in a similar position in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest. Related party transactions are referred to the Audit Committee for approval, ratification or other action. Based on its consideration of all of the relevant facts and circumstances, the Audit Committee will approve or ratify a related party transaction only if it determines the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
Transactions with Citigroup 
As of December 13, 2011, Citigroup no longer had an ownership interest in Primerica. However, Mr. Mason, a member of Citigroup's senior management team, serves on our Board of Directors. His term will expire on May 16, 2019. As of March 1, 2019, Mr. Mason became an executive officer of Citigroup. 
In connection with the IPO, we entered into certain agreements and transactions with 
 Citigroup that continue to be effective. Further, Citigroup participates in the syndicate for our revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2018, the aggregate amount we paid to Citigroup represented less than 0.5% of Citigroup's total revenues. The Company does not believe that Mr. Mason has any material interest, whether direct or indirect, in the transactions and agreements we entered into with Citigroup in April 2010 in connection with the IPO or in any other arrangements that we have with Citigroup pursuant to which the Company pays immaterial amounts to Citigroup. 
Other Transactions 
Mr. Addison, one of our directors, serves on the Board of Directors of LegalShield. The Company has a business relationship with LegalShield pursuant to which Primerica and members of the sales force receive a commission for sales of LegalShield's legal protection plans. The Company does not believe that Mr. Addison has any material interest, whether direct or indirect, in these transactions or our arrangements with LegalShield. 
In June 2017, the Company signed a consulting agreement with Mr. Addison pursuant to which he receives $25,000 per quarter to perform various services requested by the Executive Team. At that time, the Board of Directors revoked the authorization, made in April 2015, to pay Mr. Addison $25,000 per quarter for his role as Chairman of Primerica Distribution. 
Before Senator Chambliss was elected to the Board, the Company had retained the law firm of DLA Piper, of which Senator Chambliss is a partner, to provide legal advice to the Company on various regulatory and transactional matters. Senator Chambliss does not perform legal work for the Company. The Corporate Governance Committee is informed of any engagement of DLA Piper to perform future legal work and, if necessary, such engagement will also be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval as a related party transaction. The Company does not believe that Senator Chambliss has any material interest, whether direct or indirect, in these transactions or our arrangements with DLA Piper. 
INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND 
THE ANNUAL MEETING 
We are furnishing this Proxy Statement in connection with the solicitation by our Board of Directors of proxies for the Annual Meeting for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Annual Meeting will be held on Thursday, May 16, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Primerica Theater located in Primerica's home office, One Primerica Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30099. 
On or about April 5, 2019, we will mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to holders of our common stock as of March 20, 2019, other than those holders who previously requested electronic or paper delivery of communications from us. The notice will contain instructions on: (i) how to access this Proxy Statement and the 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders (the "Annual Stockholders Report") and (ii) how to vote over the Internet, how to request and return a proxy card by mail and how to vote by telephone. 
What is the purpose of this Proxy Statement? 
This Proxy Statement provides information regarding matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting. Additionally, it contains certain information that the SEC requires us to provide annually to our stockholders. This Proxy Statement is also used by our Board of Directors to solicit proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting so that all stockholders of record have an opportunity to vote on the matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting, even if they cannot attend the meeting in person. Our Board has designated a Proxy Committee, which will vote the shares represented by proxies at the Annual Meeting in the manner indicated by the proxies (the "Proxy Committee"). The members of the Proxy Committee are Mr. G. Williams, our Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Schneider, our President. 
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a printed set of proxy materials? 
We are permitted by SEC rules to furnish our proxy materials over the Internet to our stockholders by delivering a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail. We believe that this "e-proxy" process expedites your receipt of proxy materials, while lowering the costs and reducing the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. Unless requested, holders of our common stock will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instructs you on how to access and review this Proxy Statement and the Annual Stockholders Report over the Internet at www.proxyvote.com. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you as to how you may vote over the Internet, how to request and return a proxy card by mail, and how to vote by telephone. If you receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail and would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, then you should follow the instructions for requesting these materials provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
Who is entitled to vote on the matters discussed in this Proxy Statement? 
You are entitled to vote if you were a stockholder of record of our common stock as of the close of business on March 20, 2019. Your shares can be voted at the Annual Meeting only if you are present in person or represented by a valid proxy. 
What constitutes a quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the close of business on the record date must be present, 
INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
 either in person or represented by valid proxy, to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the Annual Meeting. On the record date, 42,454,292 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding. Shares represented by valid proxies received but marked as abstentions, and shares represented by valid proxies received but reflecting broker non-votes, will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum. 
How many votes am I entitled to for each share of common stock I hold? 
Each share of our common stock represented at the Annual Meeting is entitled to one vote for each director nominee with respect to the proposal to elect directors and one vote for each of the other proposals to be voted on. 
What proposals will require my vote? 
You are being asked to vote on the following proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The election of the ten director nominees named in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 1);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consideration of an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 2); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal 3).  
[END TABLE]
What vote is required to approve each proposal or elect directors, and how will my vote be counted? 
Proposal 1: Election of Directors 
Each director will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, meaning that each director nominee must receive a greater number of shares voted "FOR" such director than the shares voted "against" such director. If an incumbent director does not receive a greater number of shares voted "FOR" such director than shares voted "AGAINST" such director, then such director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In that situation, the Board would decide whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action and would publicly disclose its decision and rationale behind it. Any shares that are not voted (whether by abstention or otherwise) will have no impact on the outcome of the vote with respect to this proposal. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named in this Proxy Statement. 
Proposal 2: Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation (Say-on-Pay) 
This proposal requires approval by the holders of at least a majority of the shares present in person or represented by valid proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Any shares that are not voted (whether by abstention or otherwise) will have no impact on the outcome of the vote with respect to this proposal. This is an advisory vote and is therefore not binding. 
Proposal 3: Ratification of the Appointment of KPMG LLP as Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
This proposal requires approval by the holders of at least a majority of the shares present in person or represented by valid proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Any shares that are not voted (whether by abstention or otherwise) will have no impact on the outcome of the vote with respect to this proposal. 
How does our Board of Directors recommend that I vote? 
Our Board recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the election of the ten director nominees named in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 1);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement (Proposal 2); and   
[END TABLE]

• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 (Proposal 3).   
[END TABLE]
What is the difference between a registered stockholder and a beneficial holder of shares? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, Inc., then you are considered a "registered  stockholder" with respect to those shares. Registered stockholders and holders of shares held in the Primerica, Inc. Stock Purchase Plan (the "Stock Purchase Plan") will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials  containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and the Annual Stockholders Report and how to vote over the Internet, how to request and return a proxy card by mail, and how to vote by telephone.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are considered the "beneficial holder" of the  shares held for you. Beneficial holders of shares should refer to the instructions provided by their broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote their shares or to revoke previous voting instructions. The availability of Internet and  telephone voting depends on the voting processes of the broker, bank or other nominee. As the beneficial holder, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. Beneficial holders may vote in person only if  they have a legal proxy to vote their shares.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote? 
If you are a registered stockholder, then you have four voting options. You may vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Over the Internet at the web address noted in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy materials e-mail or proxy card that you received;   
• By telephone through the number noted on your proxy card (if you received a proxy card);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By signing and dating your proxy card (if you received a proxy card) and mailing it in the prepaid and addressed envelope enclosed therewith; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
We encourage you to vote your shares as soon as possible by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial holder, then please refer to the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other nominee regarding how to vote. 
I am a beneficial holder. How are my shares voted if I do not return voting instructions? 
Your shares may be voted if they are held in the name of a brokerage firm, even if you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions. Under the rules of the NYSE, brokerage firms have the authority to vote shares on certain routine matters for which their customers do not provide voting instructions by the tenth day before the Annual Meeting. The ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 is considered a routine matter. 
None of the other proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting is considered a routine matter. If a proposal is not a routine matter and the brokerage firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial holder of the shares with respect to that proposal, then the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal. This is called a "broker non-vote." In tabulating the voting result for any particular proposal, shares that are subject to broker non-votes with respect to that proposal will not be considered votes either for or against the proposal. It is very important that you provide voting instructions to your brokerage firm if you want your shares to be voted at the Annual Meeting on a non-routine matter.
INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Can I change my mind after I vote? 
If you vote by proxy, then you can revoke that proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. You can do this in one of the following three ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote again using the Internet or by telephone prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sign another proxy card with a later date and return it to us prior to the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attend the Annual Meeting in person and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
How will a proposal or other matter that was not included in this Proxy Statement be handled for voting purposes if it is raised at the Annual Meeting? 
If any matter that is not described in this Proxy Statement should properly come before the Annual Meeting, then the Proxy Committee will vote the shares represented by valid proxies in accordance with its best judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, shares represented by valid proxies that are marked to deny discretionary authority to the Proxy Committee on other matters considered at the Annual Meeting will not be voted on those other matters and will not be counted in determining the number of votes cast with respect to those other matters. At the time this Proxy Statement was printed, management was unaware of any other matters that might be presented for stockholder action at the Annual Meeting. 
Who will tabulate and certify the vote? 
Representatives of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") will tabulate the vote, and a representative of Carl T. Hagberg and Associates will act as the independent inspector of elections for the Annual Meeting and will certify the final vote. 
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy materials e-mail or proxy card? 
This means that you have multiple accounts holding shares of our common stock with brokers and/or our transfer agent. You will need to vote separately with respect to each Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy materials e-mail or proxy card that you receive. Please vote all of the shares you are entitled to vote. 
Does the Company participate in householding? 
A single set of proxy materials, along with individual proxy cards, or individual Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, will be delivered in one envelope to multiple stockholders of record having the same last name and address, unless contrary instructions have been received from an affected stockholder. This is referred to as "householding." We believe this procedure provides greater convenience to our stockholders and saves money by reducing our printing and mailing costs and fees. If you would like to enroll in this service or receive individual copies of all documents, then please contact Broadridge by calling toll-free at 1-800-542-1061, or by writing to Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. Alternatively, if you participate in householding and would like to revoke your consent or otherwise would like to receive separate copies of our proxy materials, then please contact Broadridge as described above and we will promptly deliver them to you upon your written or oral request. 
A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding. If you hold your shares in street name, then please contact your bank, broker or other nominee to request information about householding. 
INFORMATION ABOUT VOTING AND THE ANNUAL MEETING 
How do I vote the shares that I purchased through the Stock Purchase Plan? 
If you are a registered stockholder and you own shares of our common stock through the Stock Purchase Plan, and the accounts are registered in the same name, then you will receive one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials representing your combined shares. If your registered account and your Stock Purchase Plan are registered in different names, then you will receive separate Notices of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you hold shares through the Stock Purchase Plan, then your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern daylight savings time on May 15, 2019, unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
What happens if I abstain from voting? 
Abstentions with respect to a proposal are counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. If a quorum is present, then abstentions will have no impact on the outcome of the vote with respect to Proposal 1 (election of directors), Proposal 2 (Say-on-Pay), and Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019). 
What do I need to do if I want to attend the Annual Meeting? 
You do not need to make a reservation to attend the Annual Meeting. However, attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to Primerica stockholders, members of their immediate families or their named representatives. The Company reserves the right to limit the number of named representatives who may attend the Annual Meeting. In order to gain admittance to the meeting, you may be required to show evidence that you were a holder of our common stock on the record date. 
How can I listen to the live webcast of the Annual Meeting? 
You may listen to a live webcast of the Annual Meeting at http://investors.primerica.com. The webcast will allow you to listen to the Annual Meeting, but stockholders accessing the Annual Meeting through the webcast will not be considered present at the Annual Meeting and will not be able to vote their shares through the webcast or ask questions. If you plan to listen to the live webcast, then please submit your vote prior to the Annual Meeting using one of the methods described under "How do I vote?" above. An archived copy of the webcast will be available at http://investors.primerica.com until at least June 15, 2019. Registration to listen to the webcast will be required. We have included our website address for reference only. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this Proxy Statement. 
How are proxies solicited and what is the cost? 
We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We have engaged AST Phoenix Advisors, Inc. to assist with the solicitation of proxies for an annual fee of $7,000 plus expenses. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock. Our directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by mail, telephone and personal contact. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities.

Our Board and management do not currently intend to bring before the Annual Meeting any matters other than those disclosed in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, nor are they aware of any business which other persons intend to present at the Annual Meeting. Should any other matter or business requiring a vote of stockholders arise, the Proxy Committee intends to exercise the authority conferred by the proxy and vote the shares represented thereby in respect of any such other matter or business in accordance with its best judgment in the interest of the Company. 
If a stockholder would like to bring a matter before the meeting that is not the subject of a proposal that meets the SEC proxy rule requirements for inclusion in the proxy statement, the stockholder must follow procedures in the Company's by-laws in order to personally present the proposal at the meeting. 
One of the procedural requirements in the Company's by-laws is timely notice in writing of the business the stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting. Notice of business proposed to be brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by the Company's Corporate Secretary no earlier than by 5:00 p.m. local time on January 17, 2020, and no later than 5:00 p.m. local time on February 16, 2020. Among other things, the notice must describe the business proposed to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting the business at the meeting, and any material interest of the stockholder in the business. Pursuant to Rule 14a-4 under the Exchange Act, if a stockholder notifies the Company after 
OTHER STOCKHOLDER INFORMATION 
 February 21, 2020 of an intent to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting (and for any reason the proposal is voted upon at the 2020 Annual Meeting), then the Proxy Committee will have the right to exercise discretionary voting authority with respect to the proposal without including information regarding the proposal in its proxy materials. 
A stockholder also may directly nominate someone for election as a director at a stockholders' meeting. Under the Company's by-laws, a stockholder may nominate a candidate at the 2020 Annual Meeting by providing advance notice to the Company to the Corporate Secretary that is received no earlier than 5:00 p.m. local time on January 17, 2020, and no later than 5:00 p.m. local time on February 17, 2020. Such notice shall contain all of the information specified in the Company's by-laws. In the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the Annual Meeting, the notice must be delivered to the Company's Corporate Secretary not earlier than the 120th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting and not later than the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is first made by the Company. 
A copy of the procedures and requirements related to the above matters is available upon request from the Corporate Secretary or can be found on our investor relations website at http://investors.primerica.com. The notices required above must be sent to the Corporate Secretary, Primerica, Inc., One Primerica Parkway, Duluth, Georgia 30099, or by fax: to 470-564-6600.

Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
We report the Company's financial results in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of certain items because they are considered unusual and not indicative of our ongoing operations. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the definitions of similar measures used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company's performance. 
Furthermore, management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may provide users with additional meaningful comparisons between current results and results of prior periods as they are expected to be reflective of our core ongoing business. These measures have limitations, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. 
Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are set forth below.
