SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA 92121 
PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 
SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD ON JANUARY 15, 2019 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Trovagene, Inc. ("Trovagene" or the "Company") is soliciting your proxy to vote at a Special Meeting of Stockholders (the "Special Meeting") to be held at our offices, located at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121, on January 15, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, including at any adjournments or postponements of the Special Meeting. You are invited to attend the Special Meeting to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. However, you do not need to attend the Special Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may simply complete, sign and return the enclosed proxy card if you received paper copies of the proxy materials, or follow the instructions below to submit your proxy over the Internet. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING 
How do I attend the Special Meeting? 
The Special Meeting will be held on January 15, 2019, at 9:00 a.m. Pacific Standard Time at our offices, located at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121. Directions to the Special Meeting may be found at the back of this Proxy Statement. Information on how to vote in person at the Special Meeting is discussed below. 
Who is Entitled to Vote? 
The Board has fixed the close of business on December 14, 2018 as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. On the Record Date, there were 22,991,190 shares of common stock outstanding. Each share of common stock represents one vote that may be voted on each proposal that may come before the Special Meeting. 
What is the Difference Between Holding Shares as a Record Holder and as a Beneficial Owner (Holding Shares in Street Name)? 
If your shares are registered in your name with our transfer agent, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc., you are the "record holder" of those shares. If you are a record holder, these proxy materials have been provided directly to you by the Company. 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares held in "street name." If your shares are held in street name, these proxy materials have been forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered to be the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Special Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct this organization on how to vote your shares. 
Who May Attend the Special Meeting? 
Only record holders and beneficial owners of our common stock, or their duly authorized proxies, may attend the Special Meeting. If your shares of common stock are held in street name, you will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement or other documentation reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date. 
What am I Voting on? 
There is one (1) matter scheduled for a vote: 
1. To authorize an amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock at a specific ratio, within a range of 1-for-2 and 1-for-6, to be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and effected, if at all, on or before January 15, 2020. 
What if another matter is properly brought before the Special Meeting? 
The Board knows of no other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Special Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the Special Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote on those matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
How Do I Vote? 
Stockholders of Record 
For your convenience, record holders of our common stock have three methods of voting: 
1. Vote by Internet. The website address for Internet voting is on your vote instruction form. 
2. Vote by mail. Mark, date, sign and promptly mail the enclosed proxy card (a postage-paid envelope is provided for mailing in the United States). 
3. Vote in person. Attend and vote at the Special Meeting. 
Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name 
For your convenience, beneficial owners of our common stock have three methods of voting: 
1. Vote by Internet. The website address for Internet voting is on your vote instruction form. 
2. Vote by mail. Mark, date, sign and promptly mail your vote instruction form (a postage-paid envelope is provided for mailing in the United States). 
3. Vote in person. Obtain a valid legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares and attend and vote at the Special Meeting. 
If you vote by Internet, please DO NOT mail your proxy card. 
All shares entitled to vote and represented by a properly completed and executed proxy received before the Special Meeting and not revoked will be voted at the Special Meeting as instructed in a proxy delivered before the Special Meeting. If you do not indicate how your shares should be voted on a matter, the shares represented by your properly completed and executed proxy will be voted as the Board recommends on each of the enumerated proposals, with regard to any other matters that may be properly presented at the Special Meeting and on all matters incident to the conduct of the Special Meeting. If you are a registered stockholder and attend the Special Meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. If you are a street name stockholder and wish to vote at the Special Meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy form from the institution that holds your shares. All votes will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. 
We provide Internet proxy voting to allow you to vote your shares online, with procedures designed to ensure the authenticity and correctness of your proxy vote instructions. However, please be aware that you must bear any costs associated with your Internet access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies. 
How Many Votes do I Have? 
On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of common stock you own as of the close of business on the Record Date. 
Is My Vote Confidential? 
Yes, your vote is confidential. Only the inspector of elections, individuals who help with processing and counting your votes and persons who need access for legal reasons will have access to your vote. This information will not be disclosed, except as required by law. 
What Constitutes a Quorum? 
To carry on business at the Special Meeting, we must have a quorum. A quorum is present when a majority of the shares entitled to vote, as of the Record Date, are represented in person or by proxy. Thus, 11,495,596 shares must be represented in person or by proxy to have a quorum at the Special Meeting. Your shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy (or one is submitted on your behalf by your broker, bank or other nominee) or if you vote in person at the Special Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted towards the quorum requirement. Shares owned by us are not considered outstanding or considered to be present at the Special Meeting. If there is not a quorum at the Special Meeting, either the chairperson of the Special Meeting or our stockholders entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting. 
How Will my Shares be Voted if I Give No Specific Instruction? 
We must vote your shares as you have instructed. If there is a matter on which a stockholder of record has given no specific instruction but has authorized us generally to vote the shares, they will be voted as follows: 
1. "FOR" the approval of the Reverse Stock Split, as described in Proposal 1. 
This authorization would exist, for example, if a stockholder of record merely signs, dates and returns the proxy card but does not indicate how its shares are to be voted on one or more proposals. If other matters properly come before the Special Meeting and you do not provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted at the discretion of the proxies. 
If your shares are held in street name, see "What is a Broker Non-Vote?" below regarding the ability of banks, brokers and other such holders of record to vote the uninstructed shares of their customers or other beneficial owners in their discretion. 
How are Votes Counted? 
Votes will be counted by the inspector of elections appointed for the Special Meeting, who will separately count, votes "FOR" and "AGAINST," abstentions and broker non-votes. 
What is a Broker Non-Vote? 
If your shares are held in street name, you must instruct the organization who holds your shares how to vote your shares. If you sign your proxy card but do not provide instructions on how your broker should vote on "routine" proposals, your broker will vote your shares as recommended by the Board. If you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any "non-routine" proposals. This vote is called a "broker non-vote." Because broker non-votes are not considered under Delaware law to be entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, broker non-votes will not be included in the tabulation of the voting results of any of the proposals and, therefore, will have no effect on these proposals. 
What is an Abstention? 
An abstention is a stockholder's affirmative choice to decline to vote on a proposal. Under Delaware law, abstentions are counted as shares present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting. However, our By-Laws provide that an action of our stockholders (other than the election of directors) is only approved if a majority of the number of shares of stock present and entitled to vote thereat vote in favor of such action. 
How Many Votes are Needed for Each Proposal to Pass?

[END TABLE]
What Are the Voting Procedures? 
In voting by proxy with regard to the proposals, you may vote in favor of or against the proposal, or you may abstain from voting on the proposal. You should specify your respective choices on the accompanying proxy card or your vote instruction form. 
Is My Proxy Revocable? 
You may revoke your proxy and reclaim your right to vote at any time before your proxy is voted by giving written notice to the Secretary of Trovagene, by delivering a properly completed, later-dated proxy card or vote instruction form or by voting in person at the Special Meeting. All written notices of revocation and other communications with respect to revocations of proxies should be addressed to: Trovagene, Inc., 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121, Attention: Secretary, or by facsimile at 858-952-7571. Your most current proxy card or Internet proxy is the one that will be counted. 
Who is Paying for the Expenses Involved in Preparing and Mailing this Proxy Statement? 
All of the expenses involved in preparing, assembling and mailing these proxy materials and all costs of soliciting proxies will be paid by us. In addition to the solicitation by mail, proxies may be solicited by our officers and other employees by telephone or in person. Such persons will receive no compensation for their services other than their regular salaries. Arrangements will also be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward solicitation materials to the beneficial owners of the shares held of record by such persons, and we may reimburse such persons for reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by them in forwarding solicitation materials. We have retained Kingsdale Advisors as our strategic shareholder advisor and proxy solicitation agent in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting. If you have any questions or require any assistance with completing your proxy, please contact Kingsdale Advisors by telephone (toll-free within North America) at 1-866-851-2484 or (call collect outside North America) at 416-867-2272 or by email at contactus@kingsdaleadvisors.com. 
Do I Have Dissenters' Rights of Appraisal? 
Trovagene stockholders do not have appraisal rights under Delaware law or under Trovagene's governing documents with respect to the matters to be voted upon at the Special Meeting. 
How can I Find out the Results of the Voting at the Special Meeting? 
Preliminary voting results will be announced at the Special Meeting. In addition, final voting results will be disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we expect to file with the SEC within four (4) business days after the Special Meeting. If final voting results are not available to us in time to file a Form 8-K with the SEC within four (4) business days after the Special Meeting, we intend to file a Form 8-K to publish preliminary results and, within four (4) business days after the final results are known to us, file an additional Form 8-K to publish the final results. 
When are Stockholder Proposals Due for the 2019 Annual Meeting? 
Any appropriate proposal submitted by a stockholder and intended to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2019 Annual Meeting") must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121, and received no later than January 3, 2019, to be includable in the Company's proxy statement and related proxy for the 2019 Annual Meeting. However, if the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting is convened more than 30 days before, or delayed by more than 30 days after, May 30, 2019, to be considered for inclusion in proxy materials for our 2019 Annual Meeting, a stockholder proposal must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121, a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting. A stockholder proposal will need to comply with the SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. Although the Board will consider stockholder proposals, we reserve the right to omit from our proxy statement, or to vote against, stockholder proposals that we are not required to include under the Exchange Act, including Rule 14a-8. 
If you wish to submit a proposal that is not to be included in the proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting, your proposal must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121 by March 1, 2019. However, if the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting is convened more than 30 days before, or delayed by more than 30 days after, May 30, 2019, to be brought before our 2019 Annual Meeting, a stockholder proposal must be submitted in writing to the Company's Secretary at 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121, a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy materials for the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Do the Company's Officers and Directors have an Interest in Any of the Matters to Be Acted Upon at the Special Meeting? 
Members of the Board and executive officers of Trovagene own stock and/or options in the Company, and therefore have an interest in Proposal 1. 
PROPOSAL 1 
TO GRANT DISCRETIONARY AUTHORITY TO THE COMPANY'S BOARD TO AMEND THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE COMPANY TO EFFECT THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. 
The Board deems it advisable and in the best interest of the Company that the Board be granted the discretionary authority to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation to effect a Reverse Stock Split of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock as described below (the "Reverse Stock Split Amendment"). 
The form of Reverse Stock Split Amendment to be filed with the Delaware Secretary of State is set forth in Appendix A. 
Approval of the proposal would permit (but not require) our Board to effect one or more reverse stock splits of our issued and outstanding common stock by a ratio of not less than 1-for-2 and not more than 1-for-6, with the exact ratio to be set at a number within this range as determined by our Board in its sole discretion, provided that the Board determines to effect the Reverse Stock Split and such amendment is filed with the appropriate authorities in the State of Delaware no later than January 15, 2020. The Company shall not effect a Reverse Stock Split that, in the aggregate, exceeds 1-for-6. We believe that enabling our Board to set the ratio within the stated range will provide us with the flexibility to implement the Reverse Stock Split in a manner designed to maximize the anticipated benefits for our stockholders. In determining a ratio, if any, our Board may consider, among other things, factors such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the initial or continuing listing requirements of various stock exchanges, including The Nasdaq Capital Market;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the historical trading price and trading volume of our common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number of shares of our common stock outstanding;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the then-prevailing trading price and trading volume of our common stock and the anticipated impact of the  Reverse Stock Split on the trading market for our common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the anticipated impact of a particular ratio on our ability to reduce administrative and transactional costs; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prevailing general market and economic conditions.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board reserves the right to elect to abandon the Reverse Stock Split, including any or all proposed reverse stock split ratios, if it determines, in its sole discretion, that the Reverse Stock Split is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Depending on the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split determined by our Board, no less than 2 and no more than 6 shares of existing Common Stock, as determined by our Board, will be combined into one share of our common stock. Our Board will have the discretionary authority to determine whether to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by holder entitled thereto, to pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or to entitle holders to receive from the Company transfer agent, in lieu of any fractional share, the number of shares rounded up to the next whole number. The amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effect a Reverse Stock Split, if any, will include only the reverse split ratio determined by our Board to be in the best interests of our stockholders and all of the other proposed amendments at different ratios will be abandoned. 
Reasons for the Reverse Stock Split; Potential Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split 
On September 5, 2017, the Company received a written notice from the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the minimum bid price of the Company's common stock has been below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had a period of 180 calendar days, or until March 5, 2018, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. On March 6, 2018, the Nasdaq staff notified the Company that it had not regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and was eligible for a second 180 day period, or until September 4, 2018 to regain compliance with the minimum bid requirement. 
On June 1, 2018, the Company effected a 1-for-12 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock in an effort to comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). On June 12, 2018, the Company closed a public offering of $18,000,000 consisting of 9,140,000 Class A Units offered at $1.00 per share and 8,860 Class B Units offered at $1,000 per share. The Class A Units consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $1.10 per share. The Class B Units consisted of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock which is convertible into an aggregate of 8,860,000 shares of common stock. Additionally, the Company issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 20,700,000 shares of common stock in connection with the public offering. 
On September 7, 2018, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, based upon the Company's continued non-compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Rule, the Company's common stock would be subject to delisting unless the Company timely requests a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the "Panel"). The Company timely requested a hearing before the Panel which was held on November 8, 2018. On November 15, 2018, the Company announced that the Panel has granted the Company's request for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to on or before January 31, 2019, the Company effecting a reverse stock split of its common stock and evidencing a closing bid price of over $1.00 for at least 10 consecutive trading days. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to evidence compliance with the continued listing criteria by January 31, 2019. 
The Company's primary reasons for approving and recommending the Reverse Stock Split are to make the common stock more attractive to certain institutional investors, which would provide for a stronger investor base and to increase the per share price and bid price of our common stock to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq. 
Reducing the number of outstanding shares of common stock should, absent other factors, generally increase the per share market price of the common stock. Although the intent of the Reverse Stock Split is to increase the price of the common stock, there can be no assurance, however, that even if the Reverse Stock Split is effected, that the Company's bid price of the Company's common stock will be sufficient for the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. 
In addition, the Company believes the Reverse Stock Split will make its common stock more attractive to a broader range of investors, as it believes that the current market price of the common stock may prevent certain institutional investors, professional investors and other members of the investing public from purchasing stock. Many brokerage houses and institutional investors have internal policies and practices that either prohibit them from investing in low-priced stocks or tend to discourage individual brokers from recommending low-priced stocks to their customers. Furthermore, some of those policies and practices may function to make the processing of trades in low-priced stocks economically unattractive to brokers. Moreover, because brokers' commissions on low-priced stocks generally represent a higher percentage of the stock price than commissions on higher-priced stocks, the current average price per share of common stock can result in individual stockholders paying transaction costs representing a higher percentage of their total share value than would be the case if the share price were higher. The Company believes that the Reverse Stock Split will make the common stock a more attractive and cost effective investment for many investors, which in turn would enhance the liquidity of the holders of common stock. 
Reducing the number of outstanding shares of our common stock through the Reverse Stock Split is intended, absent other factors, to increase the per share market price of our common stock. However, other factors, such as our financial results, market conditions and the market perception of our business may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split, if completed, will result in the intended benefits described above, that the market price of our common stock will increase following the Reverse Stock Split, that as a result of the Reverse Stock Split we will be able to meet or maintain a bid price over the minimum bid price requirement of Nasdaq or that the market price of our common stock will not decrease in the future. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the market price per share of our common stock after the Reverse Stock Split will increase in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our common stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the Reverse Stock Split. 
Procedure for Implementing the Reverse Stock Split 
The Reverse Stock Split will become effective upon the filing or such later time as specified in the filing (the "Effective Time") of the Reverse Stock Split Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State. The form of the Reverse Stock Split Amendment is attached hereto as Appendix A. The exact timing of the filing of the Reverse Stock Split Amendment and the ratio of the Reverse Stock Split (within the approved range) will be determined by our Board based on its evaluation as to when such action and at what ratio will be the most advantageous to the Company and our stockholders. In addition, our Board reserves the right, notwithstanding stockholder approval and without further action by the stockholders, to elect not to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split if, at any time prior to filing the Reverse Stock Split Amendment, our Board, in its sole discretion, determines that it is no longer in our best interest and the best interests of our stockholders to proceed with the Reverse Stock Split. If the Reverse Stock Split Amendment has not been filed with the Delaware Secretary of State by January 15, 2020, our Board will abandon the Reverse Stock Split. 
Effect of the Reverse Stock Split on Holders of Outstanding Common Stock 
Depending on the ratio for the Reverse Stock Split determined by our Board, a minimum of 2 and a maximum of 6 shares in aggregate of existing common stock will be combined into one new share of our common stock. Based on 22,991,190 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of the record date, immediately following the Reverse Stock Split the Company would have approximately 11,495,595 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (without giving effect to rounding for fractional shares) if the ratio for the reverse split is 1-for-2, approximately 5,747,798 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (without giving effect to rounding for fractional shares) if the ratio for the reverse split is 1-for-4, and approximately 3,831,865 shares of common stock issued and outstanding (without giving effect to rounding for fractional shares) if the ratio for the reverse split is 1-for-6, which is the aggregate ratio allowed under this proposal. Any other ratios selected within such range would result in a number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding following the transaction between 3,831,865 and 11,495,595 shares. 
The actual number of shares issued after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, will depend on the Reverse Stock Split ratio and the number of Reverse Stock Splits, if any, that are ultimately determined by our Board. 
The Reverse Stock Split will affect all holders of our common stock uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company, except that as described below in "Fractional Shares," record holders of Common Stock otherwise entitled to a fractional share as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the next whole number. In addition, the Reverse Stock Split will not affect any stockholder's proportionate voting power (subject to the treatment of fractional shares). 
The Reverse Stock Split may result in some stockholders owning "odd lots" of less than 100 shares of common stock. Odd lot shares may be more difficult to sell, and brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in "round lots" of even multiples of 100 shares. 
After the Effective Time, our common stock will have new Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures ("CUSIP") numbers, which is a number used to identify our equity securities, and stock certificates with the older CUSIP numbers will need to be exchanged for stock certificates with the new CUSIP numbers by following the procedures described below. After the Effective Time, we will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting and other requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and our common stock will continue to be quoted on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol "TROV." The Reverse Stock Split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a "going private transaction" as described by Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act. 
After the Effective Time of the Reverse Stock Split, the post-split market price of our common stock may be less than the pre-split price multiplied by the Reverse Stock Split ratio. In addition, a reduction in number of shares outstanding may impair the liquidity for our common stock, which may reduce the value of our common stock. 
Authorized Shares of Common Stock 
The Reverse Stock Split will not change the number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock under the Company's certificate of incorporation. Because the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock will decrease, the number of shares of common stock remaining available for issuance will increase. Currently, under our certificate of incorporation, our authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of common stock. 
Subject to limitations imposed by Nasdaq, the additional shares available for issuance may be issued without stockholder approval at any time, in the sole discretion of our Board. The authorized and unissued shares may be issued for cash, for acquisitions or for any other purpose that is deemed in the best interests of the Company. 
By increasing the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock, the Reverse Stock Split could, under certain circumstances, have an anti-takeover effect, although this is not the intent of the Board. For example, it may be possible for the Board to delay or impede a takeover or transfer of control of the Company by causing such additional authorized but unissued shares to be issued to holders who might side with the Board in opposing a takeover bid that the Board determines is not in the best interests of the Company or its stockholders. The Reverse Stock Split therefore may have the effect of discouraging unsolicited takeover attempts. By potentially discouraging initiation of any such unsolicited takeover attempts the Reverse Stock Split may limit the opportunity for the Company's stockholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal. The Reverse Stock Split may have the effect of permitting the Company's current management, including the current Board, to retain its position, and place it in a better position to resist changes that stockholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of the Company's business. However, the Board is not aware of any attempt to take control of the Company and the Board has not approved the Reverse Stock Split with the intent that it be utilized as a type of anti-takeover device. 
Beneficial Holders of Common Stock (i.e. stockholders who hold in street name) 
Upon the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split, we intend to treat shares held by stockholders through a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee in the same manner as registered stockholders whose shares are registered in their names. Banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees will be instructed to effect the Reverse Stock Split for their beneficial holders holding our common stock in street name. However, these banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees may have different procedures than registered stockholders for processing the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who hold shares of our common stock with a bank, broker, custodian or other nominee and who have any questions in this regard are encouraged to contact their banks, brokers, custodians or other nominees. 
Registered "Book-Entry" Holders of Common Stock (i.e. stockholders that are registered on the transfer agent's books and records but do not hold stock certificates) 
Certain of our registered holders of common stock may hold some or all of their shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent. These stockholders do not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership of the common stock. They are, however, provided with a statement reflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts. 
Stockholders who hold shares electronically in book-entry form with the transfer agent will not need to take action (the exchange will be automatic) to receive whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split common stock, subject to adjustment for treatment of fractional shares. 
Holders of Certificated Shares of Common Stock 
Stockholders holding shares of our common stock in certificated form will be sent a transmittal letter by our transfer agent after the Effective Time. The letter of transmittal will contain instructions on how a stockholder should surrender his, her or its certificate(s) representing shares of our common stock (the "Old Certificates") to the transfer agent in exchange for certificates representing the appropriate number of whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split common stock (the "New Certificates"). No New Certificates will be issued to a stockholder until such stockholder has surrendered all Old Certificates, together with a properly completed and executed letter of transmittal, to the transfer agent. No stockholder will be required to pay a transfer or other fee to exchange his, her or its Old Certificates. Stockholders will then receive a New Certificate(s) representing the number of whole shares of common stock that they are entitled as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, subject to the treatment of fractional shares described below. Until surrendered, we will deem outstanding Old Certificates held by stockholders to be cancelled and only to represent the number of whole shares of post-Reverse Stock Split common stock to which these stockholders are entitled, subject to the treatment of fractional shares. Any Old Certificates submitted for exchange, whether because of a sale, transfer or other disposition of stock, will automatically be exchanged for New Certificates. If an Old Certificate has a restrictive legend on the back of the Old Certificate(s), the New Certificate will be issued with the same restrictive legends that are on the back of the Old Certificate(s). 
The Company expects that our transfer agent will act as exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange of stock certificates. No service charges will be payable by holders of shares of common stock in connection with the exchange of certificates. All of such expenses will be borne by the Company. 
STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY STOCK CERTIFICATE(S) UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO. 
Fractional Shares 
The Board will have the discretionary authority to determine whether to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by stockholders entitled thereto, to pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, or to entitle stockholders to receive from the Company's transfer agent, in lieu of any fractional share, the number of shares rounded up to the next whole number. 
If the Board determines to arrange for the disposition of fractional interests by stockholders entitled thereto or to pay in cash the fair value of fractions of a share as of the time when those entitled to receive such fractions are determined, stockholders who would otherwise hold fractional shares because the number of shares of common stock they hold before the Reverse Stock Split is not evenly divisible by the ratio ultimately selected by the Board will be entitled to receive cash (without interest or deduction) in lieu of such fractional shares from either: (i) the Company, upon receipt by the transfer agent of a properly completed and duly executed transmittal letter and, where shares are held in certificated form, upon due surrender of any certificate previously representing a fractional share, in an amount equal to such holder's fractional share based upon the closing sale price of the common stock on the trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time as reported on the Nasdaq Capital Market, or other principal market of the common stock, as applicable, as of the date the Reverse Stock Split is effected; or (ii) the transfer agent, upon receipt by the transfer agent of a properly completed and duly executed transmittal letter and, where shares are held in certificated form, the surrender of all old certificate(s), in an amount equal to the proceeds attributable to the sale of such fractional shares following the aggregation and sale by the transfer agent of all fractional shares otherwise issuable. If the Board determines to dispose of fractional interests pursuant to clause (ii) above, the Company expects that the transfer agent would conduct the sale in an orderly fashion at a reasonable pace and that it may take several days to sell all of the aggregated fractional shares of Common Stock. In this event, such holders would be entitled to an amount equal to their pro rata share of the proceeds of such sale. The Company will be responsible for any brokerage fees or commissions related to the transfer agent's open market sales of shares that would otherwise be fractional shares. 
The ownership of a fractional share interest following the Reverse Stock Split will not give the holder any voting, dividend or other rights, except to receive the cash payment, or, if the Board so determines, to receive the number of shares rounded up to the next whole number, as described above. 
Stockholders should be aware that, under the escheat laws of various jurisdictions, sums due for fractional interests that are not timely claimed after the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split may be required to be paid to the designated agent for each such jurisdiction, unless correspondence has been received by the Company or the transfer agent concerning ownership of such funds within the time permitted in such jurisdiction. Thereafter, if applicable, stockholders otherwise entitled to receive such funds, but who do not receive them due to, for example, their failure to timely comply with the transfer agent's instructions, will have to seek to obtain such funds directly from the state to which they were paid. 
Effect of the Reverse Stock Split on Employee and Consultant Plans, Options, Restricted Stock Awards and Units, Warrants, and Convertible or Exchangeable Securities 
Based upon the Reverse Stock Split ratio determined by the Board, proportionate adjustments are generally required to be made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or conversion of all outstanding options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities entitling the holders to purchase, exchange for, or convert into, shares of common stock. This would result in approximately the same aggregate price being required to be paid under such options, warrants, convertible or exchangeable securities upon exercise, and approximately the same value of shares of common stock being delivered upon such exercise, exchange or conversion, immediately following the Reverse Stock Split as was the case immediately preceding the Reverse Stock Split. The number of shares deliverable upon settlement or vesting of restricted stock awards will be similarly adjusted, subject to our treatment of fractional shares. The number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to these securities will be proportionately based upon the Reverse Stock Split determined by the Board, subject to our treatment of fractional shares. 
Accounting Matters 
The Reverse Stock Split Amendment will not affect the par value of our Common Stock per share, which will remain $0.0001 par value per share. As a result, as of the Effective Time, the stated capital attributable to common stock and the additional paid-in capital account on our balance sheet, on aggregate, will not change due to the Reverse Stock Split. Reported per share net income or loss will be higher because there will be fewer shares of common stock outstanding. 
Certain Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split 
The following summary describes certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split to holders of our common stock. 
Unless otherwise specifically indicated herein, this summary addresses the tax consequences only to a beneficial owner of our common stock that is a citizen or individual resident of the United States, a corporation organized in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of our common stock (a "U.S. holder"). A trust may also be a U.S. holder if (1) a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over administration of such trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) it has a valid election in place to be treated as a U.S. person. An estate whose income is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source may also be a U.S. holder. This summary does not address all of the tax consequences that may be relevant to any particular investor, including tax considerations that arise from rules of general application to all taxpayers or to certain classes of taxpayers or that are generally assumed to be known by investors. This summary also does not address the tax consequences to (i) persons that may be subject to special treatment under U.S. federal income tax law, such as banks, insurance companies, thrift institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt organizations, U.S. expatriates, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, traders in securities that elect to mark to market and dealers in securities or currencies, (ii) persons that hold our common stock as part of a position in a "straddle" or as part of a "hedging," "conversion" or other integrated investment transaction for federal income tax purposes, or (iii) persons that do not hold our common stock as "capital assets" (generally, property held for investment). 
If a partnership (or other entity classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) is the beneficial owner of our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partnerships that hold our Common Stock, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split. 
This summary is based on the provisions of the Code, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative rulings and judicial authority, all as in effect as of the date of this information statement. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split. 
PLEASE CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR REGARDING THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT IN YOUR PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE AND THE LAWS OF ANY OTHER TAXING JURISDICTION. 
U.S. Holders 
The Reverse Stock Split should be treated as a recapitalization for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Therefore, a stockholder generally will not recognize gain or loss on the Reverse Stock Split, except to the extent of cash, if any, received in lieu of a fractional share interest in the post-Reverse Stock Split shares. The aggregate tax basis of the post-split shares received will be equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-split shares exchanged therefore (excluding any portion of the holder's basis allocated to fractional shares), and the holding period of the post-split shares received will include the holding period of the pre-split shares exchanged. A holder of the pre-split shares who receives cash will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the portion of the tax basis of the pre-split shares allocated to the fractional share interest and the cash received. Such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss and will be short term if the pre-split shares were held for one year or less and long term if held more than one year. No gain or loss will be recognized by us as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. 
No Appraisal Rights 
Under Delaware law and our charter documents, holders of our common stock will not be entitled to dissenter's rights or appraisal rights with respect to the Reverse Stock Split. 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting will be required to approve the Reverse Stock Split. 
Board Recommendation 
OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE REVERSE STOCK SPLIT. 
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as of December 14, 2018 by (i) each person known to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, (ii) each of our directors, (iii) each of our named executive officers (as defined in "Summary Compensation Table" below), and (iv) all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

OTHER MATTERS 
We have no knowledge of any other matters that may come before the Special Meeting and do not intend to present any other matters. However, if any other matters shall properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the persons soliciting proxies will have the discretion to vote as they see fit unless directed otherwise. 
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies in the accompanying form. In addition to the use of the mails, proxies may also be solicited by our directors, officers or other employees, personally or by telephone, facsimile or email, none of whom will be compensated separately for these solicitation activities. We have engaged Kingsdale Advisors to assist in the solicitation of proxies. We will pay a fee of $13,500 plus reasonable out-of-pocket charges. 
If you do not plan to attend the Special Meeting, in order that your shares may be represented and in order to assure the required quorum, please sign, date and return your proxy promptly. In the event you are able to attend the Special Meeting, at your request, we will cancel your previously submitted proxy. 
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Householding 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for Proxy Availability Notice or other Special Meeting materials with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Notice or other Special Meeting materials addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as householding, potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards. 
This year, a number of brokers with account holders who are our stockholders will be "householding" our proxy materials. A Notice or proxy materials will be delivered in one single envelope to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from one or more of the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding communications to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate Notice or proxy materials, please notify your broker or call our Secretary at (858) 952-7570, or submit a request in writing to our Secretary, c/o Trovagene, Inc., 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice or proxy materials at their address and would like to request householding of their communications should contact their broker. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the Notice or proxy materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered. 
Annual Reports on Form 10-K 
Copies of Trovagene's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 may be obtained without charge by writing to the Secretary, Trovagene, Inc., 11055 Flintkote Avenue, San Diego, California 92121.

APPENDIX A 
CERTIFICATE OF AMENDMENT 
of the 
AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
Under Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 
Trovagene, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Corporation") hereby certifies as follows: 
FIRST: That the Board of Directors of the Corporation has duly adopted resolutions (i) authorizing the Corporation to execute and file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware this Certificate of Amendment of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (this "Amendment") to combine each [NUMBER] ([        ]) shares of the Corporation's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Common Stock"), either issued and outstanding or held by the Corporation as treasury stock, into one (1) share of Common Stock; (ii) declaring this Amendment to be advisable, submitted to and considered by the stockholders of the Corporation entitled to vote thereon for approval by the affirmative vote of such stockholders in accordance with the terms of the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") and Section 242 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"); and (iii) recommending this Amendment for approval by the stockholders of the Corporation. 
SECOND: That this Amendment was duly adopted in accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation and the provisions of Section 242 of the DGCL by the stockholders of the Corporation. 
THIRD: Effective at [TIME] (New York City time) on the date of the filing of this Amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (with such time on such date being the "Effective Time"), the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended by amending the Article "FOURTH" thereof to insert the following at the end thereof: 
"Effective at [TIME] (New York City time) on the date of the filing of the Certificate of Amendment of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Corporation, dated [DATE], 2019, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to insert the following provisions to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Effective Time"), each [NUMBER] ([        ]) shares of Common Stock either issued and outstanding or held by the Corporation as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be combined into one (1) share of Common Stock (the "Reverse Stock Split"). Further, every right, option and warrant to acquire shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time and without any further action, automatically be reclassified into the right to acquire one (1) share of Common Stock based on the above ratio, but otherwise upon the terms of such right, option or warrant (except that the exercise or purchase price of such right, option or warrant shall be proportionately adjusted). No fractional share shall be issued upon the Reverse Stock Split. All shares of Common Stock (including fractions thereof) issuable upon the Reverse Stock Split to a given holder shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the Reverse Stock Split would result in the issuance of any fractional share. If, after the aforementioned aggregation, the Reverse Stock Split would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, in lieu of receiving any such fractional share, the holder (other than with respect to shares of Common Stock held by the Corporation as treasury stock) otherwise entitled to such fraction will receive a sum in cash equal to the fraction multiplied by the fair market value per share of the Common Stock as determined in a reasonable manner by the Board of Directors. Upon surrender by a holder of a certificate or certificates for Common Stock (or, if lost, an acceptable affidavit of loss is delivered to the Corporation), the Corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, issue and deliver to such holder, or to the nominee or assignee of such holder, a new certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock that such holder shall be entitled to following the Reverse Stock Split." 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have executed this Amendment this          day of                     , 2019.
