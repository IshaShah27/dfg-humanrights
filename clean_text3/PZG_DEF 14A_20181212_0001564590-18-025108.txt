At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the matters outlined in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders on the cover page of this proxy statement, consisting of (1) election of directors; (2) approval of the amendments to the 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan; (3) ratification of the selection of MNP LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019; and (4) any other matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting.
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
Only our stockholders of record at the close of business on October 15, 2018, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of and to participate in the annual meeting. If you were a stockholder of record on that date, you will be entitled to vote all of the shares you held on that date at the meeting, or any postponement(s) or adjournment(s) of the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 25,474,954 shares of common stock outstanding, all of which are entitled to be voted at the Annual Meeting.
A list of stockholders will be available at our headquarters at 665 Anderson Street, Winnemucca, Nevada, 89445, as of the mail date, October 29, 2018 through to the Annual Meeting and at the Annual Meeting itself for examination by any stockholder.
Why am I receiving these materials?
You are receiving these materials because, as of October 15, 2018, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, you owned shares of Paramount common stock.  Paramount has made these materials available to you on the Internet or has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Company's Board of Directors' solicitation of proxies for use at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held on Wednesday, December 12, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. local time.  These proxy materials give you information to determine how to vote in connection with the Annual Meeting.
What proposals will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?
Stockholders will vote on three proposals at the Annual Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The election to the Board of Directors the seven nominees named in this proxy statement (Proposal No. 1);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The approval of the amendments to the 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan to increase the number of common shares authorized for issuance thereunder by 600,000 (from 291,177 shares to 891,177 shares) and to reduce the maximum term that an option shall be exercisable from ten (10) years to five (5) years (Proposal No. 2) and

[END TABLE]
What are the Board of Directors' voting recommendations?
The Board recommends that you vote your shares:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" each of the nominees to the Board (Proposal No. 1);

• "FOR" ratification of the appointment of MNP LLP as Paramount's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 (Proposal No. 3);  
[END TABLE]
Where is Paramount's head office? And what is Paramount's main telephone number?
Our head office is located at 665 Anderson Street, Winnemucca, Nevada, 89445. Our telephone number is (775) 625-3600.
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy material instead of a full set of proxy materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials via the Internet. Accordingly, the Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") to the Company's stockholders. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. The Company encourages stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to expedite the stockholders' receipt of proxy material, help lower the cost of the Annual Meeting and reduce the environmental impact of its annual meetings. 
However, if a stockholder would prefer to receive printed proxy materials, the stockholder may follow the instructions included in the Notice.
How can I get electronic access to the proxy material?
The Notice will provide you with instructions regarding how to access the proxy materials on the Internet for the Annual Meeting.  Also, the Notice will indicate how to instruct Paramount to send future proxy materials to you by email.  Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our Annual Meeting of stockholders on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. The Annual Report on Form 10-K accompanies the proxy materials but is not considered part of the proxy soliciting materials.
You can also access proxy materials on the Company's website at www.paramountnevada.com/pzgproxy.pdf 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
For each matter, stockholders have one vote for each share of Company common stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date (defined in the next sentence). Only stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 15, 2018 (the "Record Date") are entitled to receive notice of, to attend and to vote at the Meeting.  As of the Record Date, there were 25,474,954 shares of Paramount's common stock issued and outstanding.
How do I vote my shares if I am a shareholder of record?
There are four ways to vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person.  If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting.  The Company will give you a ballot when you arrive. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet.  You may vote by proxy via the Internet by following the instructions provided on the ballot.  
• By Telephone.  With your proxy card in hand, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number found on the ballot. 
• By Mail.  You may vote by proxy by filling out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
How do I vote my shares if I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name as of the Record Date?
There are four ways to vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person.  If you are a beneficial owner of stock held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares.  Please contact that organization for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy. 
• Via the Internet.  You may vote by proxy via the Internet by visiting www.proxyvote.com and entering the control number found on the ballot. 
• By Telephone.  With your proxy card in hand, you may vote by proxy by calling the toll free number found on the ballot. 
• By Mail.  You may vote by proxy by filling out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
What is the quorum requirement for the Annual Meeting?
One-third of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group, represented in person or by proxy, constitutes a quorum of that voting group for the action on the matter, and abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. Your shares will be counted for purposes of determining if there is a quorum, whether representing votes for, against or abstained, if you:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Are present and vote in person at the Annual Meeting; or 
• Have voted on the Internet, by telephone or by properly submitting a proxy card or vote instruction form by mail. 
[END TABLE]
If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.
How are proxies voted?
All stock represented by valid proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted and, where a stockholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the stockholders instructions.
How are votes counted?
Votes will be counted by the inspector of election appointed at the Annual Meeting, who will separately count "FOR" and "AGAINST" votes, abstentions and broker non-votes. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a nominee holding stock for a beneficial owner does not receive instructions with respect to the proposals from the beneficial owner.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
If you are a stockholder of record and you either indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board or sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement and with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion.
Brokers and other nominees who hold common stock in street name and do not receive instructions from their clients on how to vote on a particular proposal are not permitted to vote on these proposals. The absence of votes from brokers is referred to as broker non-votes.  Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum.
Can I revoke my proxy?
If you give a proxy, you may revoke it at any time before it is exercised. You may revoke your proxy in any one of three ways:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may send in another proxy with a later date. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may notify Paramount in writing (by you or your attorney authorized in writing, or if the stockholder is a corporation, under its corporate seal, by an officer or attorney of the corporation) at its corporate offices before the Annual Meeting, that you are revoking your proxy. 
• You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
[END TABLE]
What happens if I do not vote?
The presence, in person or by proxy, of one-third of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by a voting group is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. For purposes of determining whether the stockholders have approved matters other than the election of directors, abstentions are treated as shares present or represented and voting, so abstaining has the same effect as a negative vote. Shares held by brokers who do not receive voting instructions on any proposal are not permitted to vote.  They are counted as present for the purposes of determining the existence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting.
If my stock is held in "street name" by my broker, will my broker vote my stock for me?
If a stockholder's shares are held of record by a broker, bank or other nominee and the stockholder wishes to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, the stockholder must contact his or her broker or bank and obtain from the record holder a "legal" proxy issued in the stockholder's name.  Absent specific instructions from the beneficial owners of the shares, brokers who hold shares in "street name" for clients no longer have the authority to vote on proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. Proxies submitted without a vote by brokers on these matters are referred to as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists at the Annual Meeting.
Who bears the cost of soliciting proxies?
Paramount may require the use of a proxy solicitation firm. Paramount would bear the cost of soliciting proxies and will reimburse brokerage firms and others for expenses involved in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners or soliciting their execution. Paramount estimates, that if required, that the costs associated with solicitations of the proxies requested by this proxy statement would be approximately $15,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses.
In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, certain members of the Company's directors, officers, and regular employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies personally or by telephone, facsimile or email on the Company's behalf.
Where can I find more information about Paramount?
Paramount filed its 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC on September 11, 2018.  That report, together with other corporate filings are available for your review on the Internet by visiting the SEC's website located at www.sec.gov. Copies of any reports, including exhibits, will be furnished to stockholders upon written request. All written requests should be directed to: Corporate Communications, Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. 665 Anderson Street, Winnemucca, Nevada, 89445, USA. 
We are subject to the informational requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), which requires that Paramount file reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website on the Internet that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding registrants, including Paramount, that file electronically with the SEC. The SEC's website address is www.sec.gov.

Regarding the election of directors, if a quorum is present, a majority of the votes properly cast for election of directors is sufficient to elect directors. Votes to withhold authority are considered properly cast; broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast. As a result, banks and brokers will not be able to vote on the election of directors without instructions from the beneficial owners. We encourage all stockholders who hold shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record to provide voting instructions to such parties to ensure that their shares are voted at the Annual Meeting.
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY 
RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH NOMINEE UNDER PROPOSAL No. 1.  PROPOSAL No. 2: APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE 2016 STOCK INCENTIVE 
AND EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN
Amendments to the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to approve amendments to the Paramount 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan (the "2016 Plan") as described below. The 2016 Plan was initially approved by the stockholders on December 14, 2016. The proposed amendments to the 2016 Plan (the "Amendments" and together the "Amended 2016 Plan"), described below, were adopted by the Board on October 17, 2018, subject to stockholder approval. The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy intend to vote FOR the Amended 2016 Plan.
The first proposed amendment to the 2016 Plan would increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued pursuant to the 2016 Plan by an additional 600,000 shares, representing approximately 2.4% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding on the Record Date. As of the Record Date, a total of 291,177 shares were subject to outstanding awards granted under the 2016 Plan, and there were no shares available for new award grants under the 2016 Plan before taking the proposed share increase into account.  The second proposed amendment to the 2016 Plan would reduce the maximum term that an option shall be exercisable from ten (10) years to five (5) years after the option is granted
The Company believes that incentives and stock-based awards focus employees on the objective of creating stockholder value and promoting the success of the Company, and that incentive compensation plans like the Amended 2016 Plan are an important attraction, retention and motivation tool for participants in the plan. The Board believes that the number of shares currently available for new award grants under the 2016 Plan does not give the Company sufficient authority and flexibility to adequately provide for future incentives and, accordingly, recommends the proposed amendments.
If our stockholders do not approve the proposed Amendments of the 2016 Plan, the 2016 Plan will remain unchanged. 
Material Features of the Amended 2016 Plan
The material features of the Amended 2016 Plan are summarized below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the specific provisions of the Amended 2016 Plan, the full text of which is set forth as Exhibit 1 to this proxy statement.
Administration
The Amended 2016 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee has the authority to determine, within the limits of the express provisions of the Amended 2016 Plan, the individuals to whom awards will be granted, the nature, amount and terms of such awards and the objectives and conditions for earning such awards or grants.
Types of Awards
Awards under the Amended 2016 Plan may include restricted shares of common stock, registered shares of common stock, (if a registration statement has been filed) nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options ("ISOs") and stock appreciation rights ("SARs"). Restricted Shares are shares of common stock issued to a recipient subject to such terms and conditions, including, without limitation, forfeiture and to such restrictions against sale, transfer or other disposition, as the Compensation Committee may determine at the time of issuance. A SAR is the right to receive cash, common stock or both based on the increase in the market value of the shares of common stock covered by such SAR from the initial date of the performance period for such SAR to the date of exercise. If the Compensation Committee elects to pay an amount to a participant in common stock, such common stock shall be valued at fair market value (as defined in the Amended 2016 Plan) as the day of exercise of the SAR. We may only issue registered securities if the Company files a registration statement with the SEC.
The Amended 2016 Plan provides that ISOs may be granted to a recipient during a calendar year only if the aggregate fair market value (determined as of the time an ISO is granted) of common stock with respect to which ISOs are exercisable for the first time by such recipient during any calendar year under the Amended 2016 Plan and any other "incentive stock option plans" maintained by the Company does not exceed $100,000.
Eligible Recipients of Awards
The Compensation Committee may grant awards to any of the Company's employees, to a member of the Board of Directors and to our consultants. Restrictions on Awards to Insiders
No award under the Amended 2016 Plan shall be granted if the aggregate number of shares of common stock (i) issued to Insiders (as that term is defined in the Amended 2016 Plan) of the Company within any one year period, or (ii) issuable to Insiders at any time, under the Amended 2016 Plan and any other security based compensation arrangement of the Company could exceed 10% of the Company's shares of common stock issued and outstanding, on a non-diluted basis, at the time of the grant of the award.
Term of Options
The term of each stock option shall be fixed by the Compensation Committee provided that no stock option shall be exercisable more than five (5) years after the date the stock option is granted, and provided further that no ISO granted to a ten percent stockholder shall be exercisable more than five (5) years after the date the option is granted.
Option Price
The option price per share of common stock purchasable under either an ISO or non-qualified stock option shall be determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value (as defined in the Amended 2016 Plan) of one share of common stock at the time of the grant, provided that the exercise price of an ISO granted to an eligible employee who is a ten percent stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the fair market value of one share of common stock at the time of grant. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Amended 2016 Plan to the contrary, all awards under the amended 2016 Plan that are subject to Code Section 409A shall be designed and administered in a manner that does not result in the imposition of tax or penalties under Code Section 409A.
Market Appreciation of Stock Appreciation Rights
The Amended 2016 Plan provides for tandem and non-tandem stock appreciation rights. A tandem stock appreciation right shall mean the right to surrender to the Company all (or a portion) of a stock option in exchange for an amount in cash or stock equal to the excess of (i) the fair market value (as that term is defined in the Amended 2016 Plan), on the date such stock option (or such portion thereof) is surrendered, of the common stock covered by such stock option (or such portion thereof), over (ii) the aggregate exercise price of such stock option (or such portion thereof). A non-tandem stock appreciation right shall mean the right to receive an amount in cash or stock equal to the excess of (x) the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date such right is exercised, over (y) the aggregate exercise price of such right, other than on surrender of a stock option.
Stock Award Pricing
The Compensation Committee shall determine the price, if any, to be paid by the recipient of an award of restricted stock or registered stock under the Amended 2016 Plan.
Assignability
No award granted pursuant to the Amended 2016 Plan is transferable or assignable by its recipient other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.
Shares Subject to the Amended 2016 Plan
An aggregate of 891,177 shares of common stock is reserved for issuance under the Amended 2016 Plan representing 3.5% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock as of October 15, 2018. Shares of common stock to be delivered or purchased under the Amended 2016 Plan may be either authorized but unissued common stock or treasury shares.
Anti-Dilution Protection
In the event of any changes in the capital structure of the Company, including a change resulting from a stock dividend or stock split, or combination or reclassification of shares, the Board of Directors is empowered to make such equitable adjustments with respect to awards or any provisions of the Amended 2016 Plan as it deems necessary and appropriate, including, if necessary, any adjustments in the maximum number of shares of common stock subject to the Amended 2016 Plan or in the number of shares of common stock subject to an outstanding award.
Merger, Consolidation, Reorganization, Liquidation, Etc. If the Company becomes a party to any corporate merger, consolidation, major acquisition of property for stock, reorganization, or liquidation, the Board of Directors is authorized under the Amended 2016 Plan to make such arrangements it deems advisable with respect to outstanding awards, which shall be binding upon the recipients of such awards, including, but not limited to, the substitution of new awards for any awards then outstanding, the assumption of any such awards, and the termination of or payment for such awards.
Market Value Restrictions
The amounts of certain awards are based on the fair market value of a share of common stock at a specified point in time. The exercise price per share of common stock under each nonqualified stock option or ISO granted under the Amended 2016 Plan, which is paid to the Company at the time of the exercise, shall be determined by the Compensation Committee, but may not be less than the fair market value of such common stock on the date of grant of such option. "Fair market value" of a share of common stock as of a given date is defined by the Amended 2016 Plan to be as of any given date: (i) if the Common Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, foreign stock exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or Nasdaq SmallCap Market, the closing price of the Common Stock on the trading market for the Common Stock, as selected by the Compensation Committee, on the trading date preceding the given date, as reported by the exchange or Nasdaq, as the case may be, (ii) if the Common Stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, foreign stock exchange or quoted on the Nasdaq National Market or Nasdaq SmallCap Market, but is traded in the over-the-counter market, the closing bid price for the Common Stock on such date, as reported by the OTC Bulletin Board or the National Quotation Bureau, Incorporated or similar publisher of such quotations.
No Repricing
Except for adjustments made pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of the Amended 2016 Plan, or by reason of a merger, consolidation, major acquisition of property for stock, reorganization or liquidation, the exercise or purchase price under any outstanding award granted under the Amended 2016 Plan may not be decreased after the date of grant, nor may any outstanding award granted under the Amended 2016 Plan be surrendered to the Company as consideration for the grant of a new award with a lower exercise or purchase price in the absence of the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at a duly constituted meeting of our stockholders.
Termination of Employment
Generally, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at grant, if a participant is terminated for cause, any stock option held by such participant shall thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of termination. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at grant, any stock option held by a participant:
(i) on death or termination of employment or consultancy by reason of disability or, with respect to a non-qualified stock option, retirement, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the participant's death or termination, by the legal representative of the estate or participant as the case may be, at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such death, termination or retirement;
(ii) on termination of employment or consultancy by involuntary termination without cause or for good reason or, with respect to an ISO, retirement, may be exercised, by the participant at any time within a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination; or
(iii) on termination of employment or consultancy by voluntary termination but without good reason and occurs prior to, or more than ninety (90) days after, the occurrence of an event which would be grounds for termination by the Company for cause, any stock option held by such participant may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at termination, by the participant at any time within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such stock option.
Amendments to the Amended 2016 Plan
The Board may at any time amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Amended 2016 Plan, or suspend or terminate the Amended 2016 Plan entirely. Provided, however, that, unless otherwise required by law or specifically provided in the Amended 2016 Plan, the rights of a participant with respect to awards granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination, may not be impaired without the consent of such participant and, provided further, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, if and to the extent required by the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 of the 1934 Act or, if and to the extent required, under the applicable provisions of the Code, no amendment may be made which would, among other things: increase the aggregate number of Common Shares that may be issued under the Amended 2016 Plan; change the classification of participants eligible to receive awards under the Amended 2016 Plan; decrease the minimum option price of any stock option; extend the maximum option  period; change any rights under the Amended 2016 Plan with regard to non-employee directors; or require stockholder approval in order for the Amended 2016 Plan to continue to comply with the applicable provisions.
Awards to be Granted Under the Amended 2016 Plan
The exact types and amounts of any awards to be made by the Compensation Committee to any eligible employee or non-employee director pursuant to the Amended 2016 Plan are not presently determinable. As a result of the discretionary nature of the Amended 2016 Plan, it is not possible to determine the specific amounts and types of awards that may be awarded in the future under the Amended 2016 Plan.
Federal Income Tax Consequences
The federal income tax consequences of the issuance and/or exercise of awards under the Amended 2016 Plan are as described below. The following information is not a definitive explanation of the tax consequences of the awards, and recipients should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences inherent in the ownership and/or exercise of the awards, and the ownership and disposition of any underlying securities. Tax consequences will also vary depending upon the jurisdiction where the recipient of the award may reside.
Restricted Shares
A recipient will not be taxed at the date of an award of Restricted Shares, provided that the Restricted Shares are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, but will be taxed at ordinary income rates on the fair market value of any restricted shares as of the date that the restrictions lapse, unless the recipient, within 30 days after transfer of such Shares to the recipient, elects under Section 83(b) of the Internal Revenue Code to include in income the fair market value of the Restricted Shares as of the date of such transfer. The Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Any disposition of shares after restrictions lapse will be subject to the regular rules governing long-term and short-term capital gains and losses, with the basis for this purpose equal to the fair market value of the shares at the end of the restricted period (or on the date of the transfer of the restricted shares, if the employee elects to be taxed on the fair market value upon such transfer). Dividends received by a recipient during the restricted period will be taxable to the recipient at ordinary income tax rates and will be deductible by the Company, unless the recipient has elected to be taxed on the fair market value of the restricted shares upon transfer, in which case they will thereafter be taxable to the recipient as dividends and will not be deductible by the Company.
Incentive Stock Options
A recipient who is granted an ISO will not recognize any taxable income for federal income tax purposes on either the grant or the exercise of the ISO. If the recipient disposes of the shares purchased pursuant to the ISO more than two years after the date of grant and more than one year after the transfer of the shares to him (the required statutory "holding period"), (a) the recipient will recognize long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the selling price and the option price; and (b) the Company will not be entitled to a deduction with respect to the shares of stock so issued.
If the holding period requirements are not met, any gain realized upon disposition will be taxed as ordinary income to the extent of the excess of the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of exercise over the option price, or (ii) the gain on the sale. The Company will be entitled to a deduction in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the recipient. Any additional gain will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain depending upon the holding period for the stock. A sale for less than the option price results in a capital loss. Generally, if an ISO is not exercised within three months following a participant's termination of employment, the ISO will be treated as a nonqualified stock option.
Ordinarily, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the option price is an alternative minimum tax addition. A corresponding alternative minimum tax subtraction is allowed in the year in which the shares are disposed. See "Alternative Minimum Tax," below.
Nonqualified Stock Options
The recipient of a nonqualified stock option under the Amended 2016 Plan will not recognize any income for federal income tax purposes on the grant of the option. Generally, on the exercise of the option, the recipient will recognize taxable ordinary income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date over the option price for the shares. The Company generally will be entitled to a deduction on the date of exercise in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the recipient. Upon disposition of the shares purchased pursuant to the stock option, the recipient will recognize long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount realized on such disposition and the basis for such shares, which basis includes the amount previously recognized by the recipient as ordinary income. Stock Appreciation Rights
A recipient who is granted stock appreciation rights will not recognize any taxable income on the receipt of the SARs. Upon the exercise of an SAR, (a) the recipient will recognize ordinary income equal to the amount received (the increase in the fair market value of one share of our common stock from the date of grant of the SAR to the date of exercise) and (b) the Company will be entitled to a deduction on the date of exercise in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the recipient.
Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights
Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any stock option (a "Reference Stock Option") granted under the Amended 2016 Plan ("Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights"). In the case of a non-qualified stock option, such rights may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Reference Stock Option. In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, such rights may be granted only at the time of the grant of such Reference Stock Option.
A Tandem Stock Appreciation Right or applicable portion thereof granted with respect to a Reference Stock Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the Reference Stock Option, except that, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time of grant, a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of shares covered by the Reference Stock Option shall not be reduced until and then only to the extent the exercise or termination of the Reference Stock Option causes the number of shares covered by the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right to exceed the number of shares remaining available and unexercised under the Reference Stock Option.
Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, a participant shall be entitled to receive up to, but no more than, an amount in cash and/or Common Shares equal in value to the excess of the fair market value of one Common Share over the option price per share specified in the Reference Stock Option multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised, with the Compensation Committee having the right to determine the form of payment.
Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights
Stock Appreciation Rights may also be granted without reference to any Stock Options granted under the Amended 2016 Plan ("Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights"). The term of each Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Compensation Committee, but shall not be greater than ten (10) years after the date the right is granted.
Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant. Subject to such terms and conditions, Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option term, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights to be exercised.
Upon the exercise of a Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, a participant shall be entitled to receive, for each right exercised, up to, but no more than, an amount in cash and/or Common Shares equal in value to the excess of the fair market value of one Common Share on the date the right is exercised over the fair market value of one (1) Common Share on the date the right was awarded to the participant.
Alternative Minimum Tax
In addition to the federal income tax consequences described above, a recipient may be subject to the alternative minimum tax ("AMT"), which is payable only to the extent it exceeds the recipient's regular tax liability. The AMT is assessed on the recipient's alternative minimum taxable income in excess of an exemption amount that varies by filing status. For purposes of computing the AMT, the alternative minimum taxable income is equal to taxable income (1) increased by tax preference items and (2) increased or reduced by certain AMT "adjustments." Federal law currently provides for a minimum tax credit that may be applied against the recipient's regular tax liability in years following a year in which the recipient is subject to AMT. The minimum tax credit is limited to the excess, if any, of the regular tax over the tentative AMT for the year. Any credit not used because of the limitation may be carried forward indefinitely.
Section 409A
Notwithstanding any contrary provisions in the Amended 2016 Plan, each provision in the Amended 2016 Plan that otherwise relates to nonqualified deferred compensation benefits will be interpreted to permit the deferral of compensation and the payment of deferred amounts in accordance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, to the extent applicable.
Required Vote In order to become effective, the proposal to ratify the amendment to the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Broker non-votes will not be counted in evaluating the results of the vote.

The Audit Committee Charter authorizes the Audit Committee to appoint a subcommittee of one or more members of the Audit Committee and/or to pre-approve non-audit services by establishing detailed pre-approval policies as to the particular service, provided that the Audit Committee is informed of each service pre-approved (no less frequently than at each meeting of the Audit Committee) and that no pre-approval shall be delegated to Paramount's management except as permitted by applicable law and regulation. In considering whether to pre-approve any non-audit services, the Audit Committee (or its delegates) considers whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm.
Required Vote 
In order to become effective, the proposal to ratify the appointment of MNP LLP as Paramount's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending June 30, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote.  
RECOMMENDATION OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF MNP LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM UNDER PROPOSAL No. 3. BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES; ANNUAL MEETING ATTENDANCE
Our Board of Directors currently consists of eight directors. They are: Glen Van Treek, John W. Seaberg, Rudi Fronk, Dr. John Carden, Eliseo Gonzalez-Urien, Christopher Reynolds, Pierre Pelletier and David Smith.  The rules of the NYSE American require that a majority of our directors be independent directors.  The Board has determined that Dr. Carden and Messrs., Fronk, Gonzalez-Urien, Reynolds, Pelletier and Smith are independent directors having satisfied the independence requirements pursuant to the "non-employee director" definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and National Instrument 58-101 of the Canadian Securities Administrators ("CSA") and pursuant to the "independent director" definition in Section 803A of the rules of the NYSE American.  Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Smith are considered "financial experts". Mr. Smith will not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting.
During our last fiscal year, our Board met a total of eight times.   Each of our directors attended no less than 75% of our director meetings and no less than 75% of any committee meetings on which they serve.  
An annual meeting of stockholders for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, on such date, and at such time as shall be fixed exclusively by resolution of the board of directors of the Corporation or a duly authorized committee thereof. Except as otherwise required by law, special meetings of stockholders of the Company for any purpose(s) may be called at any time only by or at the direction of (a) the board of directors of the Company, (b) the chairman of the board of directors or (c) two or more directors. 
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board at our annual meeting of stockholders, we encourage directors to attend and historically more than a majority have done so either in person or made themselves available by telephone. 
Board Leadership Structure
The Board of Directors currently separates the roles of Executive Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. Each year, our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee assesses these roles and the board leadership structure to ensure the interests of Paramount and its stockholders are best served. 
In June 2018, John W. Seaberg became Executive Chairman of our Board. Glen Van Treek continues to serve as our President and Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board believes that this leadership structure, which separates the Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles, is appropriate at this time in light of the evolution of Paramount's business and operating environment. In particular, the Board believes that this structure clarifies the individual roles and responsibilities of Mr. Seaberg and Mr. Van Treek, streamlines decision-making, and enhances accountability. As Executive Chairman, Mr. Seaberg is responsible for capital markets and will advise Mr. Van Treek. In this role and given his in-depth knowledge of the issues, challenges, and opportunities facing us, the Board believes that Mr. Seaberg is best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the board's time and attention are focused on the most critical matters. His role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders and the investor communities.
Committees of the Board
The Board has five standing committees: an Audit Committee; a Compensation Committee; a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee; an Independent Committee; and a Technical Committee.  A minimum of two directors serve on each committee. Current membership on the various committees is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]

The Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee currently consists of Christopher Reynolds (Chair), Dr. John Carden and David Smith.

Each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and experienced in financial matters and has not participated in the preparation of Paramount's financial statements at any time during the past three years. The Board has also determined that Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Smith are "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of applicable SEC regulations.
The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of Paramount's financial reporting, focusing on the integrity of Paramount's financial statements, Paramount's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of Paramount's independent auditor and the performance of Paramount's internal audit function and independent auditor. The Audit Committee's primary responsibilities include:

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee's responsibilities and key practices are more fully described in its written charter.  In accordance with the rules of the NYSE American, the Audit Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of its written charter on an annual basis.
Audit Committee Report 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC designed to improve disclosures related to the functioning of corporate audit committees and to enhance the reliability and credibility of financial statements of public companies, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors submits the following report: 
Audit Committee Report to Stockholders 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of the Company's accounting functions and internal controls. The Audit Committee is composed of three directors, each of whom is independent as defined by the Listing Rules. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors and held four meetings in fiscal 2018. A copy of the charter is available on the Company's website at www.paramountnevada.com by choosing the "Corporate" link then clicking on the "Governance" section. 
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) standards and to issue reports thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes, including the activities of the internal audit function. The Audit Committee has established a mechanism to receive, retain and process complaints on auditing, accounting and internal control issues, including the confidential, anonymous submission by employees, vendors, customers and others of concerns on questionable accounting and auditing matters. 
In connection with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with management and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss the June 30, 2018 audited consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required by Statement on Auditing Standards Update No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU section 380), as adopted by the PCAOB in Rule 3200T. In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed the independent registered public accounting firm's independence from the Company and its management.  Based upon the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2018 filed with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee also has appointed, subject to stockholder ratification, MNP LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019.

The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee currently consists of Dr. Carden (Chair), Messrs. Fronk, Gonzalez-Urien, Smith, Reynolds and Pelletier.  All members of the Committee are independent directors. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee assists the Board in carrying out its oversight responsibilities relating to the composition of the Board and further assists the Board by regularly assessing and making recommendations to improve the Company's governance practices.
The Committee's primary responsibilities include considering and making recommendations to the Board with respect to nominees for election to the Board consistent with criteria approved by the Board or the Committee, including director candidates submitted by Paramount's stockholders.  
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's responsibilities and key practices are more fully described in its charter.
Director Nominees
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director nominees. The Committee may consider candidates recommended by Paramount's directors, members of management, professional search firms or stockholders. These candidates may be considered at any point during the year.  The members of the Nominating Committee evaluate potential nominees, whether proposed by stockholders or otherwise, by reviewing their qualifications, reviewing results of personal and reference interviews and reviewing other relevant information. Candidates whose evaluations are favorable are then chosen by a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee to be recommended for nomination by the full Board. The full Board then selects and nominates candidates for election as directors by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting.
To date, our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has not paid a fee to any third party to identify or evaluate prospective nominees. 
Qualifications
In evaluating nominees for election as a director, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers a number of factors, including the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal and professional qualities, characteristics, attributes, accomplishments and reputation in the business community and otherwise; 
• reputation in a particular field or area of expertise; 
• current knowledge and contacts in the markets in which Paramount does business and in Paramount's industry and other industries relevant to Paramount's business; 
• the ability and willingness to participate fully in board activities, including attendance at, and active participation in, meetings of the Board and its committees; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the skills and personality of the nominee and how the Committee perceives the nominee will fit with the existing directors and other nominees in maintaining a Board that is collegial and responsive to the needs of Paramount and its stockholders; 
• the willingness to represent the best interests of all of Paramount's stockholders and not just one particular constituency; and the diversity of viewpoints, background and experience, compared to those of existing directors and other nominees. 
[END TABLE]
The INDEPENDENT Committee 
The Independent Committee of the Board of Directors currently consists of three members, they are: Messrs. Smith (Chair) and Pelletier, and Dr. Carden.
The committee, on behalf of the Board is authorized to negotiate and approve the terms associated with offerings including all associated documents. The committee may authorize an officer to execute and deliver transaction documents that the committee deems such terms and provisions necessary or desirable.
In addition the Independent Committee is authorized to consider, and if deemed advisable, to approve the participation in the offering of any related party to the Company, including any officer, director or significant stockholder.
The TECHNICAL Committee 
The Technical Committee of the Board of Directors currently consists of three members, they are: Messrs. Pelletier (Chair), Fronk and Gonzalez-Urien.
The committee, on behalf of the Board is to have periodic discussions with management related to the areas of focus related to process, programs, including environmental, social and those related to project development. The committee is to ensure that management is taking appropriate measures to achieve compliance with appropriate laws and legislation, and to ensure that principle risks and opportunities related to the area of focus are identified. The committee is to ensure that management has the proper resources allocated to address these risks and opportunities. The committee is to provide advice, counsel and recommendations to management as the committee deems appropriate. 
Related Person Transaction Policies and Procedures 
It is our practice and policy to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding related party transactions, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  A related person is any executive officer, director, or more than 5% stockholder of the Company, including any of their immediate family members, and any entity owned or controlled by such persons. Our Audit Committee has been charged with responsibility for approving all related party transactions as part of the Audit Committee's overall responsibilities as set forth in its charter. In considering related party transactions, the Audit Committee takes into account the relevant available facts and circumstances.  In the event a director has an interest in the proposed transaction, the director must recuse himself from the deliberations and approval.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, independent directors as a group, were paid or accrued $80,000 for their services as directors of the Company's Board.  During the year ended June 30, 2018, the Company also recorded a non-cash transaction to recognize stock based compensation for directors in the amount of $40,122.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Directors' Independence
Our Board currently consists of eight directors. They are: John W. Seaberg, Rudi Fronk, Glen Van Treek, David Smith, Christopher Reynolds, Eliseo Gonzalez-Urien, John Carden and Pierre Pelletier.  The rules of the NYSE American require that a majority of our directors be independent directors.  The Board has determined that Dr. Carden and Messrs. Fronk, Smith, Gonzalez-Urien, Pelletier and Reynolds are independent directors having satisfied the independence requirements pursuant to the "non-employee director" definition of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act and pursuant to the "independent director" definition in Section 803A of the rules of the NYSE American.  Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Smith are considered "financial experts." Mr. Smith will not stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. We currently expect that Mr. Smith will remain as a director until the date of the Annual Meeting.
Executive Chairman
On June 25, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Mr. John Seaberg as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and who shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors and stockholders at which he shall be present and shall have and may exercise such powers as may, from time to time, be assigned to him or her by the Board of Directors as stated in the Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws").
The Board's Role in Succession Planning
Except as otherwise provided in the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the "Articles of Incorporation"), the Board of Directors shall consist of at least three (3) individuals and not more than fifteen (15) individuals, with the number of directors within the foregoing fixed minimum and maximum established and changed from time to time as provided in, and in accordance with, the Articles of Incorporation. Each director shall hold office until his or her successor shall be elected or appointed and qualified or until his or her earlier death, retirement, disqualification, resignation or removal. No reduction of the number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of his or her term of office. No provision of this Section 3.2 shall restrict the right of the Board of Directors (or, to the extent permitted under the Articles of Incorporation, the stockholders) to fill vacancies or the right of the stockholders to remove directors, each as provided in the Articles of Incorporation or the Bylaws.
Code of Conduct
The Board has adopted a Code of Ethics (the "Code") that applies to all our directors and employees, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer. A copy of the Code is currently available on our website at www.paramountnevada.com. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Messrs. Fronk (Chair), Gonzalez-Urien, and Dr. Carden serve as members of our Compensation Committee. None of the members of the Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of Paramount, nor did any Compensation Committee member engage in any "related person" transaction that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. 
Communications with the Board of Directors
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board or specific directors by mail addressed to: Board of Directors, c/o Paramount Gold Nevada Corp., 665 Anderson Street, Winnemucca, Nevada, 89445.

STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder and for nominations to be properly brought before a special meeting by a stockholder in each case pursuant to Section 2.12, the stockholder of record must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the secretary of the Corporation, and, in the case of business other than nominations, such  other business must be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting (December 13, 2017); provided that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which public announcement (as stated in the Bylaws) of the date of such meeting is first made by the Corporation. In no event shall the public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described above. The notice must be provided by a stockholder of record and must set forth specific criteria as defined in the Articles of Incorporation. Such proposals must also meet the other requirements and procedures prescribed by Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act relating to stockholders' proposals. 
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO STOCKHOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS

Amended 2016 Stock Incentive and Equity Compensation Plan
PARAMOUNT GOLD NEVADA CORP.
2016 STOCK INCENTIVE AND EQUITY COMPENSATION PLAN
As amended on December 12, 2018
ARTICLE I
PURPOSE
The purpose of this Paramount Gold Nevada Corp. 2016 Stock Incentive and Compensation Plan (the "Plan") is to enhance the profitability and value of Paramount Gold Nevada Corp.  (the "Company") for the benefit of its stockholders by enabling the Company (i) to offer employees and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates stock based incentives and other equity interests in the Company, thereby creating a means to raise the level of stock ownership by employees and consultants in order to attract, retain and reward such employees and consultants and strengthen the mutuality of interests between employees or consultants and the Company's stockholders and (ii) to offer equity based awards to non-employee directors thereby attracting, retaining and rewarding such non-employee directors and strengthening the mutuality of interests between non-employee directors and the Company's stockholders.
ARTICLE II
DEFINITIONS
For purposes of this Plan, the following terms shall have the following meanings:
2.1"Affiliate" shall mean, other than the Company, each of the following:  (i) any Subsidiary; (ii) any Parent; (iii) any corporation, trade or business (including, without limitation, a partnership or limited liability company) which is directly or indirectly controlled fifty percent (50%) or more (whether by ownership of stock, assets or an equivalent ownership interest or voting interest) by the Company; and (iv) any other entity, approved by the Committee as an "Affiliate" under the Plan, in which the Company has a material equity interest.
2.2"Award" shall mean any award under this Plan of any Stock Option, Stock Appreciation Right or Restricted Stock.  All Awards shall be confirmed by, and subject to the terms of, a written agreement executed by the Company and the Participant.
2.3"Black-out Period" means any black-out period imposed by the Company that restricts the purchase and sale of the Company's securities by designated persons for a period of time; for greater certainty a "Black-out Period" includes any quarterly or special black-out period imposed by the Company but excludes any cease trade order imposed against the Company or an Insider.
2.4"Board" shall mean the Board of Directors of the Company.
2.5"Cause" shall mean, with respect to a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter:  (i) in the case where there is no employment agreement, consulting agreement, change in control agreement or similar agreement in effect between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant at the time of the grant of the Award (or where there is such an agreement but it does not define "cause" (or words of like import)), termination due to a Participant's dishonesty, fraud, insubordination, willful misconduct, refusal to perform services (for any reason other than illness or incapacity) or materially unsatisfactory performance of his or her duties for the Company as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion; or (ii) in the case where there is an employment agreement, consulting agreement, change in control agreement or similar agreement in effect between the Company or an Affiliate and the Participant at the time of the grant of the Award that defines "cause" (or words of like import), as defined under such agreement; provided, however, that with regard to any agreement that conditions "cause" on occurrence of a change in control, such definition of "cause" shall not apply until a change in control actually takes place and then only with regard to a termination thereafter.  With respect to a Participant's Termination of Directorship, Cause shall mean an act or failure to act that constitutes "cause" for removal of a director under applicable state corporate law.
2.6"Change in Control" shall have the meaning set forth in Article X.
2.7"Code" shall mean the Internal Revenue Code as amended.  Any reference to any section of the Code shall also be a reference to any successor provision and any Treasury regulation thereunder.

To the extent that no Committee exists which has the authority to administer the Plan, the functions of the Committee shall be exercised by the Board.  If for any reason the appointed Committee does not meet the requirements of Rule 16b-3, such noncompliance with the requirements of Rule 16b-3 shall not affect the validity of the awards, grants, interpretations or other actions of the Committee.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the application of the Plan to non-employee directors, Committee shall mean the Board.

ARTICLE IV
SHARE AND OTHER LIMITATIONS
4.1SHARES.
(a)GENERAL LIMITATION.  The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued or used for reference purposes under this Plan or with respect to which other Awards may be granted shall not exceed 891,177 shares (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2) which may be either authorized and unissued Common Stock or Common Stock held in or acquired for the treasury of the Company.
Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 4.2, in no event shall more than an aggregate of 891,177 shares of Common Stock be issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options granted under the Plan, including shares issued pursuant to the exercise of Incentive Stock Options that are the subject of disqualifying dispositions within the meaning of Sections 421, 422 and 423 of the Code.
If any Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted under this Plan expires, terminates or is canceled for any reason without having been exercised in full or, with respect to Options, the Company repurchases any Option pursuant to Section 6.3(f), the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the repurchased Option, and/or the number of shares of Common Stock underlying any unexercised Stock Appreciation Right or Option shall again be available for the purposes of Awards under the Plan.  If a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right or a Limited Stock Appreciation Right is granted in tandem with an Option, such grant shall only apply once against the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under this Plan.  In determining the number of shares of Common Stock available for Awards other than Awards of Incentive Stock Options, if Common Stock has been delivered or exchanged by a Participant as full or partial payment to the Company for the exercise price or for withholding taxes, in connection with the exercise of a Stock Option or the number shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable has been reduced for full or partial payment for the exercise price or for withholding taxes, the number of shares of Common Stock delivered, exchanged or reduced shall again be available for purposes of Awards under this Plan.
In the event Awards are granted to employees or Consultants pursuant to Section 3.2(h), the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan for Awards other than Incentive Stock Options shall be increased by the number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued or used for reference with respect to those Awards granted pursuant to Section 3.2(h).  The maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under this Plan with respect to Incentive Stock Options shall not be increased (subject to any increase or decrease pursuant to Section 4.2).
Notwithstanding anything else contained herein to the contrary, the Committee shall be prohibited from granting any Award if the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock (i) issued to Insiders of the Company within any one year period, or (ii) issuable to Insiders at any time, under this Plan and any other security based compensation arrangement of the Company, could exceed 10% of the Company's shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding, on a non-diluted basis, at the time of the grant of the Award.
4.2CHANGES.
(a)The existence of the Plan and the Awards granted hereunder shall not affect in any way the right or power of the Board or the stockholders of the Company to make or authorize any adjustment, recapitalization, reorganization or other change in the Company's capital structure or its business, any merger or consolidation of the Company or its Affiliates, any issue of bonds, debentures, preferred or prior preference stock ahead of or affecting Common Stock, the dissolution or liquidation of the Company or its Affiliates, any sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business or any other corporate act or proceeding.
(b)In the event of any such change in the capital structure or business of the Company by reason of any stock dividend or distribution, stock split or reverse stock split, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, combination or exchange of shares, distribution with respect to its outstanding Common Stock or capital stock other than Common Stock, sale or transfer of all or part of its assets or business, reclassification of its capital stock, or any similar change affecting the Company's capital structure or business and the Committee determines an adjustment is appropriate under the Plan, then the aggregate number and kind of shares which thereafter may be issued under this Plan, the number and kind of shares or other property (including cash) to be issued upon exercise of an outstanding Option or other Awards granted under this Plan and the purchase price thereof shall be appropriately adjusted consistent with such change in such manner as the Committee may deem equitable to prevent substantial dilution or enlargement of the rights granted to, or available for, Participants under this Plan or as otherwise necessary to reflect the change, and any such adjustment determined by the Committee shall be binding and conclusive on the Company and all Participants and employees and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.
(c)Fractional shares of Common Stock resulting from any adjustment in Options or Awards pursuant to Section 4.2(a) or (b) shall be aggregated until, and eliminated at, the time of exercise by rounding-down for fractions less than one-half (1/2) and rounding-up for fractions equal to or greater than one-half (1/2).  No cash settlements shall be made with respect to fractional shares eliminated by rounding.  Notice of any adjustment shall be given by the Committee to each Participant whose Option or Award has been adjusted and such adjustment (whether or not such notice is given) shall be effective and binding for all purposes of the Plan.
(d)In the event of a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving entity or in the event of any transaction that results in the acquisition of substantially all of the Company's outstanding Common Stock by a single person or entity or by a group of persons and/or entities acting in concert, or in the event of the sale or transfer of all of the Company's assets (all of the foregoing being referred to as "Acquisition Events"), then the Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate all outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights of Eligible Employees and Consultants, effective as of the date of the Acquisition Event, by delivering notice of termination to each such Participant at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of consummation of the Acquisition Event; provided, that during the period from the date on which such notice of termination is delivered to the consummation of the Acquisition Event, each such Participant shall have the right to exercise in full all of his or her Options and Stock Appreciation Rights that are then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on exercisability otherwise contained in the Option or Award Agreements) but contingent on occurrence of the Acquisition Event, and, provided that, if the Acquisition Event does not take place within a specified period after giving such notice for any reason whatsoever, the notice and exercise shall be null and void.
(e)If an Acquisition Event occurs, to the extent the Committee does not terminate the outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section 4.2(d), then the provisions of Section 4.2(b) shall apply.
ARTICLE V
ELIGIBILITY
5.1All employees, non-employee directors, and Consultants to the Company and its Affiliates are eligible to be granted Non-Qualified Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights and Restricted Stock, subject to any filing requirements, under this Plan.  All employees of the Company, its Subsidiaries and its Parents are also eligible to be granted Incentive Stock Options under the Plan.  Eligibility under this Plan shall be determined by the Committee.
ARTICLE VI
STOCK OPTION GRANTS
6.1OPTIONS.  Each Stock Option granted hereunder shall be one of two types:  (i) an Incentive Stock Option intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code or (ii) a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
6.2GRANTS.  The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any Eligible Employee, who is not a non-employee director or Consultant, one or more Incentive Stock Options, Non-Qualified Stock Options, or both types of Stock Options (in each case with or without Stock Appreciation Rights).  The Committee shall have the authority to grant to any non-employee director or Consultant one or more Non-Qualified Stock Options (with or without Stock Appreciation Rights).  To the extent that any Stock Option does not qualify as an Incentive Stock Option (whether because of its provisions or the time or manner of its exercise or otherwise), such Stock Option or the portion thereof which does not qualify, shall constitute a separate Non-Qualified Stock Option.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary or any provision in an agreement evidencing the grant of a Stock Option to the contrary, any Stock Option granted to an Eligible Employee of an Affiliate (other than an Affiliate which is a Parent or a Subsidiary) or to any Consultant shall be a Non-Qualified Stock Option.
6.3TERMS OF OPTIONS.  Options granted under this Plan shall be subject to the following terms and conditions, shall be subject to Section 3.2 hereof and the other provisions of this Plan, and shall be in such form and contain such additional terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, as the Committee shall deem desirable:
(a)OPTION PRICE.  The option price per share of Common Stock purchasable under either an Incentive Stock Option or Non-Qualified Stock Option shall be determined by the Committee at the time of grant but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock at the time of grant, provided that the exercise price of an Incentive Stock Option granted to an Eligible Employee who is a Ten Percent Shareholder  and who is not a non-employee director or Consultant shall not be less than 110% of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock at the time of grant.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Option is modified, extended or renewed and, thereby, deemed to be the issuance of a new Option under the Code, the exercise price of an Option may continue to be the original exercise price even if less than the Fair Market Value, or 110% of the Fair Market Value as the case may be, of the Common Stock at the time of such modification, extension or renewal.
(b)OPTION TERM.  The term of each Stock Option shall be fixed by the Committee, provided that no Stock Option shall be exercisable more than five (5) years after the date the Option is granted, and provided further that no Incentive Stock Option granted to a Ten Percent Shareholder shall be exercisable more than five (5) years after the date the Option is granted.  If any Stock Options are set to expire during any Black-out Period which would prohibit the option holder from exercising the Stock Option during that Black-out Period, then in that event the option term shall be extended for an additional ten (10) business days beyond the end of any Black-out Period to permit the option holder to exercise the Stock Option (the "Black-out Expiration Term").  The Black-out Expiration Term is fixed and shall not be subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors or the Committee.
(c)EXERCISABILITY.  Stock Options shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant.  If the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any Stock Option is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that it is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitations on the exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, that the Committee may waive the installment exercise provisions or accelerate the time at which Options may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.
(d)METHOD OF EXERCISE.  Subject to whatever installment exercise and waiting period provisions apply under subsection (c) above, Stock Options may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the Option term, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased.  At or after grant, payment in full or in part may be made at the election of the optionee as follows:  (i) in cash or by check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Company; (ii) if the Common Stock is traded on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. or quoted on a national quotation system sponsored by the National Association of Securities Dealers, through a "cashless exercise" procedure whereby the Participant delivers irrevocable instructions to a broker to deliver promptly to the Company an amount equal to the purchase price, (iii) in the form of Common Stock owned by the Participant (and for which the Participant has good title free and clear of any liens and encumbrances) or (iv) in the form of Restricted Stock; provided, however, that in each case, such payment is equivalent to on the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the payment date as determined by the Committee (without regard to any forfeiture restrictions applicable to such Restricted Stock).  No shares of Common Stock shall be issued until full payment, (and if payment is by installments all payments have been received), as provided herein, therefor has been made or provided for.  If payment in full or in part has been made in the form of Restricted Stock, an equivalent number of shares of Common Stock issued on exercise of the Option shall be subject to the same restrictions and conditions, during the remainder of the Restriction Period, applicable to the Restricted Stock surrendered therefor.
(e)INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION LIMITATIONS.  To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined as of the time of grant) of the Common Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by an Eligible Employee during any calendar year under the Plan and/or any other stock option plan of the Company or any Subsidiary or Parent exceeds $100,000, such Options shall be treated as Options which are not Incentive Stock Options.  
Should the foregoing provision not be necessary in order for the Stock Options to qualify as Incentive Stock Options, or should any additional provisions be required, the Committee may amend the Plan accordingly, without the necessity of obtaining the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
(f)BUY OUT AND SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS.  The Committee may at any time on behalf of the Company offer to buy out an Option previously granted, based on such terms and conditions as the Committee shall establish and communicate to the Participant at the time that such offer is made.
(g)FORM, MODIFICATION, EXTENSION AND RENEWAL OF OPTIONS.  Subject to the terms and conditions and within the limitations of the Plan, an Option shall be evidenced by such form of agreement or grant as is approved by the Committee, and the Committee may modify, extend or renew outstanding Options granted under the Plan (provided that the rights of a Participant are not reduced without his consent), or accept the surrender of outstanding Options (up to the extent not theretofore exercised) and authorize the granting of new Options in substitution therefor (to the extent not theretofore exercised.
(h)DEFERRED DELIVERY OF COMMON SHARES.  The Committee may in its discretion permit Participants to defer delivery of Common Stock acquired pursuant to a Participant's exercise of an Option in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the Committee.
6.4TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.  The following rules apply with regard to Options upon the Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy of a Participant:
(a)TERMINATION BY REASON OF DEATH.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of death, any Stock Option held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant's estate are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the Participant's death, by the legal representative of the estate, at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such death, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option.
(b)TERMINATION BY REASON OF DISABILITY.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of Disability, any Stock Option held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the Participant's termination, by the Participant (or the legal representative of the Participant's estate if the Participant dies after termination) at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option.
(c)TERMINATION BY REASON OF RETIREMENT.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of Retirement, any Non-Qualified  Stock Option held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, shall be fully vested and may thereafter be exercised by the Participant at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Non-Qualified Stock Option; provided, however, that, if the Participant dies within such exercise period, any unexercised Non-Qualified Stock Option held by such Participant shall thereafter be exercisable, to the extent to which it was exercisable at the time of death, for a period of one (1) year (or such other period as the Committee may specify at grant or, if no rights of the Participant's estate are reduced, thereafter) from the date of such death, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Non-Qualified Stock Option.  Any Incentive Stock Option may be exercised as provided in Section 6.4(f) below.
(d)INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR TERMINATION FOR GOOD REASON.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by involuntary termination without Cause or for Good Reason, any Stock Option held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at termination, by the Participant at any time within a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option.
(e)TERMINATION WITHOUT GOOD REASON.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is voluntary but without Good Reason and occurs prior to, or more than ninety (90) days after, the occurrence of an event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause (without regard to any notice or cure period requirements), any Stock Option held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at termination, by the Participant at any time within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Option.
(f)OTHER TERMINATION.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, if a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement, Good Reason, involuntary termination without Cause or voluntary termination as provided in subsection (e) above or due to Retirement in the case of Incentive Stock Options, any Stock Option held by such Participant shall thereupon terminate and expire as of the date of termination, provided that (unless the Committee determines a different period upon grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter) in the event the termination is for Cause or is a voluntary termination without Good Reason within ninety (90) days after occurrence of an event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause (without regard to any notice or cure period requirement), any Stock Option held by the Participant at the time of occurrence of the event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause shall be deemed to have terminated and expired upon occurrence of the event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause.
ARTICLE VII
STOCK AWARDS
7.1STOCK AWARDS.  Shares of Restricted Stock may be issued to Eligible Employees or Consultants either alone or in addition to other Awards granted under the Plan.

7.2AWARDS AND CERTIFICATES.  The prospective Participant selected to receive an Award of Restricted Stock shall not have any rights with respect to such Award, unless and until such Participant has delivered a fully executed copy of the applicable agreement evidencing the Award (the "Stock Award Agreement") to the Company and has otherwise complied with the applicable terms and conditions of such Award.  Further, such Award shall be subject to the following conditions:
(a)PURCHASE PRICE.  The purchase price of Restricted Stock shall be fixed by the Committee.

(d)CUSTODY.  The Committee may require that any stock certificates evidencing restricted shares be held in custody by the Company until the restrictions thereon shall have lapsed, and that, as a condition of any Award of Restricted Stock, the Participant shall have delivered a duly signed stock power, endorsed in blank, relating to the Common Stock covered by such Award.
7.3RESTRICTIONS AND CONDITIONS ON RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.  The shares of Restricted Stock awarded pursuant to this Plan shall be subject to Article IX and the following restrictions and conditions:

ARTICLE VIII
STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS
8.1TANDEM STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in conjunction with all or part of any Stock Option (a "Reference Stock Option") granted under this Plan ("Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights").  In the case of a Non-Qualified Stock Option, such rights may be granted either at or after the time of the grant of such Reference Stock Option.  In the case of an Incentive Stock Option, such rights may be granted only at the time of the grant of such Reference Stock Option.
8.2TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF TANDEM STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee, including Article IX and the following:
(a)TERM.  A Tandem Stock Appreciation Right or applicable portion thereof granted with respect to a Reference Stock Option shall terminate and no longer be exercisable upon the termination or exercise of the Reference Stock Option, except that, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time of grant, a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right granted with respect to less than the full number of shares covered by the Reference Stock Option shall not be reduced until and then only to the extent the exercise or termination of the Reference Stock Option causes the number of shares covered by the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right to exceed the number of shares remaining available and unexercised under the Reference Stock Option.
(b)EXERCISABILITY.  Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable only at such time or times and to the extent that the Reference Stock Options to which they relate shall be exercisable in accordance with the provisions of Article VI and this Article VIII.
(c)METHOD OF EXERCISE.  A Tandem Stock Appreciation Right may be exercised by an optionee by surrendering the applicable portion of the Reference Stock Option.  Upon such exercise and surrender, the Participant shall be entitled to receive an amount determined in the manner prescribed in this Section 8.2.  Stock Options which have been so surrendered, in whole or in part, shall no longer be exercisable to the extent the related Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights have been exercised.
(d)PAYMENT.  Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right a Participant shall be entitled to receive up to, but no more than, an amount in cash and/or Common Stock (as chosen by the Committee in its sole discretion) equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock over the option price per share specified in the Reference Stock Option multiplied by the number of shares in respect of which the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall have been exercised, with the Committee having the right to determine the form of payment.  If the Committee elects to pay such amount to a Participant in Common Stock, such Common Stock shall be valued at Fair Market Value on the day of exercise of the Tandem Stock Appreciation Right.
(e)DEEMED EXERCISE OF REFERENCE STOCK OPTION.  Upon the exercise of a Tandem Stock Appreciation Right, the Reference Stock Option or part thereof to which such Stock Appreciation Right is related shall be deemed to have been exercised for the purpose of the limitation set forth in Article IV of the Plan on the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued under the Plan.
8.3NON-TANDEM STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights may also be granted without reference to any Stock Options granted under this Plan.
8.4TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF NON-TANDEM STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be subject to such terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this Plan, as shall be determined from time to time by the Committee, including Article IX and the following:
(a)TERM.  The term of each Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right shall be fixed by the Committee, but shall not be greater than ten (10) years after the date the right is granted.
(b)EXERCISABILITY.  Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be exercisable at such time or times and subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Committee at grant.  If the Committee provides, in its discretion, that any such right is exercisable subject to certain limitations (including, without limitation, that it is exercisable only in installments or within certain time periods), the Committee may waive such limitation on the exercisability at any time at or after grant in whole or in part (including, without limitation, that the Committee may waive the installment exercise provisions or accelerate the time at which rights may be exercised), based on such factors, if any, as the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion.
(c)METHOD OF EXERCISE.  Subject to whatever installment exercise and waiting period provisions apply under subsection (b) above, Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised in whole or in part at any time during the option term, by giving written notice of exercise to the Company specifying the number of Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights to be exercised.
(d)PAYMENT.  Upon the exercise of a Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right a Participant shall be entitled to receive, for each right exercised, up to, but no more than, an amount in cash and/or Common Stock (as chosen by the Committee in its sole discretion) equal in value to the excess of the Fair Market Value of one share of Common Stock on the date the right is exercised over the Fair Market Value of one (1) share of Common Stock on the date the right was awarded to the Participant.  If the Committee elects to pay such amount to a Participant in Common Stock, such Common Stock shall be valued at Fair Market Value as the day of exercise of the Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right.
8.5LIMITED STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS.  The Committee may, in its sole discretion, grant Tandem and Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights either as a general Stock Appreciation Right or as a Limited Stock Appreciation Right.  Limited Stock Appreciation Rights may be exercised only upon a Change in Control (to the extent provided in an Award agreement granting such Limited Stock Appreciation Rights) or the occurrence of such other event as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, designate at the time of grant or thereafter.  Upon the exercise of Limited Stock Appreciation Rights, except as otherwise provided in an Award agreement, the Participant shall receive in cash or Common Stock, as determined by the Committee, an amount equal to the amount (1) set forth in Section 8.2(d) with respect to Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights or (2) set forth in Section 8.4(d) with respect to Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights.
8.6TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR TERMINATION OF CONSULTANCY.  The following rules apply with regard to Stock Appreciation Rights upon the Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy of a Participant:
(a)TERMINATION BY DEATH.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of death, any Stock Appreciation Right held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or if no rights of the Participant's estate are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the Participant's death, by the legal representative of the estate, at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Appreciation Right, whichever period is the shorter.
(b)TERMINATION BY REASON OF DISABILITY.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of Disability, any Stock Appreciation Right held by such participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at the Participant's termination, by the Participant (or the legal representative of the Participant's estate if the Participant dies after termination) at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such termination or until the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Appreciation Right, whichever period is the shorter.
(c)TERMINATION BY REASON OF RETIREMENT.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by reason of Retirement, any Stock Appreciation Right held by such Participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter, shall be fully vested and may thereafter be exercised by the Participant at any time within a period of one (1) year from the date of such termination or until the expiration of the stated term of such right, whichever period is the shorter; provided, however, that, if the Participant dies within such one (1) year period, any unexercised Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Right held by such Participant shall thereafter be exercisable, to the extent to which it was exercisable at the time of death, for a period of one (1) year (or such other period as the Committee may specify at grant or if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter) from the date of such death or until the expiration of the stated term of such right, whichever period is the shorter.
(d)INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE OR TERMINATION FOR GOOD REASON.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is by involuntary termination without Cause or for Good Reason, any Stock Appreciation Right held by such participant, unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant or if no rights of the participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at termination, by the Participant at any time within a period of ninety (90) days from the date of such termination or until the expiration of the stated term of such right, whichever period is shorter.
(e)TERMINATION WITHOUT GOOD REASON.  If a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is voluntary but without Good Reason and occurs prior to, or more than ninety (90) days after, the occurrence of an event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause (without regard to any notice or cure period requirements), any Stock Appreciation Right held by such Participant, unless greater or lesser exercise rights are provided by the Committee at the time of grant or, if no rights of the participant are reduced, thereafter, may be exercised, to the extent exercisable at termination, by the Participant at any time within a period of thirty (30) days from the date of such termination, but in no event beyond the expiration of the stated term of such Stock Appreciation Right.
(f)OTHER TERMINATION.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee at grant, or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced thereafter, if a Participant's Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy is for any reason other than death, Disability, Retirement, Good Reason, involuntary termination without Cause or voluntary termination as provided in subsection (e) above, any Stock Appreciation Right held by such Participant shall thereupon terminate or expire as of the date of termination, provided, that (unless the Committee determines a different period upon grant, or, if no rights of the Participant are reduced, thereafter) in the event the termination is for Cause or is a voluntary termination as provided in subsection (e) above, within ninety (90) days after occurrence of an event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause (without regard to any notice or cure period requirement), any Stock Appreciation Right held by the Participant at the time of the occurrence of the event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause shall be deemed to have terminated and expired upon occurrence of the event which would be grounds for Termination of Employment or Termination of Consultancy by the Company for Cause.
ARTICLE IX
NON-TRANSFERABILITY
Except as provided in the last sentence of this Article IX, no Stock Option or Stock Appreciation Right granted to an Employee or Consultant shall be Transferable by the Participant otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.  All Stock Options and all Stock Appreciation Rights granted to an Employee or Consultant shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant.  Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights shall be Transferable, to the extent permitted above, only with the underlying Stock Option.  Shares of Restricted Stock under Article VII may not be Transferred prior to the date on which shares are issued, or, if later, the date on which any applicable restriction lapses.  No Award shall, except as otherwise specifically provided by law or herein, be Transferable in any manner, and any attempt to Transfer any such Award shall be void, and no such Award shall in any manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person who shall be entitled to such Award, nor shall it be subject to attachment or legal process for or against such person.  All Stock Options granted to non-employee directors shall be Transferable solely to such non-employee director's principal employer (other than the Company or an Affiliate) at the time of grant if the terms of such non-employee director's employment so require.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may determine at the time of grant or thereafter, that a Non-Qualified Stock Option that is otherwise not transferable pursuant to this Article IX is transferable in whole or part and in such circumstances, and under such conditions, as specified by the Committee.
ARTICLE X
CHANGE IN CONTROL PROVISIONS
10.1BENEFITS.  In the event of a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), except as otherwise provided by the Committee upon the grant of an Award, each Participant shall have the following benefits:
(a)Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, all outstanding Options and the related Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights and Non-Tandem Stock Appreciation Rights of such Participant granted prior to the Change in Control shall be fully vested and immediately exercisable in their entirety.  The Committee, in its sole discretion, may provide for the purchase of any such Stock Options by the Company for an amount of cash equal to the excess of the Change in Control Price (as defined below) of the shares of Common Stock covered by such Stock Options, over the aggregate exercise price of such Stock Options.  For purposes of this Section 10.1, "Change in Control Price" shall mean the higher of (i) the highest price per share of Common Stock paid in any transaction related to a Change in Control of the Company, or (ii) the highest Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock at any time during the sixty (60) day period preceding a Change in Control.
(b)Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, the restrictions to which any shares of Restricted Stock of such Participant granted prior to the Change in Control are subject shall lapse as if the applicable Restriction Period had ended upon such Change in Control.
(c)Notwithstanding anything else herein, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, provide for accelerated vesting of an Award upon a Termination of Employment during the Pre-Change in Control Period.  Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the "Pre-Change in Control Period" shall mean the one hundred eighty (180) day period prior to a Change in Control.
10.2CHANGE IN CONTROL.  A "Change in Control" shall be deemed to have occurred:
(a)upon any "person" as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the Company, any trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under any employee benefit plan of the Company, or any company owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of Common Stock of the Company, becoming the owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing forty percent (40%) or more of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities (including, without limitation, securities owned at the time of any increase in ownership);
(b)during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board of Directors, and any new director (other than a director designated by a person who has entered into an agreement with the Company to effect a transaction described in paragraph (a), (c), or (d) of this section) or a director whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of either an actual or threatened election contest (as such terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulation 14A promulgated under the Exchange Act) or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a person other than the Board of Directors of the Company whose election by the Board of Directors or nomination for election by the Company's stockholders was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning of the two-year period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors;
(c)upon the merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the combined voting power of the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation; provided, however, that a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of the Company (or similar transaction) in which no person (other than those covered by the exceptions in (a) above) acquires more than forty percent (40%) of the combined voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities shall not constitute a Change in Control of the Company; or
(d)upon the stockholder's of the Company approval of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets other than the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to a person or persons who beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least fifty percent (50%) or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Company at the time of the sale.

11.1TERMINATION OR AMENDMENT.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the Board may at any time, and from time to time, amend, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan, or suspend or terminate it entirely, retroactively or otherwise, without stockholder approval.  By way of example and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board of Directors reserves the right, without stockholder approval, to (i) make amendments of a clerical nature that clarify language or understanding of the terms of the Plan, (ii) amend the vesting provisions of a Stock Option or the Plan, (iii) amend the provisions with respect to termination or death of a Participant, including but not limited to the length of time to exercise a Stock Option upon termination or death, (iv) add a deferred or restricted share unit or any other provision which results in Participants receiving Common Stock while no cash consideration is received by the Company; (v) change the method of calculating a minimum exercise price per Common Stock for Stock Options under Section 6.3 of the Plan; and (vi) adjust accordingly the number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan, the Common Stock subject to any Award and the exercise price of the Common Stock subject to Stock Options as a result of the events described in Section 4.2(b) of the Plan.  (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Board of Directors reserves the right, without stockholder approval, to (i) make amendments of a clerical nature that clarify language or understanding of the terms of the Plan, (ii) amend the vesting provisions of a Stock Option or the Plan, (iii) amend the provisions with respect to termination or death of a Participant, including but not limited to the length of time to exercise a Stock Option upon termination or death, (iv) add a deferred or restricted share unit or any other provision which results in Participants receiving Common Stock while no cash consideration is received by the Company; (v) change the method of calculating a minimum exercise price per Common Stock for Stock Options under Section 6.3 of the Plan; and (vi) adjust accordingly the number of shares of Common Stock available under the Plan, the Common Stock subject to any Award and the exercise price of the Common Stock subject to Stock Options as a result of the events described in Section 4.2(b) of the Plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing:
(a)unless otherwise required by law or specifically provided herein, the rights of a Participant with respect to Awards granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination, may not be impaired without the consent of such Participant; and
(b)stockholder approval shall be required, only if and to the extent required by the rules of a stock exchange on which the Company's Common Stock is listed for trading, the applicable provisions of Rule 16b-3 or, if and to the extent required, under the applicable provisions of Section 422 of the Code, for an amendment which would (i) except as permitted in Section 4.1(a), increase the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under this Plan; (ii) change the classification of employees, Consultants, directors and non-employee directors eligible to receive Awards under this Plan; (iii) decrease the minimum option price of any Stock Option; (iv) extend the maximum option period under Section 6.3; (v) change any rights under the Plan with regard to non-employee directors; or (vi) require stockholder approval in order for the Plan to continue to comply with the applicable provisions, if any, of Rule 16b-3, any applicable state law, or, with regard to Incentive Stock Options, Section 422 of the Code.
The Committee may amend the terms of any Award theretofore granted, prospectively or retroactively, but, subject to Article IV above or as otherwise specifically provided herein, no such amendment or other action by the Committee shall impair the rights of any holder without the holder's consent.
ARTICLE XII
UNFUNDED PLAN
This Plan is intended to constitute an "unfunded" plan for incentive compensation.  With respect to any payments as to which a Participant has a fixed and vested interest but which are not yet made to a Participant by the Company, nothing contained herein shall give any such Participant any rights that are greater than those of a general creditor of the Company.
ARTICLE XIII
GENERAL PROVISIONS
13.1LEGEND.  The Committee may require each person receiving shares pursuant to an Award under the Plan to represent to and agree with the Company in writing that the Participant is acquiring the shares without a view to distribution thereof.  In addition to any legend required by this Plan, the certificates for such shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on Transfer.  All certificates for shares of Common Stock delivered under the Plan shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations and other requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Common Stock is then listed or any national securities association system upon whose system the Common Stock is then quoted, any applicable federal or state securities law, and any applicable corporate law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
13.2OTHER PLANS.  Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to stockholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
13.3NO RIGHT TO EMPLOYMENT/DIRECTORSHIP.  Neither this Plan nor the grant of any Award hereunder shall give any Participant or other employee any right with respect to continuance of employment by the Company or any Affiliate, nor shall there be a limitation in any way on the right of the Company or any Affiliate by which an employee is employed to terminate his employment at any time.  Neither this Plan nor the grant of any Award hereunder shall impose any obligations on the Company to retain any Participant as a director nor shall it impose on the part of any Participant any obligation to remain as a director of the Company.
13.4WITHHOLDING OF TAXES.  The Company shall have the right to deduct from any payment to be made to a Participant, or to otherwise require, prior to the issuance or delivery of any shares of Common Stock or the payment of any cash hereunder, payment by the Participant of, any Federal, state or local taxes required by law to be withheld.  Upon the vesting of Restricted Stock, or upon making an election under Code Section 83(b), a Participant shall pay all required withholding to the Company.  The Committee may permit any such withholding obligation with regard to any Participant to be satisfied by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock otherwise deliverable or by delivering shares of Common Stock already owned.  Any fraction of a share of Common Stock required to satisfy such tax obligations shall be disregarded and the amount due shall be paid instead in cash by the Participant.
13.5LISTING AND OTHER CONDITIONS.  If at any time counsel to the Company shall be of the opinion that any sale or delivery of shares of Common Stock pursuant to an Award is or may in the circumstances be unlawful or result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company under the statutes, rules or regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, the Company shall have no obligation to make such sale or delivery, or to make any application or to effect or to maintain any qualification or registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or otherwise with respect to shares of Common Stock or Awards, and the right to exercise any Option shall be suspended until, in the opinion of said counsel, such sale or delivery shall be lawful or will not result in the imposition of excise taxes on the Company.
13.6GOVERNING LAW.  This Plan shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of incorporation of the Company (regardless of the law that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws).
13.7CONSTRUCTION.  Wherever any words are used in this Plan in the masculine gender they shall be construed as though they were also used in the feminine gender in all cases where they would so apply, and wherever any words are used herein in the singular form they shall be construed as though they were also used in the plural form in all cases where they would so apply.  To the extent applicable, the Plan shall be limited, construed and interpreted in a manner so as to comply with the applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3; however, noncompliance with Rule 16b-3 shall have no impact on the effectiveness of a Stock Option granted under the Plan.
13.8OTHER BENEFITS.  No Award payment under this Plan shall be deemed compensation for purposes of computing benefits under any retirement plan of the Company or its subsidiaries nor affect any benefits under any other benefit plan now or subsequently in effect under which the availability or amount of benefits is related to the level of compensation.
13.9COSTS.  The Company shall bear all expenses included in administering this Plan, including expenses of issuing Common Stock pursuant to any Awards hereunder.
13.10NO RIGHT TO SAME BENEFITS.  The provisions of Awards need not be the same with respect to each Participant, and such Awards to individual Participants need not be the same in subsequent years.
13.11DEATH/DISABILITY.  The Committee may in its discretion require the transferee of a Participant to supply it with written notice of the Participant's death or Disability and to supply it with a copy of the will (in the case of the Participant's death) or such other evidence as the Committee deems necessary to establish the validity of the transfer of an Award.  The Committee may also require the agreement of the transferee to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the Plan.
13.12SECTION 16(b) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT.  All elections and transactions under the Plan by persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act involving shares of Common Stock are intended to comply with any applicable condition under Rule 16b-3.  The Committee may establish and adopt written administrative guidelines, designed to facilitate compliance with Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, as it may deem necessary or proper for the administration and operation of the Plan and the transaction of business thereunder.
13.13CODE SECTION 409A COMPLIANCE.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, all Awards under this Plan that are subject to Code Section 409A shall be designed and administered in a manner that does not result in the imposition of tax or penalties under Code Section 409A.  Accordingly, Awards under this Plan that are subject to Code Section 409A shall comply with the following requirements, as applicable.
(a)DISTRIBUTION TO SPECIFIED EMPLOYEES UPON SEPARATION FROM SERVICE.  To the extent that payment under an Award which is subject to Code Section 409A is due to a Specified Employee on account of the Specified Employee's Separation from Service from the Company or its Affiliate or Subsidiary, such payment shall be delayed until the first day of the seventh (7th) month following such 
Separation from Service (or as soon as practicable thereafter).  The Committee, in its discretion, may provide in the Award document for the payment of interest at a rate set by the Committee for such six-month period.  In the event that a payment under an Award is exempt from Code Section 409A, payment shall be made to a Specified Employee without any such six-month delay.
(b)NO ACCELERATION OF PAYMENT.  To the extent that an Award is subject to Code Section 409A, payment under such Award shall not be accelerated from the date(s) specified in the Award documents as of the date of grant.
