 AMAZING ENERGY OIL AND GAS, CO.
This proxy statement ("Proxy Statement") and the accompanying proxy card are furnished in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors (the "Board" or the "Board of Directors") of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. (the "Company" or "AMAZ") of proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company to be held at our corporate headquarters located at 5700 W. Plano Parkway, Suite 3600, Plano, TX 75093 , at 10:00 AM Central Time on December 12, 2018 (the "Annual Meeting"), and any adjournments or postponements thereof. The Company's mailing address is 5700 W. Plano Pkwy, Suite 3600, Plano, TX 75093.
If a proxy in the accompanying form ("Proxy") is properly executed and received by us prior to the Annual Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or rescheduling thereof, our shares of common stock, no par value per share ("Shares") represented by such Proxy will be voted in the manner directed. In the absence of voting instructions, the Shares will be voted for the proposals set out in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Please see the Proxy for voting instructions.
A Proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its use by filing a written notice of revocation of Proxy or a later dated Proxy with American Stock Transfer Company, LLC, the Company's registrar and transfer agent, at 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219. A Proxy may also be revoked by submitting another Proxy with a later date over the internet, to our registrar and transfer agent or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Attending the Annual Meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a Proxy.
Proxies for the Annual Meeting will be solicited by the Company primarily by mail. Proxies may also be solicited personally by our directors, officers or regular employees without additional compensation. We may reimburse banks, broker-dealers or other nominees for their reasonable expenses in forwarding the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting to beneficial owners of Shares. The costs of this solicitation will be borne by the Company.
NRS 78.320 provides that a majority of the voting power entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Abstentions, withheld votes and shares held of record by a broker or its nominee that are voted on any matter are included in determining the number of votes present.
The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement, our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 and the enclosed Proxy are first being given or sent to stockholders is November 15, 2018.
 Your vote is important — we urge you to vote by Proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting.  COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q:    
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement and Proxy?
A:
This Proxy Statement describes the proposals upon which you, as a stockholder, will vote. It also gives you information on the proposals, as well as other information so that you can make an informed decision.
Q:    
What is the Proxy?
A:
The Proxy enables you to appoint as your representative at the Annual Meeting. By completing and returning the Proxy, you are authorizing Mr. McAndrew to vote your Shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed on the Proxy. This way your Shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is a good idea to complete and return your Proxy before the date of the Annual Meeting just in case your plans change.
Q:
What happens if you do not indicate how your Shares are to be voted?
A:
If you submit your executed Proxy designating Mr. McAndrew as the individual authorized to vote your Shares, but you do not indicate how your Shares are to be voted, then your Shares will be voted by Mr. McAndrew in accordance with the Board's recommendations, which are described in this Proxy Statement. In addition, if any other matters are properly brought up at the Annual Meeting (other than the proposals contained in this Proxy Statement), then Mr. McAndrew will have the authority to vote your shares on those other matters in accordance with his discretion and judgment. The Board currently does not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals contained in this Proxy Statement.
Q:    
Who can vote at the Meeting?
A:
Registered stockholders who own our Shares on November 9, 2018 (the "Record Date") may attend and vote at the Meeting. Each Share is entitled to one vote. There were 83,873,932 Shares outstanding on the Record Date. If you own your Shares through a brokerage account or in another nominee form, you must provide instructions to the broker or nominee as to how your Shares should be voted. Your broker or nominee will generally provide you with the appropriate forms at the time you receive this Proxy Statement. If you own your Shares through a brokerage account or nominee, you cannot vote in person at the Annual Meeting unless you receive a Proxy from the broker or the nominee.
The list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be open for the examination by any stockholder for any purpose relevant to the Annual Meeting during normal business hours for 10 days before the Annual Meeting at the Company's registered office in our statutory registered agent's office at CSC Services of Nevada, Inc., 2215-B, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119. The list will also be available during the Annual Meeting for inspection by stockholders.
You are entitled to attend the Annual Meeting only if you are a stockholder of record or a beneficial owner as of the close of business on the Record Date, or if you hold a valid proxy for the Annual Meeting. You should be prepared to present photo identification for admission to the Annual Meeting. Note that even if you attend the Annual Meeting, you cannot vote the Shares that are held by your nominee unless you have a proxy from your nominee.
Q:    
How can Shares held through a brokerage account be voted?
A:
If your shares are not registered in your name but in the "street name" of a bank, broker or other holder of record, then your name will not appear in the Company's register of stockholders. Those Shares are held in your nominee's name, on your behalf, and your nominee will be entitled to vote your Shares. Your nominee is required to vote your Shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions to your nominee, your nominee will be entitled to vote your Shares with respect to "discretionary" items. On non-routine items, nominees cannot vote without instructions from the beneficial owner, which if such instructions are not given result in "broker non-votes". For the purposes of the Annual Meeting, brokers are able to vote all of the matters to be voted on require voting instructions from the underlying beneficial owner or such Shares will be considered broker non-votes.
Q:     
What am I voting on? A:
We are asking you to: (i) vote for the election of the Company's directors for the ensuing year; (ii) ratification of DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. as our auditors for 2018; and, (iii) approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.
 OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE IN FAVOR
 OF EACH OF THESE PROPOSALS.
Q:  
How do I vote?
A: 
Registered stockholders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting, by mail, by phone, or on the Internet.
Voting by Mail. Complete, date, sign and mail the Proxy in the enclosed postage pre-paid envelope. If you mark your voting instructions on the Proxy, your Shares will be voted as you instruct. Please see the Proxy for voting instructions. In order for your Proxy to be validly submitted and for your Shares to be voted in accordance with your instructions, we must receive your mailed proxy card by 8:00 AM Central Time on December 12, 2018.
Voting by Telephone. Call the toll-free number listed on the Proxy from any touch-tone telephone and follow the instructions. You should have your Proxy in hand when you call.
Voting in Person. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may vote as instructed at the Annual Meeting. However, if you hold your Shares in street name (that is, through a broker/dealer or other nominee), you will need to bring to the Annual Meeting a Proxy delivered to you by such nominee reflecting your Share ownership as of the Record Date.
Voting on the Internet. Go to www.iproxydirect.com/AMAZ and follow the instructions. You should have your Proxy in hand when you access the website.
If you own your Shares through a brokerage account or in other nominee form, you should follow the instructions you receive from the record holder to see which voting methods are available.
Your vote is very important to us. If you do not plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to read this Proxy Statement and submit your completed Proxy prior to the Annual Meeting in accordance with the above instructions so that your Shares will be represented and voted in accordance with your instructions.
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we recommend that you vote your Shares in advance as described above so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting.
Q:   
What does it mean if I receive more than one Proxy?
A: 
It means that you hold Shares in multiple accounts. Please complete and return all Proxies to ensure that all your Shares are voted in accordance with your instructions.
Q:  
What if I change my mind after returning my Proxy?
A: 
If you are a registered stockholder, you may revoke your Proxy and change your vote at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting. You may do this by:
 sending a signed notice of revocation of proxy to American Stock Transfer Company, LLC, 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, stating that the Proxy is revoked; or
 submitting another Proxy with a later date over the Internet, by telephone, or to our registrar and transfer agent at the address set out above; or
 voting at the Annual Meeting.
If you wish to revoke your submitted Proxy and submit new voting instructions by mail, by telephone, or over the Internet then we must receive a new Proxy with your new voting instructions by 8:00 AM Central Time on December 12, 2018. Your Proxy will not be revoked if you attend the Annual Meeting but do not vote.
If you own your Shares through a broker or other nominee and wish to change your vote, you must send those instructions to your broker or nominee.
Q:   
Will my Shares be voted if I do not sign and return my Proxy?
A: 
If your Shares are registered in your name, they will not be voted unless you submit your Proxy or vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If your Shares are held in street name, your broker/dealer or other nominee will not have the authority to vote your Shares unless you provide instructions.
Q:   
Who will count the votes?
A: 
Agents of the Company will tabulate the Proxies. Additionally, votes cast by stockholders voting in person at the Annual Meeting are tabulated by a person who is appointed by our management before the Annual Meeting.
Q:  
How many Shares must be present to hold the Meeting?
A: 
NRS 78.320 provides that a majority of the voting power entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. Consequently, to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business, at least a majority of the voting power entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present at the Annual Meeting. This is called a quorum.
Votes are counted as present at the Annual Meeting if a stockholder either:
 is present and votes in person at the Meeting; or
 has properly submitted a Proxy.
Abstentions and broker non-votes (Shares held by a broker/dealer or other nominee that are not voted because the broker/dealer or other nominee does not have the authority to vote on a particular matter) will be counted for the purposes of establishing a quorum.
Q:   
How many votes are required to elect directors?
A: 
To be elected, a director nominee must receive a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Only votes cast FOR a nominee will be counted. Votes withheld and broker non-votes will be excluded entirely from the vote.
Q:  
What is the effect of withholding votes or "abstaining"?
A: 
You can withhold your vote for any nominee in the election of directors. Withheld votes will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect on the outcome. On other proposals, you can "Abstain". If you abstain, your Shares will be counted as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of that proposal and your abstention will have the effect of a vote against the proposal.
Q:  
How are votes counted?
A: 
You may vote "For" or "Withhold" your vote on the proposal to elect directors. You may vote "For" or "Against" or "Abstain" on the other proposals outlined in this Proxy Statement. If you abstain from voting on a proposal, it will have the practical effect of voting against the proposal.
If you sign and return your Proxy without voting instructions, your Shares will be counted as a "For" vote in favor of each proposal.
Q: 
Could other matters be discussed at the Meeting?
A: 
We do not know of any other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement. If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, the person named in the Proxy will have the discretion to vote on those matters on your behalf. Q:   
Where and when will I be able to find the voting results?
A: 
You can find the official results of voting at the Annual Meeting in a current report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") within four business days of the Meeting.
Q: 
Do you have plans to implement rules that allow companies to direct their shareholders to an on-line copy of the proxy materials, rather than sending them paper copies?
A: 
SEC rules allow companies to mail their stockholders a notice that their proxy materials can be accessed over the internet, instead of sending a paper copy of the proxy statement and annual report. We have decided not to adopt this new delivery method for the Annual Meeting. We are considering how to realize the cost savings opportunity and environmental benefits of this new rule while still maintaining a meaningful and convenient proxy process for our stockholders.
Q:    
Who do I contact if I have any further questions?
A: 
If you have questions or require any assistance with voting your Shares, please contact the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Will McAndrew III at Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co., 5700 W. Plano Parkway, Suite 3600, Plano, TX 75093, Telephone 972-233-1244.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS
 Board Meetings and Attendance
The Board met 7 times during fiscal 2018. Each member of the Board attended at least 25% of all meetings of our Board and of the committees of the Board on which they served in 2017 that took place since each such director's appointment to the Board. Although we do not have a formal policy with respect to attendance of directors at our annual meetings, all directors are encouraged and expected to attend such meetings if possible.
 Independence of Directors
 Our shares of common stock are traded on OTCQX. OTCQX requires at least two (2) of our Directors be independent. Under these circumstances, the rules of the SEC require that we identify which of our directors is independent using a definition for independence for directors of a national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system which has requirements that a majority of the board of directors be independent. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, with us, our senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm, our Board of Directors has determined that five (5) of our directors, Mr. Alford, Mr. Devereaux, Mr. Berg, Mr. Manning and Mr. Koeppler are independent directors under standards established by the NASDAQ Stock Market.
 Board Leadership Structure
The Board has determined that having the Company's President also serve as Chief Executive Officer is in the best interests of Company's stockholders. Given the Company's size and Mr. McAndrew's in-depth knowledge of the Company's business, his leadership in formulating and implementing strategic initiatives and the market environment, the Board believes that having the CEO also serve as the President provides the effective leadership for the Company. Further, because the Company also has a separate individual, Tony Alford, serve as the Company's Chairman of the Board, this bifurcated leadership structure provides checks and balances available through a segregation of duties amongst leadership. Furthermore, because the Company has separate individuals serving as President/CEO and Chairman, the Company benefits from the added experience and knowledge each individual possesses and employs toward the Company's operation. The Board believes that this current leadership structure is optimal for the Company because it provides the Company with strong, knowledgeable and effective leadership.
 Risk Oversight
 The Company's officers are responsible for assessing and managing our various exposures to risk on a day-to-day basis, including the creation and implementation of appropriate risk management policies and programs.
 Our Board has overall responsibility for overseeing our officers in the execution of these responsibilities and for assessing our overall approach to risk management.  Additionally, while oversight of our risk management process is a full Board responsibility, the responsibility for monitoring financial risks has been delegated to the Board's audit committee. The audit committee meets periodically with management to review our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. Such risk exposures and steps are reported by the audit committee to the full Board.
 The Board's role in risk oversight has not had any effect on the Board's leadership structure.
 Our Director Nominations Process
 Our Board is responsible for approving candidates for Board membership.
 Criteria for Directors
Our Board believes that certain criteria should be met by director nominees to ensure effective corporate governance, support the Company's strategies and businesses, account for individual director attributes and the effect of the overall mix of those attributes on the Board's effectiveness, and support the successful recruitment of qualified candidates for the Board. Qualified candidates are those who, in the judgment of the Board, possess certain personal attributes and a sufficient mix of experience and related attributes to assure effective service on the Board. The personal attributes of director nominees that the Board considers include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Experience. Each candidate should possess professional and  personal experiences and expertise relevant to the Company's  business operations.  
● Integrity. Each candidate shall be an individual who has  demonstrated integrity and ethics in his or her personal and  professional life and has established a record of professional  accomplishment in his or her chosen field;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Best Interests of All stockholders. Each candidate must be  prepared to represent the best interests of all stockholders and  not just one particular constituency;  
● Active Participation. Each candidate must be prepared to  participate fully in Board activities, including attendance at, and  active participation in, meetings of the Board and the committee(s)  of which he or she is a member, and not have other personal or  professional commitments that would, in the Board's sole  judgment, interfere with or limit his or her ability to do  so;  
● Independence. No  candidate, or family member or affiliate or associate (as defined  in federal securities laws) of a candidate, shall have any material  personal, financial or professional interest in any present or  potential competitor of the Company;  
● Collegiality. Each candidate should contribute positively to  the existing chemistry and collegial culture among Board members;  and  
● Diversity. Each candidate should contribute to the  Board's overall diversity – diversity being broadly  construed to mean a variety of viewpoints, perspectives, personal  and professional experiences and backgrounds.  
[END TABLE]
 Processes for Identifying Director Candidates
 The Board has two principal methods for identifying potential Board candidates (other than those proposed by stockholders, as discussed below). First, the Board solicits ideas for possible candidates from a number of sources, including other members of the Board, senior executives, individuals personally known to Board members and research.
 The Board will also consider nominees recommended by the Company's stockholders as candidates for Board membership. A stockholder wishing to nominate a candidate for Board membership should provide written notice to the Board at the following address: 5700 W. Plano Pkwy, Suite 3600, Plano, TX 75093. To nominate a candidate for election to the Board at the annual meeting, the notice must be received by November 14, 2018. The notice should contain information about both the nominee and the stockholder making the nomination, including such information regarding each nominee required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to SEC rules and regulations and such other information sufficient to allow the Board to determine if the candidate meets the criteria for Board membership described above. The Board may require that the proposed nominee furnish additional information to determine that person's eligibility to serve as a director. All recommendations will be brought to the attention of the Board.  Evaluation of Director Candidates
 The Board will consider and evaluate all candidates identified through the processes described above, including incumbents and candidates proposed by stockholders.
 If, based upon Board's initial evaluation, the candidate continues to be of interest, members of the Board may interview the candidate and communicate their evaluation to the rest of the Board. Additional meetings between the candidate and other members of the Board may also be arranged. Ultimately, background and reference checks may also be conducted by the Board.
 Audit Committee
 As of July 31, 2018, the entire board of directors comprised the audit committee with Tony Alford serving as the Audit Committee Chairman. The Audit Committee approves the selection of the Company's independent certified public accountants to audit the annual financial statements and review the quarterly financial statements, discusses with the auditors and approves in advance the scope of the audit and reviews, reviews management's administration of the system of internal controls, and reviews the Company's procedures relating to business ethics. During the last fiscal year, our audit committee met once.
 Audit Committee Financial Expert
 We do not have an Audit Committee Financial Expert. We believe that the need for an Audit Committee Financial Expert and the costs associated with such retention is not warranted at the present time.
 Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
 As of July 31, 2018 the entire board of directors comprises the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with Darrell Carey serving as Chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are responsible for developing the Company's approach to corporate governance issues and compliance with governance rules. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is also mandated to plan for the succession of the Company, including recommending director candidates, review of board procedures, size and organization, and monitoring of senior management with respect to governance issues. The committee is responsible for the development and implementation of corporate communications to ensure the integrity of the Company's internal control and management information systems. The purview of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also includes the administration of the board's relationship with the management of the Company, monitoring the quality and effectiveness of the Company's corporate governance system and ensuring the effectiveness and integrity of the Company's communication and reporting to shareholders and the public generally.
 Compensation Committee
 As of July 31, 2018 the entire board of directors comprises the Company's compensation committee with Bob Manning serving as Chairman of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the compensation for the officers and the other agents and employees of the corporation. The Committee may delegate the authority to set the compensation of the officers, agents, and employees to the President/CEO. No officer may be prevented from receiving compensation as an officer solely because the officer is also a director of the corporation. The Committee shall fix the amount or salary to be paid to each director for service as a director or for attendance at each meeting of the Board. Salary or payment for service as a director shall not preclude a director from serving the corporation in any other capacity or from receiving compensation for service in that other capacity.
 Code of Ethics
 We have adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics for our Directors, Officers and employees.  A copy of our Code of Conduct and Ethics can be obtained at no cost, by telephone at 806-322-1922, or by mail at: 5700 W. Plano Pkwy, Suite 3600, Plano, TX 75093.  We believe our Code of Conduct and Ethics is reasonably designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct; provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in public reports; comply with applicable laws; ensure prompt internal reporting of code violations; and provide accountability for adherence to the code.  Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
 Under section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and pursuant to regulations there under, the Company's Directors, Executive Officers and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our equity securities are required to file reports of their own ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us, or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, that certain Directors and Officers failed to timely file a Form 3 by July 31, 2018 and that certain Directors and Officers also failed to timely file Form 5 by September 14, 2018.

 In February 2017, the Board of Directors adopted and approved the 2017 Stock Option Plan as it relates to 10,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), to be offered and sold to accounts of eligible persons of the Company under the Plan. The 2017 Plan, by its terms, required the approval of a majority vote of the shareholders within 12 months of the adoption of the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan was not approved by a majority vote of the shareholders of the Company and therefore is now void. No options were issued pursuant to the 2017 Plan.
 PROPOSAL 2 – RATIFICATION OF DECORIA, MAICHEL & TEAGUE, P.S.
 AS OUR INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR 2019
The Audit Committee has selected DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. independent auditor for fiscal year ending July 31, 2019, and the Board asks shareholders to ratify that selection. The Board considers the selection of the independent auditor to be an important matter of shareholder concern and is submitting the selection of DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. for ratification by shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. The Board considers the selection of DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. as our independent auditor for fiscal year ending July 31, 2019 to be in the best interests of Amazing Energy Oil and Gas, Co. and its shareholders.
The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the voting power cast in person or by proxy at the meeting is required to approve the ratification of the selection of DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. independent auditor for the current fiscal year. If a majority of shareholders does not ratify the selection of DeCoria, Maichel & Teague, P.S. the Audit Committee will consider the result a recommendation to consider selection of a different firm.
 PROPOSAL 3 – NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
 The Company believes that the compensation policies for our named executive officers (which include Mr. McAndrew and Mr. Dobbins,) are designed to attract, motivate and retain talented executive officers and are aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. This advisory stockholder vote, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay vote" gives you as a stockholder the opportunity to approve or not approve the compensation of our named executive officers that is disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This advisory stockholder vote occurs every year and will next occur at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of executive compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, the Company asks that you indicate your support for our executive compensation policies and practices as described in this Proxy Statement by voting "FOR" the following resolution:  RESOLVED that the Company's stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's executives named in the Summary Compensation Table, as disclosed in the Company's 2018 Proxy Statement pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which disclosure includes the compensation tables, narrative disclosure and other related tables and disclosure.
 Since this say-on-pay vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board. However, the Board values the opinions of our stockholders and will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the Shares represented in person or by proxy entitled to vote on the proposal will be required for approval.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THIS PROPOSAL.
