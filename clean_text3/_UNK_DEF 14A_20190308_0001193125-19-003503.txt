SUMMARY OF PROPOSAL 1 
PROPOSAL 1: TO APPROVE A CHANGE IN THE FUND'S CLASSIFICATION FROM A "DIVERSIFIED" FUND TO A "NON-DIVERSIFIED" FUND (THE "PROPOSAL"). 
Background and Description of the Proposal: 
The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act") requires every mutual fund to be classified as either a "diversified" fund or "non-diversified" fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act also requires shareholders to approve a change in a fund's classification from a diversified fund to a non-diversified fund. 
A diversified fund is limited as to the amount it may invest in any single issuer. Under the 1940 Act, a diversified fund may not, with respect to 75% of its total assets, invest in securities of any issuer if, as a result of such investment (i) more than 5% of the value of the fund's total assets would be invested in securities of any one issuer, or (ii) the fund would hold more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer. These percentage limitations do not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or to securities issued by other investment companies. With respect to the remaining 25% of its total assets, a diversified fund may invest more than 5% of its total assets in the securities of one issuer. These limits apply at the time a diversified fund purchases a security; a diversified fund may exceed these limits if positions it already holds increase in value relative to the rest of the fund's holdings. In contrast, a non-diversified fund is not subject to the limits of a diversified fund; it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in a single issuer or a fewer number of issuers than a diversified fund. 
The Fund currently is classified as a diversified fund. Shareholders are being asked to approve a change in the Fund's classification from a diversified fund to a non-diversified fund, as defined under the 1940 Act. Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC ("LMPFA"), the Fund's investment manager, and Martin Currie Inc. ("Martin Currie"), the Fund's subadviser, believe that changing the Fund's classification to non-diversified will benefit the Fund by giving it the flexibility to hold larger positions in certain companies. Martin Currie believes that this change will better allow the Fund to take more meaningful positions in securities that are its top investment choices. 
To the extent the Fund invests its assets in a smaller number of issuers, the Fund will be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers than a diversified fund. Investing a larger percentage of the Fund's assets in any one issuer could increase the Fund's risk of loss and its share price volatility because the value of its shares would be more susceptible to adverse events affecting that issuer. If the Fund takes a larger position in an issuer that subsequently has an adverse return, the Fund may have a greater loss than it would have had if Martin Currie had invested Fund assets in a larger number of issuers. Martin Currie will use this increased investment flexibility to take larger positions in the securities of fewer issuers when it believes that doing so could benefit the Fund. 
Martin Currie does not expect the proposed change in the classification of the Fund to substantially affect the manner in which the Fund's investment program is conducted at this time. Other than the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified, LMPFA and Martin Currie do not propose or anticipate any material change in the management of the Fund if the Proposal is approved. Any future material changes to the management of the Fund will require consideration by the Board and disclosure in the Fund's prospectus or statement of additional information, as appropriate. 
In addition, the Fund is (and will remain) subject to the diversification rules of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Tax Code"). These rules provide that, to maintain favorable tax treatment, the Fund must invest at least 50% of its total assets so that no more than 5% of its total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer, and so that it holds no more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any issuer. With respect to the remaining 50% of its total assets, the Fund is limited to investing 25% in the securities of a single issuer. These limits apply only as of the end of each quarter of the Fund's fiscal year, so the Fund may have a higher concentration in an issuer during periods between the ends of its fiscal quarters. However, Martin Currie has no current intention of investing in the securities of any single issuer beyond the Tax Code limits. Like the 1940 Act limits, the Tax Code limits do not apply to securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, or to securities issued by other investment companies.  If shareholders of the Fund approve the Proposal, the change in the Fund's classification from diversified to non-diversified will become effective when the Fund's registration statement is revised or supplemented to reflect that the fundamental investment limitation requiring diversification no longer applies to the Fund. If shareholders of the Fund do not approve the Proposal, the Fund will continue to be subject to the fundamental policy requiring diversification and will continue to operate as a "diversified" fund. 
Shareholder Approval 
Approval of the Proposal will require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, as defined in the 1940 Act. A "majority of the outstanding voting securities" is defined in the 1940 Act as the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the voting power of the voting securities present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present at the Meeting or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. 
The Board met on November 1-2, 2018 to discuss the Proposal and voted unanimously to approve the Proposal. In determining to recommend approval of the Proposal, the Board considered, among other factors, Martin Currie's statement that Martin Currie believes the Fund would benefit from changing its classification to a non-diversified fund because it would allow the Fund greater flexibility to hold larger positions in certain companies that Martin Currie recommends. The Board considered that a fund that invests a larger percentage of its assets in a smaller number of issuers could be more susceptible to negative events affecting those issuers, and in that regard, considered Martin Currie's representation that it believes that the potential benefits of investing more of the Fund's assets in particular issuers justify the risks of following a non-diversified strategy. Additionally, the Board considered Martin Currie's representation that the Fund would continue to hold the same range of number of stocks, that Martin Currie did not believe that the change would substantially affect the overall risk profile of the Fund, and that the costs associated with seeking shareholder approval of the Proposal would not be borne by the shareholders. 
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the Proposal.  VOTING INFORMATION 
General 
The Trust is a Maryland statutory trust organized on October 7, 2009. A Maryland statutory trust is an unincorporated business association that is established under, and governed by, Maryland law. Maryland law provides a statutory framework for the powers, duties, rights and obligations of the trustees and shareholders of the statutory trust, while the more specific powers, duties, rights and obligations of the trustees and the shareholders are determined by the trustees as set forth in the Trust's declaration of trust. The Fund is a series of the Trust and is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1940 Act as an open-end management investment company. 
Solicitation of Votes 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with a solicitation of proxies by the Fund's Board to be exercised at the Meeting. This Proxy Statement, along with the Notice of Meeting and a Proxy Card, are first being mailed to shareholders of the Fund on or about January 7, 2019 or as soon as practicable thereafter. Only shareholders of record as of the close of business on the Record Date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. If the enclosed Proxy Card is properly completed, signed and dated and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the proxies named thereon will vote the shares represented by the Proxy Card in accordance with the instructions marked thereon. Proxy Cards that are properly signed but have not been marked with voting instructions will be voted "FOR" approval of the Proposal and in the discretion of the designated proxy holders on any other matter that properly comes before the Meeting. Proxy Cards that are unsigned, or that are marked with unclear or conflicting voting instructions, will not be voted and will be resent to shareholders to be properly completed, signed and dated and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting. Please see page iii of this Proxy Statement for instructions on how to sign your Proxy Card. 
The costs of the solicitation will be borne by LMPFA or its affiliates and not by the Fund. These costs include the cost of preparing, printing and mailing the Proxy Statement, Proxy Cards and other proxy materials and tabulating the votes. It is estimated that the total costs and expenses of the solicitation, to be borne by LMPFA or its affiliates, will be approximately $14,000. LMPFA or its affiliates will also bear the legal expenses incurred in connection with the preparation of this Proxy Statement. 
Votes are being solicited by mail. Additional solicitation may be made by letter or telephone by officers or employees of LMPFA or its affiliates, or by dealers and their representatives. Brokerage houses, banks and other fiduciaries may be requested to forward proxy solicitation material to the beneficial owner of shares of the Fund to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. LMPFA or its affiliates will reimburse brokerage firms, custodians, banks and fiduciaries for their expenses in forwarding the Proxy Statement and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the Fund's shares. LMPFA, on behalf of the Fund, has retained Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge"), a proxy solicitation firm, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. The services to be provided by Broadridge include printing and mailing proxy materials, proxy consulting, project management, telephone and internet processing, tabulation and vote reporting services. It is anticipated that Broadridge will be paid approximately $11,000, which is included in the amount above, for such solicitation services, to be borne by LMPFA or its affiliates as described above. Broadridge may solicit proxies personally and by mail, telephone or the Internet. 
Submission of Voting Instructions 
Shareholders have three options for submitting voting instructions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Internet—the enclosed Proxy Card includes directions for shareholders to cast their votes via the Internet at a website designed  for this purpose. The required control number is printed on each shareholder's Proxy Card. Shareholders who cast their votes via the Internet do not need to mail their Proxy Card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  Telephone—the enclosed Proxy Card includes directions for shareholders to cast their votes over the telephone. The toll-free  telephone number and required control number are printed on each shareholder's Proxy Card. Shareholders who cast their votes over the telephone do not need to mail their Proxy Card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Mail—shareholders also may cast their votes by executing the enclosed Proxy Card and mailing it in the envelope provided. The  envelope is addressed for your convenience and needs no postage if mailed in the United States.  
[END TABLE]
 The Trust encourages shareholders of the Fund to vote via the Internet or by telephone. Votes cast via the Internet or over the telephone are recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause a Proxy Card to arrive late and therefore not be counted. A shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time prior to its exercise at the Meeting by (1) submitting to the Fund a subsequently executed proxy, (2) delivering to the Fund a written notice of revocation (addressed to the Assistant Secretary at the principal executive office of the Fund at the address shown at the beginning of this Proxy Statement) or (3) otherwise giving notice of revocation at the Meeting. Merely attending the Meeting, however, will not revoke any previously executed proxy. Unless revoked, all valid and executed proxies will be voted in accordance with the specifications thereon or, in the absence of such specifications, for approval of the Proposal. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Meeting will be tabulated by the inspectors of election appointed for the Meeting. The inspectors of election will determine whether or not a quorum is present at the Meeting. The inspectors of election will treat abstentions and "broker non-votes" as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
Broker/dealer firms holding shares of the Fund in "street name" for the benefit of their customers and clients will request the instructions of such customers and clients on how to vote their shares with respect to approval of the Proposal before the Meeting. The New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") takes the position that a broker/dealer that is a member of the NYSE and that has not received instructions from a customer or client prior to the date specified in the broker/dealer firm's request for voting instructions may not vote such customer's or client's shares with respect to approval of the Proposal. A signed Proxy Card or other authorization by a beneficial owner of Fund shares that does not specify how the beneficial owner's shares should be voted on the Proposal will be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the Proposal. 
If you hold shares of the Fund through a bank or other financial institution or intermediary (called a service agent) that has entered into a service agreement with the Fund or the distributor of the Fund, the service agent may be the record holder of your shares. At the Meeting, a service agent will vote shares for which it receives instructions from its customers in accordance with those instructions. A signed Proxy Card or other authorization by a shareholder that does not specify how the shareholder's shares should be voted on the Proposal will be deemed an instruction to vote such shares in favor of the Proposal. Depending on its policies, applicable law or contractual or other restrictions, a service agent may be permitted to vote shares for which it has not received voting instructions from a customer in the same proportion as other shareholders with similar accounts have submitted voting instructions to the service agent. This practice is commonly referred to as "echo voting." Shareholders should consult their service agent for more information. 
If you beneficially own shares that are held in "street name" through a broker/dealer or that are held of record by a service agent, and if you do not give specific voting instructions for your shares, they may not be voted at all or, as described above, they may be voted in a manner that you may not intend. Therefore, you are strongly encouraged to give your broker/dealer or service agent specific instructions as to how you want your shares to be voted. 
Photographic identification will be required for admission to the Meeting. 
Shares Outstanding 
Only shareholders of record of the Fund at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. As of the close of business on the Record Date, the Fund had the number of shares outstanding as set forth in Exhibit A. 
Quorum 
The holders of outstanding shares of the Fund entitled to vote and present in person or by proxy representing 30% of the voting power of the Fund shall constitute a quorum at the Meeting. 
Required Vote 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund is required to approve the Proposal, which under applicable law means the vote of the lesser of (a) 67% or more of the voting power of the voting securities present at the Meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund   are present at the Meeting or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund. Each whole share (or fractional share) outstanding on the Record Date shall entitle the holder thereof to a number of votes equal to the net asset value of the share (or fractional share) in United States dollars determined at the close of business on the Record Date. 
Effect of Abstentions and Broker "Non-Votes" 
For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the Fund for transacting business at the Meeting, executed proxies marked as abstentions and "broker non-votes" (i.e., proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the brokers or nominees do not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present for quorum purposes but which have not been voted. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against approval of the Proposal. As a result, shareholders are urged to sign and date their Proxy Card and forward their voting instructions promptly. 
Adjournments and Postponements 
In the event that a quorum for the Fund is not present at the Meeting or in the event that a quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve the Proposal are not received, the chair of the Meeting or, if a proposal to adjourn is submitted to a vote of shareholders by the chair, the shareholders of the Fund, by the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast on the adjournment, shall have the power to adjourn the Meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the Meeting, until the requisite number of shares entitled to vote at the Meeting is present. Unless a proxy provides otherwise, the persons named as proxies will vote upon such adjournment in their discretion. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned without further notice, even if the date of such adjourned meeting is more than 120 days after the notice of the original meeting or the postponement thereof, was mailed or sent. 
The Meeting may be postponed prior to the Meeting. If the Meeting is postponed, the Fund will give notice of the postponement to shareholders.  OTHER INFORMATION
