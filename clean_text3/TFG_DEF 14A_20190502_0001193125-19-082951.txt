This Proxy Statement includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not historical facts, but instead represent only the firm's beliefs regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the firm's control. Forward-looking statements include statements about potential revenue and growth opportunities. It is possible that the firm's actual results, including the incremental revenues, if any, from such opportunities, and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated results, financial condition and incremental revenues indicated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect the firm's future results and financial condition, see "Risk Factors" in Goldman Sachs' Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Statements about Goldman Sachs' revenue and growth opportunities are subject to the risk that the firm's businesses may be unable to generate additional incremental revenues or take advantage of growth opportunities.

Goldman Sachs 
Fellow Shareholders: 
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. We will hold the meeting on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at 8:30 a.m., local time, at our offices in Jersey City, New Jersey. Enclosed you will find a notice setting forth the items we expect to address during the meeting, a letter from our Lead Director, our Proxy Statement, a form of proxy and a copy of our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders. 
In our 2018 letter to shareholders, which is included in the Annual Report, we continue our dialogue regarding our strategic priorities for the firm. In developing our forward strategy, our guiding principles include client centricity and the creation of long-term shareholder value. We believe that driving sustainable, long-term results will require innovation, scale, diversity and efficient capital and expense management, all of which must be supported by sound risk management. We hope you will find the letter to be informative. 
I would like to personally thank you for your continued support of Goldman Sachs as we invest together in the future of this firm. We look forward to welcoming many of you to our Annual Meeting. Your vote is important to us: even if you do not plan to attend the meeting in person, we hope your votes will be represented.

Goldman Sachs 
To my fellow shareholders, 
2018 was an active year for the firm and for our Board, during which we added two independent directors and completed one of a Board's most fundamental roles — the appointment of, and transition to, a new CEO. 
For several years I have written to you about the importance of executive succession planning, discussing our commitment to developing leaders in every area of the firm's businesses and the close work of our independent directors and Lloyd Blankfein, our former Chairman and CEO, on the firm's long-term and emergency succession plans. This past year was certainly no exception to our focus on this critical responsibility, as the final steps of our multi-year executive succession planning effort materialized with the July 2018 announcement that David Solomon would assume the CEO role in October 2018 and the Chairman role in January 2019. 
During 2018 we transitioned the firm's leadership from Lloyd to David, and oversaw the appointment of John Waldron to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer and of Stephen Scherr to the role of Chief Financial Officer. David, John and Stephen are dedicated and talented individuals who have distinguished themselves throughout their careers at the firm and are representative of the best of the firm's culture. These transitions are emblematic of the strength and quality of the firm's leadership bench, and as a Board we continue to be confident in the ongoing breadth, depth and commitment of our management team. 
On behalf of the entire Board I also want to express our deep gratitude to Lloyd. As Chairman and CEO, Lloyd led the firm through some of its best, but also some of its most challenging, times. Through it all, Lloyd's dedication to the firm, its people and its shareholders was self-evident, and time and time again, Lloyd proved to be a prudent risk manager and an insightful colleague and leader over his 36 year career at Goldman Sachs. 
As you will read about further in this Proxy Statement, in conjunction with our CEO succession planning, we actively considered our Board leadership structure, and determined that our Board and our firm would remain best served by having David serve in a combined Chairman and CEO role. However, as our shareholders know, our Board is committed to maintaining strong independent leadership, which we have established through a robust, independent Lead Director role that is ably supported by the independence and diversity of our Board as a whole. We will continue to re-evaluate our leadership structure at least annually to ensure that it continues to serve us well. 
As a Board, overseeing the firm's creation and delivery of long-term shareholder value is paramount to our duties. Our Board engages regularly with senior management on its development and execution of firmwide, regional and divisional strategies. We have seen firsthand David's and the new management team's unwavering commitment to find new ways to more effectively deliver One Goldman Sachs to the firm's clients by means of a strategy focused on innovation and growth and supported by sound risk management. As a Board we will hold senior management responsible for driving and sustaining long-term growth for our firm. Many of the firm's initiatives have already begun bearing fruit, and it is clear that management is committed to enhancing transparency and accountability to shareholders. We continue to advise management as they further develop their strategic plans and establish related targets and metrics that we as a Board, and you as shareholders, can use to hold them to account. 
To most effectively carry out our duties as a Board, our composition must reflect an appropriate diversity — broadly defined — of demographics, viewpoints, experiences and expertise. We have enhanced our Proxy Statement disclosure this year to more specifically highlight for shareholders the diversity of our directors. Furthermore, I am pleased to note that during 2018 we added two esteemed women to our Board — Dr. Drew Faust and Vice Admiral Jan Tighe (Retired, U.S. Navy). 
Both Drew and Jan bring a wealth of experience, knowledge and new and unique perspectives to our Board. As the former President of Harvard University, Drew led Harvard through a decade of growth and transformation, and is well positioned to provide insights on the firm's strategies relating to diversity, recruiting and retention as well as reputational risk. Jan has over 20 years of senior executive experience in cybersecurity and information technology, including through her service as the former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Information Warfare and Director of Naval Intelligence. 
Letter from our Lead Director 
As you will see in our Proxy Statement, two of my fellow directors — Bill George and Jim Johnson — will be retiring from our Board in advance of the Annual Meeting in accordance with the retirement age policy set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. On behalf of you, the firm and our Board, I would also like to thank Bill and Jim for their outstanding commitment to our Board and our firm. Bill was integrally involved in the firm's Business Standards Committee review, and served as the founding chair of our Public Responsibilities Committee. As our former Compensation Committee Chair, Jim helped to evolve the firm's compensation structure and program. Both of their contributions to our Board and our firm have been immeasurable over their tenure, during which time they provided us with valuable insight, judgment and institutional knowledge across a wide range of topics. 
In connection with Bill's retirement, we are pleased that Ellen Kullman has agreed to join and chair our Public Responsibilities Committee. In this new role Ellen will draw upon her broad range of public company and other experiences, including her focus on sustainability efforts as the former Chair and CEO of DuPont and her commitment to diversity as a co-chair of Paradigm for Parity. During her tenure on our Board Ellen has displayed unwavering commitment to the oversight of reputational risk, and we look forward to her continued contributions in this new role. 
We regularly review our Board composition, and as we continue our active search for new directors, our focus is and will remain on ensuring that our Board has an appropriate mix and balance of skills and experiences to carry out its duties. 
In closing, I know many of you may have questions or concerns relating to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) matters. As Lead Director, I want to assure you that the Board has been, and will continue to be, focused on these matters. We take seriously our oversight of the firm's business standards and reputation, and believe that it is critical that the firm and its people continue to hold themselves to the highest standards of integrity. 
As our 2019 Annual Meeting approaches, on behalf of our Board, I want to thank you for your ongoing support of both our Board and the firm. As your Lead Director I had another active year of engagement. In addition to our regular Board and committee meetings, in 2018 I had over 70 meetings, calls and engagements with the firm and its people, our shareholders, regulators and other constituents, including meetings with shareholders representing approximately 30% of our shareholder base. This engagement is invaluable to me and informs the work of our entire Board. I look forward to continuing our dialogue in the year to come.

1   To improve comparability across periods, both 2017 and 2018 ROE and EPS are shown here excluding one-time impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Legislation). During 2017 the firm recorded a $4.4 billion one-time income tax expense, based on our best estimate  of the expected size of a one-time deemed repatriation tax on foreign earnings and re-measurement of our deferred tax assets. This charge reduced 2017 ROE by 590 basis  points and 2017 EPS by $10.75. During 2018, the firm finalized this estimate using updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, resulting in a $487 million income tax benefit, which increased  2018 ROE by 60 basis points and 2018 EPS by $1.25. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures with the corresponding GAAP measures, please see Annex A.

∎    As more fully described in our Form 10-K filed February 26, 2019, the firm is  cooperating with the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and with other governmental and regulatory investigations relating to certain bond transactions the firm arranged for 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in 2012 and 2013. The DOJ has  made public documents that allege, among other things, that certain individuals, including two former non-executive employees and an unnamed non-executive employee co-conspirator who has been put on administrative leave, participated in a conspiracy to misappropriate proceeds of the 1MDB offerings for themselves and others and to pay bribes to various government officials to  obtain and retain 1MDB business for the firm. The firm has also been named in certain related civil proceedings, including a shareholder derivative suit filed in February 2019 against the individuals who were members of our Board as of 2018 year-end  alleging, among other things, breaches of fiduciary duties, including in connection with alleged insider trading, and violations of securities laws, including relating to the firms stock repurchases and solicitation of proxies. In March 2019,  the firm also received a demand from an alleged shareholder to investigate and bring claims against the current members of our Board, several current executive officers and a former executive officer and director based on their oversight and public  disclosures regarding 1MDB and related internal controls. In addition, on December 17, 2018, the Attorney General of Malaysia issued a press statement that criminal charges in Malaysia had been filed against certain of the firms non-U.S. subsidiaries (as well as certain individuals, including a former non-executive employee of the firm).

∎    In light of the ongoing 1MDB investigation, our Board and Compensation Committee made two important compensation-related  decisions in January 2019:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    First, they approved a new forfeiture provision in the 2018 year-end equity-based  awards granted to our NEOs that provides our Board with the flexibility to reduce the size of the award granted to any NEO prior to payment and/or forfeit the underlying delivered Shares at Risk if it is later determined that the results of the 1MDB  investigation would have impacted 2018 year-end compensation decisions for any such NEO; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Second, they deferred their decision under the LTIP awards originally granted in 2011 to Mr. Blankfein and two other  retired executives who hold such awards until more information is available, given that the 1MDB investigation relates to events that occurred during the performance period of these awards. As a result, no amounts under these LTIP awards have yet  been determined or paid. The Board will publicly disclose when a final determination is made.

Both Dr. Faust and Vice Admiral Tighe bring to the Board and its Committees significant experience as described in their respective biographies below, and we look forward to their continued contributions. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director will typically retire at the annual meeting following his or her 75th birthday. In accordance with this policy, William George and James Johnson will not be standing for re-election and will be retiring from our Board on the eve of our 2019 Annual Meeting. We are grateful to Mr. George and Mr. Johnson for providing our Board with their informed counsel and judgment for many years. Effective May 2, 2019, Ellen Kullman will succeed Mr. George as the Chair of our Public Responsibilities Committee, drawing upon her background as the former CEO of DuPont, her public company board service and her other professional experience as described in her biography below. 
In connection with the firm's recent executive leadership transition, Mr. Solomon joined our Board on October 1, 2018 and became Chairman of the Board on January 1, 2019. Mr. Blankfein retired from our Board on December 31, 2018.

For example, in addition to our policies on director independence and related person transactions, we maintain a policy with respect to outside director involvement with financial firms, such as private equity firms or hedge funds. Under this policy, in determining whether to approve any current or proposed affiliation of a non-employee director with a financial firm, our Board will consider, among other things, the legal, reputational, operational and business issues presented, and the nature, feasibility and scope of any restrictions, procedures or other steps that would be necessary or appropriate to ameliorate any perceived or potential future conflicts or other issues.

   Our Governance Committee considers a number of demographics and other factors, including race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, culture, nationality and work experiences (including military service), seeking to  develop a board that, as a whole, reflects diverse viewpoints, backgrounds, skills, experiences and expertise.   Among the factors our Governance Committee considers in identifying and evaluating a potential director candidate is the extent to which the candidate would add to the  diversity of our Board. The Committee considers the same factors in determining whether to re-nominate an incumbent director. In that connection, and using the self-identified characteristics of our directors,  our nominees include four directors who are women, one director who is Black, one director who is of Indian descent, one director with career service in the military and three directors who are non-U.S. or  dual citizens.   Diversity is also considered as part of the annual Board evaluation.

Process for Independence Assessment 
A director is considered independent under NYSE rules if our Board determines that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with Goldman Sachs. Our Board has established a Policy Regarding Director Independence (Director Independence Policy) that provides standards to assist our Board in determining which relationships and transactions might constitute a material relationship that would cause a director not to be independent. 
To assess independence, our Governance Committee and our Board review detailed information regarding our independent directors, including employment and public company and not-for-profit directorships, as well as information regarding immediate family members and affiliated entities. 
Through the course of this review, our Governance Committee and our Board consider relationships between the independent directors (and their immediate family members and affiliated entities) on the one hand, and Goldman Sachs and its affiliates on the other, in accordance with our Director Independence Policy. This includes a review of revenues to the firm from, and payments or donations made by us to, relevant entities affiliated with our directors (or their immediate family members) as a result of ordinary course transactions or contributions to not-for-profit organizations. 
For more information on the categories of transactions that our Governance Committee and our Board reviewed, considered and determined to be immaterial under our Director Independence Policy, see Annex B—Additional Details on Director Independence.

[END TABLE]
Board and Committee evaluations play a critical role in ensuring the effective functioning of our Board. It is important to take stock of Board, Committee and director performance and to solicit and act upon feedback received from each member of our Board.

Current Board Leadership Structure 
We review Board leadership structure annually. Conducting regular assessments allows our Board to discuss and debate whether the most efficient and appropriate leadership structure is in place to meet the needs of our Board and our firm, which may evolve over time. We are committed to independent leadership on our Board. If at any time the Chairman is not an independent director, our independent directors will appoint an independent Lead Director. 
Strong Independent Lead Director — Combined Chairman-CEO: Why our Structure is Effective 
In 2018, in connection with Mr. Blankfein's retirement and Mr. Solomon's assumption of the CEO role, our Governance Committee conducted a thorough review of our Board's leadership structure. The review considered a variety of factors, including our governance practices and shareholder feedback on our Board and its leadership structure, as described on the following page. 
As a result of this review, our Governance Committee determined that after a transition period having Mr. Solomon serve as both Chairman and CEO — working together with a strong independent Lead Director — is the most effective leadership structure for our Board and our firm at this time. 
Ultimately, we believe that our current leadership structure, together with strong governance practices, creates a productive relationship between our Board and management, including strong independent oversight that benefits our shareholders. 
We will continue to conduct Board leadership assessments annually. If at any time our Governance Committee determines it would be appropriate to appoint an independent Chairman, it will not hesitate to do so.

Identifying and recommending individuals for nomination, election or re-election to our Board is a principal responsibility of our Governance Committee. The Committee carries out this function through an ongoing, year-round process, which includes the Committee's annual evaluation of our Board and individual director evaluations. Each director and director candidate is evaluated by our Governance Committee based on his or her individual merits, taking into account our firm's needs and the composition of our Board. 
To assist in this evaluation, the Committee utilizes as a discussion tool a matrix of certain skills and experiences that would be beneficial to have represented on our Board and on our Committees at any particular point in time. For example, the Committee is focused on what skills are beneficial for service in key Board positions, such as Lead Director and Committee Chairs, and conducts a succession planning process for those positions. 
Our Governance Committee welcomes candidates recommended by shareholders and will consider these candidates in the same manner as other candidates. Shareholders wishing to submit potential director candidates for consideration by our Governance Committee should follow the instructions in Frequently Asked Questions.

[END TABLE]
Director education about our firm and our industry is an ongoing process, which begins when a director joins our Board. 
Upon joining our Board, new directors are provided with a comprehensive orientation about our firm, including our business, strategy and governance. For example, new directors typically meet with senior leaders covering each of our revenue-producing divisions and regions, as well as with senior leaders from key control-side functions. 
New directors will also undergo in-depth training on the work of each of our Board's Committees, such as Audit and Risk Committee orientation sessions with our CFO, Controller, Treasurer and CRO, as well as a session with the Director of Internal Audit. Additional training is also provided when a director assumes a leadership role, such as becoming a Committee Chair. 
Board and Committee presentations, roundtables, regular communications and firm and other industry events help to keep directors appropriately apprised of key developments in our businesses and in our industry, including material changes in regulation, so that they can carry out their oversight responsibilities.

(a)  Salaries for Messrs. Solomon, Waldron, Scherr and O'Neill were increased at the time of their  respective changes in role/title. The number of PSUs or RSUs awarded as part of our NEOs' 2018 annual compensation was determined by reference to the closing price of our Common Stock on the grant date ($199.09 on January 17, 2019). This  resulted in grants as follows: Mr. Solomon – 77,413 PSUs; Mr. Waldron – 58,265 PSUs; Mr. Scherr – 52,033 PSUs; Mr. Chavez – 53,268 RSUs; Mr. Gnodde – 15,094 RSUs (in respect of his fixed allowance) and  48,863 RSUs (in respect of his variable compensation); Mr. O'Neill – 55,101 RSUs; and Mr. Blankfein – 71,551 RSUs. (For additional information regarding Mr. Gnodde's grant, see footnote (c).)

(c)  For each of 2018 and 2017, Mr. Gnodde, who is based in the U.K., received a cash salary of  $1.85 million and a fixed allowance of $8.15 million, payable approximately 37% in equity-based awards, with the remainder in cash. Mr. Gnodde received a higher level of fixed compensation than our U.S.-based NEOs as a result of  applicable U.K. regulations. See page 49 for more details. Generally, RSUs awarded to our employees include a right to receive dividend equivalent payments. However, under applicable U.K. regulations, RSUs granted to Mr. Gnodde and certain  other U.K. employees in respect of their variable compensation for 2018 and 2017 cannot include this right and therefore do not have the same value as awards granted to our other employees. To make up for this relative loss in value, affected U.K.  employees receive additional RSUs (Additional RSUs). In this regard, for 2018 Mr. Gnodde received 3,657 Additional RSUs (which are reflected in the amounts described in footnote (a)). See page 51 for more detail regarding the terms of these  Additional RSUs.

HOW OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MADE ITS DECISIONS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ∎  Our  Compensation Committee made its annual compensation determinations for our NEOs in the context of our Compensation Principles, which encompass a pay for performance philosophy, and after consideration of a number of other factors, including  stakeholder feedback (see pages 46-48 for more detail).   ∎  The Committee believed it was appropriate  to reward our Executive Leadership Team and other NEOs for the firms strong improvement in operating performance in 2018 as well as their outstanding individual performance.   »  The  Committee considered firmwide performance in a holistic manner without ascribing specific weight to any single financial metric, and considered a number of factors, including ROE, BVPS, EPS, net revenues and  pre-tax earnings in making compensation determinations (including, where appropriate, adjusted to reflect the impact of U.S. Tax Legislation).   »  In  particular, the Committee focused on the firms ROE (on an absolute and relative basis), BVPS growth and EPS growth in assessing firmwide performance.   »  In addition, the Committee considered the firms year-over-year growth in  net revenues and pre-tax earnings as indicators of managements ability to grow the firms business in a cost-effective manner.   ∎  Given that many of our NEOs served in more  than one role during 2018, the Committee took into account a number of factors in determining their 2018 compensation, including their responsibilities, length of service in their prior and new roles, historical compensation, both for these  individuals and with respect to these roles, and an analysis of prior year peer compensation.   »  Thus, the 2018 compensation amounts awarded to the members of our Executive  Leadership Team are below the 2017 levels for the individuals who had previously served in those roles, mainly because the Executive Leadership Team did not serve in their new roles for the entire year.   ∎  Given that the NEOs role changes  occurred during 2018, the Committee also determined it was appropriate to adjust the percentage of year-end variable compensation paid in the form of equity-based awards up or down from their 2017 levels,  taking into account the amount of time each executive spent in his prior role vs. his new role (e.g., 73% for Mr. Solomon on a pro rata basis given he served as our CEO for one-quarter of 2018).

Our Compensation Committee continues to believe that, in order to achieve our overarching goal of enhancing shareholder value while promoting the safety and soundness of our firm, it is important to retain discretion to determine compensation forms and amounts for our senior executives, while tying compensation to ongoing performance metrics where appropriate. Our business is dynamic and requires us to respond rapidly to changes in our operating environment. A rigid, formulaic program based solely on metrics without the use of discretion could hinder our ability to do so. Equity-based awards comprise a significant portion of annual variable compensation for our NEOs and help to ensure long-term alignment without the disadvantages of purely formulaic compensation. 
Our Compensation Committee has responded to stakeholder feedback by changing our executive compensation program over time, which has helped to ensure that our program continues to be appropriately aligned with our Compensation Principles and shareholder expectations. 
Our Compensation Principles 
Our Compensation Principles guide our Compensation Committee in its review of compensation at our firm, including the Committee's determination of NEO compensation. The full text of our Compensation Principles is available on our public website at www.gs.com/corpgov. Key elements of our Compensation Principles include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   PAYING FOR  PERFORMANCE         ENCOURAGING FIRMWIDE ORIENTATION &  CULTURE           DISCOURAGING  IMPRUDENT RISK-TAKING           ATTRACTING & RETAINING TALENT

   Firmwide compensation should directly  relate to firmwide performance over the cycle.         Employees should think and act like long-term shareholders, and  compensation should reflect the performance of the firm as a whole.         Compensation should be carefully designed to be consistent with  the safety and soundness of our firm. Risk profiles must be taken into account in annual performance reviews, and factors like liquidity risk and cost of capital should also be considered.           Compensation should reward an employee's ability to  identify and create value, but the recognition of individual performance should be considered in the context of the competitive market for talent.

In addition to our Compensation Principles, our Compensation Committee is guided by our Compensation Framework, which more broadly governs the variable compensation process for employees who could expose the firm to material amounts of risk (such as our NEOs). The Committee considered the following factors in determining the amount and form of compensation to be awarded to each of our NEOs (firmwide performance and individual performance are discussed above on pages 40-44): 
Stakeholder Feedback 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In making NEO compensation decisions, our Compensation Committee reviews and carefully considers:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Specific feedback received from shareholders and other constituents; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    The results of our Say on Pay votes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our 2018 Say on Pay vote received the support of approximately 88% of our shareholders. While our Compensation Committee  viewed this outcome positively, it also believed it was critical that it continue to engage with our shareholders regarding our compensation program. This engagement ultimately resulted in several changes to the program for 2018 (see page 38).

CRO Input & Risk Management 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Effective risk management underpins everything that we do, and our compensation programs are carefully designed to be  consistent with the safety and soundness of our firm.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our CRO presented his annual risk assessment jointly to our Compensation Committee and our Risk Committee in order to  assist with the evaluation of our programs design.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    This assessment is focused on whether our program is consistent with regulatory guidance providing that financial services  firms should ensure that variable compensation does not encourage imprudent risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Our CRO's view was that the various components of our compensation programs and policies work together to balance risk  and reward in a manner that does not encourage imprudent risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
Market for Talent 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our Compensation Committee reviews the competitive market for talent as part of its review of our compensation  programs effectiveness in attracting and retaining talent, and to help determine our NEOs compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Our goal is always to be in a position to appoint people from within the firm to our most senior leadership positions and  our executive compensation program is intended to incentivize our people to stay at Goldman Sachs and to aspire to these senior roles.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Committee conducts an evaluation of our existing NEO compensation program, comparing it to those of our U.S. Peers and  European Peers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Committee performs this evaluation with information and assistance from our Global Head of Human Capital Management  (HCM). The evaluation is based on compensation information (including plan design and compensation levels for named executive officers at peer firms) and financial performance of our peers obtained from an analysis of public filings by our Finance  and HCM Divisions, as well as surveys regarding incentive compensation practices conducted by Willis Towers Watson.  
[END TABLE]
Regulatory Considerations 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our Compensation Committee also considers regulatory matters and the views of our regulators when determining NEO  compensation. Throughout 2018, our senior management briefed the Committee on relevant regulatory developments.  
[END TABLE]
Independent Compensation Consultant Input 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our Compensation Committee recognizes the importance of using an independent compensation consulting firm that is  appropriately qualified and that provides services solely to the Committee and not to our firm. Accordingly, the Committee again retained Semler Brossy as its independent compensation consultant in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Committee uses Semler Brossy because of the quality of its advice as well as its:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Extensive experience working with a broad cross-section of companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Multi-faceted business perspective; and

Fixed Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Fixed compensation provides our NEOs with a predictable level of income that is competitive with our peers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    We made no changes to NEO base salary levels ($2.0 million for our CEO and $1.85 million for our other NEOs, in  each case on an annual basis), and our Compensation Committee believes that these salary levels are competitive in the market for talent. Salaries for Messrs. Solomon, Waldron, Scherr and ONeill were increased at the time of their changes in  role/title.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The requirements of the European Unions Fourth Capital Requirements Directive limit the amount of variable  compensation that is permitted to be granted to certain U.K. employees by reference to their fixed compensation. In this regard, Mr. Gnodde received a fixed allowance of $8.15 million for 2018, in addition to his base salary.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    In order to generally align the equity component of Mr. Gnodde's overall 2018 compensation with that of the other  NEOs, this fixed allowance was paid approximately 37% in RSUs, with the remainder paid in cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    The fixed allowance RSUs will deliver as Shares at Risk in three approximately equal installments in each of 2020, 2021 and  2022. Substantially all of the Shares at Risk delivered to Mr. Gnodde (after applicable tax withholding) will be restricted from sale until January 2024. However, as required by regulatory guidance, these fixed allowance RSUs are not subject to  the clawback and forfeiture provisions that apply to year-end RSUs (e.g., cause and/or non-compete/non-solicit provisions).   
[END TABLE]
Annual Variable Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Variable compensation provides our NEOs with the opportunity to realize cash and equity-based incentives that are aligned  with firmwide and individual performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In 2018, we paid annual variable compensation to our NEOs in the form of cash and PSUs or RSUs. Certain material terms of  each of the equity-based components are summarized below. Additional detail regarding other material terms is provided as follows:

      ∎  Provide recipient with annual variable compensation that has a metrics-based outcome; the ultimate value paid to the NEO is tied to firm  performance both through stock price and metrics-based structure (ROE is used given it is a risk-based metric that is an important indicator of the firms operating performance and is viewed by many shareholders as a key performance  metric).   ∎  PSUs will be paid at 0-150% of the initial award based on our average ROE over 20192021,  using both absolute and relative metrics; see chart on page 39 for more detail on calculation methodology and enhancements made to metrics.   ∎  Awards  will be settled in 2022, with 50% settled in cash based on the average closing price of our Common Stock over a ten-trading-day period, and 50% settled in Shares at Risk  (i.e., shares (after applicable tax withholding) that are subject to transfer restrictions through January 2024, five years after the PSU grant date).   »  Transfer restrictions generally prohibit the  sale, transfer, hedging or pledging of underlying Shares at Risk, even if the NEO leaves our firm (subject to limited exceptions; see pages 65-68 for more detail).   ∎  Average  ROE is the average of the annual ROE for each year during the performance period.   »  Annual ROE for the firm is calculated as  annualized net earnings applicable to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity, as publicly reported by Goldman Sachs in its annual report.   »  For purposes of determining ROE of our peers  with respect to the PSUs relative metrics, annual ROE is as reported in the peer companys publicly disclosed annual report, rounded to one decimal place.   »  If a peer companys ROE is not reported  in this form, its ROE will be its annualized net earnings applicable to common shareholders divided by average common shareholders equity and will be calculated using available publicly disclosed information.   ∎  If the  Committee determines it is necessary or appropriate to maintain the intended economics of PSUs, it may make adjustments, including to the firms or a peer companys ROE as it deems equitable in light of changed circumstances (e.g., unusual  or non-recurring events), resulting from changes in accounting methods, practices or policies, changes in capital structure, a material change in the firms or a peer companys revenue mix or  business activities or such other changed circumstances as the Committee may deem appropriate; any adjustments to the firms or a peer companys ROE for purposes of the relative ROE calculation will be based on publicly disclosed financial  information.   ∎  The Committee may adjust the applicable peer group in certain specified circumstances (e.g., a merger or a material change in a peer  companys revenue mix or business activities).   ∎  Each PSU includes a cumulative dividend equivalent right payable only if and when that PSU settles.   ∎  PSUs have  no additional service-based vesting requirement; however, they (and underlying Shares at Risk) provide for forfeiture or recapture in a number of situations.

Determinations Regarding LTIP Awards and Certain Outstanding PSUs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our outstanding LTIP awards, first granted in 2011, have eight-year performance periods.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Compensation Committee discontinued granting the awards in 2016.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    As described in our Proxy Statement for our 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Mr. Blankfein was granted an LTIP  award in January 2011 (2011 LTIP Award). The 2011 LTIP Award had a performance period from January 2011 through December 2018. The ongoing governmental, regulatory and civil proceedings relating to 1MDB relate to events that occurred during this  performance period, and the Compensation Committee concluded that it was appropriate to defer its decision under the awards until more information is available. As a result, no amounts under the 2011 LTIP Award have yet been determined or paid. The  Board will publicly disclose when a final determination is made.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Although no amounts are earned by or paid to the recipient under the LTIP awards until the end of the applicable  performance period (and, in the case of the 2011 LTIP Award, until individual performance is assessed for that period), the notional values of these awards are adjusted upward or downward for each year of the performance period by an amount equal to  our annual ROE, subject (in the case of all LTIP awards other than the 2011 LTIP Award) to an annual 12% cap (for example, the average increase in value in 2018 for the outstanding LTIP awards granted to Mr. Blankfein was  approximately 12.3%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    For this purpose, as well as under the PSUs granted for services in 2015 (2015  Year-End PSUs), "ROE" is calculated for each year by dividing net earnings applicable to common shareholders by average monthly common shareholders' equity, adjusted for the after-tax effects of amounts that would be excluded from "Pre-Tax Earnings" under The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Restricted Partner Compensation Plan (RPCP).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    The types of amounts that could be excluded from "Pre-Tax Earnings"  include, but are not limited to, amounts related to: exit or disposal activities, impairment or disposal of long-lived assets or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, net provisions for litigation and other regulatory proceedings and  items that are unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence and that are separately disclosed, in each case if the aggregate net effect of such amounts on Pre-Tax Earnings exceeds a pre-established threshold (for relevant RPCP provisions, see page 3 of Exhibit 10.1 of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended February 24, 2006,  filed April 5, 2006).

Adjustments to Certain Outstanding PSUs and LTIP Awards 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The outstanding PSUs and LTIP awards contemplate that the Committee shall, in order to maintain the intended economics of  the awards, make certain adjustments to the calculation of ROE and, in the case of the LTIP awards, changes in BVPS for events such as legal, regulatory and/or accounting changes, or other actions that impact capital.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    As contemplated in our Proxy Statement for our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Committee considered the impact of  U.S. Tax Legislation on the economics of the outstanding PSUs and LTIP awards for the remainder of these awards performance periods, consistent with their terms, and accordingly made the changes described below.  
[END TABLE]
2015 Year-End PSUs and Outstanding LTIP Awards 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Committee determined it was appropriate to adjust the calculation of 2018 ROE and 2018 BVPS in order to  lower the performance calculations under the award due to a true-up in the firms original estimate for the impact of the changes that resulted from U.S. Tax Legislation. This change resulted in a  decrease to ROE of approximately 65 basis points and a decrease to the change in BVPS of approximately 70 basis points (with the latter change applicable only to the LTIP awards).  
[END TABLE]
2017 Year-End PSUs 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    The Committee determined it was appropriate to increase the absolute ROE threshold for maximum payout for the 2017 Year-End PSUs to 15% (from 14%) in light of the impact of U.S. Tax Legislation on the firm and the industry more broadly and other factors, in order to maintain the intended economics of the award.

Stock Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In January 2015 our Board adopted Stock Ownership Guidelines to supplement the longstanding retention requirements applied  through our Shareholders Agreement (described below). These guidelines provide that:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Our CEO must retain beneficial ownership of a number of shares of Common Stock equal in value to 10x his base salary for so  long as he remains our CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Each of our COO and CFO must retain beneficial ownership of a number of shares of Common Stock equal in value to 6x his  base salary for so long as he remains in such a position at the firm.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Transition rules apply in the event that an individual becomes newly appointed to a position subject to these guidelines.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Each member of our Executive Leadership Team met these Stock Ownership Guidelines in 2018.

Recapture Provisions 
We have a longstanding practice of including robust recapture provisions in our incentive compensation awards. In addition, we added a new recapture provision to our NEOs' 2018 year-end equity-based awards relating to the 1MDB investigation. The chart below summarizes our conduct-related recapture rights, which in many cases include both forfeiture and repayment rights (collectively, "Recapture"):

Hedging Policy; Pledging of Common Stock 
Our NEOs are prohibited from hedging any shares of our Common Stock, even shares they can freely sell, for so long as they remain executive officers. In addition, our NEOs and all other employees are prohibited from hedging their equity-based awards. Our employees, other than our executive officers, may hedge only shares of our Common Stock that they can otherwise sell. However, they may not enter into uncovered hedging transactions and may not "short" shares of our Common Stock. Employees also may not act on investment decisions with respect to our Common Stock, except during applicable "window periods." None of our executive officers has any shares of Common Stock subject to a pledge. 
Qualified Retirement Benefits 
During 2018, each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Gnodde) participated in The Goldman Sachs 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan), which is our U.S. broad-based tax-qualified retirement plan. In 2018 these individuals were eligible to make pre-tax, and/or "Roth" after-tax contributions to our 401(k) Plan and receive a dollar-for-dollar matching contribution from us on the amount they contributed, up to a maximum of $11,000. For 2018, these individuals each received a matching contribution of $11,000. 
During 2018, Mr. Gnodde participated in a U.K. defined contribution arrangement known as LifeSight (the U.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement). Under the terms of the U.K. Defined Contribution Arrangement, eligible employees receive a firm contribution up to a capped percentage of salary (which, for 2018, equaled £13,365) and are also able to make their own contributions to the plan. For 2018, Mr. Gnodde received a firm contribution of £13,365. 
Perquisites and Other Benefits 
Our NEOs received in 2018 certain benefits that are considered "perquisites" for purposes of the SEC rules regarding compensation disclosure. While our Compensation Committee was provided with the estimated value of these items, it determined, as in prior years, not to give these amounts significant consideration in determining our NEOs' 2018 variable compensation. 
Compensation Matters | Compensation Discussion and Analysis   
During 2018, we made available to our NEOs (other than Messrs. Gnodde and O'Neill) a car and driver and, in some cases, other services for security and/or business purposes. Car and driver services were contracted through a third party for Messrs. Waldron and Scherr. We also offered our NEOs benefits and tax counseling services, generally provided or arranged by our subsidiary, The Ayco Company, L.P. (Ayco), to assist them with tax and regulatory compliance and to provide them with more time to focus on the needs of our business. 
Our NEOs participate in our executive medical and dental program and receive executive life insurance while they remain PMDs. Our NEOs also receive long-term disability insurance coverage. Our NEOs (and their covered dependents) are also eligible for a retiree healthcare program and receive certain other perquisites, some of which have no incremental cost to us. See "All Other Compensation" and footnote (b) in —Executive Compensation—2018 Summary Compensation Table. 
Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limits our annual corporate tax deduction for compensation paid to each of our "covered employees" to $1 million. Under Section 162(m) as in effect prior to 2018, our "covered employees" for a year were our CEO and our next three most highly compensated executive officers (other than our CFO) on the last day of that year, and compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) did not count against the $1 million deduction limit. Moreover, because "covered employee" status prior to 2018 was determined on a discrete annual basis, compensation paid to a person after the person ceased to be a "covered employee" (e.g., because the person left the firm or changed roles before the end of the year) was not subject to the $1 million deduction limit. Amounts awarded pursuant to our RPCP, our shareholder-approved plan under which we historically awarded variable compensation to Management Committee members (including our NEOs), were intended to constitute qualified "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m). 
U.S. Tax Legislation modified Section 162(m) to, among other things, eliminate the exclusion for qualified "performance-based compensation" and broaden the group of people who are considered "covered employees." Beginning in 2018, "covered employees" include anyone who served as CEO or CFO during any part of a year and the next three most highly compensated NEOs for that year. In addition, once a person is considered a "covered employee," that person remains a covered employee in all subsequent years (including after the person leaves the firm or changes roles). As a result of the changes to Section 162(m), beginning in 2018 generally we will not be entitled to a U.S. tax deduction for compensation paid in any year to our NEOs and our other "covered employees" in excess of $1 million. We may be able to deduct in 2018 or thereafter certain compensation paid to our "covered employees" to the extent it is eligible for transition relief under U.S. Tax Legislation and any rules promulgated thereunder. However, there is no guarantee that such compensation will be deductible, and the firm may determine that certain compensation cannot qualify for such transition relief or that it does not wish to take or refrain from taking steps necessary to qualify for such relief. 
Because U.S. Tax Legislation eliminated the benefit of determining variable compensation under the RPCP, for 2018 Management Committee members (including our NEOs) did not participate in the RPCP, but instead participated in The Goldman Sachs Partner Compensation Plan (PCP), the plan under which we determine variable compensation for all of our other PMDs.

On December 19, 2018, our Board approved a letter agreement between the firm and Mr. Blankfein in connection with Mr. Blankfein's previously announced retirement and transition to Senior Chairman. This agreement provided that Mr. Blankfein would become Senior Chairman of the firm as of January 1, 2019. In this capacity, he serves as a resource for both our Board and management, which may include providing advice, client outreach, performing speaking engagements on behalf of the firm, office visits and other mutually agreed activities as appropriate. 
Under the agreement, while Mr. Blankfein serves as Senior Chairman, he continues to receive benefits generally provided to PMDs. Mr. Blankfein is not an employee and does not receive any salary or incentive compensation. Additionally, our Board has determined that it is appropriate for security reasons for the firm to provide Mr. Blankfein with a car and security driver through December 31, 2019 for business use.

As a key element of the firm's overall impact investing platform, we established our GS Gives program to coordinate, facilitate and encourage global philanthropy by our PMDs. The firm contributed approximately $130 million for the 2018 GS Gives program, with PMD compensation being reduced to fund this contribution. 
GS Gives underscores our commitment to philanthropy through diversified and impactful giving, harnessing the collaborative spirit of the firm's partnership, while also inspiring our firm's next generation of philanthropists. We ask our PMDs to make recommendations of not-for-profit organizations to receive grants from the firm's contributions to GS Gives. 
Grant recommendations from our PMDs help to ensure that GS Gives invests in a diverse group of charities that improve the lives of people in communities where we work and live. We encourage our PMDs to make recommendations of grants to organizations consistent with GS Gives' mission of fostering innovative ideas, solving economic and social issues, and enabling progress in underserved communities globally. GS Gives undertakes diligence procedures for donations and has no obligation to follow recommendations made to us by our PMDs. 
In 2018, GS Gives accepted the recommendations of over 550 current and retired PMDs and granted over $154 million to over 2,300 not-for-profit organizations around the world. GS Gives made grants in support of a broad range of large-scale initiatives, including ongoing need-based financial aid at colleges and universities globally; the third-annual Analyst Impact Fund competition, a Partnership Committee-led initiative in which teams of analysts in all regions enter to win a GS Gives grant recommendation for charities of their choosing, with 2018's winning teams addressing global homelessness, human trafficking, disease eradication in rural communities and access to clean water; cutting-edge cancer care in London; and innovative educational efforts across Japan. The U.S. Dollar equivalent amounts donated in 2018 by GS Gives based on the following individuals' recommendations were: Mr. Solomon—$2.0 million; Mr. Waldron—$1.7 million; Mr. Scherr—$1.6 million; Mr. Chavez—$1.8 million; Mr. Gnodde—$2.0 million; Mr. O'Neill—$2.1 million; and Mr. Blankfein—$3.7 million.

Executive Compensation 
The 2018 Summary Compensation Table below sets forth compensation information relating to 2018, 2017 and 2016. In accordance with SEC rules, compensation information for each NEO is only reported beginning with the year that such executive became an NEO. For a discussion of 2018 NEO compensation, please read —Compensation Discussion and Analysis above. 
Pursuant to SEC rules, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table is required to include for a particular year only those equity-based awards granted during that year, rather than awards granted after year-end, even if awarded for services in that year. SEC rules require disclosure of cash compensation to be included in the year earned, even if payment is made after year-end. 
Generally, we grant equity-based awards and pay any cash variable compensation (as well as fixed allowances) for a particular year shortly after that year's end. As a result, annual equity-based awards, cash variable compensation and Mr. Gnodde's fixed allowance are disclosed in each row of the table as follows:  
[BEGIN TABLE]

*  Amounts reflect the incremental cost to us of benefits and tax counseling services provided by Ayco  or by another third-party provider. For services provided by Ayco, cost is determined based on the number of hours of service provided by, and compensation paid to, individual service providers. For services provided by others, amounts are payments  made by us to those providers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
**  Amounts reflect the incremental cost to us attributable to commuting and other non-business use. We made available to each of our NEOs (other than Messrs. Gnodde and O'Neill) in 2018 a car and driver for security and business purposes. Car and driver services were contracted through a  third party for Messrs. Waldron and Scherr. The cost of providing a car is determined on an annual basis and includes, as applicable, driver compensation, annual car lease, car service fees and insurance cost, as well as miscellaneous expenses (for  example, fuel and car maintenance).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
***  Certain of the amounts for Mr. Gnodde have been converted from British Pounds Sterling into  U.S. Dollars at a rate of 1.3333 Dollars per Pound, which was the average daily rate in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Also included in the "All Other Compensation" column are amounts reflecting the incremental cost to us of providing our identity theft safeguards program for U.S. PMDs, assistance with certain travel arrangements, in-office meals and security services. We provide security (the incremental cost of which was $114,491 for Mr. Blankfein) for the benefit of our firm and our shareholders. We do not consider these security measures to be personal benefits but rather business-related necessities due to the high-profile standing of our NEOs. 
We provide our NEOs, on the same terms as are provided to other PMDs and at no incremental out-of-pocket cost to our firm, waived or reduced fees and overrides in connection with investments in certain funds and other accounts managed or sponsored by Goldman Sachs, unused tickets to certain events and certain negotiated discounts with third-party vendors. 
We make available to our NEOs private aircraft from third-party vendors. Our policy is to limit personal use of such aircraft by our NEOs and to require reimbursement by the NEO for all costs associated with such use. For example, in situations where an NEO brings a personal guest as a passenger on a business-related flight, the NEO pays us an amount equal to the greater of: (a) the aggregate incremental cost to us of the usage by the guest and (b) the price of a first-class commercial airline ticket for the same trip.

(c)  Amounts included represent the grant date fair value in accordance with ASC 718. Grant date fair  value was determined by multiplying the target number of PSUs, number of shares of restricted stock or aggregate number of RSUs, as applicable, by $250.97, the closing price per share of Common Stock on the NYSE on the grant date. For the portion of  the 2017 Year-End PSUs granted to Messrs. Solomon, Chavez and Blankfein that are stock-settled, the value includes an approximately 9% liquidity discount to reflect the transfer restrictions on the Common  Stock underlying these PSUs. For 2017 Year-End Restricted Stock granted to Messrs. Waldron, Scherr and O'Neill, the value includes an approximately 17% liquidity discount to reflect the transfer  restrictions on these shares. For 2017 Fixed Allowance RSUs granted to Mr. Gnodde, the value includes an approximately 13% liquidity discount to reflect the transfer restrictions on the Common Stock underlying these RSUs. For 2017 Year-End RSUs granted to Mr. Gnodde other than the 2017 Fixed Allowance RSUs, the value includes an approximately 12% discount to reflect both the transfer restrictions on the Common Stock underlying these RSUs  and the lack of dividend equivalent payment rights in respect of such RSUs (see page 36 for more details).

(b)  For Messrs. Waldron, Scherr and O'Neill, consists of 2017  Year-End Restricted Stock which was vested upon grant. For Mr. Gnodde, consists of shares of Common Stock underlying 2017 Year-End RSUs, all of which were vested  upon grant. With respect to the 2017 Year-End RSUs granted to Mr. Gnodde, one-fifth of these shares is deliverable on or about each of the third through seventh  anniversaries of grant. Substantially all of the shares of 2017 Year-End Restricted Stock and shares of Common Stock underlying the 2017 Year-End RSUs that are delivered  to our NEOs are subject to transfer restrictions until January 2023; for Mr. Gnodde, shares delivered on or after the fifth anniversary of grant will be subject to transfer restrictions for one year following delivery due to applicable U.K.  regulatory requirements, other than the shares underlying his Additional RSUs which will only be subject to transfer restrictions for one year following delivery. For Mr. Blankfein, this column includes the shares of Common Stock underlying his  2015 Year-End PSUs that were settled in cash on February 5, 2019 following the end of the applicable performance period on December 31, 2018. The final amounts payable under these PSUs were  calculated based on the firm's average annual "ROE" over the applicable performance period (see —Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Overview of Compensation Elements—Annual Variable Compensation in our Proxy  Statement for our 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders for more detail on this calculation). The initial number of PSUs granted to Mr. Blankfein was 48,467 and the average "ROE" over the performance period was 11.0%, resulting in a  100.5% multiplier. The final amount of PSUs Mr. Blankfein earned was 48,689.

(c)  With respect to 2017 Year-End Restricted Stock and 2017 Year-End RSUs, values were determined by multiplying the aggregate number of shares or RSUs by $250.97, the closing price per share of our Common Stock on the NYSE on January 18, 2018, the grant date. In  accordance with SEC rules the —2018 Summary Compensation Table and —2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards sections above include the grant date fair value of the 2017 Year-End Restricted Stock and 2017 Year-End RSUs calculated in accordance with ASC 718. With respect to Mr. Blankfein's 2015 Year-End PSUs, values were determined by multiplying the aggregate number  of PSUs earned by $199.55, the ten-day average closing price per share of our Common Stock on the NYSE on January 17–31, 2019. Mr. Blankfein also received $421,160 in respect of the accrued dividend  equivalents underlying these earned PSUs.

(a)  Our employees, including Messrs. Solomon, Waldron, Scherr, Gnodde, O'Neill and Blankfein, were  credited for service for each year employed by us while eligible to participate in our GS Pension Plan or GS U.K. Retirement Plan (as applicable).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  Represents the present value of the entire accumulated benefit and not the annual payment an NEO  would receive once his benefits commence. Prior to being frozen, our GS Pension Plan provided an annual benefit equal to between 1% and 2% of the first $75,000 of the participant's compensation for each year of credited service under our GS  Pension Plan. The normal form of payment is a single life annuity for single participants and an actuarially equivalent 50% joint and survivor annuity for married participants. The present values shown in this column were determined using the  following assumptions: payment of a single life annuity following retirement at either the normal retirement age (age 65) or immediately (if an NEO is over 65); a 4.56% discount rate; and mortality estimates based on the RP-2014 white collar fully generational mortality table, with adjustments to reflect continued improvements in mortality based on Scale MP-2018. Our GS Pension Plan provides  for early retirement benefits, and all of our participating NEOs are eligible to elect early retirement benefits upon reaching age 55.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Prior to being frozen, our GS U.K. Retirement Plan provided for an annual benefit equal to 1.25% of  the first £81,000 of the participant's compensation for each year of credited service. The normal form of payment is a single life annuity plus a contingent spouse's annuity equal to two-thirds  of the member's pension. The present value shown in this column reflects Mr. Gnodde's accrued benefits with an annual cost of living adjustment that is applied pursuant to the terms of the GS U.K. Retirement Plan and was determined  using the following assumptions: payment of a joint life annuity following retirement at normal retirement age 65; a 2.85% discount rate; and mortality estimates based on the S1 Light series fully generational mortality table, with adjustments to  reflect continued improvements in mortality. The GS U.K. Retirement Plan provides for early retirement benefits, and Mr. Gnodde is eligible to elect early retirement benefits.

NQDC Plan. Prior to December 2008 (when our NQDC Plan was frozen), each participant in our NQDC Plan was permitted to elect to defer up to $1 million of his or her year-end cash variable compensation for up to the later of (i) ten years or (ii) six months after termination of employment. Mr. Blankfein is the only NEO who participated in our NQDC Plan. Amounts deferred under our NQDC Plan are generally not forfeitable and were adjusted based on the performance of certain available "notional investments" selected by each participant. Distributions from our NQDC Plan to Mr. Blankfein will be made in a lump-sum cash payment. Mr. Blankfein is not subject to U.S. federal income tax on amounts that he deferred or on any "notional investment" earnings until those amounts are distributed to him, and we do not take a tax deduction on these amounts until they are distributed.

   With respect to our NQDC Plan, Mr. Blankfein's account balance was adjusted to reflect  gains (or losses) based on the performance of certain "notional investments" (selected by Mr. Blankfein from various hedge funds and mutual funds available under the plan in 2018) to the same extent as if he had actually invested in  those funds.

(c)  The Vested and Undelivered RSUs included in these amounts are 2017  Year-End RSUs, 2016 Year-End RSUs and 2015 Year-End RSUs. These stock awards were previously reported in the Summary Compensation  Table (to the extent that the NEO was a named executive officer in the applicable year of grant). Values for RSUs were determined by multiplying the number of RSUs by $167.05, the closing price per share of our Common Stock on the NYSE on  December 31, 2018 (the last trading day of the year).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(d)  This amount also reflects a deferral of compensation of $1,000,000 previously reported as bonus in  each of the fiscal 2005 and 2006 Summary Compensation Tables for Mr. Blankfein.

Our PCP, The Goldman Sachs Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (2018) and its predecessor plans, and our retiree healthcare program may provide for potential payments to our NEOs in conjunction with a termination of employment. The amounts potentially payable to our NEOs under our pension plans, vested RSUs and our NQDC Plan are set forth under the —2018 Pension Benefits and —2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation sections above. The terms of the outstanding PSUs and LTIP awards are not affected by a future termination of employment or change in control (absent circumstances constituting "cause" – e.g., any material violation of any firm policy or other conduct detrimental to our firm), except that, following a change in control, our Compensation Committee may not amend the terms of the LTIP awards with respect to an NEO without the NEO's consent. 
Each of our NEOs participated in our PCP in 2018. Under our PCP, if a participant's employment at Goldman Sachs terminates for any reason before the end of a "contract period" (generally a two-year period as defined in the PCP), our Compensation Committee has the discretion to determine what, if any, variable compensation will be provided to the participant for services provided in that year, subject to the formula in the PCP. There is no severance provided under our PCP. 
Set forth below is a calculation of the potential benefits to each of our NEOs (other than Mr. Blankfein) assuming a termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2018, in accordance with SEC rules. Details regarding Mr. Blankfein's retirement are provided separately below. The narrative disclosure that follows the table provides important information and definitions regarding specific payment terms and conditions.

For 2015, 2016 and 2017 Year-End RSUs, 2017 Year-End Restricted Stock and 2017 Year-End PSUs granted to our NEOs, if the firm is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to its material noncompliance, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws as described in Section 304(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley, the NEO's rights to the award will terminate and be subject to repayment to the same extent that would be required under Section 304 of Sarbanes-Oxley had the NEO been a "chief executive officer" or "chief financial officer" of the firm (regardless of whether the NEO actually held such position at the relevant time). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to regulatory guidance, Mr. Gnodde's fixed allowance RSUs are not subject to the clawback and forfeiture provisions that apply to year-end RSUs. See page 49 for more details. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(b)  In the event of an NEO's death, delivery of shares of Common Stock underlying RSUs is  accelerated. Any transfer restrictions on the shares of Common Stock underlying RSUs and/or shares of restricted stock are removed. The terms of the PSUs are not affected by the NEO's death. For information on the number of PSUs and vested RSUs  held by the NEOs at year-end, see —2018 Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End and —2018  Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation above. These amounts do not reflect, in the case of death, the payment of a death benefit under our executive life insurance plan, which provides each NEO with term life  insurance coverage through age 75 (a $4.5 million benefit for each NEO other than Mr. Waldron, who elected coverage at the minimum level under such plan).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(c)  If a Change in Control (as defined below) occurs, and within 18 months thereafter we terminate an  NEO's employment without Cause or if the NEO terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined below), delivery of shares of Common Stock underlying RSUs is accelerated and any transfer restrictions on the shares of Common Stock underlying  RSUs and/or shares of restricted stock are removed. The terms of the PSUs are not affected. For RSUs and Shares at Risk delivered in respect of PSUs and RSUs, certain forfeiture provisions no longer apply.  
[END TABLE]
In the case of a disability, provided that the NEO does not become associated with a Covered Enterprise, shares of Common Stock underlying RSUs continue to deliver on schedule and PSUs continue to be eligible to be earned pursuant to their existing terms. If the NEO does become associated with a Covered Enterprise, the awards would be treated as set forth in footnote (a) above for that situation. 
In the case of a termination in which an NEO resigns and accepts a position that is deemed Conflicted Employment (as defined below), the NEO will receive, at our sole discretion, (i) with respect to RSUs, either a cash payment or an accelerated delivery of, and removal of transfer restrictions on, the shares of Common Stock underlying those RSUs; and (ii) with respect to restricted stock, removal of transfer restrictions on such shares of restricted stock. Additionally, in the event of such a termination, our Compensation Committee may determine to amend the terms of any then-outstanding LTIP awards or PSUs held by the NEO.

(e)  PMDs with eight or more years of service as a PMD are eligible to receive medical and dental  coverage under our retiree healthcare program for themselves and eligible dependents through our firm at a 75% subsidy. Each of our NEOs is eligible for this coverage. The values shown in this column reflect the present value of the cost to us of  the 75% subsidy and were determined using a December 31, 2018 retirement date and the following assumptions: a 4.56% discount rate; mortality estimates based on the S1PMA_L table (Mr. Gnodde) and the  RP-2014 white collar fully generational mortality table, with adjustments to reflect continued improvements in mortality based on Scale MP-2018 (other NEOs); estimates  of future increases in healthcare subsidy costs of 2.5% for medical and pharmacy and 5.25% for dental; and assumptions for subsequent eligibility for alternative coverage, which would eliminate subsidies under our program (60% firm subsidized and  40% not firm subsidized). Values and assumptions shown reflect that effective January 1, 2020, the value of the benefit under our U.S. retiree healthcare program will not exceed the annual limits under Section 4980I of the Code.   
[END TABLE]
Retirement of Mr. Blankfein 
Mr. Blankfein did not receive any payments or other benefits in connection with his retirement; although he meets the eligibility requirements for our PMD retiree healthcare program described in footnote (e) to the table above (the present value of which as of December 31, 2018 was $256,418, calculated using the same assumptions described in footnote (e)), at this time Mr. Blankfein is instead receiving coverage in his capacity as Senior Chairman. Please see —Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Senior Chairman Agreement with Mr. Blankfein for additional details regarding arrangements in connection with Mr. Blankfein's Senior Chairman role. 
Compensation Matters | Executive Compensation   
Other Terms 
As PMDs, our NEOs are generally subject to a policy of 90 days' notice of termination of employment. We may require that an NEO be inactive (i.e., on "garden leave") during the notice period (or we may waive the requirement). 
For purposes of describing our RSUs and PSUs, the above-referenced terms have the following meanings: 
"Cause" means the NEO (a) is convicted in a criminal proceeding on certain misdemeanor charges, on a felony charge or an equivalent charge, (b) engages in employment disqualification conduct under applicable law, (c) willfully fails to perform his or her duties to Goldman Sachs, (d) violates any securities or commodities laws, rules or regulations or the rules and regulations of any relevant exchange or association of which we are a member, (e) violates any of our policies concerning hedging or pledging or confidential or proprietary information, or materially violates any other of our policies, (f) impairs, impugns, denigrates, disparages or negatively reflects upon our name, reputation or business interests or (g) engages in conduct detrimental to us. 
"Change in Control" means the consummation of a business combination involving Goldman Sachs, unless immediately following the business combination either: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    At least 50% of the total voting power of the surviving entity or its parent entity, if applicable, is represented by  securities of Goldman Sachs that were outstanding immediately prior to the transaction (or by shares into which the securities of Goldman Sachs are converted in the transaction); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    At least 50% of the members of the board of directors of the surviving entity, or its parent entity, if applicable,  following the transaction were, at the time of our Boards approval of the execution of the initial agreement providing for the transaction, directors of Goldman Sachs on the date of grant of the RSUs (including directors whose election or  nomination was approved by two-thirds of the incumbent directors).  
[END TABLE]
"Conflicted Employment" occurs where (a) a participant resigns solely to accept employment at any U.S. federal, state or local government, any non-U.S. government, any supranational or international organization, any self-regulatory organization, or any agency or instrumentality of any such government or organization, or any other employer determined by our Compensation Committee, and as a result of such employment the participant's continued holding of our equity-based awards would result in an actual or perceived conflict of interest, or (b) a participant terminates employment and then notifies us that he/she has accepted or intends to accept employment of the nature described in clause (a). For awards granted after 2016, employment with an "Accounting Firm" within the meaning of SEC Rule 2-01(f)(2) of Regulation S-X will not be considered "Conflicted Employment." 
"Covered Enterprise" includes any existing or planned business enterprise that (a) offers, holds itself out as offering or reasonably may be expected to offer products or services that are the same as or similar to those offered by us or that we reasonably expect to offer or (b) engages in, holds itself out as engaging in or reasonably may be expected to engage in any other activity that is the same as or similar to any financial activity engaged in by us or in which we reasonably expect to engage. 
Whether employment is terminated by reason of "Downsizing" is determined solely by us. 
"Good Reason" means (a) as determined by our Compensation Committee, a materially adverse change in the NEO's position or nature or status of the NEO's responsibilities from those in effect immediately before the Change in Control or (b) Goldman Sachs requiring the NEO's principal place of employment to be located more than 75 miles from the location where the NEO is principally employed at the time of the Change in Control (except for required travel consistent with the NEO's business travel obligations in the ordinary course prior to the Change in Control). 
"Solicitation" means any direct or indirect communication of any kind whatsoever (regardless of who initiated), inviting, advising, encouraging or requesting any person or entity, in any manner, to take or refrain from taking any action. 
Compensation Matters | Report of our Compensation Committee

∎    In accordance with SEC rules, we have calculated the ratio between the 2018 compensation of our current CEO,  Mr. Solomon, and the median of the 2018 compensation of all of our employees (other than the CEO) (Median Compensation Amount).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Using reasonable estimates and assumptions where necessary, we have determined that the Median Compensation Amount  (calculated in accordance with SEC rules) for 2018 is $136,513.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    In accordance with SEC rules, we identified the employee who received the Median Compensation Amount as of  December 31, 2017 using the firm's standard internal compensation methodology known as "per annum total compensation," which measures each employee's fixed compensation and incentive compensation for a particular year, with  appropriate prorations made to reflect actual compensation paid to part-time employees and currency conversions as applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    SEC rules permit identification of this median employee once every three years. As such, the Median Compensation Amount for  2018 reflects the 2018 "per annum total compensation" of the employee we identified as of December 31, 2017, given that there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would  significantly impact pay ratio disclosure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Mr. Solomons compensation for 2018, as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table, is $20,662,835, and the  ratio between this amount and the Median Compensation Amount is approximately 151:1.

 2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM

Our Governance Committee reviews the form and amount of our Director Compensation Program annually, taking into account: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ∎   Advice from its independent consultant

[BEGIN TABLE]
   ∎   Structure of our program and overall amount of compensation   
   ∎   Feedback from investors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ∎   Benchmarking against form, structure and amount of peer director compensation  
[END TABLE]
Both the quantum and the structure of our Director Compensation Program are designed to support the key objectives set forth on the prior page, including but not limited to the alignment of director interests with long-term shareholder interests such as through the hold-past retirement requirement for 100% of the equity component of the program. Our Director Compensation Program has not changed since 2014, when our Governance Committee proactively determined to set the annual equity award as a dollar amount rather than a fixed number of RSUs, as had previously been the case, to, among other things, mitigate the effect of short-term stock price performance on the amount of director compensation. This change had the effect of lowering the amount of director compensation in 2014 and ensuring that future pay does not automatically escalate with appreciation in our Common Stock. Accordingly, the 2018 Director Compensation Program consists of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 RETENTION OF INDEPENDENT NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION  CONSULTANT 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, our Governance Committee reappointed Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), a compensation consultant, to conduct an independent review of our non-employee director compensation program. 
FW Cook assessed the structure of our non-employee director compensation program and its value compared to competitive market practices. FW Cook determined that the firm's compensation program remained competitive with the market and continued to align the interests of our non-employee directors with the long-term interests of our shareholders. This assessment took into account the decision to fix the annual equity award as a dollar amount rather than a share amount in 2014, as well as the program's emphasis on equity compensation and the holding requirements and other restrictions on the RSUs. The duties of our non-employee directors were also taken into consideration, including the ongoing oversight responsibilities required of our directors by the regulatory environment in which we operate. As a result of its assessment, FW Cook confirmed that it supported the continuation of our non-employee director compensation program without changes to either amount or design. 
Our Governance Committee considered this review in determining to recommend to the Board that it make no changes to our non-employee director compensation program for 2018, which recommendation was accepted by the Board. 
In connection with the engagement of FW Cook, our Governance Committee considered certain information regarding FW Cook's relationship with our firm, including that FW Cook provides no services to our firm other than to our Governance Committee, the fees paid by our firm to FW Cook for this analysis in the context of FW Cook's total revenues, that FW Cook has no significant business or personal relationship with any member of our Governance Committee or any executive officer and that none of the members of FW Cook's consulting team for our firm owns any shares of our Common Stock. Considering this information, our Governance Committee determined that FW Cook is independent and does not have conflicts of interest in providing services to our Governance Committee.

If our shareholders do not ratify the appointment, our Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain PwC, but still may retain them. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of our firm and our shareholders. 
A representative of PwC is expected to be present at our Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.

Item 4. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Right to Act by Written Consent 
John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California, 90278, beneficial owner of 20 shares of Common Stock, is the proponent of the following shareholder proposal. Mr. Chevedden has advised us that a representative will present the proposal and related supporting statement at our Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPONENT'S STATEMENT 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 4 - Right to Act by Written Consent 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written consent. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if most Allstate and Sprint shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice. 
Our higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting (which may be unreachable due to time constraints and detailed technical requirements) is one more reason that we should have the right to act by written consent. 
The shareholder ability to elect a director by written consent would give our directors a greater incentive to oversee the following problems more effectively and prevent a reoccurrence: 
Federal probe into alleged violations of anti-money laundering regulations. 
November 2018 
Shareholder lawsuit over alleged excessive stock based incentives for executives without proper shareholder disclosure. 
October 2018 
SEC Inquiry over allegations of misconduct involving internal sharing of privileged information and nepotism. October 2018 
Certified Class Action Lawsuit over allegations of gender discrimination. 
October 2018 
Item 4. Shareholder Proposal 
Certified Class Action Lawsuit over alleged false and misleading statements on collateralized debt obligations sold prior to housing market collapse in 2008. 
August 2018 
NGO criticism over alleged funding of First Pacific and Salim Group's palm oil production unit facing deforestation allegations, labor rights violations and child labor practices allegations, Indonesia. 
July 2018 
Investigation over alleged dividend stripping as tax avoidance scheme, Germany. 
July 2018 
Announcement of share repurchase authorization of up to $5 Billion. Stock buybacks can be a sign of short-termism for executives - sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the company. 
June 2018 
$4.4 Billion impairment charge. 
January 2018 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is better overseen by a more qualified and focused board. Our Directors will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus have more of an incentive to improve the oversight role of the Board of Directors. 
Please vote yes: Right to Act by Written Consent - Proposal 4 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION 
[END TABLE]
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL. 
Our Board has re-evaluated the ability of shareholders to act by written consent. Action by written consent as proposed may cause confusion and disruption, as well as promote short-termism or special interests. In light of our Board's commitment to corporate governance best practices – including Board-level engagement with shareholders, we believe that the adoption of this proposal is unnecessary and not in the best interests of our firm or our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Our Board is committed to engaging with our shareholders and listening to their perspectives. In addition to  various governance practices which enhance the rights of all shareholders, our Board has open lines of communication with our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    For example, during 2018 members of our Board, including our Lead Director, met with shareholders representing  approximately 30% of our shares outstanding on topics such as board composition and director succession planning, compensation, executive succession planning, regulation and reputational risk.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    In addition to the right to call a special meeting and extensive shareholder outreach, we maintain several other strong  governance practices that protect the rights of all shareholders. For example:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Independent Lead Director with expansive duties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Experienced and diverse Board, which held 63 Board and Committee meetings during 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Proactively adopted proxy access provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Single class shareholder structure; no supermajority vote requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Annual elections of directors; majority voting with resignation policy for directors in uncontested elections.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    No "poison pill."  
[END TABLE]
Item 4. Shareholder Proposal 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Matters subject to a shareholder vote should be communicated to all shareholders in the context of an annual or special  meeting (which may be called by 25% of outstanding shares), with adequate time to consider the matters proposed.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Our governing documents provide protections, such as advance notice and thorough disclosure to all shareholders, for the  conduct of business at annual and special meetings, to ensure a well-informed, fair and equitable process.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Annual and special meetings also allow opportunity for discussion and interaction among shareholders so that all points of  view may be considered prior to a vote.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    In contrast, enabling a limited group of shareholders to act by written consent may deprive almost half of our  shareholders of these important rights.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ∎    Action by written consent as proposed may cause confusion and disruption, as well as promote short-termism or  special-interests. For example:    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Our Board may be denied the opportunity to consider the merits of a proposed action and to suggest alternative proposals  for shareholder evaluation that may be in the best interests of our shareholders.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  »    Multiple shareholder groups may solicit multiple written consents simultaneously, some of which may be duplicative or  contradictory, causing confusion and disruption to shareholders, the Board and management.    
[END TABLE]
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
On the recommendation of our independent directors, our Board has in place both a Related Person Transactions Policy and a policy with respect to outside director involvement with financial firms (see Corporate Governance— Item 1. Election of Directors—Our Directors) to provide guidelines for the review of certain relationships and transactions involving our directors and executive officers. 
Related Person Transactions Policy 
Our Board has a written Related Person Transactions Policy regarding the review and approval of transactions between us and "related persons" (directors, executive officers, immediate family members of a director or executive officer, or known 5% shareholders). 
Under this policy, transactions that exceed $120,000 in which a related person may have or may be deemed to have a direct or indirect material interest are submitted to our Governance Committee Chair, our Audit Committee Chair or our full Governance Committee for approval, as applicable. Certain transactions, including employment relationships, ordinary course brokerage, investment and other services, payment of certain regulatory filing fees and certain other ordinary course non-preferential transactions, are considered preapproved transactions, and thus do not require specific approval under the policy (although these transactions must be reported to our Governance Committee and may still be submitted for approval if deemed appropriate). 
In determining whether to approve a related person transaction, the following factors, among others, are considered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Whether the transaction would impair the independence of an independent director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Whether the transaction presents a conflict of interest, taking into account the size of the transaction, the financial  position of the director or executive officer, the nature of the directors or executive officers interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Whether the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and on substantially the same terms as would apply to comparable  third parties;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    The business reasons for the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
∎    Any reputational issues; and  
[END TABLE]

∎    Whether the transaction is material, taking into account the significance of the transaction to our investors.

Some of our directors and executive officers (and persons or entities affiliated with them) have brokerage and/or discretionary accounts at our broker-dealer affiliates, and, in certain cases, extensions of credit not involving more than the normal risk of collectability or presenting other unfavorable features have been and may be made to family members of directors by Goldman Sachs Bank USA in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons unrelated to our firm.

   FIRM-MANAGED FUNDS AND OTHER  INVESTMENTS   
[END TABLE]
We have established private investment funds (Employee Funds) to permit our employees (and in certain cases, retired employees) to participate in our private equity, hedge fund and other similar activities by investing in or alongside funds and investments that we manage or sponsor for independent investors and/or for our firm. Investment decisions for the Employee Funds are made by the investment teams or committees that are fiduciaries for such funds, and no executive officers are members of such investment teams or committees. The Employee Funds generally maintain diversified investment portfolios, and these investment opportunities do not affect the incentives of our executive officers under our compensation program. Many of our employees, their spouses, related charitable foundations or entities they own or control have invested in these Employee Funds. In some cases, we have limited participation to our PMDs, including our executive officers, and in some cases participation may be limited to individuals eligible to invest pursuant to applicable law. 
Certain of the Employee Funds provide investors with an interest in the overrides we receive for managing the funds for independent investors (overrides). Employee Funds generally do not require our current or retired PMDs and other current or retired employees to pay management fees and do not deduct overrides from fund distributions. Similarly, certain other investments may be made available to our PMDs, retired PMDs and other current employees on a fee-free or reduced fee basis. 
Distributions and redemptions exceeding $120,000 from Employee Funds made to our 2018 executive officers (or persons or certain entities affiliated with them) and Mr. Viniar (with respect to investments made when he was an employee) during 2018, consisting of profits and other income and return of amounts initially invested (excluding overrides generally available only to PMDs, which are discussed below), were approximately, in the aggregate, as follows: Mr. Solomon—$7.1 million; Mr. Blankfein—$15.3 million; Mr. Waldron—$1.4 million; Mr. Scherr—$0.9 million; Mr. Chavez—$0.1 million; Mr. Gnodde—$14.9 million; Mr. O'Neill—$5.4 million; Harvey M. Schwartz (retired April 2018)—$0.7 million; Pablo J. Salame (retired June 2018)—$0.8 million; Gregory K. Palm (General Counsel through 2018)—$19.4 million; Sarah E. Smith (Global Head of Compliance)—$0.3 million; John F.W. Rogers (Chief of Staff and Secretary to the Board)—$2.4 million; and Mr. Viniar—$3.6 million. 
Distributions of overrides generally available only to PMDs (and retired PMDs) made to our 2018 executive officers (or persons or entities affiliated with them) and Mr. Viniar (with respect to investments made when he was an employee) during 2018 were approximately, in the aggregate, as follows: Mr. Solomon—$1.32 million; Mr. Blankfein—$1.61 million; Mr. Waldron—$362,000; Mr. Scherr—$167,000; Mr. Chavez—$108,000; Mr. Gnodde—$1.22 million; Mr. Schwartz—$61,000; Mr. Salame—$2,000; Mr. Palm—$1.59 million; Ms. Smith—$59,000; Mr. Rogers—$252,000; and Mr. Viniar—$1.29 million. 
Subject to applicable laws, in addition, certain of our directors and executive officers may from time to time invest their personal funds in other funds or investments that we have established and that we manage or sponsor. Except as described above, these other investments are made on substantially the same terms and conditions as other similarly-situated investors in these funds or investments who are neither directors nor employees. In certain of these funds, including certain Employee Funds, our directors and executive officers own in the aggregate more than 10% of the interests in these funds. 
Affiliates of Goldman Sachs generally bear overhead and administrative expenses for, and may provide certain other services free of charge to, Employee Funds.

We take very seriously any actual or perceived conflict of interest, and critically evaluate all potential transactions and relationships that may involve directors or director-affiliated entities. 
Mr. Mittal is the Chairman and CEO of ArcelorMittal S.A. and beneficially owns (directly and indirectly) approximately 37% of the outstanding common shares of ArcelorMittal. Goldman Sachs provides ordinary course financial advisory, lending, investment banking, trading and other financial services to ArcelorMittal and its affiliates, including as described below. 
In December 2018 Goldman Sachs agreed to participate in a $5.5 billion five-year revolving credit facility for ArcelorMittal, which facility refinanced prior revolving credit facilities for ArcelorMittal outstanding in the same total amount. Under this $5.5 billion facility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to lend to ArcelorMittal up to $170 million at an interest rate of Libor + 55 basis points (which rate may vary depending on ArcelorMittal's credit ratings); the facility currently is partially drawn, resulting in an approximately $17.7 million loan from Goldman Sachs to ArcelorMittal under this facility. 
Goldman Sachs also participates in a $1 billion five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility for a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal, under which the firm has agreed to lend up to $40 million at an interest rate of Libor + 225 basis points (which rate may vary depending on a fixed charge coverage ratio). Goldman Sachs currently has no loan outstanding under this facility. 
Goldman Sachs is acting as advisor to ArcelorMittal in connection with the proposed approximately $7 billion acquisition of an Indian steel company. In connection with this acquisition, in December 2018 Goldman Sachs agreed to participate in 12 month acquisition bridge facilities (each with a 6 month extension option) split across two tranches (one for ArcelorMittal and one for a joint venture) as follows. Under a $4.6 billion bridge facility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to lend to an acquisition joint venture up to approximately $354 million (repayment of which is guaranteed by ArcelorMittal) at an interest rate of Libor + 50 basis points (which rate will increase depending on the bridge facility's time to maturity beginning six months after signing); no loan is currently outstanding under this facility. Under a $2.4 billion bridge facility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to lend to ArcelorMittal up to approximately $181 million at an interest rate of Libor + 50 basis points (which rate will increase depending on the bridge facility's time to maturity beginning six months after signing); this facility currently is partially drawn, resulting in an approximately $76 million loan from Goldman Sachs under this facility. 
Goldman Sachs also participates in a $147.5 million credit facility for an entity in which ArcelorMittal is an approximately 31% shareholder, which facility was amended in 2018. Under such facility, Goldman Sachs has agreed to lend up to approximately $22.5 million at an interest rate of Libor + 450 basis points. The facility is currently partially drawn, resulting in an approximately $14.3 million loan from Goldman Sachs outstanding under this facility. Concurrent with the amendment to such facility, in 2018 the firm also acted as an underwriter in an approximately $575 million high yield bond offering for this entity. 
Goldman Sachs provided sell-side advisory services to the seller of certain long steel businesses in Brazil; majority control of these businesses was acquired by a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal in 2018 in an approximately $350 million transaction. In addition, in 2019 Goldman Sachs acted as an underwriter for approximately $750 million of debt offerings by ArcelorMittal. 
Each of these transactions was conducted on, and all of these services were provided on, an arm's-length basis.

(a)  For purposes of this table and the Beneficial Owners of More than Five Percent table below,  "beneficial ownership" is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, pursuant to which a person or group of persons is deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of any  shares of Common Stock that such person has the right to acquire within 60 days of the date of determination. In light of the nature of vested RSUs, we have also included in this table shares of Common Stock underlying vested RSUs. For purposes of  computing the percentage of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by each person or group of persons named above, any shares that such person or persons has the right to acquire within 60 days (as well as the shares of Common Stock underlying  vested RSUs) are deemed to be outstanding but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

Affiliates of BlackRock,  Inc. are investment managers for certain investment options under our 401(k) Plan and certain GS Pension Plan assets.

The Vanguard Group is an investment manager to mutual funds that are investment options in our 401(k) Plan and certain tax qualified plans  maintained by certain of our affiliates. The selection of the Vanguard mutual funds as investment options for each plan is unrelated to Vanguard's Common Stock ownership. In the case of The 401(k) Savings Plan, a third-party investment manager  who is not affiliated with GS is responsible for fund selection and selected the Vanguard mutual fund. We believe that the fees paid to The Vanguard Group through the Vanguard mutual fund are the same as the fees that are paid by the other holders  of the same share class of that fund.

Additional Information    
Compensation-Related Litigation 
The following description is as of March 4, 2019: 
On May 9, 2017, Goldman Sachs and certain of its current and former directors were named as defendants in an action brought by a shareholder in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint, which asserts derivative claims purportedly on behalf of Goldman Sachs and direct claims on behalf of the shareholder-plaintiff, alleges, among other things, that the director defendants breached their fiduciary duties by approving excessive non-employee director compensation since 2015, including because such compensation is the highest among the firm's U.S. Peers. A copy of the plaintiff's complaint is available at http://www.goldmansachs.com/litigation/ 2017nedderivative.pdf. Defendants moved to dismiss on July 28, 2017. On March 20, 2018, the parties entered into a settlement-in-principle, which, following an objection from a stockholder, the court declined to approve. Oral argument on defendants' motion to dismiss and the objector's fee motion was held on February 4, 2019. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of our Compensation Committee is or has been an officer or employee of Goldman Sachs. No member of our Compensation Committee is an executive officer of another entity at which one of our executive officers serves on the board of directors. For information about related person transactions involving members of our Compensation Committee, see Certain Relationships and Related Transactions. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership of, and transactions in, our equity securities with the SEC. Our directors and executive officers are also required to furnish us with copies of all such Section 16(a) reports they file. The reports are published on our website at www.gs.com/shareholders. 
Based on a review of the copies of these reports, and on written representations from our reporting persons, we believe that all such Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors and executive officers were complied with during 2018.

If you received printed versions of these materials by mail (rather than through electronic delivery), these materials also included a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
How are we distributing our proxy materials? 
To expedite delivery, reduce our costs and decrease the environmental impact of our proxy materials, we used "Notice and Access" in accordance with an SEC rule that permits us to provide proxy materials to our shareholders over the Internet. By March 22, 2019, we sent a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to certain of our shareholders containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials online. If you received a Notice, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the Notice instructs you on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The Notice also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy via the Internet. If you received a Notice and would like to receive a copy of our proxy materials, follow the instructions contained in the Notice to request a copy electronically or in paper form on a one-time or ongoing basis. Shareholders who do not receive the Notice will continue to receive either a paper or electronic copy of our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which will be sent on or about March 26, 2019.

The proxy holders (that is, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card) will vote your shares of Common Stock in accordance with your instructions at the Annual Meeting (including any adjournments or postponements thereof). 
How will my shares be voted if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
Shareholders of Record. If you indicate that you wish to vote as recommended by our Board or if you sign, date and return a proxy card but do not give specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this Proxy Statement, and the proxy holders may determine in their discretion regarding any other matters properly presented for a vote at our Annual Meeting. Although our Board does not anticipate that any of the director nominees will be unable to stand for election as a director nominee at our Annual Meeting, if this occurs, proxies will be voted in favor of such other person or persons as may be recommended by our Governance Committee and designated by our Board. 
Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name. 
If your bank, brokerage firm, broker-dealer or other similar organization does not receive specific voting instructions from you, how your shares may be voted will depend on the type of proposal. 
Participants in our 401(k) Plan. If you sign and return the voting instruction form but otherwise leave it blank or if you do not otherwise provide voting instructions to the 401(k) Plan trustee by mail, Internet or telephone, your shares will be voted in the same proportion as the shares held under the 401(k) Plan for which instructions are received, unless otherwise required by law. 
What is a Broker Non-Vote? 
A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for the meeting with respect to the ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accounting firm but does not vote on non-discretionary matters because you did not provide voting instructions on these matters.

Frequently Asked Questions 
How is voting affected by shareholders who participate in certain Goldman Sachs Partner Compensation plans? 
Employees of Goldman Sachs who participate in the PCP are "covered persons" under our Shareholders' Agreement. Our Shareholders' Agreement governs, among other things, the voting of shares of Common Stock owned by each covered person directly or jointly with a spouse (but excluding shares acquired under our 401(k) Plan). Shares of Common Stock subject to our Shareholders' Agreement are called "voting shares." 
Our Shareholders' Agreement requires that before any of our shareholders vote, a separate, preliminary vote is held by the persons covered by our Shareholders' Agreement. In the election of directors, all voting shares will be voted in favor of the election of the director nominees receiving the highest numbers of votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary vote. For all other matters, all voting shares will be voted in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by the covered persons in the preliminary vote. 
If you are a party to our Shareholders' Agreement, you previously gave an irrevocable proxy to our Shareholders' Committee to vote your voting shares at our Annual Meeting in accordance with the preliminary vote, and to vote on any other matters that may come before our Annual Meeting as the proxy holder sees fit in a manner that is not inconsistent with the preliminary vote and that does not frustrate the intent of the preliminary vote. 
As of March 4, 2019, 13,949,461 shares of Common Stock were beneficially owned by the parties to the Shareholders' Agreement. Each person who is a party to our Shareholders' Agreement disclaims beneficial ownership of the shares subject to the agreement that are owned by any other party. As of March 4, 2019, 12,881,809 of the outstanding shares of Common Stock that were held by parties to our Shareholders' Agreement were subject to the voting provisions of our Shareholders' Agreement (representing approximately 3.51% of the outstanding shares entitled to vote at our Annual Meeting). The preliminary vote with respect to the voting shares will be concluded on or about April 19, 2019. 
Other than this Shareholders' Agreement (which covers our Chairman and CEO, who is also a director), there are no voting agreements by or among any of our directors. 
Where can I find the voting results of our Annual Meeting? 
We expect to announce the preliminary voting results at our Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be posted on our website. 
When will Goldman Sachs next hold an advisory vote on the frequency of Say on Pay votes? 
The next advisory vote on the frequency of Say on Pay votes will be held no later than our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
How do I obtain more information about Goldman Sachs? 
A copy of our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders accompanies this Proxy Statement. You also may obtain, free of charge, a copy of that document, our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, our Director Independence Policy and the charters for our Audit, Compensation, Governance, Public Responsibilities and Risk Committees by writing to: The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10282, Attn: Investor Relations; email: gs-investor-relations@gs.com. 
These documents, as well as other information about Goldman Sachs, are also available on our website at www.gs.com/shareholders. 
How do I inspect the list of shareholders of record? 
A list of the shareholders of record as of March 4, 2019 will be available for inspection during ordinary business hours at our headquarters at 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282, from April 22, 2019 to May 1, 2019, as well as at our Annual Meeting. 
How do I sign up for electronic delivery of proxy materials? 
This Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available on our website at: www.gs.com/proxymaterials. If you would like to help reduce our costs of printing and mailing future materials, you can agree to access these documents in the future over the Internet rather than receiving printed copies in the mail. For your convenience, you may find links to sign up for electronic delivery for both shareholders of record and beneficial owners who hold shares in street name at www.gs.com/electronicdelivery. 
Once you sign up, you will continue to receive proxy materials electronically until you revoke this preference. 
Who pays the expenses of this proxy solicitation? 
Our proxy materials are being used by our Board in connection with the solicitation of proxies for our Annual Meeting. We pay the expenses of the preparation of proxy materials and the solicitation of proxies for our Annual Meeting. In addition to the 
Frequently Asked Questions solicitation of proxies by mail, certain of our directors, officers or employees may solicit telephonically, electronically or by other means of communication. Our directors, officers and employees will receive no additional compensation for any such solicitation. We have also hired Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, to assist in the solicitation and distribution of proxies, for which they will receive a fee of $25,000, as well as reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket costs and expenses. We will reimburse brokers, including Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, and other similar institutions for costs incurred by them in mailing proxy materials to beneficial owners. 
What is "householding"? 
In accordance with a notice sent to certain street name shareholders of Common Stock who share a single address, shareholders at a single address will receive only one copy of this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders unless we have previously received contrary instructions. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce our printing and postage costs. We currently do not "household" for shareholders of record. 
If your household received a single set of proxy materials, but you would prefer to receive a separate copy of this Proxy Statement or our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, you may contact us at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10282, Attn: Investor Relations, telephone: 1-212-902-0300, email: gs-investor-relations@gs.com, and we will deliver those documents to you promptly upon receiving the request. 
You may request or discontinue householding in the future by contacting the broker, bank or similar institution through which you hold your shares. You may also change your householding preferences through the Broadridge Householding Election system at 1-866-540-7095 using the control number we have provided to you. 
How can I recommend a director candidate to our Governance Committee? 
Our Governance Committee welcomes candidates recommended by shareholders and will consider these candidates in the same manner as other candidates. 
Shareholders who wish to recommend director candidates for consideration by our Governance 
 Committee may do so by submitting in writing such candidates' names to John F.W. Rogers, Secretary to the Board of Directors, at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282. 
How can I submit a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders? 
Shareholders who, in accordance with the SEC's Rule 14a-8, wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed by us in connection with our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must submit their proposals to John F.W. Rogers, Secretary to the Board of Directors, via email at shareholderproposals@gs.com or by mail at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282. Proposals must be received on or before Saturday, November 23, 2019. As the rules of the SEC make clear, however, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion. 
How can I submit nominees (such as through proxy access) or shareholder proposals in accordance with our By-laws? 
Shareholders who wish to submit a "proxy access" nomination for inclusion in our proxy statement in connection with our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders may do so by submitting in writing a Nomination Notice, in compliance with the procedures and along with the other information required by our By-laws, to John F.W. Rogers, Secretary to the Board of Directors, at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282 no earlier than October 24, 2019 and no later than November 23, 2019. 
In accordance with our By-laws, for other matters (including director nominees not proposed pursuant to proxy access) not included in our proxy materials to be properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder's notice of the matter that the shareholder wishes to present must be delivered to John F.W. Rogers, Secretary to the Board of Directors, in compliance with the procedures and along with the other information required by our By-laws, at The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., 200 West Street, New York, New York 10282, not less than 90 nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting. As a result, any notice given by or on behalf of a shareholder pursuant to these provisions of our By-laws (and not pursuant to the SEC's Rule 14a-8) must be received no earlier than January 3, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020. 
Annex A: Calculation of Non-GAAP Measures  
Annex A: Calculation of Non-GAAP Measures 
The U.S. Tax Legislation was enacted on December 22, 2017 and among other things, lowered U.S. corporate income tax rates as of January 1, 2018, implemented a territorial tax system and imposed a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The estimated impact of the U.S. Tax Legislation was an increase in income tax expense of $4.40 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2018, the firm finalized this estimate to reflect the impact of updated information, including subsequent guidance issued by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, resulting in a $487 million income tax benefit for 2018. 
We believe that presenting certain of our 2018 results excluding the estimated impact of U.S. Tax Legislation is meaningful, as it reflects metrics considered by the Compensation Committee in making its compensation determinations. We have presented below the metrics used in this Proxy Statement including and excluding the impact of U.S. Tax Legislation. The adjusted results are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP measures used by other companies.
