Notice of 2019 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders and Proxy Statement 
Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS 
FROM OUR CHAIR & CEO 
Dear Fellow Shareholder, 
Fiscal 2018 has been a tremendous year at Jacobs. We continue to successfully execute our strategy to transform Jacobs' culture, capabilities and business portfolio to become a more innovation and technology-driven solutions company – tackling some of the world's most critical challenges. Our strong performance has created substantial value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders, and provides a solid foundation for continuing our focus on becoming a company unlike any other. 
Over a one and three-year period we have delivered total shareholder return of 33% and 108%. These returns to our shareholders place us in the top quartile of our peer group and well above the S&P 500 of 18% and 61%, respectively. 
Governance and Compensation Practices
Comprehensive corporate governance oversight, combined with highly talented people executing our profitable growth strategy, is fundamental to building long-term shareholder value. Underpinning our performance is our strong focus on integrity and corporate governance, which includes a continuous review and refinement of our company practices. 
Board Structure – The Board is comprised of 11 members from diverse geographic, industry, technical and business backgrounds. These different experiences and viewpoints provide for a robust governance structure which aligns with our strong emphasis on inclusion. In fact, 45% of our board is female or ethnically diverse. Elected on an annual basis under a majority voting standard, the average tenure of our Board is nine years, with four newly appointed directors within the last 5 years, including Barry L. Williams who joined the Board in December 2017 from our acquisition of CH2M HILL Companies, Ltd. 
Governance and Oversight Structures – We benefit from a highly engaged Board, facilitated by frequent formal and informal meetings with Executive leadership. The Board's engagement has expanded and evolved over the past several years in direct alignment with critical areas of importance in the business, including active participation and diligence on acquisition and divestiture opportunities and the formation of a Business Resilience Steering Group focused on Enterprise Risk reporting to the Audit Committee. Our cybersecurity leadership provides quarterly updates to the Board on our corporate wide cyber risk posture. We continue to benefit from our lead independent director Linda Fayne Levinson, ensuring independent leadership in the boardroom. 
Executive Compensation – We believe in pay for performance Executive compensation that incentivizes creation and sustainment of long-term shareholder value. In fact, 76% of compensation for our named executive officers is performance-based. In last year's annual shareholder advisory vote on "say-on-pay" we received a 96% approval. We also continue to evolve our performance-based compensation approach and will introduce non-financial based metrics for executives in fiscal 2019. These include performance and cultural based leadership behaviors such as safety, inclusion and diversity, innovation and talent management. 
2019 Proxy Statement |     
Value Creation Strategy 
We continue to execute against our Corporate Strategy launched in 2016, and our performance through fiscal 2018 has exceeded expectations. 
Build a High-Performance Culture – We are excited about the advancement of our high-performance culture this past year – an achievement that we're particularly proud of given the global integration activities of bringing Jacobs and CH2M together. We believe culture is fundamental to driving superior long-term performance, and there are several highlights worth noting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Progress on Inclusion – The diversity of our Executive Leadership Team is now at 50% overall –  40% women and 20% of diverse ethnic background – including the company's first female Executive Vice President.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong Organizational Health – We completed our second Organizational Health Assessment with results showing an  improvement of eight points over the past two years and elevating from the 3rd to 2nd quartile. We will be relentless in driving to achieve 1st quartile cultural performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Embedded Culture of Caring – Building on our  BeyondZero® foundation, we have extended our focus beyond safety to a strong culture of caring, including sustainability, inclusion, security and mental health. We launched  PlanBeyond, our sustainability framework to deliver on our corporate vision to "provide solutions for a more connected, sustainable world" and achieve our Global Sustainability Commitment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Engaged Employee Network Groups – A key part of the integration strategy with CH2M was the engagement and  empowerment of our Jacobs employee networks that embrace and reflect communities of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, veterans and career stages. These networks of more than 10,000 employees are driving inclusion and change on several levels.  In May we held our first global summit where leaders of our network groups and executives collaborated on ways to further our efforts in this crucial area.  
[END TABLE]
Transform the Core – We continue to evolve our operating model to improve business excellence, project delivery and sales effectiveness, with several critical enhancements in fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accountability – Appointment of two chief operating officers provided focus for driving accountability, further  supporting our profitable growth strategy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Technology Modernization – Significant investments in project delivery and business infrastructure improved  efficiency and connectivity of our systems, supporting our employees' productivity and work environment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Excellence – Continued focus on step-change improvement in project delivery resulted in a  year-over-year reduction in project write-offs of 22% (or 2-year reduction of 44%).  
[END TABLE]
Grow Profitably – Fiscal 2018 marked strong performance against our balanced strategy of improving our existing businesses and active portfolio management. We are on track to exceed the metrics outlined in our Strategy in December 2016. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong Financial Performance – Pro forma revenue growth of 9% and double digit pro forma operating growth  across all lines of business.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Successful CH2M Integration – Leadership on delivering key metrics provided to our shareholders:   
  ✓    Cost synergies exceeding initial outlook  
  ✓    Attaining revenue synergies  
  ✓    Surpassing EPS accretion targets  
  ✓    On track to outperform return/IRR target  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Focus on Innovation – Ongoing incremental investment has resulted in Jacobs Connected Enterprise gaining  strong traction in customer solutions over the past two years. Recognizing the critical importance of technology and innovation in driving thought leadership and innovation into the core of our business – as well as increased margins – we  named our first Chief Technology & Innovation Officer to ensure singular focus and prioritization globally.  
[END TABLE]
ii     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Our recent announcement of the divestiture of our Energy, Chemicals & Resources business demonstrates our commitment to shifting the business to higher-margin, sustained markets, providing greater focus on areas where we can accelerate profitable growth. 
In summary, fiscal 2018 was another strong year of delivering against our growth strategy and creating exceptional shareholder value. We appreciate your continued investment in Jacobs and remain confident in our ability to execute against plan while maintaining our high standards of transparency and corporate governance. 
We look forward to your attendance at our annual shareholder meeting on January 16, 2019 in Dallas. 
Remembering Noel Watson
Along with his family, we honor the memory of former Jacobs Chairman and CEO Noel Watson, who passed away in August at the age of 82. A great mentor and friend to many, Noel was a larger-than-life leader; a man of character who brought tireless passion, perspective and wisdom to his work. During his tenure as CEO, Noel steered the company's growth seven-fold, from $1 billion to more than $7 billion in revenues, with corresponding profit increases. 
Recruited by company founder Dr. Joseph Jacobs, Noel served the firm for more than 50 years, including more than 25 years at the helm of the company. He became President in 1987, CEO in 1992, was elected Chairman of the Board in 2006 and retired from the board in January 2017. 
Foremost, Noel was a dedicated and loving husband, father and grandfather. He is survived by his wife, Phyllis, their two children and five grandchildren.

2019 Proxy Statement |        v 
PROXY STATEMENT 
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the "Company" or "Jacobs"). This Proxy Statement and the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K were first made available to shareholders and the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, proxy card or voting instruction card were first mailed to shareholders on or about December 5, 2018. This Proxy Statement contains important information for you to consider when deciding how to vote on the matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. Please read it carefully. 
GENERAL 
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") will be held on Wednesday, January 16, 2019, at 4:30 p.m., local time, in the building where our principal offices are located, 1999 Bryan Street, First Floor, Dallas, Texas 75201, and at any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Who is soliciting my vote? 
The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of Directors" or "Board") is soliciting your vote in connection with the Annual Meeting. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
The Annual Meeting will be the Company's regular, annual meeting of shareholders. You will be voting on the following matters at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal Number    Description     Board Recommendation     Page Reference  
 Proposal Number    Description     Board Recommendation     Page Reference  
   1      Election of the directors named in this Proxy Statement to hold office until the  2020 annual meeting;       FOR each nominee    4   
   1      Election of the directors named in this Proxy Statement to hold office until the  2020 annual meeting;       FOR each nominee    4   
 3    Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019.      FOR    57 
[END TABLE]
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. There is no cumulative voting. There were 142,335,347 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on November 23, 2018 (the "Record Date"). 
How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock as of the Record Date must be present at the Annual Meeting in order to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. This is called a "quorum." Your shares are counted as present at the Annual Meeting if you are present at the Annual Meeting and vote in person, a proxy card or voting instruction card has been properly submitted by you or on your behalf, or you have voted electronically on the Internet or by telephone. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. A "broker non-vote" is a share of common stock that is beneficially owned by a person or entity and held by a broker or other nominee but for which the broker or other nominee (1) lacks the discretionary authority to vote on certain matters, and (2) has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner in respect of those specific matters. 
2019 Proxy Statement |        1 
How many votes are required to elect directors and approve the other proposals? 
Proposal No. 1 (Election of Directors): Each director is elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such nominee in uncontested elections (the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that nominee). Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of the election of directors and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of such election. 
Proposal No. 2 (Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation): The approval of the advisory resolution on the Company's executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the advisory resolution. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the advisory votes. The results of advisory votes are not binding on the Board of Directors. 
Proposal No. 3 (Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors): The ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. This proposal is considered a routine matter with respect to which a broker or other nominee can generally vote in their discretion. Therefore, no broker non-votes are expected in connection with this proposal. 
How do I vote by proxy? 
You can vote your shares by completing and returning the proxy card or voting instruction card that was sent to you or by voting your shares electronically on the Internet or by telephone. Your Internet or telephone vote authorizes the named proxies to vote your shares in the same manner as if you marked, signed, and returned your proxy card or voting instruction card. Voting instructions are printed on your proxy card, voting instruction card or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. You are encouraged to vote by proxy as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person. 
What if I don't vote on some of the proposals? 
If you return your signed proxy card or voting instruction card in the envelope provided to you but do not mark selections, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors with respect to such selections. Similarly, when you vote electronically on the Internet and do not vote on all matters, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors with respect to the matters on which you did not vote. In connection therewith, the Board of Directors has designated Mr. Steven J. Demetriou, Mr. Kevin C. Berryman and Mr. Michael R. Tyler as proxies. Shareholders that vote by telephone must vote on each matter. If you indicate a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon on your proxy card or voting instruction card, or by Internet or telephone, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. 
What if I hold my shares in a brokerage account or through a bank or other nominee? 
If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee and do not return the voting instruction card, the broker, bank or other nominee will vote your shares on each matter at the Annual Meeting for which he or she has the requisite discretionary authority. Under applicable rules, brokers have the discretion to vote on routine matters, such as the ratification of the selection of independent registered public accounting firms, but do not have discretion to vote on the election of directors or on any advisory vote regarding the Company's executive compensation. You may receive multiple sets of proxy materials if you hold your shares of Company common stock in multiple ways, such as directly as a holder of record or indirectly through a broker, bank or other nominee or through the CH2M 401(k) Plan (as defined below). You are encouraged to vote all proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive as soon as possible. 
What if I hold my shares in the CH2M HILL Retirement and Tax-Deferred Savings Plan? 
If your shares of Company common stock are held in the CH2M HILL Retirement and Tax-Deferred Savings Plan (the "CH2M 401(k) Plan"), you will receive a voting instruction card allowing you to instruct the trustee of the 
2     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
 CH2M 401(k) Plan how to vote such shares. The trustee will vote the shares credited to your account in accordance with your instructions, provided the trustee determines it can do so in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"). Pursuant to ERISA, the trustee would only be prevented from voting the shares credited to your account in accordance with your instructions if the independent fiduciary of the CH2M 401(k) Plan, State Street Global Advisors ("SSGA"), deems that following the instructions would be a violation of the trustee's fiduciary duties. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee of the CH2M 401(k) Plan, your voting instructions must be received by January 11, 2018 at 11:59p.m. eastern time. If you do not send instructions regarding the voting of shares in your CH2M 401(k) Plan account, or if your instructions are not received in a timely manner, SSGA will direct the trustee, in SSGA's discretion, how to vote your shares. Please follow the instructions on your voting instruction card, which may be different from those provided to other stockholders. For the avoidance of doubt, if you are a participant in the CH2M 401(k) Plan, you may not vote directly at the Annual Meeting. You may receive multiple sets of proxy materials if you hold your shares of Company common stock in multiple ways, such as directly as a holder of record or indirectly through a broker, bank or other nominee or through the CH2M 401(k) Plan. You are encouraged to vote all proxy cards and voting instruction cards you receive as soon as possible. 
Who pays for the proxy solicitation and how will the Company solicit votes? 
The Company bears the expense of printing and mailing proxy materials and soliciting proxies. In addition to this solicitation of proxies by mail, the Company's directors, officers, and other employees may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, or electronic communication. These individuals will not be paid any additional compensation above their regular salaries and wages for any such solicitation. The Company will request brokers and other nominees who hold shares of common stock in their names to furnish proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such shares. The Company will reimburse such brokers and other nominees for their reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. In addition, we have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a total fee of up to $20,000 plus reimbursement of expenses. MacKenzie Partners, Inc. may solicit proxies in person, by telephone or electronic communication. 
Can I change or revoke my vote? 
Yes. Even if you sign and return the proxy card or voting instruction card in the form provided to you, vote by telephone, or vote electronically on the Internet, you retain the power to revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting. You can revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before that deadline by giving written notice to the Secretary of the Company, specifying such revocation. You may also change your vote by timely delivering a valid, later-dated proxy or voting instruction card or by submitting a later-dated vote by telephone or electronically on the Internet or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. However, please note that if you would like to vote at the Annual Meeting and you are not the shareholder of record, you must request, complete, and deliver a proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
Whom can I contact if I have questions or need assistance in voting my shares?

PROPOSAL NO. 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
What are you voting on? 
At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to elect eleven directors to serve on the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has nominated Steven J. Demetriou, Linda Fayne Levinson, Joseph R. Bronson, Juan José Suárez Coppel, Robert C. Davidson, Jr., General Ralph E. Eberhart, Dawne S. Hickton, Robert A. McNamara, Peter J. Robertson, Christopher M.T. Thompson and Barry L. Williams for election as directors for one-year terms expiring at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. When elected, directors serve until their successors have been duly elected and qualified or until any such director's earlier resignation or removal. 
If any nominee for any reason is unable to serve or will not serve, proxies may be voted for such substitute nominee as the proxy holder may determine. The Company is not aware of any nominee who will be unable to or will not serve as a director. 
What is the Vote Required? 
Each director is elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director in uncontested elections (the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that nominee). The Company did not receive any shareholder nominations for any director and thus the election of directors at the Annual Meeting will be an uncontested election. 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of the election of directors and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the election. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each  nominee.

2019 Proxy Statement |        17 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors oversees the Company's risk management function. It oversees a Company-wide approach to risk management, designed to enhance long-term shareholder value, support the achievement of strategic objectives and improve organizational performance. The Board determines the appropriate level of risk for the Company, assesses the specific risks faced by the Company and reviews the steps taken by management to manage those risks. The Board's involvement in setting the Company's business strategy also facilitates these assessments and reviews, culminating in the development of a strategy that reflects the consensus of the Board and management as to appropriate levels of risk and the appropriate measures to manage those risks. 
Through this framework, risk is assessed throughout the enterprise, focusing on risks arising out of various aspects of the Company's strategy and the implementation of that strategy, including financial, legal/compliance, operational/strategic, health and safety, and compensation risks. The Board also considers risk when evaluating proposed transactions and other matters presented to the Board, including acquisitions and financial matters. For example, in fiscal 2017, the Board held six special Board meetings in connection with the acquisition of CH2M Hill Companies, Ltd. ("CH2M") that was completed in the first fiscal quarter of 2018. Following fiscal 2018, the Board held two special meetings and an additional executive session in connection with the pending sale of the Company's Energy, Chemicals and Resources business announced in the first fiscal quarter of 2019. In addition, the independent directors discuss risk management during executive sessions without management present. 
While the Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its Committees oversee risk in certain specified areas: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee: Addresses financial risk, including internal controls, and discusses the  Company's risk profile with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviews potential violations of the Company's various codes of ethics and related corporate policies.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Human Resource and Compensation Committee: Periodically reviews compensation practices and  policies to consider whether they encourage excessive risk taking, including an annual review of management's assessment of the risk associated with the Company's compensation programs covering its employees, including executives, and  discusses the concept of risk as it relates to the Company's compensation programs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee: Oversees risks associated with the independence  of directors and Board nominees and assists the Board in overseeing the activities with respect to compliance and business practice matters, including the Company's corporate governance policies.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the Board's instruction, management regularly reports on applicable risks to the relevant Committee or the Board, as appropriate, including regular reports on significant Company projects, with additional review or reporting on risks being conducted as needed or as requested by the Board and its Committees. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board's leadership is comprised of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chair of the Board and CEO: Steven J. Demetriou  
• Lead Independent Director: Linda Fayne Levinson  
• Audit, Human Resource and Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees: Composed entirely of independent  directors  
[END TABLE]
Currently, the Board is led by Mr. Demetriou as Chair, a position he has held since July 2016, and Ms. Fayne Levinson as Lead Independent Director, a position she has also held since July 2016. 
18     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
In a process led by the Lead Independent Director and the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board evaluates the appointment and role of the Chair on an annual basis. The Board has determined that having Mr. Demetriou serve as Chair provides significant advantages to the Board and the Company, as it allows the Board to benefit from his knowledge of the Company's business and market opportunities and risks and also facilitates communications and relations with other members of senior management. The Board also believes that having Mr. Demetriou serve as Chair is advantageous to the Company when working with clients in certain areas of the world in which the title of Chair is significant. 
Because the Board believes that strong independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance, the Board has established the position of Lead Independent Director. The Board also believes that a Lead Independent Director, who has the responsibilities set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, provides independent leadership, oversight and benefits for the Company and Board that would be provided by an independent Chair. Responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director include:

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee leads the process of the Board's evaluation of the selection, role and term of the Lead Independent Director on an annual basis. 
Board Composition 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing with the Board on an annual basis the appropriate skills and characteristics required of members in the context of the current make-up of the Board. This process enables them to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board as a whole, and in individual directors, as the Company's needs evolve. This assessment takes into consideration all factors deemed relevant by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independence: The Board must be comprised of a majority of independent directors.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relevant Skills and Experience: The assessment of skills and characteristics of Board members  takes into account all skills and experience deemed relevant by the Committee, including those summarized in the Director Experience Matrix on page 5, among others. For incumbent directors, past performance on the Board of Directors and its  Committees is also taken into consideration. For new director candidates, the assessment also takes into account the ability and willingness of the director candidate to serve on the Board for five to seven years.  
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement |        19 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diversity: The Board believes it should encompass individuals with diverse backgrounds and  perspectives. In accordance with this guideline, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, experience and other demographics in evaluating and considering potential director candidates.  Diversity is an important consideration in the director nomination process because the Board believes that people of different genders, experiences, ages, races and ethnic backgrounds can contribute different, useful perspectives, while  collaborating effectively to further the Company's mission. This policy is included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consider the qualifications and attributes of directors and director candidates individually, as well as in the broader context of the Board's overall composition and the Company's current and future needs, to ensure that the Board as a whole possesses the requisite combination of skills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. 
Independence of Directors 
The Board of Directors has adopted Board of Directors Guidelines for Determining the Independence of its Members, which are accessible by following the link to "Corporate Governance" on the Company's website at www.jacobs.com. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each person who served as a member of the Board of Directors during fiscal 2018, other than Mr. Demetriou, is independent under Section 303A.02 of the NYSE listed company manual and the Company's independence guidelines. Each member of each Committee of the Board is also independent (as defined by the applicable NYSE rules). 
In addition, as further required by the NYSE's listed company manual and the Company's Independence Guidelines, the Board of Directors has made an affirmative determination that no relationship, whether immaterial or material, exists between any independent director and the Company that would prevent a director from being independent. In making this determination, the Board considered the facts described below. 
Mr. Davidson is an officer of Gamma Zeta Boulé Foundation and Sigma Pi Phi Professional Fraternity. The Company has made annual contributions to these organizations during the last three fiscal years. Such amounts did not exceed $7,500 in any fiscal year. During fiscal 2015, Ms. Hickton was Vice Chair, President and CEO of RTI International Metals, Inc. ("RTI"), which has been a client of the Company. The payments by RTI to the Company for any fiscal year were substantially less than two percent of the consolidated gross revenues of RTI. Mr. McNamara was previously Global Chief Risk Officer & COO — Australia businesses of Building, Engineering, and Services of Lendlease Corporation Limited ("Lendlease"), which has been a client of the Company. The payments by Lendlease to the Company for any fiscal year were substantially less than two percent of the consolidated gross revenues of Lendlease. 
Until February 2018, Mr. Robertson served as the U.S. co-chairman of the US-Saudi Arabian Business Council, an organization to which the Company makes $20,000 in annual cash contributions and also supports conferences. In February 2018, Mr. Demetriou succeeded Mr. Robertson in this role as the co-chairman. The total amount contributed by the Company to the US-Saudi Arabian Business Counsel over the last five years is approximately $70,000. Mr. Robertson is also on the Board of Sasol Ltd., which is a client of the Company. After a review of the facts, using its business judgment, the Board of Directors determined that these relationships did not compromise the independence of Mssrs. Davidson, McNamara and Robertson or Ms. Hickton. 
Director Nominations 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending the selection of director nominees to the Board. Once potential candidates are identified, including those candidates nominated by shareholders and/or identified by outside advisors or search firms, the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Lead Independent Director and the Chair and CEO review the backgrounds of those candidates with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Final candidates are then chosen and interviewed by non-management directors and executive management of the Company. 
20     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Based on the interviews, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then makes its recommendation to the Board of Directors. If the Board of Directors approves the recommendation, the candidate is nominated for election. With regard to procedures for shareholder nominations of directors for election, please see the requirements described below under "Shareholders' Proposals." The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders in accordance with these procedures.

The Corporate Governance Guidelines address the following matters: 
22     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Director Education 
The Board recognizes the importance of director continuing education and is committed to provide such education in order to enhance both Board and Committee performance. Accordingly, as noted in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company regularly provides the Board with education programs, presentations and briefings on topics relevant to the Company, its business and risk profile. In addition, each year the Board engages a third-party provider to host an educational program for members of the Board on matters relevant to the Company or relating to duties and responsibilities of directors. Directors are also encouraged to attend at least one outside educational program each year on any subjects pertaining to the directors' responsibilities such as "directors' colleges." Additionally, new directors must participate in the Company's orientation program for new directors. 
Annual Performance Evaluations 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, together with the Lead Independent Director, coordinates annual Board performance evaluations and periodic individual director reviews. The Chairs of each of the Committees coordinate annual performance evaluations of their respective Committees. 
Attendance at Meetings of the Board and its Committees and the Shareholder Meeting 
Overall director attendance at meetings of the Board and its Committees was 99% during fiscal 2018. Each individual director attended at least 75% of all meetings of the Board and all Committees on which they serve during fiscal 2018. Board members are expected to attend annual meetings of shareholders. All of the members of our Board attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Code of Ethics 
In addition to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors has adopted the following other codes, guidelines, and policies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for Members of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓    Code of Conduct.  
[END TABLE]
These documents, along with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, serve as the foundation for the Company's system of corporate governance. They provide guidance for maintaining ethical behavior, require that directors and employees comply with applicable laws and regulations, prohibit conflicts of interest, and provide mechanisms for reporting violations of the Company's policies and procedures. 
2019 Proxy Statement |        23 
In the event the Company makes any amendment to, or grants any waiver from, a provision of the code of ethics that applies to the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, or principal accounting officer that requires disclosure under applicable SEC rules, the Company will disclose such amendment or waiver and the reasons therefore on its website at www.jacobs.com. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
In an effort to more closely align the Company's non-management directors' financial interests with those of our shareholders, the Board of Directors has established stock ownership guidelines for non-management directors. Under these guidelines, the Company's non-management directors are expected to own equity in the Company (including common stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units) valued at a minimum of five times their annual cash retainer. Non-management directors are restricted from selling any shares of common stock during any period in which they have not met these ownership guidelines. As of the end of fiscal 2018, all non-management directors exceeded these guidelines or were within the five-year period from their appointment date, at the time of which they are expected to meet the guidelines. 
Similarly, the Company has established stock ownership guidelines for senior management. Under these guidelines, the Company's senior management is expected to own equity in the Company (including common stock, restricted stock or restricted stock units, but excluding unvested performance share units or unexcised options) within 3-5 years of entering their respective positions valued as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position           Multiple of       Base Salary   
 Position           Multiple of       Base Salary   
 Chair and CEO    6x 
 EVP/Presidents of Lines of Business    3x 
 Other  Senior Management (SVPs)    2x 
[END TABLE]
Members of senior management are not required to purchase shares of common stock to reach the applicable threshold, but are restricted from selling any shares of common stock during any period in which they have not met these ownership guidelines. This restriction does not apply to the withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements. As of the end of fiscal 2018, all named executive officers (or NEOs) exceeded their respective guidelines.

Compensation of Directors 
Determination of Non-Employee Director Compensation 
Each year, the Board determines non-employee director compensation based upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. In making a recommendation, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers market data for the Company's peer group, which is the same peer group used for the Company's executive compensation benchmarking, and input from FW Cook, the independent consultant retained by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding market practices for director compensation. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee intends to set non-employee director compensation levels at or near the market median relative to directors at companies of comparable size, industry, and scope of operations. This ensures directors are paid competitively for their time, commitment and responsibilities, which enables us to attract and retain highly qualified directors. During fiscal 2018, the independent consultant conducted a review of director compensation levels relative to the Company's peer group and recommended certain changes to ensure the program remains aligned with median competitive practices, including increasing the cash retainer from $110,000 to $115,000 and the annual equity value from $135,000 to $150,000. The Board approved these changes effective January 2018. Directors who are employees of the Company or its affiliates do not receive separate compensation for their board activities. 
Additional Director Compensation for Periods of Unusually High Activity 
Based on the recommendation of the independent consultant, during fiscal 2018 the Board adopted a policy under which non-employee directors may be compensated for periods of unusually high Board or committee activity. The intention of this policy is to provide additional compensation for periods of unusual activity only and not for ordinary course of business. The Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the number of regularly scheduled Board meetings per year will be five or six and the new policy provides that beginning with the ninth meeting in a fiscal year, the Company will pay an additional $2,000 special fee for each additional meeting to the non-employee directors. In the event the Board forms a special committee, the Company will pay the additional 
2019 Proxy Statement |        25 
 $2,000 special fee beginning with the fifth special committee meeting. During fiscal 2018, the Company did not pay any special fees under this new policy, as the Board and all committees except the Audit Committee held fewer than nine meetings. 
Director Compensation During Fiscal 2018 
Cash Retainers. The Company paid non-management directors a cash retainer of $110,000 per year through the first fiscal quarter of 2018 and $115,000 per year thereafter. In addition, the Lead Independent Director receives an additional cash retainer of $100,000 per year, and the Chair of each Committee receives an additional cash retainer of $20,000 per year. 
Equity. For fiscal 2018, the Board set the annual equity value to be awarded to non-management directors at approximately $150,000 and, accordingly, granted each non-management director an award of 2,162 restricted stock units ("RSUs") on January 18, 2018. Such grants were made pursuant to the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1999 Outside Director Stock Plan, as amended and restated (the "1999 Outside Director Plan"). Each RSU grant vests upon the earlier of (i) the next annual shareholder meeting or (ii) the one-year anniversary of the grant date. If the Company pays a cash dividend on its outstanding common stock, RSUs will be credited with cash dividend equivalent rights ("Dividend Equivalents") which are paid to such director upon the vesting of the RSU and distribution of the underlying share of common stock as described below in the section entitled "Executive Compensation—Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan Based Awards Table—Payment of Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Rights". Each director also receives cash dividends with respect to each outstanding restricted stock award ("RSA") as and when paid to shareholders of common stock. Additionally, non-management directors are eligible to participate in the Jacobs Director Deferral Plan, pursuant to which each director may defer all or a portion of such director's cash retainer or RSUs. 
The table below sets forth the compensation earned by each of the Company's non-management directors during fiscal 2018.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 — ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
What are you voting on? 
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, this proposal seeks a shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules (which includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table, and the related compensation tables and narrative disclosures)." 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the Company, the Board of Directors, or the Human Resource and Compensation Committee (the "Compensation Committee"), and will not be construed as overruling a decision by the Company, the Board, or the Compensation Committee or creating or implying any additional fiduciary duty for the Company, the Board, or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value the opinions that shareholders express in their votes and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
At our 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, our shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, a frequency of every year for casting advisory votes approving our executive compensation. After the Annual Meeting, our next advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at our 2020 annual meeting of shareholders. 
What is the Vote Required? 
The approval of the advisory resolution on the Company's executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the advisory resolution. Broker non-votes will have no effect of the outcome of the advisory vote. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   The Board of  Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the advisory resolution approving the Company's executive compensation.

[END TABLE]

The Compensation Decision Process 
The Compensation Committee directly retains the services of independent consultants and other experts to assist in fulfilling its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee currently engages the services of FW Cook (the "Independent Consultant"), a national executive compensation consulting firm, to review and provide recommendations concerning all of the components of the Company's compensation programs. The Independent Consultant performs services on behalf of the Compensation Committee and has no relationship with the Company or management except as it may relate to performing such services. the Independent Consultant also advises the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee on outside director compensation. The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of the Independent Consultant, pursuant to the rules of the SEC and the NYSE and concluded that the Independent Consultant is independent and no conflict of interest exists with respect to the services provided by the Independent Consultant to the Compensation Committee. 
During fiscal 2018, the CEO and other members of our senior executive team worked with the Compensation Committee to help ensure that our executive compensation programs are competitive, ethical, and aligned with the Company's values. For fiscal 2018, compensation decisions for the NEOs (other than our CEO) were made by the Compensation Committee after consultation with the CEO, and the compensation decision with respect to our CEO was approved by the full Board upon recommendation from the Compensation Committee. 
Assessing Compensation Competitiveness 
The Compensation Committee, with the help of the Independent Consultant, annually compares each element of compensation to that of an industry peer group. For fiscal 2018, as part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee determined that the peer group should be comprised of (1) construction and engineering firms that are direct competitors with the Company for business and executive management talent or (2) companies that provide consulting or technical services to government and large commercial clients. In addition, to be included, a company would need to be generally within one-third to three times the size of the Company in terms of revenue and market capitalization, evaluated annually. 
Similar to prior years, in order to assess compensation competitiveness compared to the peer group, the Independent Consultant utilized comparative data disclosed in publicly available proxy statements, other documents filed with the SEC, and data from a comprehensive database of pay information developed by Willis Towers Watson regarding the industry specific and general industry group in which the Company competes for talent. 
The following chart shows our fiscal 2018 industry peer group, including relevant size and performance data to illustrate the Company's relative position.

For fiscal 2018, as part of its annual review, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Independent Consultant, added Halliburton to the peer group and removed CH2M due to its acquisition by Jacobs. For fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Independent Consultant, maintained the current peer selection criteria and group size used in fiscal 2018. Based on that criteria, Cognizant Technology Solutions and Parker-Hannifin were added to the peer group and Chicago Bridge & Iron was removed from the peer group due to its acquisition by McDermott International. 
Shareholder Engagement and Say-on-Pay 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 In evaluating the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the results of the advisory  vote on the "say-on-pay" proposal. At the Company's 2018 annual meeting, 95.9% of the voting shares approved the proposal. This followed similar results  from the Company's 2017 annual meeting, where 96.4% of the voting shares approved the proposal. The Compensation Committee believes these results, which show a significant improvement over the 80.9% approval received at the Company's 2016  annual meeting, were due to positive changes made to the Company's executive compensation program in fiscal 2016 and carried forward.   Members of executive leadership and our Board frequently engage with shareholders and host open, ongoing dialogues around corporate governance  matters, including executive compensation. Taking into account the positive support received in both 2017 and 2018 after instituting changes to the compensation program in 2016, the Compensation Committee believes the Company provides a competitive pay-for-performance package that effectively incentivizes and retains executives.

Compensation Elements 
During fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee utilized findings by the Independent Consultant to determine that the Company's executive compensation program continued to be both reasonable in relation to competitive pay levels and appropriate in supporting business objectives and a positive performance-based culture. As reflected in the charts below, variable/at risk compensation represents the majority of the total target direct compensation of our CEO and other NEOs. 
34     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Total target direct compensation refers to base salary, short-term incentive compensation (measured at target for the fiscal year) and long-term equity incentive compensation based on grant date fair values (measured at target for PSUs and RSUs). In determining the executive's overall compensation, the Compensation Committee takes into account the absolute and relative value of each component and the overall mix. As with prior years, the Compensation Committee generally allocated the long-term incentive awards with 60% of the values as PSUs and 40% of the values as RSUs. 
The above charts represent our fiscal 2018 total target direct compensation arrangements for our CEO and our other NEOs, including Mr. Mandel's additional bonus opportunity tied to achieving cost synergy targets related to the integration of the CH2M acquisition, but excluding Mr. Pragada's additional cash incentive payment received in recognition of his leadership role in the due diligence process, negotiations in connection with the CH2M acquisition and its successful closure, as Mr. Pragada's payment was a special cash bonus and not part of his fiscal 2018 target direct compensation. 
Base Salary 
In setting the base salaries of our NEOs, the Compensation Committee utilizes information provided by its Independent Consultant to determine the competitiveness of base salaries compared to the industry peer group and market survey data. 
The Compensation Committee also considers the fact that the Company provides limited perquisites. This stems from the Compensation Committee's belief that focusing on the three core elements of compensation (base salary and short- and long-term incentive compensation) results in a more transparent and easier-to-administer pay system and is more consistent with the Company's culture. For example, the Company's currently available retirement program in the U.S. consists solely of a tax-qualified 401(k) plan with matching contributions and a non-qualified salary and bonus (including equity compensation) deferral plan that provides non-enhanced market returns. Perquisites are generally limited to financial planning and annual health assessments. 
After considering market data from our peer group and other market survey information, the Compensation Committee determined that the base salaries of our CEO and CFO for fiscal 2018 would remain at the same levels as fiscal 2017. Effective December 23, 2017, Messrs. Hagen, Mandel and Pragada received base salary increases of 3.8%, 4.2% and 3.6%, respectively, to reflect their successful performance in fiscal 2017 and increased job responsibilities as a result of the CH2M acquisition. 
The following table sets forth the base salaries of each of our NEOs for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.

Short-Term Incentives 
The Management Incentive Plan (MIP) continues to reinforce our commitment to profitable growth and effective cash management with specific measures and targets assigned to each participant based on his or her respective role in the organization. As described below, this plan provides for bonus payouts to eligible employees when certain Company-wide and business unit-specific target goals are achieved. 
2019 Proxy Statement |        35 
For fiscal 2018, select officers and managers of the Company, including the NEOs, were eligible to participate in the MIP. As shown in the following chart, an employee's target MIP award is calculated by multiplying (i) the employee's annual base salary as of July 1 of the applicable fiscal year by (ii) his or her target percentage of salary. An employee's actual MIP award amount is calculated by multiplying (i) the employee's annual base salary as of July 1 of the applicable fiscal year, by (ii) his or her target percentage of salary, and then by (iii) the performance achievement factor.

• Consolidated Operating Profit means total gross margin less selling, general and  administrative expenses ("SG&A") of the Company, as adjusted for special items that are unusual, non-recurring or otherwise not indicative of the Company's normal operations and which were  not anticipated in setting the original targets. Any such adjustments must be approved by the Compensation Committee. For example, such adjustments include, without limitation: (i) charges for restructurings; (ii) gains or losses on the  disposal of a segment of the business or in connection with discontinued operations; (iii) charges for the impairment of goodwill or other long-lived assets; (iv) gains / losses on the sale of assets; (v) major litigation settlements  and/or other judgments; (vi) the effects of changes in accounting principles, laws or regulations affecting reported results; and (vii) costs and expenses relating to acquisitions.  
• Consolidated DSO (Days Sales Outstanding) means the average of the four quarters ended  September 28, 2018 of (i) accounts receivable of the Company at the end of each quarter divided by (ii) the daily sales for each quarter.  
• Operating Profit means for each line of business, total gross margin earned by such  applicable line of business, as adjusted for unusual or non-recurring items as set forth above, less the SG&A for the applicable line of business and less allocated corporate SG&A expenses, including  cash and equity incentive compensation.  
• GM in Backlog means for each line of business, starting Gross Margin in Backlog for  such applicable line of business as adjusted for (1) new awards, (2) scope increases of new and existing work, (3) cancellations and corrections of understatements/overstatements, (4) acquisitions, and (5) the foreign  exchange effect, less the Gross Margin burn for the fiscal year. Gross Margin in Backlog must follow Jacobs' backlog rules for various contract types.  
[END TABLE]
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee used its discretion to approve adjustments to the levels of performance metric results to reflect the exclusion of (i) charges associated with an ATEN legal matter initiated in 2013, (ii) benefits associated with a BIAF legal matter initiated in 2009 and (iii) CH2M's operating profit associated with the "stub period" of CH2M ownership from the date of acquisition on December 18, 2017 through the end of CH2M's fiscal year on December 31, 2017. 
Achieving minimum performance levels result in a payout of 25% of target; target performance levels result in a payout of 100% of target; and maximum performance levels result in a payout of 200% of target. Actual award payments are calculated by linear interpolation for achievement of goals other than those specified. 
38     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
The payment of bonuses for fiscal 2018 to the NEOs was conditioned upon the Company achieving a performance goal of $100 million of net earnings in an effort to be fully deductible as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). This goal was met, thus the participating NEOs became entitled to receive a bonus payment equal to 200% of their target bonus, subject to the complete discretion of the Compensation Committee to reduce the bonus payment to a lesser amount. The Compensation Committee exercised its discretion to reduce bonus amounts in accordance with the methodology described above. 
Equity-Based Compensation 
The Compensation Committee believes that long-term equity incentives should comprise the majority of compensation for the Company's senior management, including the NEOs. In deciding upon the design and magnitude of long-term incentives, the Compensation Committee is guided by several factors, including alignment with shareholder interests, ease of understanding by participants, and retentiveness. The Compensation Committee also takes into account market data, information and recommendations from the Independent Consultant, and information provided by management, including recommendations by the CEO with respect to the magnitude of equity incentives for executive officers other than himself. Other than off-cycle awards for new hires, promotions or retention grants, the Compensation Committee generally awards equity incentives to NEOs and senior management in the first 90 days of each fiscal year. 
To determine the dollar value of awards to be granted to the NEOs and consistent with its prior process for determining the magnitude of awards, the Compensation Committee examined data with respect to competitive grant values at the industry peer group companies. It also considered the size of the awards previously granted to the NEOs, which reflected the Compensation Committee's previous evaluation of the magnitude of awards considered necessary in order to align the awards with competitive levels. The determination of award levels in fiscal 2018 also took into account the Compensation Committee's review of the CEO's performance and that of the other NEOs (and the CEO's recommendations with respect to the other NEOs), as well as the Company's overall performance. The Compensation Committee also took into account the increased job responsibilities of the NEOs resulting from the acquisition of CH2M. 
In fiscal 2018, our NEOs' equity-based compensation consisted of the following awards, other than Mr. Mandel who received 100% of his fiscal 2018 equity grant in RSUs:

Fiscal 2018 Equity Awards 
Performance Stock Units (PSUs) 
Fiscal 2018 PSU awards will vest, following a three-year performance period (starting on the first day of fiscal 2018 and ending on the last day of fiscal 2020), based on the following performance metrics: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  -    50% of the PSUs will vest based on the Company's achievement of a certain EPS Growth Rate over a three-year  performance period (the "EPS Based PSU Awards"); and  
  -    50% of the PSUs will vest based on the Company's achievement of a certain ROIC during the same three-year performance  period (the "ROIC Based PSU Awards").  
[END TABLE]
Earnings Per Share (EPS) Based PSU Awards: 
The Compensation Committee believes that EPS is a key indicator of a company's performance for shareholders. It is the predominant metric used in performance-based equity awards of the Company's peers and its use is intended to improve the focus on profitability, growth and financial discipline, while aligning the interests of the Company's senior executives with the long-term interests of shareholders. 
The number of EPS Based PSU Awards that will vest (and the corresponding number of shares that will be issued at the end of the three-year performance period) is based on the Company's EPS Growth Rate measured at the end of each of fiscal 2018, 2019 and 2020, in each case measured from fiscal 2017 EPS. Amounts are locked in annually but not distributed until after the three-year performance period. This calculation is shown in the following charts:

"EPS" for any fiscal period is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Earnings by the weighted average number of shares of the Company's common stock outstanding during the period. 
"Adjusted Net Earnings" means the net earnings attributable to the Company as reported in its consolidated financial statements for such period determined in accordance with GAAP (A) as may be adjusted to eliminate the effects of (i) costs associated with restructuring and integration activities, regardless of whether the Company discloses publicly the amount of such restructuring and integration costs or the fact that the Company engaged in restructuring and integration activities during the periods restructuring costs were incurred; and (ii) gains or losses associated with discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, but limited to the first reporting period an operation is determined to be discontinued and all subsequent periods (i.e., there will be no retroactive application of the adjustment); and (B) as adjusted for all gains or losses associated with events or transactions that the Compensation Committee has determined are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring and otherwise not indicative of the Company's normal operations, and therefore, not indicative of the underlying Company performance. For these purposes, such events or transactions could include: (i) settlements of claims and litigation, (ii) disposals of operations including a disposition of a significant amount of the Company's assets, (iii) losses on sales of investments, (iv) changes in laws and/or regulations, and (v) acquisitions. 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Based PSU Awards: 
The Compensation Committee believes that ROIC is an effective means of linking executive compensation to value creation that holds management accountable for the efficient use of capital, and has used this performance metric for fiscal 2017 and 2018 awards. Prior to fiscal 2017, the Company granted awards that vested based on the Company's total shareholder return (or TSR) compared to that of its peer group over a three-year period. 
2019 Proxy Statement |        41 
The number of ROIC Based PSU Awards that will vest (and the corresponding number of shares to be issued) is based on the Company's average ROIC measured at the end of the three-year performance period. The calculation is shown in the following charts:

The "Return on Invested Capital" (or ROIC) for any fiscal period is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Earnings by the average invested capital on the first day of fiscal 2018 and on the last day of fiscal 2020. Invested capital is the sum of equity plus long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents. 
"Adjusted Net Earnings" means the net earnings attributable to the Company as reported in its consolidated financial statements for such period determined in accordance with GAAP (A) as may be adjusted to eliminate the effects of (i) costs associated with restructuring and integration activities, regardless of whether the Company discloses publicly the amount of such restructuring and integration costs or the fact that the Company engaged in restructuring and integration activities during the periods restructuring costs were incurred; and (ii) gains or losses associated with discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with GAAP, but limited to the first reporting period an operation is determined to be discontinued and all subsequent periods (i.e., there will be no retroactive application of the adjustment); and (B) as adjusted for all gains or losses associated with events or transactions that the Compensation Committee has determined are unusual in nature, infrequently occurring and otherwise not indicative of the Company's normal operations, and therefore, not indicative of the underlying Company performance. For these purposes, such events or transactions could include: (i) settlements of claims and litigation, (ii) disposals of operations including a disposition of a significant amount of the Company's assets, (iii) losses on sales of investments, (iv) changes in laws and/or regulations, and (v) acquisitions. 
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Grants: 
The 2018 RSU awards vest ratably over a four-year period, other than RSUs granted to Mr. Mandel, which vest ratably over a two-year period due to the short-term nature of Mr. Mandel's role overseeing the integration of the CH2M acquisition. 
Vesting Provisions Applicable to Fiscal 2018 Equity Grants: 
To incentivize senior management during periods of uncertainty leading up to the CH2M acquisition and subsequent integration, all equity awards granted in fiscal 2018, including equity awards granted to the NEOs, provide for accelerated vesting in the event of an involuntarily termination of employment without cause as follows: 
For the RSUs, upon an involuntary termination of employment without cause prior to the first annual vesting date, 50% of the RSUs will vest at the time of separation, and upon an involuntary termination of employment without cause on or after the first vesting date, the remaining outstanding and unvested RSUs will vest at the time of separation. For the PSUs, upon an involuntary termination of employment without cause prior to the final vesting date, a pro-rated portion of PSUs (based on the number of days during the performance period that the 
42     | 2019 Proxy Statement employee was employed by the Company) shall remain outstanding and eligible to vest based on the performance vesting criteria through the end of the applicable performance period, and the remainder of the award will be forfeited at the time of separation for no consideration. 
Dividend Equivalent Rights 
All RSU awards are entitled to accumulated dividend equivalent rights that are subject to the same vesting, payment and other terms and conditions as the underlying award to which the dividend equivalent relates. The crediting of dividend equivalents is intended to treat the equity award holders consistently with shareholders and preserve the equity-based incentives intended by the Company when the awards were granted. The dividend equivalents pay in cash upon the vesting and settlement of the underlying RSUs. 
Long-Term Incentive Plan Metrics and Performance Attainment – PSU with Performance Periods Ending in Fiscal 2018 
Four of our NEOs served as executive officers of the Company in fiscal 2015 and received grants of PSUs at that time: Messrs. Demetriou, Berryman, Hagen and Mandel (Mr. Pragada was not employed by the Company in fiscal 2015). These awards were based on a three-year performance period that leveraged both short- and long-term goals. If certain thresholds of performance were not attained, then no payout was earned for the award. The performance metrics associated with these PSUs were weighted at 100% Net Earnings Growth ("NEG"), with the performance period beginning on the first day of the third quarter of fiscal 2015 and ending on the last day of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 
2015 Net Earnings Growth (NEG) Based PSU Awards 
The method of calculating the number of shares underlying the PSUs based on NEG (the "NEG Based Awards") granted in fiscal 2015 that vested is summarized below. 
The total number of units awarded accumulated over the three-year performance period in three segments: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One-third of award is based on NEG in Year 1 (Q3 FY2015 – Q2 FY2016);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One-third of award is based on average NEG in Years 1 – 2 (Q3 FY2015 – Q2  FY2017); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• One-third of award is based on average NEG in Years 1 – 3 (Q3 FY2015 – Q2  FY2018).  
[END TABLE]
The first two years of the program are considered a "lock in" period, meaning it was possible to "lock in" vesting of up to two-thirds of the total potential award based on performance during that period. The following NEG performance vesting schedule was approved by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2015:

Grant Process 
The Compensation Committee has delegated certain limited authority to the CEO to make equity grants in accordance with the rules established by the Compensation Committee for non-executive officers throughout the year. As soon as administratively practicable after a new hire, promotion, or retention warrants an equity grant, the CEO reviews and approves the award. All awards are granted when the CEO takes action. The Compensation Committee periodically receives reports of the CEO's actions. In fiscal 2018, no awards were made on a date other than when the Compensation Committee met or following approval by the CEO pursuant to delegated authority. 
Other Benefits and Policies 
Benefits Programs 
With the exception of the Company's Executive Severance Plan, Executive Deferral Plan ("EDP"), which is generally available to most of senior management, and certain expatriate arrangements, the Company provides executives with the same benefit plans offered to U.S. staff employees. 
401(k) Plan: During fiscal 2018, the CEO and other NEOs were eligible to participate in the Company's 401(k) plan, the same plan offered to the Company's full-time employees in the United States. The plan provides a match by the Company equal to 50% of the first 6% of eligible pay (currently $275,000). None of the NEOs participated in any defined benefit retirement or supplemental retirement benefit plan. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plans: The Company has qualified employee stock purchase plans in which all employees meeting certain minimum eligibility requirements in certain countries are eligible to participate. The Company adopted a safe-harbor plan design in 2006 that provides for a 5% discount from the closing price of a share of common stock at the end of each purchase period. The safe-harbor plan results in no accounting cost to the Company. 
44     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Non-qualified Executive Deferral Plan (EDP): Select employees, including the NEOs, meeting certain compensation minimums may elect to participate in the Company's EDP whereby a portion of salary and bonus (including equity compensation) is deferred and paid to the employees at some future date including upon retirement or death. Participant deferrals are credited with earnings and losses based upon the actual experience of the deemed investments selected by participants with equity compensation deferrals generally being credited with earnings and losses based on the actual experience of the Company's common stock. See "Executive Compensation—Non-qualified Deferred Compensation" below for a further description of the EDP. 
Executive Severance Plan: Recognizing the prevalence of severance plans among our peers and the need to attract and retain talented executives, in fiscal 2018 the Company adopted an Executive Severance Plan that provides severance benefits to certain key executives, including the NEOS, designated by the Compensation Committee from time to time in the event of either (i) a termination of employment by the Company other than for cause that is unrelated to a change of control or (ii) a termination of employment by the Company other than for cause or by the participant for good reason, in each case during the two-year period following a change of control. 
Perquisites 
Our NEOs are eligible for the same benefits as those offered to staff employees, including relocation benefits. Executives may have spousal travel paid for by the Company only when it is for an approved business purpose, in which case a related tax gross-up is provided. NEOs are also provided with financial planning assistance and annual health assessment benefits. 
The Company leases a private aircraft to allow certain executive officers, primarily the CEO, to safely and efficiently travel for business purposes around the world. Use of a private aircraft provides a confidential and highly productive environment for executive officers to conduct business while traveling. We do not allow personal usage of the private aircraft at the Company's expense. Incidental travel by family members of an executive officer in connection with such executive's business travel is permitted so long as the executive reimburses the Company for the cost of such travel. 
Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Executive Severance Plan: As described above, the Company adopted an Executive Severance Plan in fiscal 2018 that provides the following severance benefits to certain key executives, including the NEOs (with certain exceptions for Mr. Mandel, as described below), in the event of either (i) a qualifying involuntary termination of employment that is unrelated to a change in control or (ii) a qualifying termination of employment during the two-year period following a change of control. Payments under this plan are conditioned upon the receipt of a customary waiver and general release of claims from the executive. In addition, the executives will be subject to restrictive covenants, including non-disclosure of confidential information, non-disparagement restrictions and 12-month non-competition and non-solicitation obligations. Payments under this plan do not include any tax gross-ups. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Change in Control Severance Benefits—In the event of a termination  of the participant's employment by the Company other than for cause (as defined in the plan), the participant will be entitled to receive the following benefits: (i) a cash payment equal to 1.5 times (for the CEO) or 1 times (for the other  NEOs with the exception of Mr. Mandel as described below, and covered executives) the sum of the participant's (x) base salary and (y) target annual incentive award; and (ii) a cash payment equal to 1.5 times (for the CEO)  or 1 times (for the other NEOs and covered executives) the sum of (x) the annual COBRA premium for continued participation in the Company's group health plans and (y) the annual fee for continued receipt of financial advisory  services. In addition, the participant's unvested and outstanding equity awards that are scheduled to vest within the nine month period following the date of termination will continue to vest in accordance with their original vesting schedule.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in Control Severance Benefits—In the event of a termination of the participant's employment by the  Company other than for cause or by the participant for good reason (as defined in the Plan), in each case within the two year period after a change in control (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), the participant will be entitled to receive  the following benefits: (i) a cash payment equal to 2 times (for the CEO) or 1 times (for the other NEOs and covered executives) the sum of the participant's (x) base   
[END TABLE]
2019 Proxy Statement |        45 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     salary and (y) target annual incentive award; and (ii) a cash payment equal to the participant's target annual incentive award, prorated based on the number of days the participant  was employed during the fiscal year of termination; and (iii) a cash payment equal to 2 times (for the CEO) or 1 times (for the other NEOs and covered executives) the sum of (x) the annual COBRA premium for continued participation in the  Company's group health plans and (y) the annual fee for continued receipt of financial advisory services. In the event such termination occurs, unvested and outstanding equity awards are governed by the Stock Incentive Plan as described  below.  
[END TABLE]
Employment Agreements: During fiscal 2018, the Company was party to an employment agreement with Mr. Mandel, which was entered into in connection with the completion of a transaction pursuant to which the Company acquired Mr. Mandel's former employer. This employment agreement provided for benefits in the event of termination of employment that is not in connection with a change in control. Under this employment agreement, Mr. Mandel was entitled to a severance payment equal to 12 months of base salary and the continuation costs of 12 months of COBRA premiums upon a termination by the Company without cause (as defined in the employment agreement), conditioned upon his execution and non-revocation of a general release in favor of the Company. Mr. Mandel participated in the Executive Severance Plan for benefits in the event of termination of employment in connection with a change in control, as described above. 
On November 20, 2018, the Company entered into a Retirement Transition Agreement with Mr. Mandel. The Retirement Transition Agreement supersedes and replaces Mr. Mandel's employment agreement with the Company and terminates his participation in the Executive Severance Plan for benefits in the event of a termination of employment in connection with a change in control. The Retirement Transition Agreement, which contains a general release in favor of the Company, provides that effective April 1, 2019, Mr. Mandel will begin transitioning to his retirement from the Company effective December 31, 2019 (the "Transition Period"). During the Transition Period, Mr. Mandel will continue to serve as a special advisor to Jacobs' Chief Executive Officer on a modified, full-time basis. During this Transition Period, Mr. Mandel will receive the equivalent of 12 months base salary, plus he will maintain his health and welfare benefits. Provided Mr. Mandel is not involuntarily terminated with cause, as defined in the Retirement Transition Agreement, and he executes a supplemental general release agreement upon his retirement date, Mr. Mandel will also receive a termination payment of $250,000. The Retirement Transition Agreement provides discretion to the Company to increase the termination payment if determined appropriate by the Company, in its sole discretion, based on an evaluation of the services performed by Mr. Mandel during the Transition Period. Under the Retirement Transition Agreement, Mr. Mandel is not eligible to participate in the Company's fiscal 2019 long term incentive plans or Management Incentive Plan. 
Stock Incentive Plan: Consistent with all participants in the 1999 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended, NEOs may be entitled to prorated vesting at retirement of PSUs granted during fiscal 2016 and thereafter. In the case of a participant whose employment is terminated in the event of death or Disability (as defined in the Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. 1999 Stock Incentive Plan), the terms of our stock options and RSA and RSU grants provide for accelerated vesting while PSUs would remain outstanding and eligible to vest, with the final determination of the payout, if any, generally determined at the end of the three-year performance period. Additionally, the terms of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs provide for potential double trigger equity acceleration upon certain terminations following a Change in Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan) as a means of focusing executive officers on shareholder interests when considering strategic alternatives. If a Change in Control occurs and certain options, restricted stock, RSUs and PSUs are not assumed and continued by the acquiring or surviving corporation in the transaction (or a parent corporation thereof), then all such awards will vest immediately, with awards of restricted stock that are subject to performance-based vesting criteria and/or PSUs paid at a level based upon the Company's actual performance as of the date of the Change in Control. 
The estimated payments and benefits provided in each of the covered circumstances may be found under "Executive Compensation—Compensation Under Various Termination Scenarios" below. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Company has established stock ownership guidelines for its executive officers. The ownership guidelines provide that the Chair and CEO is expected to own Company stock valued at six times his annual base salary and the CFO, Presidents of Lines of Business and Executive Vice Presidents are expected to own Company stock valued at three times their annual base salary. Other senior executives, including Senior Vice 
46     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
 Presidents, are expected to own Company stock valued at two times their annual base salary. Executive officers are restricted from selling any shares of common stock (other than the withholding of shares to satisfy tax withholding requirements) during any period in which they have not satisfied the guidelines. The Compensation Committee reviews each executive officer's holdings with respect to these ownership guidelines each year. As of the end of fiscal 2018, all NEOs exceeded their respective guidelines. See the discussion under "Corporate Governance — Stock Ownership Guidelines" above for further information. 
Insider Trading and Policy on Hedging or Pledging of Stock 
The Company's insider trading policy contains stringent restrictions on transactions in Company stock by executive officers and directors. All trades by executive officers and directors must be pre-cleared. The executive officers and directors are prohibited from any trading in puts or calls of Company stock, from engaging in short sales of Company stock, and from hedging or pledging Company stock or using it as loan collateral or as part of a margin account. 
Clawback Policy 
The Compensation Committee maintains a clawback policy with respect to incentive awards granted to executive officers. The Company is authorized to recover a portion of incentive awards paid within three years of a financial statement that is inaccurate due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. Recovery applies to the extent a lesser amount would have been paid under the restated financial statement. 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Code limits deductions for certain executive compensation in excess of $1,000,000 in any fiscal year, and prior to the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Act"), compensation that qualified as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) was excluded from this limit. The Act repealed this "performance-based compensation" exclusion effective for fiscal years beginning on January 1, 2018 with limited transition relief. Prior to the Act, the Company structured its compensation arrangements to permit deductibility under Section 162(m) to the extent possible, unless the benefit of such deductibility was outweighed by the need for flexibility or the attainment of other corporate objectives in which case the Compensation Committee was prepared to enter into compensation arrangements under which payments may not be deductible under Section 162(m). 
Following the Act, the Company will continue to consider tax deductibility as a factor in determining executive compensation but may not structure its compensation arrangements around deductibility. The Company believes the tax deduction limitation should not compromise its ability to design and maintain executive compensation arrangements that will attract and retain highly qualified employees and motivate them to deliver value to our customers and shareholders. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
As part of its oversight, the Compensation Committee considers the impact of the Company's executive compensation program, and the incentives created by the compensation awards that it administers, on the Company's risk profile. The Compensation Committee also retains an independent consultant to conduct a risk assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices. 
In addition, the Company reviews all of its compensation policies and practices, including incentive plan design and factors that may affect the likelihood of excessive risk taking, to determine whether they present a significant risk to the Company. The Company's pay philosophy provides an effective balance in cash and equity mix, short- and long-term performance periods, financial and non-financial performance, and allows for the Compensation Committee's discretion to make negative adjustments to payouts under the Company's compensation plans. Further, policies to mitigate compensation-related risk include stock ownership guidelines, vesting periods on equity, insider-trading prohibitions, and independent Compensation Committee oversight. 
Based on this review, both for our executive officers and all other employees, the Company and the independent compensation consultant concluded that the risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved this conclusion.

  (1)  Consists of base salary earned during the fiscal year including any time off with pay. Mr. Pragada began employment  with the Company on February 1, 2016 with a starting annual salary of $675,000. In fiscal 2016, Mr. Pragada earned a pro-rata portion of his salary based on his start date.  
  (2)  In fiscal 2018, the $300,000 for Mr. Pragada represents a bonus awarded in recognition of his leadership role in the  due diligence process, negotiations in connection with the CH2M acquisition and its successful closure. In fiscal 2017, the $350,000 for Mr. Pragada represents a portion of his hiring bonus in addition to the $500,000 he received in fiscal  2016. In fiscal 2016, Messrs. Berryman, Mandel and Hagen received cash transition bonuses of $375,000, $375,000 and $425,000, respectively, to ensure ongoing stability and continuity of leadership during the CEO transition period that began in  fiscal 2015. For Mr. Berryman, the $875,000 also consists of the portion of his hiring bonus received in fiscal 2016 in the amount of $500,000.  
  (3)  Represents the grant date fair value of stock awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan in accordance with Financial  Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Stock Compensation ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). Please refer to Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the  Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the assumptions used to calculate these amounts. For the fiscal 2018 amounts, this column reflects the combined value of RSUs and PSUs granted  in November 2017 (except for Mr. Mandel, who received RSUs only). At the highest level of performance, the value of such fiscal 2018 PSUs on the grant date would be: $10,800,159 for Mr.Demetriou; $2,400,007 for Mr. Berryman; $2,009,989 for  Mr. Hagen; and $2,040,070 for Mr. Pragada. At the highest level of performance, the value of such fiscal 2017 PSUs on the grant date would be: $9,000,174 for Mr.Demetriou; $2,040,089 for Mr. Berryman; $1,740,138 for Mr. Hagen;  $2,040,089 for Mr. Mandel; and $1,740,138 for Mr. Pragada. At the highest level of performance, the value of such fiscal 2016 PSUs on the grant date would be: $6,918,816 for Mr.Demetriou; $1,729,742 for Mr. Berryman; $1,351,328 for  Mr. Hagen; $1,729,742 for Mr. Mandel; and $1,407,491 for Mr. Pragada.

Payment of Dividends and Dividend Equivalent Rights 
In fiscal 2017, the Company commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share and continued this policy through fiscal 2018. Holders of RSAs are entitled to receive such cash dividends unless and until the holder forfeits the shares of common stock underlying the RSAs pursuant to the terms of the relevant award agreement. 
With respect to RSUs, if the Company pays a cash dividend on its outstanding common stock, then each holder of RSUs is credited with a dollar amount equal to (i) the per-share cash dividend, multiplied by (ii) the total number of RSUs held by such individual on the record date for that dividend. These are referred to as Dividend Equivalents. Dividend Equivalents vest on the same schedule as the RSU to which they relate and will be paid to the award holder in cash at the same time the share of common stock (or, in the case of cash-settled RSUs, the cash) underlying the RSU is delivered to the award holder.

To determine the median employee, we used annual base compensation as the consistently applied compensation measure and selected July 1, 2018 as our measurement date. For full-time, salaried employees, annual base compensation was base salary, and for part-time, temporary and seasonal employees, it was hourly

 rate multiplied by hours worked. We annualized salaries and wages for our full and part-time employees who were not employed for the full year. For purposes of this disclosure, we used the U.S. dollar equivalent of the local currency, based on the average exchange rate for the three months period ended June 30, 2018 for each such foreign currency. Using this methodology, we determined that our median employee was a full-time, salaried employee located in Canada. After identifying the median employee, we calculated such median employee's total annual compensation in the same manner as we calculated our CEO's total annual compensation in the Summary Compensation Table on page 48. 
As permitted by SEC rules, we excluded all non-U.S. employees in each of the following countries in determining our median employee: Argentina (355), Armenia (16), Bahrain (31), Brazil (126), China (331), Columbia (1), Costa Rica (4), Denmark (6), Finland (12), France (44), Greece (2), Guatemala (4), Indonesia (43), Iraq (2), Israel (2), Italy (251), Japan (2), Kazakhstan (23), Kenya (1), Korea, Republic of (69), Kuwait (13), Liberia (2), Luxembourg (2), Malaysia (324), Mexico (300), Morocco (58), Norway (5), Oman (116), Panama (7), Peru (30), Philippines (208), Qatar (270), Romania (25), Russia (270), Saint Helena (3), Saint Lucia (1), South Africa (220), Spain (140), Sweden (96), Switzerland (90), Taiwan (6), Thailand (49), Trinidad and Tobago (9) and Uganda (1). In aggregate, we excluded a total of 3,570 employees from 44 countries, representing less than 5% of the Company's total workforce of approximately 74,750 people on July 1, 2018.

PROPOSAL NO. 3 — RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF 
ERNST & YOUNG LLP 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What are you voting on?   The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young or EY) to audit the consolidated  financial statements of the Company as of September 27, 2019, and for the fiscal year then ended. At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young.   The Audit Committees decision to  re-appoint our independent auditor was based on the following considerations:      The quality and performance of the lead audit partner and the overall engagement team;      Ernst & Youngs  knowledge of the industries and markets in which the Company operates;      Ernst & Youngs knowledge of the Companys operations;      Ernst & Youngs  global capabilities and technical expertise;      Ernst & Youngs independence and objectivity; and      The potential impact of rotating  to another independent audit firm.   The Company is not required to submit  the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to shareholders for approval, but is doing so as a matter of good corporate governance. If the appointment of Ernst & Young is not ratified by a majority of the shares of  common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting, then the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of other independent auditors whose selection for any period subsequent to the Annual Meeting will be subject to ratification  by the shareholders at the 2020 annual meeting.   Representatives of EY are  expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.     What is the Vote Required?   The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is  necessary to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019.   Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the  proposal.

The Audit Committees decision to  re-appoint our independent auditor was based on the following considerations:      The quality and performance of the lead audit partner and the overall engagement team;      Ernst & Youngs  knowledge of the industries and markets in which the Company operates;      Ernst & Youngs knowledge of the Companys operations;      Ernst & Youngs  global capabilities and technical expertise;      Ernst & Youngs independence and objectivity; and      The potential impact of rotating  to another independent audit firm.   The Company is not required to submit  the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm to shareholders for approval, but is doing so as a matter of good corporate governance. If the appointment of Ernst & Young is not ratified by a majority of the shares of  common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting, then the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of other independent auditors whose selection for any period subsequent to the Annual Meeting will be subject to ratification  by the shareholders at the 2020 annual meeting.   Representatives of EY are  expected to attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.     What is the Vote Required?   The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is  necessary to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 27, 2019.   Abstentions have the same effect as a vote against the  proposal.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee hereby reports as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  Management has primary responsibility for the accuracy and fairness of the Company's consolidated financial  statements as well as the processes employed to prepare the financial statements, and the system of internal control over financial reporting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  The Audit Committee represents the Board of Directors in discharging its responsibilities relating to the Company's  accounting, financial reporting, financial practices, and system of internal controls. As part of its oversight role, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with the Company's management the Company's audited consolidated financial  statements included in its 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  The Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's internal auditors and the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm, Ernst & Young, the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee has met with the internal auditors and Ernst & Young, separately and together, with and without management  present, to discuss the Company's financial reporting processes and system of internal control over financial reporting in addition to those matters required to be discussed with the independent auditors under the rules adopted by the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") in Rule 3200T.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young required by  applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with Ernst & Young their independence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  The Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures for certain  audit and non-audit services which Ernst & Young provides. In developing these policies and procedures, the Audit Committee considered the need to ensure the independence of Ernst & Young  while recognizing that in certain situations Ernst & Young may possess both the technical expertise and knowledge of the Company to best advise the Company on issues and matters in addition to accounting and auditing. The policies and  procedures adopted by the Audit Committee allow the general pre-approval by the Audit Committee of certain services, such as audit-related services (which include providing accounting and auditing consultation  and due diligence services), and tax services (which include general tax compliance, tax research, and planning services), without a specific, case-by-case consideration  of each of the services to be performed by Ernst & Young. The policies and procedures require that any other service, including the annual audit services and any other attestation service, be expressly and specifically approved by the Audit  Committee prior to such services being performed by Ernst & Young. In addition, any proposed services exceeding the general pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee considers whether all pre-approved services are consistent with the SEC's rules and regulations on auditor  independence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  6.  Based on the review and discussions referred to in paragraphs (1) through (5) above, the Audit Committee recommended  to the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors has approved the inclusion of the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28,  2018, for filing with the SEC.

2019 Proxy Statement |        61 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers and persons who own beneficially more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the SEC and the NYSE initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common stock and other equity securities of the Company. Officers, directors and greater than ten-percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by them. 
To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such filings on file with the Company and written representations from its directors and executive officers, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the Company's directors, officers and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners were complied with on a timely basis during fiscal 2018.

For information about the executive officers of the Company, see Part I, Item 1 — Business in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
SHAREHOLDERS' PROPOSALS 
Only shareholders meeting certain criteria outlined in the Company's Bylaws are eligible to submit nominations for election to the Board of Directors or to bring other proper business before an annual meeting. Under the Company's Bylaws, shareholders who wish to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors or bring other proper business before an annual meeting must give proper notice to the Company not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day and not later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. Therefore, notices regarding nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors and other proper business for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must be submitted to the Company no earlier than September 18, 2019 and no later than October 18, 2019. Notices regarding nominations and other proper business must include certain information concerning the nominee or the proposal and the proponent's ownership of common stock of the Company, in each case as set forth in the Company's Bylaws. Nominations or other proposals not meeting these requirements will not be entertained at the annual meeting. The Secretary of the Company should be contacted in writing at the address on the first page of this Proxy Statement to submit a nomination or bring other proper business or to obtain additional information as to the proper form of a nomination. 
In order to be included in the Company's Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to the 2020 annual meeting, proposals of shareholders must be received by the Secretary of the Company no later than August 7, 2019. If timely notice of a shareholder proposal is not received by the Company, then the proxies named on the proxy cards distributed by the Company for the annual meeting may use the discretionary voting authority granted to them by the proxy cards if the proposal is raised at the annual meeting, whether or not there is any discussion of the matter in the Proxy Statement. The 2020 annual meeting of shareholders is currently expected to be held on Wednesday, January 15, 2020. 
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for the review, approval, or ratification of "related-person transactions" involving the Company or its subsidiaries and related persons. Under SEC rules, a related person is a director, executive officer, nominee for director, or 5% shareholder of the Company, and their immediate family members. The Company has adopted written policies and procedures that apply to any transaction or series of transactions in which the Company or a subsidiary is a participant, in which the amount involved exceeds $100,000, and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. 
62     | 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has determined that each of the following transactions shall be deemed to be pre-approved under the Company's policies and procedures referenced above: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any transaction with another company for which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than as  an executive officer) if the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of that company's total annual revenue;  
• any charitable contribution, grant, or endowment by the Company to a charitable organization, foundation, or university for  which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than as an executive officer) or a director, if the amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of the charitable organization's total annual  receipts;  
• compensation to executive officers determined by the Compensation Committee;  
• compensation to directors as reported in the Company's proxy statement;  
• transactions in which all security holders receive proportional benefits; and  
• transactions where the rates or charges involved are determined by competitive bids.  
[END TABLE]
Any transaction involving related persons that exceeds $100,000 and that does not fall within the categories described above is presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for review. The Committee determines whether the related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction and may approve, ratify, rescind, or take other action with respect to the transaction in its discretion. In determining whether to approve or ratify the transaction, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction. 
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable to multiple shareholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. 
Once you have received notice from your broker or the Company that they or the Company will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you provide us with contrary instructions. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, or if you are receiving multiple copies of such proxy materials and wish to receive only one set, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or the Company if you hold common stock directly. Promptly upon receiving a written or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, will be delivered to you. Requests in writing should be addressed to the address below. Requests may also be made by calling (214) 638-0145.
