PROXY STATEMENT

May 14, 2019
VOTING AND REVOCATION OF PROXY 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Famous Dave's of America, Inc. to be used at the annual meeting of shareholders of the Company (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at the offices of Gray Plant Mooty, 500 IDS Center, 80 South Eighth Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota on Tuesday, May 14, 2019, at 3:00 p.m. Throughout this Proxy Statement, the terms "the Company," "Famous Dave's," "we," "our," "us," and similar terms refer to Famous Dave's of America, Inc. 
The Annual Meeting is being held for the purpose of considering and taking appropriate action with respect to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)      The election of eight directors; 
    (2)      The ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for fiscal 2019; 
    (3)      Advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation ("say-on-pay");  
    (4)      Advisory approval of the frequency with which future stockholder advisory votes to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers will be held ("say-on-frequency"); and 
    (5)      The transaction of any other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof. 
[END TABLE]
The approximate date on which this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy were first sent or provided to shareholders was March 29, 2019.  
PROXIES AND VOTING 
Your vote is extremely important. You may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, or you may vote by following the directions on the proxy card for the Annual Meeting. Even if you own only a few shares, and whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person, you are requested to vote your proxy either (1) through the Internet at the address listed on the Notice Regarding Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy card, (2) by calling a toll-free telephone number listed on the proxy card or (3) by marking, signing and dating the proxy card and mailing it in the envelope provided. If you own your shares in the name of a bank or broker, and you wish to be able to vote at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank or broker, indicating that you owned Company shares as of the record date. 
The Board of Directors has set the close of business on March 19, 2019 as the "Record Date" for the Annual Meeting. Only holders of the Company's common stock as of the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, are entitled to notice of and will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments thereof. On the Record Date, there were 9,273,905 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding. Each such share entitles the holder thereof to one vote upon each matter to be presented at the Annual Meeting. A quorum, consisting of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, must be present in person or represented by proxy before action may be taken at the Annual Meeting. Each proxy returned to the Company will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. If no direction is given by a shareholder, the shares will be voted as recommended by the Company's Board of Directors. If any nominee for the Board of Directors should withdraw or otherwise become unavailable for reasons not presently known, the proxies that would have otherwise been voted for such nominee will be voted for such substitute nominee as may be selected by the Board of Directors. If a shareholder abstains from voting on any matter, the abstention will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting for the transaction of business as well as shares entitled to vote on that matter. If you do not vote for a particular nominee listed in Proposal No. 1, or you withhold authority for one or all nominees, your vote will not count either "for" or "against" the nominee.  With respect to Proposal No. 2, the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is required. Accordingly, an abstention on Proposal No. 2 will have the same effect as voting "against" the matter. With respect to Proposal No. 3 and Proposal No. 4, an abstention will not count either "for" or "against" the matter. A non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner votes on one proposal, but does not vote on another proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes on a matter are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum for the Annual Meeting, but are not considered entitled to vote on that particular matter. Consequently, non-votes generally do not have the same effect as a negative vote on the matter. 
A shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by (i) giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company, (ii) delivering a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or (iii) voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Presence at the Annual Meeting of a shareholder who has signed a proxy does not, alone, revoke that proxy; revocation must be announced by the shareholder at the time of the Annual Meeting. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by each proxy will be voted at the Annual Meeting and at any adjournments thereof. 
NOTICE TO BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES HELD IN BROKER ACCOUNTS: 
New York Stock Exchange Rule 452 prohibits NYSE member organizations from giving a proxy to vote with respect to an election of directors (Proposal No. 1) and Say-on-pay (Proposal No. 3) without receiving voting instructions from a beneficial owner. Because NYSE Rule 452 applies to all brokers that are members of the NYSE, this prohibition applies to the Annual Meeting even though the Company is not listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Therefore, brokers will not be entitled to vote shares at the Annual Meeting with respect to Proposal No. 1, No. 3 and No. 4 without instructions by the beneficial owner of the shares. AS A RESULT, BENEFICIAL OWNERS OF SHARES HELD IN BROKER ACCOUNTS ARE ADVISED THAT, IF THEY DO NOT TIMELY PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS TO THEIR BROKER, THEIR SHARES WILL NOT BE VOTED IN CONNECTION WITH THESE PROPOSALS. 
PROPOSALS 
PROPOSAL No. 1 – Election of Directors 
The shareholders have set the size of the Board of Directors at eight and we currently have eight directors. Eight of these directors have been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting. If elected, each nominee has consented to serve as a director of the Company and to hold office until the next annual shareholders' meeting, and until his or her successor is elected and shall have qualified, or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation, removal or disqualification. 
The following paragraphs provide information as of the date of this Proxy Statement about each nominee. The information presented includes information that each nominee has given us about his or her age, all positions he or she holds within the Company, his or her principal occupation and business experience for the past five years, and the names of other publicly-held companies of which he or she currently serves as a director or has served as a director during the past five years. In addition to the information presented below regarding each nominee's specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board to the conclusion that he or she should serve as a director, our director nominees have experience in developing and overseeing businesses and implementing near term and long range strategic plans. We also believe that all of our director nominees have a reputation for integrity, honesty and adherence to high ethical standards. Collectively, they have demonstrated business acumen and an ability to exercise sound judgment, as well as a commitment of service to our Company and our Board. Although we don't believe that share ownership alone qualifies any person to serve as a director of our Company, we believe that the beneficial ownership of our Board nominees (collectively 43% as of the Record Date) aligns their interests with those of our shareholders and will drive our Board's focus on maximizing shareholder value. Jeffery Crivello, age 40, has been our chief executive officer since November 2017 and director since August 2017.  Since January 2015, Mr. Crivello served as the Chief Financial Officer of PW Partners Capital Management, LLC, a hedge fund manager with a consumer focus, where he had primary responsibility for operations and accounting. PW Partners has had board of directors' representation with Famous Dave's of America, Inc. since 2013, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. since 2014, Del Taco Holdings, Inc. since 2015, and Town Sports International Holdings, Inc. since 2015. Since 2001, Mr. Crivello has served as President of TREW Capital Management, Inc., a consulting and investment firm where he had primary responsibility for operations. From 2012 to 2015, Mr. Crivello served as a Managing Member of Maize Capital Group, LLC, a commodity investment firm.  He graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater with a B.S. degree in finance.
Mr. Crivello's restaurant-investing background, particularly his experience with casual dining chains, qualifies him to serve as a director of our Company. We believe that Mr. Crivello's unique perspective in growing other concepts will be invaluable to the future growth of Famous Dave's.
David Kanen, age 53, has been a director of our Company since October 2018 and has served as non-executive chairman of our Company since February 2019.

Edwards & Sons, Inc. from 1992 to 2004.  Mr. Kanen holds a Bachelor of Science in Marketing from Jacksonville University.
Mr. Kanen beneficially owns 17.6% of our Company as of the Record Date. Mr. Kanen's restaurant-investing background, particularly his experience with value creation for small companies such as ours, qualifies him to serve as a director of our Company. 
Anand D. Gala, age 45, has been a director of our Company since July 2015. Mr. Gala is the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gala Holdings International, a diversified holding company that conducts consulting, restaurant development and management operations. Current portfolio brands under Gala Holdings International ownership and operation include Famous Dave's and Fresh Griller. Since 2007, Mr. Gala has also been Founder and Managing Partner of Gala Development Partners, LLC, a firm focused on the acquisition, development and management of commercial real estate comprising retail and office properties.

From 2000 until 2010, Mr. Gala served as Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gala AZ Holdings, a developer of Del Taco restaurants in Arizona. Mr. Gala graduated from the University of Southern California with a B. S. in Biology. 
Mr. Gala's background in the restaurant industry and his substantial experience in franchise operations, including as a Famous Dave's franchisee, qualify him to serve as a director of our Company. We believe that maintaining good relationships with our franchisees is extremely important to our organization given the impact that franchise operations have on the results of our operations. As a well-respected Famous Dave's franchisee, Mr. Gala is uniquely positioned to advise the Company on matters related to both franchise relations and operations.
Peter O. Haeg,  age 55, has been co-managing partner of Farnam Street Partners LP, a private investment partnership focused on small cap value investing, and Farnam Street Special Opportunities Fund, a private partnership focused on private equity investments, since 1998. Mr. Haeg is  a graduate of the University of Minnesota.

Mr. Haeg is the co-managing partner of an investment fund that beneficially owns 4.5% of our Company as of the Record Date. Mr. Haeg brings the perspective of a professional institutional shareholder to Board discussions, which we believe adds a strategic resource to a Board seeking to maximize shareholder value.

Mr. Jacobs co-founded Wexford Capital LP, a registered investment advisor in 1994, and serves as its President.

Mr. Jacobs was a director of Rhino GP LLC, the general partner of Rhino Resource Partners LP (RNO) from July 2010 to April 2015. Mr. Jacobs is affiliated with investment funds that collectively hold the largest beneficial ownership stake in the Company. Mr. Jacobs brings the perspective of a professional institutional shareholder to Board discussions, which we believe adds a strategic resource to a Board seeking to maximize shareholder value. Mr. Jacobs' broad knowledge of corporate governance and management, obtained though his experience in overseeing portfolio companies, is also a valuable resource to the Board.

Vote Required 
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. The nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected. Shares represented by executed proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of the eight nominees named above. If you do not vote for a particular nominee, or you withhold authority for one or all nominees, your vote will not count either "for" or "against" the nominee, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. If any director nominee should withdraw or otherwise become unavailable for reasons not presently known, the proxies which would have otherwise been voted for that director nominee may be voted for a substitute director nominee selected by the Company's Board of Directors. 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the election of each named nominee. PROPOSAL No. 2 – Ratification of the Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Board of Directors and management of the Company are committed to the quality, integrity and transparency of the Company's financial reports. In accordance with the duties set forth in its written charter, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has appointed Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. A representative of Grant Thornton LLP is expected to attend this year's Annual Meeting and be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders, and will have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so.
Grant Thornton billed the Company a total of $350,499 and $395,985 for the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Audit Fees – Audit fees billed by Grant Thornton were $334,379 and $375,705 for the audits of the Company's 2018 and 2017 financial statements during the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Audit Related Fees – Audit-related fees billed by Grant Thornton were $16,120 and $20,280 for the audits of the Company's 2017 and 2016 401(k) financial statements during the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.
Tax Fees – There were no tax fees billed by Grant Thornton during the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
All Other Fees –There were no other fees billed by Grant Thornton during the years ended December 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed the services provided by Grant Thornton LLP during fiscal year 2018 and the fees billed for such services. After consideration, the Audit Committee has determined that the receipt of these fees by Grant Thornton LLP is compatible with the provision of independent audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services and fees with Grant Thornton LLP and Company management and determined that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
Pre-Approval Policy
The Company's Audit Committee charter (a copy of which is available at the Company's website at www.famousdaves.com) provides that all audit and non-audit accounting services that are permitted to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm under applicable rules and regulations must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee or by designated members of the Audit Committee, other than with respect to de minimis exceptions permitted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. During fiscal 2018, all services performed by Grant Thornton LLP were pre-approved in accordance with the Audit Committee charter.
Prior to or as soon as practicable following the beginning of each fiscal year, a description of the audit, audit-related, tax, and other services expected to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in the following fiscal year is presented to the Audit Committee for approval. Following such approval, any requests for audit, audit-related, tax, and other services not presented and pre-approved must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings. However, the authority to grant specific pre-approval between meetings, as necessary, has been delegated to the chairman of the Audit Committee. The chairman must update the Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of any services that were granted specific pre-approval. In addition, the Audit Committee has granted pre-approval for the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to spend up to $5,000 annually in additional permitted audit fees with Grant Thornton LLP, which authority and amount will be reviewed and approved annually.
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP, the Audit Committee may reconsider its selection, but is not required to do so. Notwithstanding the proposed ratification of the appointment of Grant Thornton LLP by the shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of new independent auditors at any time during the year without notice to, or the consent of, the shareholders, if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of Grant Thornton LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for fiscal 2019.
PROPOSAL No. 3 – Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company's shareholders are entitled to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the rules of the SEC. This "say-on-pay" vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy and policies described in this Proxy Statement.
At the Company's 2013 annual shareholders' meeting, the shareholders were asked to cast an advisory vote on how frequently the Company should seek an advisory "say-on-pay" vote. In particular, the Company asked whether the "say-on-pay" vote should occur every three years, every two years, or every one year. As stated in the proxy statement for the Company's 2013 annual shareholders' meeting, the Company's Board recommended that shareholders vote for an annual "say-on-pay" vote to best enable the Board and the Compensation Committee to understand and incorporate the views of the Company's shareholders in structuring the Company's executive compensation programs. At the 2013 annual shareholders' meeting, the option of an annual "say-on-pay" vote received the highest number of votes cast by shareholders. Consistent with this desire for an annual "say-on-pay" vote, the Company is asking shareholders to indicate their support at the Annual Meeting for the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this Proxy Statement by casting an advisory vote "FOR" the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of the "named executive officers" of Famous Dave's of America, Inc., as disclosed in the section entitled "Executive Compensation" in the Proxy Statement for the Famous Dave's of America, Inc. 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission." 
Vote Required 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be required to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the section entitled "Executive Compensation" below. Because the vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. Nevertheless, the views expressed by our shareholders, whether through this vote or otherwise, are important to us and, accordingly, the Board and the Compensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as described in this Proxy Statement. 
PROPOSAL No. 4 – Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Act also enables our shareholders to indicate how frequently we should seek an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, such as Proposal No. 3. As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is providing our shareholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on whether the Company will seek an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers every three years, two years, or one year.
The optimal frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation depends on a balancing of the benefits and burdens of more or less frequent votes. Many have expressed a belief that less frequent votes are appropriate as they enable shareholders to focus on a company's overall compensation program design, as opposed to short-term decisions, and provide sufficient time to evaluate how a company's compensation programs drive longer-term performance and the creation of longer-term shareholder value. Many also believe that a less frequent voting cycle will give companies sufficient time to respond thoughtfully to stockholder views and to implement any necessary changes to executive compensation programs and allow shareholders to evaluate the results of these changes before the next shareholder advisory vote. 
Others believe more frequent shareholder votes are optimal as they provide shareholders with the opportunity to react promptly to emerging trends in compensation and to provide rapid feedback to companies with respect to their views on the effectiveness and appropriateness of their executive compensation programs. This more frequent feedback would provide boards of directors and compensation committees with the opportunity to evaluate individual compensation decisions each year in light of the shareholder feedback and to better incorporate current shareholder views into companies' compensation programs. At the Company's 2013 annual shareholders' meeting, an annual "say-on-pay" received the highest number of votes cast by shareholders. Our Board believes that the most appropriate outcome at this time is to continue to have an annual shareholder advisory vote on compensation, to best enable the Board and the Compensation Committee to understand and incorporate the views of our shareholders in structuring our executive compensation programs. 
You may cast your vote on your preferred voting frequency, by choosing the option of three years, two years, one year or abstain from voting when you vote on this Proposal No. 4. 
Vote Required 
The option of three years, two years or one year that receives the highest number of votes cast by shareholders will be the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation that has been selected by shareholders. As with your vote on Proposal No. 3 above, your vote on this Proposal No. 4 is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, or our Board, and the Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our shareholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our shareholders. However, our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders and we will take our shareholders' preferences into account in making determinations regarding the frequency of the say-on-pay vote. 
The Board recommends that shareholders vote for a frequency of every ONE YEAR for future advisory shareholder votes on executive compensation.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board of Directors is not aware of any matter to be presented for action at the Annual Meeting other than the four proposals described above. Although the Board of Directors knows of no other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting, all proxies returned to the Company will be voted on any such matter in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders.

Description of Additional Compensation Plans and Practices
Deferred Compensation Plan
The Company maintains a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan in which employees who are at the "director" level and above are eligible to participate. None of the named executive officers have participated in this plan.  Participants must complete a deferral election each year and submit it to the Company, prior to the beginning of the fiscal year for which the compensation pertains, indicating the level of compensation (salary, bonus and commissions) they wish to have deferred for the coming year. This deferral election is irrevocable except to the extent permitted by the plan's administrator, and the applicable regulations promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service. For fiscal 2017 and 2018, the Company matched 25.0% of the first 4.0% contributed by participants and paid declared interest rates of 6.0% on balances contributed.  
Deferral periods are defined as the earlier of termination of employment or not less than three calendar years following the end of the applicable plan year. Extensions of the deferral period for a minimum of five years are allowed, provided the election is made at least one year before the first payment affected by the change. Payments can be in a lump sum or in equal payments over a two-, five- or ten-year period, plus interest from the commencement date.
The plan assets are kept in an unsecured account that has no trust fund. In the event of bankruptcy, any future payments would have no greater rights than that of an unsecured general creditor of the Company and they confer no legal rights for interest or claim on any assets of the Company. Benefits provided by the deferred compensation plan are not insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), because the pension insurance provisions of ERISA do not apply to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Other Benefits 
The Company provides additional benefit plans to employees, including the named executive officers, such as medical, dental, life insurance and disability coverage, flex benefit accounts, 401(k) plan, and an employee assistance program. The Company also provides vacation and other paid holidays to employees, including the named executive officers, which are comparable to those provided at other companies of comparable size. 
Tax Deductibility of Compensation 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, places a limit of $1,000,000 on the amount of compensation that the Company may deduct in any one year with respect to certain of its most highly paid executive officers. The exception to the $1,000,000 limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements has been repealed, effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company has generally not paid compensation in excess of $1,000,000 to any single executive officer in the past.  Incentive compensation, including equity incentive awards, has not generally been structured to meet all of such requirements, and, as such, may not be fully deductible.
INFORMATION REGARDING THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board of Directors 
The size of our Board of Directors is set at eight by the shareholders. We currently have eight members serving as directors. The following directors, constituting a majority of the Board, are "independent directors" as such term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Stock Market's Marketplace Rules: Peter O. Haeg, Joseph M. Jacobs, Richard A. Shapiro, Richard Welch and Bryan L. Wolff. The Board of Directors held four formal meetings during fiscal 2018. David L. Kanen is the non-executive chairman of the Company's Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors held four formal meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Board of Directors Role in Risk Oversight 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has been delegated the responsibility for risk oversight. In overseeing the Company's risk management, the Audit Committee adheres to a detailed committee responsibilities calendar that addresses various risk-related matters. These matters include but are not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· meeting with management and the Company's independent registered public accountant in separate executive sessions; 
· interacting with management and the internal audit function; 
· considering and reviewing with the Company's independent registered public accountant the Company's assessment and any related attestation (including related reports) on internal control over financial reporting, the adequacy of such controls and recommendations for improvements;

Committees of the Board of Directors 
The Company has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. During fiscal 2018, each member of the Board of Directors attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and meetings of committees to which they belong during the period in which such member served as a director. Although the Company has no formal policy regarding directors' attendance at the Company's annual shareholders meetings, the Company encourages such attendance by members of the Board of Directors. All but one of the Company's eight directors serving on the Board of Directors at the time of the Company's most recent annual shareholders' meeting, held May 15, 2018, were in attendance at that meeting. Below is a summary of the Company's board committee structure and current committee membership information.

Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
The Company has established a three-member Audit Committee within the Board of Directors that currently consists of Chairman Bryan L. Wolff, Peter O. Haeg and Richard S. Welch. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available at the Company's website at www.famousdaves.com. The charter reflects the Audit Committee's increased responsibilities as a result of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the NASDAQ Stock Market corporate governance standards. As set forth in the charter, the primary responsibilities of the Audit Committee include: (i) serving as an independent and objective party to monitor the Company's financial reporting process and internal control system; (ii) reviewing and appraising the audit performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm; and (iii) providing an open avenue of communication among the independent registered public accounting firm, financial and senior management and the Board of Directors. The charter also requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve the performance of all audit and non-audit accounting services to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, other than certain de minimis exceptions permitted by Section 202 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. 
The Board of Directors has determined that at least one member of the Audit Committee, Bryan L. Wolff, qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, each member of the Audit Committee is an "independent director," as such term is defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Stock Market's Marketplace Rules, and meets the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Board of Directors has also determined that each of the Audit Committee members is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and that at least one member of the Audit Committee has past employment experience in finance or accounting. The Audit Committee held four formal meetings during fiscal 2018.
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Company's management has primary responsibility for the Company's internal controls and preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company's financial reporting, internal controls, and audit functions. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the last fiscal year and discussed them with management. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, as amended, Communications with Audit Committees,  as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding such firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the independent accountants their independence. The Audit Committee, based on the review and discussions described above, has recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

· incentives that promote sustained short- and long-term financial growth and return in order to increase intrinsic value per share; 
· a reward system for extraordinary performance that recognizes individual initiative and achievements; and 
· a means to optimize performance without encouraging unreasonable risks or incentivizing behavior that would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on the Company. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that the total compensation program for executives should consist of the following elements, each determined by individual and corporate performance:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Base salary compensation; and 
· Incentive compensation, both in the form of annual cash bonus and long-term stock-based incentive awards. 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the compensation program elements listed above, we have established a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan in which our executives are entitled to participate. The Compensation Committee believes that the availability of this plan adds to the attractiveness of the Company's overall compensation program and positively impacts the Company's ability to hire and retain qualified executives. Compensation Procedures 
Our Compensation Committee approves, on an annual basis, the competitiveness of our overall executive compensation programs, including the appropriate mix between cash and non-cash compensation as well as annual and long-term incentives. As set forth in its written charter, our Compensation Committee has access to resources it deems appropriate to accomplish its responsibilities, including the sole authority to retain (with funding provided by the Company) legal counsel and experts in the field of executive compensation after taking into consideration the independence related factors required under applicable NASDAQ listing standards. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain and to terminate such advisors, and to approve the fees and other retention terms. During fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee primarily relied upon internal Company resources to generate information on which to benchmark the Company's compensation practices. 
Generally, our Chief Executive Officer has provided input to our Compensation Committee regarding executive compensation and participated in the ultimate determination of compensation for the Company's other executives. However, our Chief Executive Officer does not have direct involvement in the determination of his own compensation, the determination and structure of which is the sole responsibility of the Compensation Committee.
The Compensation Committee held four meetings during fiscal 2018.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors 
The Company has established a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee within the Board of Directors that consists of Chairman Bryan L. Wolff, Peter O. Haeg and Richard A. Shapiro. Messrs. Wolff, Haeg and Shapiro satisfy the independence requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Marketplace Rules. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, a copy of which is available at the Company's website at www.famousdaves.com. The primary role of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is to consider and make recommendations to the full Board of Directors concerning the appropriate size, function and needs of the Board, including establishing criteria for Board membership and considering, recruiting and recommending candidates (including those recommended by shareholders) to fill new Board positions. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also considers and advises the full Board on matters of corporate governance and monitors and recommends the functions of, and membership on, the various committees of the Board. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee (or a subcommittee thereof) recruits and considers director candidates and presents all qualified candidates to the full Board for consideration. Qualified candidates will be considered without regard to race, color, religion, sex, ancestry, national origin, disability, marital or veteran status, or any other legally protected status.
In identifying and evaluating potential candidates to be nominees for directors, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the flexibility to consider such factors as it deems appropriate under relevant circumstances. These factors may include education, general business and industry experience, ability to act on behalf of shareholders and build long term shareholder value, potential concerns regarding independence or conflicts of interest and other factors relevant in evaluating Board nominees. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that a Board comprised of directors with diverse skills and experiences relevant to the Company's industry will result in efficient and competent oversight of the Company's various core competencies, which include restaurant operations, franchise operations, real estate, marketing and financial and accounting. As such, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers the interplay of a director candidate's experience with that of other members of the Board of Directors. 
If the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee approves a candidate for further review following an initial screening, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will establish an interview process for the candidate. Generally, the candidate will meet with at least a majority of the members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, along with the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Contemporaneously with the interview process, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will conduct a comprehensive conflicts-of-interest assessment of the candidate. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider reports of the interviews and the conflicts-of-interest assessment to determine whether to recommend the candidate to the full Board of Directors. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will also take into consideration the candidate's personal attributes, including, without limitation, personal integrity, loyalty to the Company and concern for its success and welfare, willingness to apply sound and independent business judgment, awareness of a director's vital part in the Company's good corporate citizenship and image, time available for meetings and consultation on Company matters and willingness to assume broad, fiduciary responsibility. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider recommendations by shareholders of candidates for election to the Board of Directors. Any shareholder who wishes that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee consider a candidate must follow the procedures set forth in our Bylaws. Under our Bylaws, if a shareholder plans to nominate a person as a director at a meeting, the shareholder is required to place a proposed director's name in nomination by written request delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices not less than 60 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting. For our 2020 annual shareholders' meeting, notices must be delivered to or mailed and received not prior to November 30, 2018 and not later than January 29, 2019. If the date of our 2020 annual meeting is advanced more than 30 calendar days prior to or delayed by more than 30 calendar days after the anniversary of the Annual Meeting, timely notice by a shareholder may be delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 10th calendar day following the earlier of the date that we mail notice to our shareholders that the 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held or the date on which we issue a press release, filed a periodic report with the SEC or otherwise publicly disseminated notice that the 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held.

All shareholder communications sent in care of the Company's Secretary will be forwarded promptly to the applicable director(s). 
Policies and Procedures for the Consideration and Determination of Director Compensation 
Each year, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the Board's compensation in relation to other companies nationwide and recommends any changes in Board compensation to the full Board of Directors for approval. As needed, the Compensation Committee will also review and make recommendations to the Board. The Compensation Committee also approves any grants of equity incentives to directors under the Company's equity incentive plans. Director Compensation

Anand D. Gala currently serves as a director of the Company and has been nominated for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Gala is the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of Gala Holdings International, a diversified holding company that conducts consulting, restaurant development and management operations. As a Company franchisee, Gala Holdings International paid approximately $1.5 million in franchise royalties and contributions to the Company's system-wide marketing fund for the Company's 2018 fiscal year.
An entity that Charles Davidson, a beneficial owner of approximately 18.6% of our company, controls is a franchisee of the Company. As a Company franchisee, Mr. Davidson paid approximately $308,000 in franchise royalties and contributions to the Company's system-wide marketing fund for the Company's 2018 fiscal year.
On November 10, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") by and between the Company and PW Partners, LLC ("PW Partners").  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company sold to PW Partners on behalf of its designated client, FS Special Opportunities I, L.P. (the "Purchaser's Designee"), 418,169 shares of our common stock (the "Private Placement"). The Purchase Agreement provides further that PW Partners has assigned its rights under the Purchase Agreement to the Purchaser's Designee; provided, however, that PW Partners retains its obligations under the Purchase Agreement. On January 29, 2018, the Company entered into a Standby Purchase Agreement (the "Standby Purchase Agreement") with PW Partners, in connection with a non-transferable rights offering (the "Rights Offering"). The Standby Purchase Agreement provided that PW Partners will (a) exercise its non-transferable rights to subscribe for and purchase its pro rata amount of newly-issued shares of the Company's common stock, at a price per share, which the Company's board of directors set at $3.50 per share (the "Subscription Price"), and (b) purchase in a private placement separate from the Rights Offering, at the Subscription Price and subject to the terms and conditions of the Standby Purchase Agreement, any shares of the Company's common stock that were not subscribed for in the Rights Offering pursuant to the Company's stockholders' exercise of their rights. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Standby Purchase Agreement also provided that PW Partners will not purchase shares of the Company's common stock in an amount that would result in the Standby Purchaser beneficially owning 20% or more of the outstanding common stock after such purchase.
PW Partners is affiliated with PW Capital Management, LLC ("PW Capital"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, Jeffery Crivello, the Chief Financial Officer of PW Capital, became the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, effective November 14, 2017.
On December 8, 2017, as a part of settlement of a legal dispute and distressed situation, the Company approved the transfer of seven franchise restaurants in Utah and Washington (the "Transferred Restaurants") to an entity (the "Acquirer") controlled by Charles Davidson. 
The previous franchisee of these seven restaurants experienced financial difficulties for more than one year and, at the time of the sale to the Acquirer, was more than one year in arrears with royalty, miscellaneous and national advertising fund payments that totaled approximately $1.4 million. The previous franchisee engaged a broker who marketed the franchise for several months, which resulted in two potential buyers, one of whom dropped out of the process. These stores were severely neglected, and this was determined to be the best path to economic recovery. 
In connection with settling the dispute with the previous franchisee, the Company collected $350,000 in cash from the previous franchisee. Pursuant to the settlement, the Company wrote off accounts receivable of approximately $1.0 million. 
As part of the transaction, the Company agreed to certain concessions in order to facilitate the transfer of the Transferred Restaurants to the Acquirer and to incentivize the Acquirer to invest the funds necessary to improve the operations of the Transferred Restaurants and to provide innovation to the Famous Dave's concept. The economic concessions consisted of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                 A $500,000 repairs and maintenance credit (the "R&M Credit"), payable through a 50% reduction in required royalty payments until the credit is exhausted;  
                 Royalty relief, in addition to the R&M Credit, of 2.0% in months one through 12 for an effective royalty rate of 3.0% and 1.0% in months 13 through 24 for an effective royalty rate of 4.0%, and a full royalty of 5.0% to be paid thereafter ("Royalty Relief");  
                 Development rights in the states of Utah and Washington in exchange for a commitment to open three restaurants before May 1, 2027; and,  
                 Waiver of initial and future franchise fees and area development fees.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to these economic concessions, the Company modified its standard franchise agreement to eliminate or limit certain obligations of Acquirer as a franchisee, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                 Waiver of reacquisition fees for two additional ten-year terms;  
                 Acquirer will spend 1.0% of net sales on local marketing, as opposed to the standard 1.5%.  
[END TABLE]
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of such securities with the SEC and NASDAQ. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on review of the copies of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto furnished to the Company during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018 and Forms 5 and amendments thereto furnished to the Company with respect to such fiscal year, or written representations that no Forms 5 were required, the Company believes that all of its officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners complied with all applicable Section 16(a) filing requirements during the fiscal year ended December 30, 2018. PROPOSALS OF SHAREHOLDERS 
Proposals by shareholders (other than director nominations) that are submitted for inclusion in our proxy statement for our 2020 annual shareholders' meeting must follow the procedures set forth in Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our Bylaws. To be timely under Rule 14a-8, a shareholder proposal must be received by our Corporate Secretary at Famous Dave's of America, Inc., 12701 Whitewater Drive, Suite 290, Minnetonka, Minnesota, 55343, by November 30, 2019.
Under our Bylaws, if a shareholder does not submit a proposal for inclusion in our proxy statement but does wish to propose an item of business to be considered at an annual shareholders' meeting (other than director nominations), that shareholder must deliver notice of the proposal at our principal executive offices not less than 60 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting. For our 2020 annual shareholders' meeting, notices must be received not prior to November 30, 2019 and not later than January 29, 2020.
If a shareholder plans to nominate a person as a director at an annual shareholders' meeting, our Bylaws require that the shareholder place a proposed director's name in nomination by written request delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices not less than 60 nor more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date on which we first mailed proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting. For our 2020 annual shareholders' meeting, notices must be delivered to or mailed and received not prior to November 30, 2019 and not later than January 29, 2020.
If the date of our 2020 annual shareholders' meeting is advanced more than 30 calendar days prior to or delayed by more than 30 calendar days after the anniversary of the Annual Meeting, timely notice of shareholder proposals and shareholder nominations for directors may be delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 10th calendar day following the earlier of the date that we mail notice to our shareholders that the 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held or the date on which we issue a press release, filed a periodic report with the SEC or otherwise publicly disseminated notice that the 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held. 
Notices of shareholder proposals and shareholder nominations for directors must comply with the informational and other requirements set forth in our Bylaws as well as applicable statutes and regulations. Due to the complexity of the respective rights of the shareholders and the Company in this area, any shareholder desiring to propose actions or nominate directors is advised to consult with his or her legal counsel with respect to such rights. The Company suggests that any such proposal be submitted by certified mail return receipt requested.
HOUSEHOLDING 
The SEC permits a procedure called "householding" for the delivery of proxy information to shareholders. Under this procedure, certain shareholders who share the same last name and address and do not participate in electronic delivery will receive only one copy of the proxy materials unless one or more of such shareholders notifies us that they would like to receive individual copies. Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. The Company initiated householding to reduce printing costs and postage fees.
The Company will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the proxy statement and annual report in a separate envelope, as applicable, to a shareholder at a shared address to which a single copy of these documents was delivered. If you prefer to receive separate copies of the proxy materials in a separate envelope either now or in the future, please contact Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. at (800) 542-1061 or in writing at Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717.
If you are currently receiving separate copies and wish to receive only one copy of future proxy materials for your household, in one envelope, please contact Broadridge at the above phone number or address. SOLICITATION 
The Company will bear the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the Proxy, Proxy Statement, Annual Report and other material which may be sent to the shareholders in connection with this solicitation. Brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries may be requested to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of stock, in which case they may be reimbursed by the Company for their expenses in doing so. Proxies may be solicited personally, by telephone, by telegram or by special letter.
The Board of Directors does not intend to present to the meeting any other matter not referred to above and does not presently know of any matters that may be presented to the meeting by others. However, if other matters come before the meeting, it is the intent of the persons named in the enclosed proxy to vote the proxy in accordance with their best judgment.
By Order of the Board of Directors
