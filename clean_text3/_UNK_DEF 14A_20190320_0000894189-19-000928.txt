[END TABLE]
Our directors have sent you this proxy statement to ask for your vote as a shareholder of the Fund.  The proxy           statement is mailed by various vendors, depending upon where the shareholder's account is serviced (direct with the Fund, at a broker or bank, etc.) and the mailing is expected to start on February 15, 2019 and be completed shortly thereafter.

[END TABLE]
How may I vote my shares?
By mail. You           may vote by completing, dating and signing a proxy card and mailing it as soon as you can. The shares of shareholders who complete and properly sign a proxy card and return it before the special meeting will be voted as directed by such           shareholder at the special meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the special meeting. The shares of a shareholder who properly signs and returns a proxy card, but does not specify how to vote, will be voted for the election of the           nominees listed below, except that proxy cards returned by a broker to indicate a broker nonvote will not be so voted and will not constitute a vote "for"           or "against" the proposal.
In person.           Written ballots will be available before the special meeting commences. Shareholders who hold their shares in "street name" through a bank, broker, nominee, fiduciary or other holder of record must obtain a proxy, executed in such shareholder's           favor, from the record holder in order to vote their shares at the special meeting if they decide to attend in person. However, shareholders who send in their proxy cards and also attend the special meeting do not need to vote again unless they           wish to revoke their proxy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                        Who is entitled to vote? 
[END TABLE]
If you owned shares of the Fund as of the close of business on the record date, January 31, 2019, then you are           entitled to vote. You will be entitled to one vote per share for each share you own on the record date.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      Do I need to attend the special meeting in order to vote? 
[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      How will proxies be solicited? 
[END TABLE]
We will solicit proxies primarily by mail.  In addition, certain of our officers and employees may solicit by           telephone and personally.  We will not pay these officers and employees specifically for soliciting proxies. The Fund will bear the cost of soliciting proxies, including preparing, assembling and mailing the proxy material.  Also, we will           reimburse brokers and other nominees for their reasonable expenses in communicating with the persons for whom they hold shares of the Fund.  The Fund has engaged Computershare Fund Services to solicit proxies from brokers, banks, other           institutional holders and individual shareholders for a fee of approximately $1,750, plus expenses.  This fee will be borne by the Fund.
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                        What happens if the special meeting is adjourned? 
[END TABLE]
The special meeting could be adjourned if, for example, a quorum does not exist.  If the special meeting is           adjourned, then it will be reconvened at the same or some other place, to be announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned special meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the           original special meeting.  All proxies will be voted in the same manner as they would have been voted at the original convening of the special meeting, except for any proxies that have been effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time the           proxy is voted at the reconvened meeting. For purposes of any adjournment, proxies will be voted "for" adjournment unless you direct otherwise           by writing anywhere on the enclosed proxy that you will vote against any adjournments.
If the shareholders fail to elect one or more of the directors, then the board of directors will take such further           action as it deems to be in the best interests of the Fund's shareholders, which may include reproposing the election of any directors who are not elected.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      What constitutes a quorum? 
[END TABLE]
A "quorum" refers to the number of shares that must be in attendance, in person or by proxy, at a meeting to lawfully           conduct business.  With regard to the special meeting, the presence in person or by proxy of shareholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes thereat shall constitute a quorum.  If at the special meeting a quorum is not present or           represented, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a majority of the stock present or represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present or represented.            At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present or represented, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      What happens if I sign and return my proxy card but do not mark my vote? 
[END TABLE]
Gary B. Wood, John A. Stetter and Gregory B. Wood, as proxies, will vote your shares to elect the nominees for           director.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      May I revoke my proxy? 
[END TABLE]
Any shareholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before it is exercised by delivering notice of such           revocation to the Secretary of the Fund in open meeting or in writing by filing with the Secretary of the Fund either a notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date.  Presence at the special meeting by a shareholder who has           signed a proxy does not itself revoke the proxy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Q.                      Who will count the votes? 
[END TABLE]
A representative of Computershare Fund Services will tabulate the votes and Gregory B. Wood will act as inspector of           election.

 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Director Nominees. At the           special meeting, shareholders are being asked to elect three directors.  Each director will hold office during the lifetime of the Fund until the election of his successor, or until he sooner dies, resigns or is removed in accordance with the           Fund's charter documents.
Section 16(a) of the Investment Company Act requires that at least a majority of the Fund's directors be elected by           the shareholders.  The Fund called the special meeting to have all of the directors elected or re-elected, as the case may be, by shareholders.
Each nominee has consented to being named as a nominee and to serve if elected.  As proxies, Gary B. Wood, John A.           Stetter and Gregory B. Wood intend to vote for the election of all of the nominees.  Should the Fund lawfully identify or nominate substitute nominees before the special meeting, the Fund will file supplemental proxy material that identifies such           nominee(s), discloses whether such nominee(s) has (have) consented to being named in the proxy material and to serve if elected and includes the relevant required disclosures with respect to such nominee(s).
Certain important information regarding each of the nominees (including their principal occupations for at least the           last five years) is set forth below. The Fund is the only series of Concorde Funds, Inc., and is not part of a "Fund Complex" as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The directors and officers of the Fund are as set forth on the following pages (ages and employment tenures listed           are as of December 31, 2018).

Gary B. Wood, Ph.D., has             been a director of the Fund since its inception.  His experience and skill as a portfolio manager, as well as his familiarity with investment strategies utilized by the Advisor, led to the conclusion that he should serve as a director.               William Marcy, Ph.D. has served as a director since 2006.  Dr. Marcy is an experienced businessman and is familiar with financial statements.  Dr. Marcy takes a constructive and thoughtful approach in addressing issues facing the Fund.  This             combination of skill and attributes led to the conclusion that Dr. Marcy should serve as a director. Harold E. Schneider is newly nominated as a director. Mr. Schneider's experience as an investor has provided him with knowledge of           financial, accounting, regulatory and investment matters that are relevant to the operation of the Fund.  As an experienced businessman, Mr. Schneider is familiar with financial statements.  This combination of experiences and knowledge led to the conclusion that Mr. Schneider should serve as a director.
The Board has an audit             committee whose members were Mr. John H. Wilson and Dr. William Marcy during the prior fiscal year.  Currently, Dr. William Marcy serves on the audit committee, and it is expected that Mr.  Schneider will serve on the audit committee with Dr. Marcy.  The primary functions of the audit committee are to recommend to the Board the independent auditors to be retained to perform the             annual audit, to review the results of the audit, to review the Fund's internal controls and to review certain other matters relating to the independent auditors and financial records.  The audit committee met one time during the fiscal year             ended September 30, 2018.
The Board has no other committees.
Director Compensation. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, each director who is not deemed an "interested person" of the Fund received $250 for each Board meeting             attended. The Fund's standard arrangement with the directors is to reimburse each director for expenses incurred in connection with attendance at meetings of the Board.  The Fund does not maintain any deferred compensation, pension or             retirement plans, and no pension or retirement benefits are accrued as Fund expenses.
The following table sets forth the compensation paid by the Fund to each of the directors of the Fund           that served during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018:

Board's Role and Committees.            As a Texas corporation, the business and affairs of the Fund are managed by its officers under the direction of the Board of Directors (the "Board").  The Board is responsible for the overall             management of the Fund.  This includes the general supervision and review of the Fund's investment policies and activities.  The Board approves all significant agreements between the Fund and those parties furnishing services to it, which             include agreements with the Advisor, administrator, custodian and transfer agent.  The Board appoints officers who conduct and administer the Fund's day-to-day operations.
The Fund has an audit             committee consisting solely of disinterested directors. Dr. William Marcy and Mr. John H. Wilson served on the audit committee during the prior fiscal year.  Currently, Dr. William Marcy serves on the audit committee, and it is expected that             Mr. Schneider will serve on the audit committee with Dr. Marcy.  As Chairman of the Board and disinterested director, Dr. Marcy (who is acting             as interim Chairman of the Board) is the presiding officer at all meetings of the Board.  Given the size of the Board and the ability of the disinterested directors to provide input on meeting agendas, together with the regular executive             sessions of the disinterested directors and the annual Board self-assessment, the Board believes that the current structure is working effectively. Accordingly, the Board has determined that its leadership structure is appropriate and effective             in light of the size of the Fund, the nature of its business and industry practices.
Through its direct oversight role, and indirectly through the Audit Committee, the Board performs a             risk oversight function for the Fund.  To effectively perform its risk oversight function, the Board, among other things, performs the following activities: receives and reviews reports related to the performance and operations of the Fund;             reviews and approves, as applicable, the compliance policies and procedures of the Fund; approves the Fund's principal investment policies; meets with representatives of various service providers, including the Advisor and the independent             registered public accounting firm of the Fund, to review and discuss the activities of the Fund and to provide direction with respect thereto; and appoints a chief compliance officer of the Fund who oversees the implementation and testing of             the Fund's compliance program and reports to the Board regarding compliance matters for the Fund and its service providers.
 The audit committee plays a significant role in risk oversight as it meets annually with the auditor             of the Fund and periodically with the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer.
Not all risks that may affect the Fund can be identified nor can controls be developed to eliminate or             mitigate their occurrence or effects.  It may not be practical or cost effective to eliminate or mitigate certain risks, the processes and controls employed to address certain risks may be limited in their effectiveness, and some risks are             simply beyond the reasonable control of the Fund, the Advisor or other service providers.  Moreover, it is necessary to bear certain risks (such as investment-related risks) to achieve the Fund's goals.  As a result of the foregoing and other             factors, the Fund's ability to manage risk is subject to substantial limitations.
The boards of directors held four meetings in 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (a) the total number of meetings of the board and (b) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the board on which the director served.
General Nominating Policies, Procedures               and Processes. The Board as a whole is responsible for identifying, evaluating and recommending nominees for director.  However, the independent directors of the Board are responsible for selecting and nominating any independent           directors.  While the Board and independent directors (with respect to selecting and nominating independent directors) do not have a formal process for identifying and evaluating director candidates, in identifying and evaluating nominees for           director, the board or the independent directors, as the case may be, seek to ensure:
1. that the Board possesses, in the aggregate, the strategic and financial skills and experience necessary to fulfill           its duties and to achieve its objectives; and
2. that the Board is comprised of directors who have broad and diverse backgrounds, as appropriate, possessing knowledge           in areas that are of importance to the Fund.
The Board and independent directors (with respect to selecting and nominating independent directors) look at each           nominee on a case-by-case basis regardless of who recommends the nominee to determine whether the proposed candidate meets the minimum qualifications for eligibility and is otherwise suitable for further consideration. At a minimum, each director           nominee must have displayed the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, values and sound business judgment. Further, in looking at the qualifications of each candidate to determine if their election would further the goals described           above, the Board or the independent directors, as the case may be, may take into account all factors it considers appropriate, which may include the following specific qualities and skills:
1. Exhibit high standards of integrity, commitment and independent thought and judgment. Also be free of any conflict of           interest that would violate any applicable law or regulation or interfere with the proper performance of the responsibilities of a director.
2. Have relevant experience with a range of skills that will allow the person to provide sound guidance with respect to           the Fund's operations and interests.
3. Have the ability to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent pursuit of his or her           duties, including attending meetings and reviewing all material in advance.
4. Have the ability to discuss major issues and come to a reasonable conclusion. The capability to understand,           effectively discuss and make appropriate judgments with respect to issues of importance to the Fund. While being collegial, the candidate should have the ability to be direct and not afraid to disagree on important issues.
5. For audit committee members, possess experience in the review of financial statements and meet any independence           requirements of applicable rules and regulations.
Process for Shareholder Director               Nominees. The Board and independent directors (with respect to selecting and nominating independent directors) do not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by shareholders, but           the board may consider recommendations that are submitted in accordance with the process described below. Because of the size of the Board and the historical small turnover of its members, the Board and independent directors (with respect to           selecting and nominating independent directors) addresses the need to retain members and fill vacancies after discussion among current members. Accordingly, the Board and independent directors (with respect to selecting and nominating independent           directors) have determined that it is appropriate not to have such a policy at this time.
While the Board and independent directors (with respect to selecting and nominating independent directors) are not           required to consider candidates recommended by the Fund's shareholders for election as directors, the Board in its discretion may consider such recommendations. Any shareholder that wishes to nominate a director candidate should submit complete           information as to the identity and qualifications of the director candidate. At a minimum, this information should include (a) the name and age of the nominee; (b) the nominee's business background for at least the past five years; (c) any           directorships that the nominee holds in other companies or investment companies; (d) any relationships of the nominee to the Fund, including share ownership; and (e) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such shareholder and           each nominee and any other person pursuant to which the nomination is being made.
A shareholder recommendation for a director nominee should be delivered to Concorde Funds Inc., Attention: Secretary,           8383 Preston Center Plaza Drive, Suite 360, Dallas, Texas 75225.
Shareholder Communications with Board.           Shareholders of the Fund may communicate with the Board (or individual directors serving on the Board) by sending written communications, addressed to any director or to the Board as a group, to Concorde Funds Inc., Attention: Secretary, 8383           Preston Center Plaza Drive, Suite 360, Dallas, Texas 75225, who will ensure that this communication (assuming it is properly marked care of the Board or care of a specific director) is delivered to the Board or the specified director, as the case           may be.
Attendance of Directors at Annual               Meetings. The Fund does not hold annual meetings and therefore does not have a policy with regard to directors' attendance at such meetings.
Required Vote. Shareholders           elect directors by a plurality of the votes cast by shares which are entitled to vote in the election, assuming a quorum is present. For this purpose, "plurality" means that the nominees receiving the largest number of votes from the shareholders           of the Fund will be elected as directors. As a result, under a plurality voting standard in an uncontested election, each nominee is elected or reelected to the Board so long as a single vote is cast in favor of his or her election.  Abstentions           and broker non-votes (if any) will be counted as votes present for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Assuming a quorum is present, any shares which do not vote, whether by abstention or otherwise, will not affect the election           of directors.
Recommendation. The directors           recommend a vote "for" all the nominees.
OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND PRINCIPAL SHAREHOLDERS
A principal shareholder is any person who owns of record or beneficially 5% or more of the outstanding           shares of the Fund.  Control persons are persons deemed to control the Fund because they own beneficially over 25% of the outstanding shares of the Fund.  Shareholders with a controlling interest could affect the outcome of proxy voting or the           direction of management of the Fund.
The Fund does not know of any person who owns beneficially, directly or through controlled companies,           more than 25% of the Fund's shares or who acknowledges the existence of control.  As of January 31, 2019, the following shareholder was considered to be a principal shareholder of the Fund:

In addition, there is an exception to the foregoing pre-approval requirement for non-audit services provided to Service Affiliates of the Fund that applies if (i) the aggregate fees and           costs of all non-audit services that, but for this limited exception, would require pre-approval by the audit committee constitutes no more than five percent of the total fees and costs paid by the Fund and its Services Affiliates to the Auditor           during the fiscal year during which such non-audit services are provided; (ii) at the time of engagement for such services, the Fund did not recognize that the services were "non-audit services" that required pre-approval; and (iii) each such           service is promptly brought to the attention of and approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit.

"Audit services" refer to performing an audit of the Fund's annual financial statements or services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years.              "Audit-related services" refer to the assurance and related services by the principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit.  "Tax services" refer to professional services rendered by the principal accountant             for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning.

RECEIPT OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholder proposals meeting tests contained in those           rules may, under certain conditions, be included in our proxy materials for a particular meeting of shareholders. One of these conditions relates to the timely receipt by us of any such proposal. Since we do not have regular annual meetings of           shareholders, under these rules, proposals submitted for inclusion in the proxy materials for a particular meeting must be received by us a reasonable time before the solicitation of proxies for the meeting is made. The fact that we receive a           shareholder proposal in a timely manner does not ensure its inclusion in our proxy materials since there are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion.
