  3 A non-binding resolution      to approve the compensation of our named executive officers;       
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote your shares FOR each of proposals one through three.
HOW WE PROVIDE PROXY MATERIALS
We began providing our proxy statement and form of proxy to stockholders on March 15, 2019.
As Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules permit, we are making our proxy statement and our annual report available to many of our stockholders via the internet rather than by mail. This reduces printing and delivery costs and supports our sustainability efforts. You may have received in the mail a "Notice of Electronic Availability" explaining how to access this proxy statement and our annual report on the internet and how to vote online. If you received this Notice but would like to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions contained in the Notice for requesting these materials.
WHO MAY VOTE
If you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on the record date of March 1, 2019, you are eligible to vote at the meeting. Each share of our common stock that you own entitles you to one vote. Shares may not be voted cumulatively.
As of the record date, 47,453,247 shares of common stock were outstanding.
If your shares are held by a bank or brokerage firm, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of the shares held in "street name." If your shares are held in street name, your bank or brokerage firm (the record holder of your shares) forwarded to you these proxy materials, along with a voting instruction card. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your record holder how to vote your shares, and the record holder is required to vote your shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions to your bank or brokerage firm, it will nevertheless be entitled to vote your shares with respect to "routine" items, but it will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to "non-routine" items. In the case of non-routine items, your shares will be considered "broker non-votes" on those proposals.
HOW TO VOTE
If you are the record holder of shares of our common stock as of the record date, you may vote by using the telephone
2019 Proxy Statement      1
or internet, by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card by mail, or by voting in person at the meeting. To vote by telephone or internet, see the instructions on the proxy card and have the proxy card available when you place your telephone call or access the internet website. To vote your proxy by mail, or by voting in person at the meeting, mark your vote on the proxy card, then follow the instructions on the card to return it by mail.
If your shares are held in street name, please follow the instructions on the voting instruction card to vote your shares.
If you are the record holder of your shares and you attend the meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person. Additionally, we will distribute written ballots to registered stockholders who wish to vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners of shares held in street name who wish to vote at the meeting will need to obtain a power of attorney or proxy from their record holder to do so.
If you return a completed and properly signed proxy card prior to the meeting, or if you vote by telephone or the internet prior to the meeting, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares according to your directions. The voting results will be certified by independent Inspectors of Election.
If you are a stockholder of record and you sign and return your proxy card, or if you vote by using the telephone or internet, but you do not specify how you want to vote your shares, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote your shares as follows:
If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, the persons named as proxies on the proxy card will vote as recommended by the Board of Directors or, if no recommendation is given, in their discretion.
EFFECT OF NOT INSTRUCTING YOUR BROKER
Routine Matters. If your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct the broker on how to vote your shares, your broker may choose to leave your shares unvoted or to vote your shares on routine matters. "Proposal 2 — Ratification of Auditors" is the only routine matter on the agenda at this year's Annual Meeting.
Non-Routine Matters. Without instructions from you on how to vote your shares, your broker cannot vote your shares on non-routine matters, including Proposals 1 and 3, resulting in what are known as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will not be considered present or entitled to vote on non-routine matters and will also not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast on these proposals. Broker non-votes will not affect the outcome of any proposals considered at the Annual Meeting.
HOW WITHHOLD VOTES AND ABSTENTIONS WILL BE COUNTED
Election of Directors. "Withhold" votes for the election of directors will have no impact on the outcome of the vote. They will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast or as votes "for" or "against" a nominee.
Other Proposals. Abstentions will be counted:
HOW TO REVOKE OR CHANGE YOUR VOTE
If you are a stockholder of record, there are several ways to revoke or change your vote:
If you hold your shares in street name, the above options for changing your vote or revoking your instructions do not apply and you must follow the instructions received from your bank or broker to change your vote or revoke your proxy.
2      2019 Proxy Statement
VOTES REQUIRED
There must be a quorum to conduct business at the Annual Meeting, which is established by having a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy. If you vote, your shares will be included in the number of shares to establish the quorum. Abstentions (or "Withhold" votes for the elections of directors) or proxy cards returned without voting instructions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether the quorum requirement is satisfied.
Election of Directors. The Company has a "plurality-plus" voting policy for directors in uncontested elections. Under our "plurality-plus" voting policy, if any nominee for director receives a greater number of votes "withheld" than votes "for" such nominee in an uncontested election, he or she will promptly tender his or her resignation. The Governance Committee, without the participation of the director who tendered his or her resignation, will then take action to accept or reject the director's resignation and submit its recommendation to the full Board of Directors. The full Board of Directors, without the participation of the director who tendered his or her resignation, will accept or reject the resignation within 90 days of the certification of the election results and, if it chooses not to accept the resignation, will promptly disclose its decision in a Form 8-K or similar filing with the SEC. Further details about our "plurality plus" policy are included in our Corporate Governance Policies, which are available in the Investors' section of our website at www.avanos.com.
Other Proposals or Matters. Approval requires the affirmative vote of a majority of shares that are present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the proposal.
If you are a stockholder of record and you do not sign and return a proxy card or vote by telephone or the internet, your shares will not count toward the quorum requirement and will not affect the outcome of any proposal at the Annual Meeting.
ATTENDING THE ANNUAL MEETING
If you are a stockholder of record, you or your duly appointed representative may attend the Annual Meeting in person. Returning your proxy card will not affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting and to vote in person. If you do plan to attend, we ask that you inform us electronically, by telephone, or by checking the appropriate box on your proxy form. This will assist us with meeting preparations and help to expedite your admittance.
If your shares are not registered in your own name and you would like to attend the meeting, please ask the broker, trust, bank or other nominee that holds your shares to provide you with written proof of your share ownership as of the record date. This will enable you to gain admission to the meeting.
If you need directions to the meeting, please contact Stockholder Services by telephone at 678-425-9273 or by e-mail at stockholder.services@avanos.com. Please bring a driver's license or other photo-identification with you to the meeting to facilitate admission to the meeting.
COSTS OF SOLICITATION
The Company will bear all costs of this proxy solicitation, including the cost of preparing, printing and delivering materials, and the out-of-pocket expenses of brokers, fiduciaries and other nominees who forward proxy materials to stockholders. In addition to mail and electronic means, our employees may solicit proxies by telephone or otherwise. Our employees will not receive additional compensation for such solicitations. We have retained D. F. King & Co., Inc., to aid in the solicitation at a cost of approximately $10,500 plus reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses.
2019 Proxy Statement      3
CORPORATEGOVERNANCE
Our governance structure and processes are based on a number of important governance documents including our Code of Conduct, Certificate of Incorporation, Corporate Bylaws, Corporate Governance Policies and our Board Committee Charters. These documents, which are available in the Investor's section of our website at www.avanos.com, guide the Board and our management in the execution of their responsibilities.
The Company believes that there is a direct connection between good corporate governance and long-term, sustained business success, and we believe it is important to uphold sound governance practices. As such, the Board reviews its governance practices and documents on an ongoing basis, and it considers changing regulatory requirements, governance trends, and issues raised by our stockholders. After careful evaluation, we may periodically make governance changes in view of these matters to maintain current good governance practices and promote stockholder value.
We believe we are in compliance with all applicable corporate governance requirements of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 that have become effective as of the date of this proxy statement.
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Ronald Dollens has served as the Chairman of the Board ("Chairman") since September 1, 2017. Under current circumstances, it is the Board's view that separate Chairman and CEO roles promotes candid discourse and responsible corporate governance. The Board retains the discretion to combine the Chairman and CEO roles, and appoint an independent Lead Director, at any time if it deems that to be in the best interest of our Company and stockholders.
Consistent with this leadership structure, at least once a quarter our Chairman, who is an independent director, chairs executive sessions of our non-management directors. Members of the Company's senior management team do not attend these sessions.
Ronald Dollens serves as our independent Chairman. Our Corporate Governance Policies outline the significant roles and responsibilities of the Chairman, which include:
4      2019 Proxy Statement
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
We believe our independent board helps ensure good corporate governance and strong internal controls.
Our Corporate Governance Policies, as adopted by the Board, provide independence standards consistent with the rules and regulations of the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE. Our independence standards can be found in Section 17 of our Corporate Governance Policies.
The Governance Committee of the Board has determined that all directors and nominees, except for Joseph F. Woody, are independent directors and meet the independence standards in our Corporate Governance Policies.
BOARD MEETINGS
The Board of Directors met 10 times in 2018. All of the directors attended in excess of 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served.
Although we do not have a formal policy with respect to director attendance at annual meetings, all directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting, and we expect that all directors, including those standing for election, will be in attendance at the Annual Meeting on April 25, 2019.
BOARD COMMITTEES
In 2018, the standing committees of the Board included the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Compliance Committee, Governance Committee, and Executive Committee. In compliance with applicable NYSE corporate governance listing standards, the Board has adopted charters for all Committees except the Executive Committee.
Our Committee charters are available in the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com.
As set forth in our Corporate Governance Policies, and in the charter of each individual Committee, the Board's Committees all have the authority to retain independent advisors and consultants, with all costs paid by the Company.
Audit Committee
[BEGIN TABLE]
Chairman: Heidi          Kunz Other members:          Gary Blackford and Patrick O'Leary 
Chairman: Heidi          Kunz Other members:          Gary Blackford and Patrick O'Leary 
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that all Audit Committee members are "audit committee financial experts" under SEC rules and regulations, satisfy the NYSE's financial literacy requirements, and qualify as independent directors under our Corporate Governance Policies.
No member of the Audit Committee serves on the audit committees of more than three public companies. Under our Audit Committee charter and NYSE corporate governance listing standards, if a member were to serve on more than three such committees, the Board would then determine whether this situation impairs the member's ability to serve effectively on our Audit Committee, and we would post information about this determination on the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com.
The Committee met 5 times in 2018, including once in joint session with the Compliance Committee.
2019 Proxy Statement      5
The Committee's principal functions, as specified in its charter, include:

Chairman: Julie          Shimer Other members:          John Byrnes, William Hawkins, and Maria Sainz. 
[END TABLE]
Each member of this Committee is an independent director. The Committee met 6 times in 2018.
The Committee's principal functions, as specified in its charter, include:
Roles of the Committee and the CEO in Compensation Decisions
Each year, the Committee reviews and approves the compensation of our named executive officers, including our CEO, and, as of 2018, certain other non-executive officers who report directly to the CEO, the chief technology officer (who reports to the CFO), and the general managers of the Company's business units (who report to the President – Global Franchises) (collectively, "Covered Officers"). The Committee's charter does not permit the Committee to delegate to anyone the authority to establish any compensation policies or programs for the executive officers. With respect to officers other than the executive officers and the Covered Officers, our CEO has the authority to establish compensation programs and, subject to certain limits, to approve equity grants. However, only the Committee may make equity grants to our executive officers.
6      2019 Proxy Statement
Our CEO makes a recommendation to the Committee each year on the appropriate target annual compensation for each of the other executive officers and Covered Officers. The Committee makes the final determination of the target annual compensation for each executive officer, including our CEO, as well as for the other Covered Officers. While our CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer typically each attend Committee meetings, none of the other executive officers is present during the portion of the Committee meetings when compensation for executive officers is set. In addition, neither our CEO nor our Chief Human Resources Officer is present during the portion of the Committee meetings when their compensation is set.
For additional information on the Committee's processes and procedures for determining executive compensation, and for a detailed discussion of our compensation policies, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis."
Use of Compensation Consultants
The Committee's charter authorizes the Committee to retain advisors, including compensation consultants, to assist it in its work. The Committee believes that compensation consultants can provide important market information and perspectives that can help it determine compensation programs that best meet the objectives of our compensation policies. In selecting a consultant, the Committee evaluates the independence of the firm as a whole and of the individual advisors who will be working with the Committee.
The Committee retains an independent executive compensation consultant who, according to the Committee's written policy, provides services solely to the Committee and not to the Company. The Committee's consultant has no other business relationship with the Company and receives no payments from the Company other than fees for services to the Committee. The consultant reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee may replace the consultant or hire additional consultants at any time. The Committee has selected Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian") as its independent consultant.
In 2018, the scope of activities for the Committee's independent compensation consultant included:
Committee Assessment of Consultant Conflicts of Interest
The Committee has reviewed whether the work provided by Meridian raises any conflict of interest. Factors considered by the Committee include: (1) whether other services are provided to the Company by the consultant; (2) what percentage of the consultant's total revenue is made up of fees from the Company; (3) policies or procedures of the consultant that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between individual consultants involved in the engagement and Committee members; (5) any shares of the Company stock owned by individual consultants involved in the engagement; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. Based on its review, the Committee does not believe that the compensation consultants that performed services to the Committee in 2018 have a conflict of interest with respect to the work performed for the Committee.
Committee Report
The Committee has reviewed the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement and has recommended that it be included in this proxy statement. The Committee's report is located at "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Compensation Committee Report."

For information about the Company's policies on transactions with related parties, see "Transactions with Related Parties" later in this proxy statement.

The Committee, in accordance with its charter and our Certificate of Incorporation, has established criteria and processes for director nominations, including those proposed by stockholders.

COMMUNICATING WITH DIRECTORS
The Board has established processes by which stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board, as well as with the Audit Committee and Compliance Committee. Those processes can be found in the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com.
OTHER CORPORATE GOVERNANCE POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Corporate Governance Policies. The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Policies. These policies guide the Company and the Board on matters of corporate governance, including: director responsibilities, Board committees and their charters, director independence, director compensation and performance assessments, director orientation and education, director access to management, Board access to outside financial, business, and legal advisors, and management development and succession planning. To see these policies, go to the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com.
Code of Conduct. The Company has a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our directors, executive officers and employees, including our CEO, Chief Financial Officer, and Vice President and Controller. It is available in the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com. Any amendments to or waivers of our Code of Conduct applicable to our CEO, Chief Financial Officer, or Vice President and Controller will also be posted at that location.
Board and Management Roles in Risk Oversight. The Board is responsible for providing risk oversight with respect to our operations. In connection with this oversight, the Board particularly focuses on our strategic and operational risks, as well as related risk mitigation. In addition, the Board reviews and oversees management's response to key risks facing the Company.
The Board's committees review particular risk areas to assist the Board in its overall risk oversight of the Company:
2019 Proxy Statement      9
Complementing the Board's overall risk oversight, our senior executive team identifies and monitors key enterprise-wide and business unit risks, providing the basis for the Board's risk review and oversight process. Our senior management team is supported by management members from business units and from our finance, treasury, information technology, global risk management, compliance, internal audit, and legal functions. Management identifies significant risks for review and updates our policies for risk management in areas such as hedging, foreign currency, and country risks, product liability, property and casualty risks, and supplier and customer risks. The Board believes the allocation of risk management responsibilities described above supplements the Board's leadership structure by allocating risk areas to an appropriate committee for oversight, allows for an orderly escalation of issues as necessary, and helps the Board satisfy its risk oversight responsibilities.
Whistleblower Procedures. The Audit Committee has established procedures for receiving, recording and addressing any complaints we receive regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters, and for the confidential and anonymous submission, by our employees or others, of any concerns about our accounting or auditing practices. The Compliance Committee has adopted similar procedures for receiving, recording, and addressing any complaints we receive regarding compliance matters other than those addressed by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee's and Compliance Committee's procedures are available in the Investor's section of our website at www.avanos.com. We also maintain a toll-free Code of Conduct telephone line and a website, each allowing our employees and others to voice their concerns anonymously.
Management Succession Planning. In conjunction with the Board, the Compensation Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing the long-term management development plans and succession plans for the CEO and other key officers, as well as the emergency succession plan for the CEO and other key officers if any of these officers unexpectedly becomes unable to perform his or her duties.
Disclosure Committee. We have established a Disclosure Committee to assist in fulfilling our obligations to maintain disclosure controls and procedures and to coordinate and oversee the process of preparing our periodic securities filings with the SEC. This committee is composed of members of management and is chaired by our Vice President and Controller.
No Executive Loans. We do not extend loans to our executive officers or directors and therefore do not have any such loans outstanding.
Charitable Contributions. The Governance Committee has adopted guidelines for the review and approval of charitable contributions by the Company to organizations or entities with which a director or an executive officer may be affiliated. We will disclose in the Investors section of our website at www.avanos.com any contributions made by us to a tax-exempt organization under the following circumstances:

PROPOSAL 1. 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Board is divided into three classes, as required by our Certificate of Incorporation, with one class of directors elected each year for a three-year term. As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board consists of nine directors. Three of the directors have terms that expire at this year's Annual Meeting (Class of 2019), three have terms that expire at next year's Annual Meeting (Class of 2020), and three have terms that expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting (Class of 2021).
The three nominees standing for election at the Annual Meeting are being nominated to serve for a term to expire at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Class of 2022), and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. All nominees have advised us that they will serve if elected; however, should any nominee become unable to serve, the Board may reduce the number of directors to be elected or select a substitute nominee. If the Board selects a substitute nominee, the shares represented by valid proxies will be voted for the substitute nominee, other than shares voted "Withhold" with respect to the original nominee.
Given the independent status of the nominees, if all nominees are elected at the Annual Meeting, eight of the nine directors on our Board will be independent directors.
PROCESS AND CRITERIA FOR NOMINATING DIRECTORS
The Board is responsible for approving candidates for Board membership. The Board has delegated the screening and recruitment process to the Governance Committee, in consultation with the Chairman and CEO. The Committee therefore recommends to the Board any new appointments and nominees for election as directors at our annual meeting of stockholders. It also recommends nominees to fill any vacancies. As provided in our Certificate of Incorporation, the Board may elect a new director when a vacancy occurs between annual meetings of stockholders.
The Committee may receive recommendations for Board candidates from various sources, including our directors, management, and stockholders. Stockholders may submit recommendations for Board candidates to the Chairman of the Governance Committee at Avanos Medical, Inc., c/o Corporate Secretary, 5405 Windward Parkway, Suite 100 South, Alpharetta, GA 30004. Board candidates recommended by stockholders are evaluated using the same criteria as candidates recommended by other sources. For details on this process, see "Other Information — Stockholder Nominations for Board of Directors." In addition, the Governance Committee may periodically retain a search firm to assist it in identifying and recruiting director candidates meeting the criteria specified by the Committee.
The Committee believes that the criteria for director nominees should foster effective corporate governance, support our strategies and businesses, take diversity into account, and ensure that our directors, as a group, have an overall mix of the attributes needed for an effective Board. The criteria should also support the successful recruitment of qualified candidates.
Qualified candidates for director are those who, in the judgment of the Committee, possess all of the personal attributes and a sufficient mix of the experience attributes listed below to ensure effective service on the Board.

COMMITTEE REVIEW OF ATTRIBUTES OF CURRENT DIRECTORS
The Governance Committee has reviewed the background of each of our current directors and their service on the Board in light of the personal and experience attributes described above. The Committee has determined that each director possesses all of the personal attributes as well as a sufficient mix of the experience attributes.
For details about each director's specific experience attributes, see "The Nominees" and "Directors Continuing in Office" below.
DIVERSITY OF DIRECTORS
As noted above, the Governance Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute for directors. As a result, the Committee seeks to have a diverse Board that is representative of our customer, product user, employee and stockholder base. While the Committee carefully considers this diversity when considering nominees for director, the Committee has not established a formal policy regarding diversity in identifying director nominees.
THE NOMINEES
The following three individuals are nominated for election to the Board for a three-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Class of 2022):

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Directors who are not officers or employees of the Company or any of our subsidiaries, affiliates or equity companies are Outside Directors for compensation purposes and are compensated for their services under our Outside Directors' Compensation Plan. All independent directors currently on our Board are Outside Directors and are compensated under this Plan.
Our objectives for Outside Director compensation are:
In 2015, our Outside Director compensation was established based on the median non-management director compensation for our peers. In 2018, after an analysis by Meridian, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, it was determined that the Company's Outside Director compensation was lower than the median non-management director compensation for our peer group. A list of the 2018 peer group companies may be found in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in Outside Director compensation. On April 25, 2018, the Committee approved (i) an increase of the annual restricted share unit grant from $140,000 to $160,000 for all Outside Directors and (ii) a top-up grant of such units with a value of $20,000, effective on or about May 3, 2018. The Committee also decided to evaluate potential additional adjustments to Outside Director Compensation at a later date. On December 12, 2018, the Committee, with additional information from Median indicating that the Company's Outside Director compensation continued to be lower than the median non-management director compensation for our peer group, re-evaluated the matter and approved an increase of the annual restricted share unit grant from $160,000 to $180,000 for all Outside Directors, effective as of January 1, 2019, and (ii) an increase of the additional cash compensation for the Audit Committee chair from $15,000 to $20,000, also effective as of January 1, 2019.
The table below shows how we structure Outside Director compensation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Board Members Cash retainer: $70,000 annually, paid in four quarterly payments          at the beginning of each quarter. Restricted share units: Annual grant with a value of $180,000,          awarded and valued on the first business day of the year. 
  Board Members Cash retainer: $70,000 annually, paid in four quarterly payments          at the beginning of each quarter. Restricted share units: Annual grant with a value of $180,000,          awarded and valued on the first business day of the year. 
  Board Members Cash retainer: $70,000 annually, paid in four quarterly payments          at the beginning of each quarter. Restricted share units: Annual grant with a value of $180,000,          awarded and valued on the first business day of the year. 
  Chairman of the Board Additional cash compensation of $115,000, paid in four quarterly          payments at the beginning of each quarter. 
  Chairman of the Board Additional cash compensation of $115,000, paid in four quarterly          payments at the beginning of each quarter. 
  Committee Chairs Additional cash compensation of $15,000, paid in four quarterly          payments at the beginning of each quarter, except that the Audit Committee chair receives additional cash compensation of $20,000,          paid in four quarterly payments at the beginning of each quarter. 
  Committee Chairs Additional cash compensation of $15,000, paid in four quarterly          payments at the beginning of each quarter, except that the Audit Committee chair receives additional cash compensation of $20,000,          paid in four quarterly payments at the beginning of each quarter. 
[END TABLE]
New Outside Directors receive a pro-rated annual retainer and grant of restricted share units based on the month when they join the Board.
We also reimburse Outside Directors for expenses incurred in attending Board or committee meetings.
Restricted share units are not shares of our common stock. Rather, restricted share units represent the right to receive a pre-determined number of shares of our common stock within 90 days following a "restricted period" that begins on the date of grant and expires on the date the Outside Director retires from or otherwise terminates service on the Board. In this way, they align the director's interests with the interests of our stockholders. Outside Directors may not dispose of the units or use them in a pledge or similar transaction. Outside Directors also receive additional restricted share units equivalent in value to the
2019 Proxy Statement      17
dividends, if any, that would have been paid to them if the restricted share units granted to them were shares of our common stock. The Company does not currently pay dividends on its common stock.
2018 OUTSIDE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The following table shows the compensation paid to each Outside Director for his or her service in 2018:
Other than the cash retainer and grants of restricted share units previously described, no Outside Director received any compensation or perquisites from the Company for services as a director in 2018.
A director who is not an Outside Director does not receive any compensation for services as a member of the Board or any committee but is reimbursed for expenses incurred as a result of the services.

PROPOSAL 2.
RATIFICATION OF AUDITORS
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of our independent auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing the negotiation of the audit fees associated with retaining our independent auditors. To assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether a different audit firm should perform our independent audit work. Also, in connection with the mandated rotation of the independent auditor's lead engagement partner, the Audit Committee and its chairman are directly involved in the selection of the lead engagement partner.
For 2019, the Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP (along with its member firms and affiliates, "Deloitte") as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements. In engaging Deloitte for 2019, the Audit Committee utilized a review and selection process that included the following:
The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of Deloitte to serve as our independent auditor is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and they recommend that stockholders ratify this selection.
Representatives of Deloitte are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
Stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of Deloitte as our independent auditor. However, we are submitting the ratification to our stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders fail to ratify the appointment of Deloitte, or even if our stockholders do ratify the appointment of Deloitte, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders.
2019 Proxy Statement      19
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FIRM FEES
Our aggregate fees to Deloitte (excluding value added taxes) with respect to the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows:
AUDIT COMMITTEE APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES
Using the following procedures, the Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by Deloitte to the Company:
The Audit Committee reviews the requests presented in these proposals and memoranda and approves all services it finds acceptable.
To ensure prompt handling of unexpected matters, the Audit Committee has delegated to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee the authority to amend or modify the list of audit and non-audit services and fees between meetings, as long as the additional or amended services do not affect Deloitte's independence under applicable rules. Any actions taken under this authority are reported to the Audit Committee at its next meeting.
All Deloitte services and fees in 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chairperson.

2019 Proxy Statement      21
PROPOSAL 3.
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVENAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERCOMPENSATION
In the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that follows, we describe in detail our executive compensation program, including its objectives, policies, and components. Our executive compensation program seeks to align the compensation of our executives with the objectives of our business plans and strategies. To this end, the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") approved an executive compensation program for 2018 that was designed to achieve the following objectives:
For a more detailed discussion of how our executive compensation program reflects these objectives, including information about the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," below.
We are asking our stockholders to support our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our executive compensation. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our executives and the objectives, policies, and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, our stockholders are being asked to vote on the following non-binding resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables, and narrative discussion, is hereby approved by the Company's stockholders on an advisory basis.
The say-on-pay vote is advisory and is therefore not binding on the Company, the Committee, or our Board. Nonetheless, the Committee and our Board value the opinions of our stockholders. Therefore, to the extent there is any significant vote against the executive compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Committee and our Board will consider our stockholders' concerns and will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSIONAND ANALYSIS
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the compensation policies and decisions regarding 2018 compensation for our named executive officers as well as information on 2019 compensation decisions as of the date of this proxy statement.
For 2018, our named executive officers were: 
To assist stockholders in finding important information, this CD&A is organized as follows:
COMPENSATION EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This executive summary provides a brief overview of our key accomplishments in 2018 and our key compensation principles and practices.
2018 Business Highlights
In 2018, the Company closed the largest transaction in its history, selling its Surgical & Infection Prevention assets to Owens & Minor, Inc. That transaction also included the sale of the Company's name, Halyard Health, and its IT system. The Company chose its new name, Avanos Medical, and rebranded itself as a pure-play medical device company. The Company also embarked on transforming its IT infrastructure to be simpler and more efficient. Also in 2018, the Company acquired Coolsystems, Inc. and its GameReady portfolio of products. And, based on the Company's investment in R&D, it launched 9 new medical device products.
2019 Proxy Statement      23
Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are non-GAAP financial measures. A description of these measures and a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.
Performance-Based Compensation
Pay-for-performance is a key objective of our compensation program. Consistent with that objective, performance-based compensation constituted a significant portion of our named executive officers' target direct annual compensation for 2018. Also, to further align the financial interests of our executives with those of our stockholders, a majority of our executives' target direct annual compensation for 2018 was equity-based. As discussed later in this CD&A, because the Company's and management's performance was below expectations for the year, management's compensation for 2018 was below target.
Compensation Design Principles And Governance Practices
The design principles for our executive compensation program are intended to protect and promote the interests of our stockholders. Below we summarize certain practices we have implemented to drive performance and those we have not implemented because we do not believe they would serve our stockholders' long-term interests:

SETTING ANNUAL COMPENSATION
This section describes the processes followed in setting 2018 target annual compensation for our executive officers.
Focus On Total Direct Annual Compensation
In setting 2018 compensation for our executive officers, including our CEO, the Committee focused on total direct annual compensation, which consists of annual cash compensation (base salary and target annual cash incentive) and long-term equity incentive compensation (performance-based restricted share units and stock options). The Committee considered annual cash and long-term equity incentive compensation both separately and as a package to help ensure that the executive officer compensation objectives are met.
2019 Proxy Statement      27
Benchmarking – Executive Compensation Peer Group
On October 31, 2017, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement ("Purchase Agreement") with Owens & Minor, Inc. ("OMI"). The Purchase Agreement provided for the sale of substantially all of the Company's Surgical and Infection Prevention ("S&IP") business, among other things ("Transaction"). The Company closed the Transaction on April 30, 2018. After closing the Transaction, the Company transformed from one that sells medical supplies and devices with annual net sales of about $1.6 billion into a pure-play medical devices company with annual net sales in excess of $600 million.
At the beginning of 2018, the Committee reviewed the Company's peer group in light of the Transaction, using information and analysis supplied by the Committee's independent compensation consultant. Based on its review, the Committee approved the peer group as shown in the table below. The Committee used this post-Transaction peer group in setting the 2018 compensation of the Company's executive officers:
The peer group is intended to consist of companies with whom we compete for talent. We believe that we generally compete for talent with medical device companies with annual revenues ranging from approximately one-third to three times our annual revenues.
The Committee (working with its independent compensation consultant) reviews the executive compensation peer group annually to ensure that it continues to serve as an appropriate comparison for our compensation program.
Process For Setting Total Direct Annual Compensation Targets
In setting the total direct annual compensation of our executive officers, both market data provided by the independent compensation consultant and information on the performance of each executive officer for prior years is evaluated. To remain competitive in the marketplace for executive talent, the target levels for the executive officers' compensation components, including our CEO, are compared to the median of the peer group.
To reinforce a pay-for-performance culture, targets for individual executive officers may be set above or below this median depending on the individual's performance in prior years and experience in the position, as well as any applicable retention concerns. The Committee believes that comparing target levels to the median, setting targets as described above, and providing incentive compensation opportunities that will enable executives to earn above-target compensation if they deliver above-target performance on their performance goals, are consistent with the objectives of our executive officer compensation policies. In particular, the Committee believes that this approach enables us to attract and retain skilled and talented executive officers to guide and lead our businesses and supports a pay-for-performance culture.
When setting annual compensation for our executive officers, the Committee considers each compensation component (base salary, annual cash incentive and long-term equity incentive), but its decision regarding a particular component does not necessarily impact its decision about other components.
In setting compensation for executive officers that join us from other companies, the Committee evaluates both market data for the position to be filled and the candidate's compensation history. The Committee recognizes that to successfully recruit a candidate to leave his or her current position and to join the Company, the candidate's compensation package may have to exceed his or her current compensation, which could result in a compensation package above the median of our peer group.
28      2019 Proxy Statement
CEO Total Direct Annual Compensation
Our CEO's total direct annual compensation is determined in the same manner as the direct annual compensation of the other named executive officers. The difference between our CEO's compensation and that of the other named executive officers reflects the fact that our CEO's responsibilities for management and oversight of a global enterprise are significantly greater than those of the other executive officers. As a result, the market pay level for our CEO is appropriately higher than the market pay for our other executive officer positions.
Total Direct Annual Compensation Targets For 2018
Consistent with the focus on total direct annual compensation, the Committee established the following 2018 direct annual compensation targets for our named executive officers based on their roles and responsibilities:
These 2018 direct annual compensation target amounts differ from the amounts set forth in the Summary Compensation Table in the following ways:
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR 2018
To help achieve the objectives discussed above, our executive officer compensation program for 2018 consisted of fixed and performance-based components, as well as short-term and long-term components.
Base Salary
To attract and retain high-caliber executives, we pay our executive officers an annual fixed salary that we believe to be competitive in the marketplace.
Salary ranges and individual salaries for executive officers are reviewed annually, and salary adjustments generally are effective on April 1 of each year. In determining individual salaries, salary levels for similar positions at our peer group companies are considered, as well as the executive officer's performance and experience in his or her position. This performance evaluation is based on how the executive officer performs during the year against results-based objectives established at the beginning of the year. In general, an experienced executive officer who is performing at a satisfactory level will receive a base salary at or around the median of our peer group companies. However, executive officers may be paid 
2019 Proxy Statement      29
above or below the median depending on their experience and performance. From time to time, if warranted, executive officers and other employees may receive additional salary increases because of promotions, changes in duties and responsibilities, retention concerns, or market conditions.
The following table shows the 2018 base salaries in effect for each named executive officer during the year.
Annual Cash Incentive Program
Consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation objective, our Executive compensation program includes an annual cash incentive program to motivate and reward executives to achieve annual performance objectives established by the Committee.
2018 Targets
The target payment amount for annual cash incentives is a percentage of the Officer's base salary. The range of possible payouts is expressed as a percentage of the target payment amount. These ranges are set based on competitive factors. The following table sets forth the target payment amounts and range of possible payouts for each named executive officer in 2018:

2018 Performance Goals, Performance Assessments, and Payouts
Payment amounts under the annual cash incentive program are dependent on performance measured against goals established at the beginning of the year. These performance goals are derived from our financial goals.
The table below shows the performance goals and weights established for 2018:
Annual Cash Incentive Program: 2018 Performance Goals and Weights
In February 2019, the Committee determined the extent to which the goals were met in 2018 and the resulting payout. Below we explain how the Committee assessed the performance of the goals for the year and show the payout that was determined.
For 2018, the Committee chose the following as the performance goals for the annual cash incentive program:
To determine the payout percentage, the Committee assessed how the Company performed against the adjusted net sales and adjusted EBITDA goals. For 2018, the Committee set these goals and the corresponding initial payout percentages at the following levels: 
Actual Results and Actual Payout Percentages
For 2018, the Committee determined that the Company's adjusted net sales were $634.4 million and its adjusted EBITDA was $142.5 million. Based on these results, the Committee determined the payout percentage to be 69.5% of target.
2019 Proxy Statement      31
Annual Cash Incentive Payouts for 2018
The following table shows the payout opportunities and the actual payouts of annual cash incentives for 2018 for each of our named executive officers. Payouts were based on the payout percentages for each element, weighted for each executive as shown above.
Mr. Tushar's incentive payout for 2018 was prorated based on his first day of employment, March 12, 2018.
Mr. Sarker's incentive payout for 2018 was prorated based on each of his two different roles during the year. He was paid a prorated amount for his previous role as Vice President Asia-Pacific from January 1, 2018 through May 22, 2018, for which he had a bonus target of 35%, and he was paid a prorated amount for his current role of Senior Vice President - International from May 22, 2018 through December 31, 2018, for which he had a bonus target of 50%.
The Committee believes that the 2018 annual incentive payout is consistent with the pay-for-performance objective of our executive officer compensation program.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
Our executive officers receive annual long-term equity incentive grants as part of their overall compensation package. These awards are consistent with the objectives of aligning our senior leaders' interests with the financial interests of our stockholders, focusing on our long-term success, supporting our performance-oriented environment, and offering competitive compensation packages.
Information regarding long-term equity incentive awards granted to our named executive officers can be found under "Summary Compensation," "Grants of Plan-Based Awards," and "Discussion of Summary Compensation and Plan-Based Awards Tables."
2018 Grants
In determining the 2018 long-term equity incentive award amounts for our named executive officers, the following factors were considered by the Committee, among others: the specific responsibilities and performance of the executive, business performance, retention needs, stock price performance, and other market factors. Because these awards are part of the annual compensation program that compares total direct annual compensation to the median of the peer group comparison, grants from prior years were not considered when setting 2018 targets or granting awards.
To determine target values, each named executive officer's total direct annual compensation was compared to the median of the peer group, and then individual performance and the other factors listed above, as applicable, were considered. Target grant values were then approved by the Committee and were divided into two types:
32      2019 Proxy Statement
The Committee believed this allocation between performance-based restricted share units (PRSUs) and stock options supports the pay-for-performance and stockholder alignment objectives of our executive officer compensation program. In 2018, the following annual long-term equity incentive awards were granted to our named executive officers
For valuation purposes, each PRSU granted was assigned a value equal to the closing price of one share of Company common stock at the end of the day on the date of grant, and each stock option was assigned a value equal to the Black-Scholes valuation for that option at the end of the day on the date of grant.
In 2018, the target grant value of Mr. Sarker's awards were based on his Vice President APAC role. The grants for that role are comprised of 50% PRSUs, 25% Time Based RSUs, and 25% Non-Qualified Stock Options. In addition to the amount shown in the table, Mr. Sarker had a target Time-Based RSU award of 310 shares.
Performance Goals and Potential Payouts for 2016 – 2018 PRSUs
For the PRSUs granted in 2016, the actual number of shares to be received by our named executive officers can range from zero to 200 percent of the target levels established by the Committee for each executive, depending on the degree to which the performance objectives for these awards are met over a three-year period.
The performance objectives for the 2016 awards are based on relative total shareholder return ("relative TSR") for the period January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, measuring the Company's performance relative to S&P 6-Digit GICS code for Healthcare Equipment and Supplies with annual revenue greater than $500 million from the most recent fiscal year. The potential payouts at varying levels of performance for the 2016-2018 PRSUs were as described below, with payouts between the levels determined on a straight-line basis:
Payout of 2016 PRSU's
In February 2018, the Committee evaluated the results of the three-year performance for the 2016 PRSU's. The Committee determined that the relative TSR was 41%. As a result, the Committee determined that the payout percentage for 2016 PRSU's was 82% of target.
2019 Proxy Statement      33
Vesting Levels of Outstanding PRSUs
The performance goals of the PRSUs granted in 2018 and 2017 are also based on relative TSR and will vest on February 28, 2021 and March 1, 2020, respectively. As a result of the Company's performance since those PRSUs were granted, the 2018 and 2017 PRSUs are on pace to vest at 0% percent and 0% percent of target, respectively.
BENEFITS AND OTHER COMPENSATION
Retirement Benefits
Our named executive officers, other than Mr. Sarker, received contributions from the Company under the Avanos Medical, Inc. 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan") and the Avanos Medical, Inc. Non-Qualified 401(k) Plan (the "Non-Qualified 401(k) Plan"). The Company does not have a defined benefit pension plan in the United States, and none of our named executive officers participate in any Company defined benefit pension plans.
The 401(k) Plan and Non-Qualified 401(k) Plan are consistent with those maintained by our peer group companies and are therefore necessary to remain competitive for recruiting and retaining executive talent. The Committee believes that these retirement benefits are important parts of our compensation program. For more information, see "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation – Overview of Qualified and Non-Qualified Plans" and "Pension Benefits."
Mr. Sarker is a citizen of Singapore and received contributions from the Company under the laws applicable to Singapore's Central Provident Fund. That the program is a broad-based statutory retirement program available to all Singapore citizens.
Other Compensation
We believe the perquisites provided to our executive officers are minimal and well below the median of those provided by our peer group. In addition, the Company does not provide tax reimbursement or gross-ups for perquisites offered to executive officers, except for certain relocation benefits.
Post-Termination Benefits
We maintain two severance plans that cover our executive officers: the Severance Pay Plan and the Executive Severance Plan. An executive officer may not receive severance payments under more than one severance plan. Benefits under these plans are payable only if the executive's employment terminates under the conditions specified in the applicable plan. We believe that our severance plans are consistent with those maintained by our peer group companies and that they are therefore important for attracting and retaining executives who are critical to our long-term success and competitiveness. For more information about these severance plans and their terms, see "Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control – Severance Benefits."
Severance Pay Plan
Our Severance Pay Plan provides severance benefits to most of our U.S. hourly and salaried employees, including our named executive officers, who are involuntarily terminated under the circumstances described in the plan. The objective of this plan is to facilitate the employee's transition to his or her next position, and it is not intended to serve as a reward for the employee's past service.
Executive Severance Plan
Our Executive Severance Plan provides severance benefits to eligible executives, including our named executive officers, in the event of a qualified termination of employment (as defined in the plan) in connection with a change of control. For an eligible employee to receive a payment under this plan, two things must occur: there must be a change of control of the Company, and the executive must have been involuntarily terminated without cause or have resigned for good reason (as defined in the plan) within two years of the change of control (often referred to as a "double trigger"). The objective of this plan is to encourage the executive to stay with the Company in the event of a change of control transaction to ensure a smooth transition. Each of our named executive officers has entered into an agreement under the plan that expires on October 31, 2020, except that Mr. Tushar's expires on March 12, 2021.
34      2019 Proxy Statement
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION FOR 2019
Beginning in 2019, the Committee decided to approve excecutive officer compensation for 2019 during its meeting in April. No actions have been taken on executive officer compensation prior to the date of this proxy statement, except that the Committee decided not to change the Company's (i) compensation objectives and policies, (ii) compensation design philosophy and guiding principles, (iii) executive compensation program components, or (iv) peer group.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR COMPENSATION PRACTICES
As a matter of sound governance, we follow certain practices with respect to our Officer compensation program. We regularly review and evaluate our Officer compensation practices in light of regulatory developments, market standards and other considerations.
Use of Independent Compensation Consultant
The Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners LLC ("Meridian") as its independent consultant to assist it in determining the appropriate Officer compensation under our compensation policies described above. Consistent with the Committee's policy in which its independent consultant may provide services only to the Committee, Meridian had no other business relationship with the Company and received no payments from us other than fees and expenses for services to the Committee. See "Corporate Governance—Compensation Committee" for information about the use of compensation consultants.
Role of the Chief Executive Officer in Compensation Decisions
Our CEO makes a recommendation to the Committee each year on the appropriate target annual compensation for each of the other Officers. The Committee makes the final determination of the target annual compensation for each Officer, including our CEO. While our CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer typically attend Committee meetings, none of the other Officers is present during the portion of the Committee's meetings when compensation for Officers is set. In addition, neither our CEO nor our Chief Human Resources Officer is present during the portion of the Committee's meetings when their compensation is set.
Adjustment of Financial Measures for Annual and Long-Term Equity Incentives
Financial measures for the annual incentive programs are developed based on expectations about our planned activities and reasonable assumptions about the performance of our key business drivers for the applicable period. From time to time, however, discrete items or events may arise that were not contemplated by these plans or assumptions. These could include accounting and tax law changes, tax credits from items not within the ordinary course of our business operations, restructuring and write-off charges, significant acquisitions or dispositions, and significant gains or losses from litigation matters.
Under the Committee's exception guidelines regarding our annual incentive program measures, the Committee may adjust in the future the calculation of financial measures for the incentive program to eliminate the effect of the types of items or events described above. In making these adjustments, the Committee's policy is to seek to neutralize the impact of the unexpected or unplanned items or events, whether positive or negative, in order to provide consistent and equitable incentive payments that the Committee believes are reflective of our performance. In considering whether to make a particular adjustment under its guidelines, the Committee will review whether the item or event was one for which management was responsible and accountable, treatment of similar items in prior periods, the extent of the item's or event's impact on the financial measure, and the item's or event's characteristics relative to normal and customary business practices. Generally, the Committee will apply an adjustment to all compensation that is subject to that financial measure.
Pricing and Timing of Stock Option Grants and Timing of Performance-Based Equity Grants
Our policies and our Equity Participation Plan require stock options to be granted at no less than the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, except for the options granted to replace Kimberly-Clark stock options forfeited as a result of the spin-off (which were priced to preserve the intrinsic value of the forfeited Kimberly-Clark options), and the other options granted following the spin-off which used a five-day variable weighted price. Stock option grants to our Officers are generally made annually at a meeting of the Committee that is scheduled at least one year in advance, and the grants 
2019 Proxy Statement      35
are effective on the date of this meeting. However, if the meeting occurs during a period when we do not permit insiders to trade Company common stock (a "Blackout Period"), the stock option grants will not be effective until the first business day following the end of the Blackout Period. Our Blackout Periods end at 11:59 p.m. on the day we issue our quarterly earnings press releases. Our executives are not permitted to choose the grant date for their individual stock option grants.
The CEO has been delegated the limited authority to approve equity grants, including stock options, to employees for recruiting and special employee recognition and retention purposes. These grants may not exceed 100,000 shares in calendar year 2019. The CEO is not permitted to make any grants to any of our executive officers.
Annual stock option grants to non-executive officers are effective on the same date as the annual stock option grants to our executive officers. Recruiting, special recognition, and retention stock-based awards are generally made on a pre-determined date following our quarterly earnings release.
Prior to 2019, the Committee awarded performance-based restricted share units to executive officers at its February meetings. Beginning in 2019, performance based restricted share units will be awarded at its April meeting. We believe this practice is consistent with award practices at other public companies of comparable size. Our executives are not permitted to choose the grant date for their individual restricted share unit awards.
Policy on Incentive Compensation Clawback
As described in detail above, a significant percentage of our executive officer compensation is incentive-based. The determination of the extent to which the incentive objectives are achieved is based in part on the Committee's discretion and in part on our published financial results. The Committee has the right to reassess its determination of the performance awards if the financial statements on which it relied are restated. The Committee has the right to direct management to seek to recover from any executive officer any amounts determined to have been inappropriately received by the individual executive officer. In addition, under the Company's Equity Participation Plan, the Committee may require awards with performance goals under the Plan to be subject to any policy we may adopt relating to the recovery of that award to the extent it is determined that performance goals relating to the awards were not actually achieved. Further, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandates that the CEO and the chief financial officer reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation paid to them in a year following the issuance of financial statements that are later required to be restated as a result of misconduct. The Committee intends to review and revise the incentive compensation clawback policy once the SEC issues final regulations on clawbacks under the Dodd-Frank legislation enacted in 2010.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We strongly believe that the financial interests of our executive officers should be aligned with those of our stockholders. Accordingly, the Committee has established the following stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers:
Target Stock Ownership Amounts 
Failure to attain these targeted stock ownership levels within five years from date of hire for, or appointment to, an eligible position can, at the committee's discretion, result in the reduction of part or all of the executive's annual cash incentive (with a corresponding grant of time-vested restricted share units or restricted stock in that amount), or a reduction in future long-term equity incentive awards, either of which may continue until the ownership guideline is achieved. In determining whether our stock ownership guidelines have been met, any restricted stock and time-vested restricted share units held are counted as owned, but performance-based restricted share units are excluded until they vest. The Committee annually reviews executive officer stock ownership levels for compliance with these guidelines.
36      2019 Proxy Statement
Other Polices Relating to Transactions in COMPANY Securities
We require all executive officers to pre-clear transactions involving our common stock (and other securities related to our common stock) with our Legal Department.
We do not permit our executive officers to engage in transactions that hedge an executive officer's economic risk of owning shares of our common stock. Thus, our executive officers may not engage in hedging transactions in the Company's shares such as puts, calls, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars and other derivative securities on an exchange or in any other organized market. Our executive officers also may not engage in short sales of the Company's shares, meaning sales of shares that are not owned at the time of sale. Additionally, our executives are not permitted to pledge shares of our common stock owned by them as collateral for loans or other obligations.
Corporate Tax Deduction for Executive Compensation
The United States income tax laws generally limit the deductibility of compensation paid to any of a company's named executive officers to $1,000,000 per year. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "New Tax Law"), this limitation did not apply to compensation paid to the chief financial officer or to qualified performance-based forms of compensation if certain requirements were met. Several classes of our executive compensation, including option awards and portions of our long-term equity grants to executive officers, were designed to meet the requirements for deductibility.
Among other things, the New Tax Law included the chief financial officer as one of the covered employees and eliminated exceptions to the limit for qualified performance-based forms of compensation. Compensation paid to our named executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will no longer be deductible unless it qualifies for the transition relief provisions of the New Tax Law, which are limited to certain arrangements that were in place as of November 2, 2017. Despite the fact that certain of our executive programs that were in place prior to such date were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation and have not been materially amended or modified, the Company recognizes that there is continued ambiguity in applying the New Tax Law, which remains subject to further guidance. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these awards will be fully deductible under the transition relief provisions of the New Tax Law.
Although tax deductibility of compensation is preferred, it is not a primary objective of our compensation programs. In the Committee's view, meeting the compensation objectives set forth above is more important than the benefit of being able to deduct the compensation for tax purposes. The Committee has always reserved the ability to award compensation that is not exempt from the deduction limits of 162(m).

ANALYSIS OF COMPENSATION- RELATED RISKS
The Committee has reviewed an assessment of our compensation programs for our employees, including our executive officers, to analyze the risks arising from our compensation systems. The Committee's independent consultant assisted with the review of our executive compensation programs.
Based on this assessment, the Committee believes that the design of our compensation programs, including our executive compensation program, does not encourage our executives or employees to take excessive risks and that the risks arising from these programs are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Several factors contributed to the Committee's conclusion, including:

Overview of Qualified and Non-Qualified Plans. The following is an overview of the Company's qualified and non-qualified plans offered to our executive officers as of December 31, 2018.
The Avanos Medical Non-Qualified 401(k) Plan is not funded and represents a general obligation of the Company.
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS ON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL
The Company's executive officers are eligible to receive certain benefits in the event of termination of employment, including following a change of control of the Company. This section describes various termination scenarios as well as the payments and benefits payable under those scenarios.
Severance Benefits
The Company maintains two severance plans that cover its executive officers, depending on the circumstances that result in their termination. Those plans include the Executive Severance Plan, which is applicable when an executive officer is terminated following a change of control, and the Severance Pay Plan, which is applicable in the event of certain other involuntary terminations. An executive officer may not receive severance payments under more than one of the plans described below.
2019 Proxy Statement      45
Executive Severance Plan. The Company's Board of Directors determines the eligibility criteria for participation in the Executive Severance Plan. The Company has entered into an agreement under this plan with each of its named executive officers. The agreements provide that, in the event of a "Qualified Termination of Employment" (as described below), the executive officers will each receive a cash payment in an amount equal to the sum of:
A "Qualified Termination of Employment" is a separation from service within two years following a change of control of the Company (as defined in the plan) either involuntarily without cause or by the participant with good reason (as defined in the plan). In addition, any involuntary separation from service without cause within one year before a change of control will also be determined to be a Qualified Termination of Employment if it is in connection with, or in anticipation of, a change of control.
The current agreements with each executive officer expire on October 31, 2020, except that Mr. Tushar's agreement expires  in March 12, 2021, all unless extended by the Company's Compensation Committee.
The Executive Severance Plan provides that the executive officers are not entitled to a tax gross-up if they incur an excise tax due to the application of Section 280G of the Code. Instead, payments and benefits payable to an executive officer will be reduced to the extent doing so would result in the officer retaining a larger after-tax amount, taking into account the income, excise and other taxes imposed on the payments and benefits.
The agreements with the executive officers provide that they will retain in confidence any confidential information known to them concerning the Company and the Company's business so long as such information is not publicly disclosed.
Severance Pay Plan. The Company's Severance Pay Plan generally provides eligible employees (including the Company's named executive officers) severance payments and benefits in the event of certain involuntary terminations. Benefits under the Severance Pay Plan depend on the participants' employee classification.
Under the Severance Pay Plan, if an executive officer's employment was involuntarily terminated, he or she would receive:
46      2019 Proxy Statement
Severance pay under the Severance Pay Plan will not be paid to any participant who is terminated for cause (as defined in the plan), is terminated during a period in which the participant is not actively at work for more than 25 weeks (except to the extent otherwise required by law), voluntarily quits or retires, dies or is offered a comparable position (as defined in the plan).
A named executive officer must execute a full and final release of claims against the Company within a specified period of time following termination to receive severance benefits under the Severance Pay Plan. If the release has been timely executed, severance benefits are payable as a lump sum cash payment no later than 60 days following the participant's termination date. Any current year annual incentive award that is payable under the Severance Pay Plan will be paid at the same time as it was payable under the Executive Officer Achievement Award Program or the Management Achievement Award Program, as applicable, but no later than 60 days following the calendar year of the separation from service.
Retirement, Death and Disability
Retirement. Retirement is defined as separation from service on or after the age of 60 with five years of service, or on or after age 55 with ten years of service. Years of service at Kimberly-Clark prior to the spin-off are considered years of service for the definition of retirement. In the event of retirement, the Company's named executive officers are entitled to receive:
Death. In the event of death while an active employee, the following benefits are payable:
2019 Proxy Statement      47
Disability. In the event of a separation from service due to a total and permanent disability, as defined in the applicable plan, the Company's named executive officers are entitled to receive:
Potential Payments on Termination or Change of Control Table
The following table presents the approximate value of (1) the severance benefits for the named executive officers under the Executive Severance Plan had a Qualified Termination of Employment under that plan occurred on December 31, 2018; (2) the severance benefits for the named executive officers under the Severance Pay Plan if an involuntary termination had occurred on December 31, 2018; (3) the benefits that would have been payable on the death of the named executive officers on December 31, 2018; (4) the benefits that would have been payable on the total and permanent disability of the named executive officers on December 31, 2018; and (5) the potential payments to Mr. Wesley if he had retired on December 31, 2018. If applicable, amounts in the table were calculated using the closing price of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2018 of $44.79 per share.
Because none of the Company's named executive officers, other than Mr. Wesley, were eligible to retire as of December 31, 2018, potential payments assuming retirement on that date are not included for the other named executive officers. The value of benefits that already were vested as of December 31, 2018, such as vested but unexercised stock options and the balances of the executive officers' accounts under the Company's 401(k) Plan and Supplemental 401(k) Plan, are not included in the table.
The amounts presented in the following table are in addition to amounts each named executive officer earned or accrued prior to termination, such as previously vested benefits under Company's qualified and non-qualified plans, previously vested options, restricted stock and restricted share units and accrued salary and vacation. For information about these previously earned and accrued amounts, see the "Summary Compensation Table," "Outstanding Equity Awards," "Option Exercises and Stock Vested," and "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation."
48      2019 Proxy Statement
The cost of continued coverage under the Company's group life insurance plans has been excluded from the table because the benefit is available to all U.S. salaried employees and does not discriminate in scope or terms or operation in favor of our named executive officers. Figures also do not include benefits payable under the Company's Long-Term Disability Plan (which is available to all U.S. salaried employees), the value of which would be dependent on the life span of the Company's named executive officer and the value of any Company or government-provided income benefits received.

RATIO OF CEO COMPENSATION TO MEDIAN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
The 2018 compensation disclosure ratio of the median annual total compensation of all Company employees worldwide to the annual total compensation of the Company's CEO is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Median                                           annual total compensation of all employees worldwide (excluding          Mr. Woody) (B) 5,820 
Median                                           annual total compensation of all employees worldwide (excluding          Mr. Woody) (B) 5,820 
[END TABLE]
The Company identified the median employee by examining the following compensation elements for all individuals, excluding Mr. Woody: current base salary, 2017 bonus paid in 2018, grant date value of 2018 long-term grants, trailing 12 months of commissions, and overtime. The Company determined the median employee based on its workforce as of December 31, 2018, and included all full-time and part-time employees. After identifying the median employee, the Company calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology used for named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. The Company's compensation disclosure ratio may not be comparable to those disclosed by other companies based on a number of factors, including differences in employee populations, different geographic distributions of employees, and the nature of the companies' businesses.

PROPOSAL 4.
APPROVAL OF EMPLOYEE STOCK PARTICIPATION PLAN
We are seeking your vote to approve our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the "ESPP." The ESPP was approved and adopted by our Board of Directors on February 21, 2019, subject to approval by the stockholders at the Annual Meeting, and will become effective upon receiving stockholder approval at that Meeting.
The purpose of the ESPP is to provide eligible employees of the Company and certain of its affiliates and subsidiaries an opportunity to use payroll deductions to purchase shares of our common stock and thereby acquire an ownership interest in the Company. The ESPP consists of two components: a 423 component, which is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" within the meaning of Section 423 of the Code ("Section 423") (the "423 Component"), and a non-423 component (the "Non-423 Component"), which is not intended to qualify under Section 423.
The maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be purchased under the ESPP will be 1,000,000 shares, subject to adjustment as provided for in the ESPP. The share pool for the ESPP represents approximately 2% of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of February 21, 2019.
SUMMARY OF MATERIAL TERMS OF THE ESPP
A summary of the material terms of the ESPP is set forth below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the ESPP, which is filed with this Proxy Statement as Appendix B.
Authorized Shares
Subject to adjustment as provided in the ESPP, a total of 1,000,000 shares of our Common Stock will be made available for sale under the ESPP. In the event of a stock dividend, stock split or combination of shares, recapitalization or other change in the Company's capitalization, or other distribution with respect to our stockholders other than normal cash dividends, an automatic adjustment will be made in the number and kind of shares as to which outstanding options then unexercised will be exercisable, in the available shares reserved for sale under the ESPP, and in the purchase period limit, in order to maintain the proportionate interest of the participants before and after the event.
As of February 14, 2019, the closing price of our common stock on New York Stock Exchange was $47.31 per share.
Plan Administration
Our Compensation Committee will administer the ESPP, and will have full and exclusive authority to interpret the terms of the ESPP and determine eligibility to participate, subject to the conditions of the ESPP. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee are also authorized to adopt rules, procedures and subplans with respect to the Non-423 Component of the ESPP and for the operation of the ESPP in jurisdictions outside of the United States.
Eligibility
Generally, employees of the Company and any of its designated subsidiaries and affiliates are eligible to participate in the ESPP, subject to the procedural enrollment and other requirements in the ESPP. However, our Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, determine prior to the beginning of an offering period that employees will not be eligible to participate if they: (i) have not completed at least two years of service since their last hire date (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by our Compensation Committee in its discretion), (ii) customarily work not more than 20 hours per week (or such
2019 Proxy Statement      51
lesser period of time as may be determined by our Compensation Committee in its discretion), (iii) customarily work not more than five months per calendar year (or such lesser period of time as may be determined by our Compensation Committee in its discretion), or (iv) are highly compensated employee within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Code.
No employee may be granted options to purchase shares of our Common Stock under the 423 Component of the ESPP if such employee (i) immediately after the grant would own capital stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock, or (ii) holds rights to purchase shares of our common stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans (as defined in Section 423) that accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of shares of our common stock for each calendar year. Employees who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be excluded from participation in the ESPP or a specific offering if such participation is prohibited under applicable local law or would violate Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
For purposes of the ESPP, designated subsidiaries include any subsidiary (within the meaning of Section 424(f) of the Code) of the Company that has been designated by our Compensation Committee as eligible to participate in the 423 Component of the ESPP and designated affiliates include any of our affiliates that have been designated by our Compensation Committee as eligible to participate in the Non-423 Component of the ESPP.
As of February 14, 2019, no more than approximately 1,135 U.S. employees, and no more than approximately 3,679 non-U.S. employees, would be eligible to participate in the ESPP.
Offering Periods
Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, on the first trading day of an offering period, each eligible employee will be granted an option to purchase shares of our Common Stock on the last day of such offering period. Our Compensation Committee will determine the length of each offering period, provided that no offering period may exceed 27 months in length.
Contributions
The ESPP permits each participant to purchase shares of our common stock through payroll deductions of up to 25% of their eligible compensation; provided, however, that a participant may not purchase more than a specific maximum number of shares, which limit will be determined by our Compensation Committee prior to the commencement of the offering period. No interest will accrue on a participant's contributions to the ESPP, unless required by law in certain jurisdictions. A participant may withdraw during the offering period and may decrease (but not increase) their contributions.
Purchases
Unless a participant terminates employment or withdraws from the ESPP or an offering period before the last trading day of an offering period, the participant's option will automatically be exercised on the last trading day of each offering period. The number of shares of our Common Stock purchased will be determined by dividing the payroll contributions accumulated in the participant's account by the applicable purchase price, subject to the maximum share limit discussed above. No fractional shares of our Common Stock will be purchased. Any contributions accumulated in a participant's account which are not sufficient to purchase a full share of our Common Stock will be rolled over to the next offering period, without interest, or will be refunded to them, without interest.
Our Compensation Committee, will determine the purchase price of the shares, which will not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the last trading day of each offering period (which we refer to as the "purchase date").
Withdrawals; Termination of Employment
A participant may end their participation at any time during an offering period and all, but not less than all, of their accrued contributions not yet used to purchase shares of our common stock will be returned to them, or will be rolled over to the next offering period, without interest. If a participant withdraws from an offering period, they must re-enroll in the ESPP in order to re-commence participation.
52      2019 Proxy Statement
If a participant ceases to be an eligible employee for any reason, they will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the ESPP and their contributions not yet used to purchase shares of our common stock will be returned to them.
Non-Transferability
A participant may not assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of in any way (other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution) their rights with regard to options granted under the ESPP or contributions credited to their account.
Corporate Transactions
The ESPP provides that in the event of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company with one or more corporations in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a direct or indirect subsidiary of such other constituent corporation or its parent), or upon a sale of substantially all of the property or stock of the Company to another corporation, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding option. If the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the outstanding option, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new purchase date will be set. The Company will notify each participant that the purchase date has been changed and that the participant's option will be exercised automatically on the new purchase date unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the offering period.
Amendment; Termination
Subject to applicable law, our Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may amend, suspend, or terminate the ESPP at any time and for any reason, without stockholder approval.
Our Compensation Committee may change the offering periods, designate separate offerings, limit the frequency and/or number of changes in the amount withheld during an offering period, establish the exchange rate applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit contributions in excess of the amount designated by a participant in order to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed contribution elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of our common stock for each participant properly correspond with contribution amounts, and establish such other limitations or procedures as our Compensation Committee determines in its sole discretion advisable that are consistent with the ESPP. Such modifications will not require stockholder approval or the consent of any ESPP participants.
The ESPP automatically will terminate on December 31, 2029, unless we terminate it sooner.
Sub-Plans
Consistent with the requirements of Section 423, our Compensation Committee may amend the terms of the ESPP, or an offering, or provide for separate offerings under the ESPP to, among other things, reflect the impact of local law outside of the United States as applied to one or more eligible employees of a designated subsidiary and may, where appropriate, establish one or more sub-plans to reflect such amended provisions.
CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS
The following summary briefly describes U.S. federal income tax consequences of options granted under the ESPP, but is not a detailed or complete description of all U.S. federal tax laws or regulations that may apply, and does not address any local, state or other country laws. Therefore, no one should rely on this summary for individual tax compliance, planning or decisions. Participants in the ESPP should consult their own professional tax advisors concerning tax aspects of options granted under the ESPP. The discussion below concerning tax deductions that may become available to the Company under U.S. federal tax law is not intended to imply that the Company will necessarily obtain a tax benefit from those deductions. Taxation of equity-based payments in other countries is complex, does not generally correspond to U.S. federal tax laws, and is not covered by the summary below.
2019 Proxy Statement      53
The 423 Component of the ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" meeting the requirements of Section 423. Under these provisions, a participant will not recognize taxable income until they sell or otherwise dispose of the shares purchased under the ESPP. If a participant disposes of the shares acquired under the ESPP more than two years from the option grant date and more than one year from the date the stock is purchased, then the participant must treat as ordinary income the amount by which the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the shares at the time of disposition, or (ii) the fair market value of the shares at the option grant date, exceeds the purchase price. Any gain in addition to this amount will be treated as a capital gain. If a participant holds shares at the time of their death, the holding period requirements are automatically deemed to have been satisfied and they will realize ordinary income in the amount by which the lesser of (i) the fair market value of the shares at the time of death, or (ii) the fair market value of the shares at the option grant date exceeds the purchase price. The Company will not be allowed a deduction if the holding period requirements are satisfied.
If a participant disposes of shares before expiration of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, then the participant must treat as ordinary income the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the purchase date over the purchase price. Any additional gain will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be. The Company will be allowed a deduction equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant.
The Non-423 Component of the ESPP does not qualify under the provisions of Section 423. Under the applicable Code provisions, a participant will recognize ordinary income at the time the shares are purchased measured as the excess of the fair market value of the shares purchased over the purchase price and the Company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction. Any additional gain or loss on the subsequent sale or disposition will be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on the capital gain holding period.
NEW PLAN BENEFITS
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, no employee has been granted any options under the proposed ESPP. Accordingly, the benefits to be received pursuant to the ESPP by the Company's officers and employees are not determinable at this time.

OTHER INFORMATION
SECURITY OWNERSHIP INFORMATION
The following table shows the number of shares of our common stock beneficially owned as of March 4, 2019, by each director and nominee, by each named executive officer, and by all directors, nominees and executive officers as a group.
2019 Proxy Statement      55
Our Corporate Governance Policies provide that, within five years of joining the Board, all Outside Directors should own an amount of our common stock or restricted share units at least equal in value to five times the annual Board cash compensation. For the purpose of these stock ownership guidelines, a director is deemed to own beneficially-owned shares as well as restricted share units (whether or not any applicable restrictions have lapsed).
The following table sets forth the information, as of December 31, 2018, regarding persons or groups known to us to be beneficial owners of more than five percent of our common stock.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, named executive officers, chief accounting officer, and any person beneficially owning more than 10 percent of our common stock to file reports with the SEC regarding their ownership of our stock and any changes in ownership. We maintain a compliance program to assist our directors, named executive officers and chief accounting officer in making these filings. Based solely on a review of the Section 16 forms filed with the SEC during 2018, and certifications from our named executive officers, directors, and chief accounting officer that no other reports were required for them, we believe that our named executive officers, directors, and chief accounting officer and persons who beneficially own more than 10 percent of our common stock timely complied with their filing requirements for 2018.
56      2019 Proxy Statement
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions. The Board has adopted written procedures for reviewing any transactions between the Company and certain "related persons" that involve amounts above certain thresholds. The SEC requires that our proxy statement disclose these "related person transactions." A related person is defined under the SEC's rules and includes our directors, named executive officers and five percent stockholders.
The Board's procedures provide that:
Each director, director nominee and named executive officer is required to promptly provide written notification of any material interest that he or she (or an immediate family member) has or will have in a transaction with the Company. Based on a review of the transaction, a determination will be made as to whether the transaction constitutes a related person transaction under the SEC's rules. As appropriate, the Governance Committee or the Audit Committee will then review the terms and substance of the transaction to determine whether to ratify or approve the related person transaction.
In determining whether the transaction is consistent with the Company's best interest, the Governance Committee or the Audit Committee may consider any factors deemed relevant or appropriate, including:
2018 Related Person Transactions. Based on SEC rules, the Board's procedures, and the factors listed above, there were no related party transactions in 2018.
STOCKHOLDERS SHARING THE SAME HOUSEHOLD
As permitted by SEC rules, multiple stockholders sharing the same address who hold their stock through a bank, broker, or other holder of record may receive a single copy of our annual report to stockholders and this proxy statement. Upon written or oral request, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the annual report to stockholders and this proxy statement to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of each document was delivered.

RECONCILICATIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Adjusted net sales, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") are financial measures that have not been calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, and are therefore referred to as non-GAAP financial measures.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
1. Purpose. The purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company and its Designated Subsidiaries and Designated Affiliates with an opportunity to purchase shares of Common Stock through accumulated Contributions. This Plan includes two components: a Code Section 423 Component (the "423 Component") and a non-Code Section 423 Component (the "Non-423 Component"). It is the intention of the Company to have the 423 Component qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code. The provisions of the 423 Component, accordingly, shall be construed so as to extend and limit participation in a uniform and nondiscriminatory basis consistent with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of options under the Non-423 Component that does not qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code; such options shall be granted pursuant to rules, procedures or subplans adopted by the Committee designed to achieve tax, securities laws or other objectives for Eligible Employees and the Company. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Non-423 Component will be operated and administered in the same manner as the 423 Component.

(a) Offering Periods. Any Eligible Employee on a given Offering Date will be eligible to participate in the Plan, subject to the requirements of Section 5, provided, however, that employees who are citizens or residents of a non-U.S. jurisdiction may be excluded from participation in the Plan or an Offering if the participation of such Employees is prohibited under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or if complying with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction would cause the Plan or an Offering to violate Section 423 of the Code.
(b) Limitations. Any provisions of the Plan to the contrary notwithstanding, no Eligible Employee will be granted an option under the 423 Component of the Plan (i) to the extent that, immediately after the grant, such Eligible Employee (or any other person whose stock would be attributed to such Eligible Employee pursuant to Section 424(d) of the Code) would own capital stock of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company and/or hold outstanding options to purchase such stock possessing five percent (5%) or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of the capital stock of the Company or of any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, or (ii) to the extent that his or her rights to purchase stock under all employee stock purchase plans (as defined in Section 423 of the Code) of the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company accrues at a rate which exceeds twenty-five thousand U.S. dollars (USD 25,000) worth of stock (determined at the Fair Market Value of the stock at the time such option is granted) for each calendar year in which such option is outstanding at any time, as determined in accordance with Section 423 of the Code and the regulations thereunder.
4. Offering Periods. Within the limitations set forth in Section 2(x), the Administrator will have the power to change the duration of Offering Periods (including the commencement dates thereof) without stockholder approval. Any such change shall be announced prior to the scheduled beginning of the first Offering Period to be affected thereafter.
5. Participation. An Eligible Employee may become a participant in the Plan by following an electronic or other enrollment procedure as may be established by the Administrator from time to time.
6. Contributions.
(a) At the time a Participant enrolls in the Plan pursuant to Section 5, he or she will elect to have Contributions made on each pay day during the Offering Period in an amount not exceeding twenty-five percent (25%) of the Compensation which he or she receives on each pay day during the Offering Period. The Administrator may permit Eligible Employees participating in a specified Offering to contribute amounts to the Plan through payment by cash, check or other means to comply with non-U.S. requirements, provided, that such contributions shall not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the Compensation received each pay period, during the Offering Period. A Participant's subscription agreement will remain in effect for successive Offering Periods unless terminated as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(b) Payroll deductions or contributions, as applicable, for a Participant will commence on the first pay day following the Offering Date and will end on the last pay day prior to the Exercise Date of such Offering Period to which such authorization is applicable, unless sooner terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(c) All Contributions made for a Participant will be credited to his or her account under the Plan and Contributions will be made in whole percentages only.
(d) Subject to Applicable Laws, a Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 10 by completing any forms and following any procedures (including specified deadlines) established by the Administrator or its designee. The change will become effective as soon as administratively practicable after receipt.
(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and Section 3(b), a Participant's Contributions may be decreased to zero percent (0%) at any time during an Offering Period. Subject to Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, Contributions will recommence at the rate originally elected by the Participant
2019 Proxy Statement      67
effective as of the beginning of the first Offering Period scheduled to end in the following calendar year, unless terminated by the Participant as provided in Section 10.
(f) At the time the option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time some or all of the Common Stock issued under the Plan is disposed of (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the Participant must make adequate provision for the Company's or its Subsidiary's or Affiliate's federal, state, local or any other tax liability payable to any authority, national insurance, social security, payment-on-account or other tax obligations, if any, which arise upon the exercise of the option or the disposition of the Common Stock (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any liability of the Participant to pay an employer tax or social insurance contribution obligation, which liability has been shifted to the Participant as a matter of law or contract. At any time, the Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable, may, but will not be obligated to, withhold from the Participant's compensation the amount necessary for the Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable, to meet applicable withholding obligations, including any withholding required to make available to the Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable, any tax deductions or benefits attributable to sale or early disposition of Common Stock by the Eligible Employee. In addition, the Company or its Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable, may (i) withhold from the proceeds of the sale of Common Stock, (ii) withhold a sufficient whole number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable following purchase having an aggregate fair market value sufficient to pay applicable withholding obligations, or (iii) may withhold by any other means set forth in the applicable subscription agreement.
7. Grant of Option. On the Offering Date of each Offering Period, each Eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period will be granted an option to purchase on each Exercise Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price) up to a number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Eligible Employee's Contributions accumulated during such Offering Period prior to such Exercise Date and retained in the Eligible Employee's account as of the Exercise Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided that in no event will an Eligible Employee be permitted to purchase during each Offering Period more than the Maximum Share Amount, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 19(a), and provided further that such purchase will be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 13. The Eligible Employee may accept the grant of such option by electing to participate in the Plan in accordance with the requirements of Section 5. The Administrator may, for future Offering Periods, increase or decrease, in its absolute discretion, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that an Eligible Employee may purchase during each Offering Period. Exercise of the option will occur as provided in Section 8, unless the Participant has withdrawn pursuant to Section 10. The option will expire on the last day of the Offering Period.
8. Exercise of Option.
(a) Unless a Participant withdraws from the Plan as provided in Section 10, his or her option for the purchase of shares of Common Stock will be exercised automatically on the Exercise Date, and the maximum number of full shares subject to the option will be purchased for such Participant at the applicable Purchase Price with the accumulated Contributions from his or her account; provided that in no event will an Eligible Employee be permitted to purchase during each Offering Period more than the Maximum Share Amount, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 19(a), and provided further that such purchase will be subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 3(b) and 13. No fractional shares of Common Stock will be purchased. Any Contributions accumulated in a Participant's account which are not sufficient to purchase a full share will, at the discretion of the Administrator, be refunded to the Participant, without interest, or be retained in the Participant's account for the subsequent Offering Period. During a Participant's lifetime, a Participant's option to purchase shares hereunder is exercisable only by him or her.
(b) In the event that the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased by all Participants in any Offering Period exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock then available for issuance under the Plan, (i) the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the remaining shares of Common Stock in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as the Committee shall, in its sole discretion, determine to be equitable and (ii) all funds not used to purchase shares of Common Stock on the Exercise Date shall be returned, without interest to the Participants.
9. Delivery. By enrolling in the Plan, each Participant shall be deemed to have authorized the establishment of a brokerage account on his or her behalf at a securities brokerage firm selected by the Company. As soon as reasonably
68      2019 Proxy Statement practicable after each Exercise Date on which a purchase of shares of Common Stock occurs, the Company shall arrange for the delivery to each Participant of the shares of Common Stock purchased upon exercise of his or her option to the Participant's brokerage or Plan share account in a form determined by the Company. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation, the Company shall not deliver to any Participant certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock issued in connection with any purchase under the Plan, and instead such shares of Common Stock shall be recorded in the books of the brokerage firm or, as applicable, the Company, its transfer agent, stock plan administrator or such other outside entity which is not a brokerage firm.
10. Withdrawal.
(a) A Participant may withdraw all but not less than all the Contributions credited to his or her account and not yet used to exercise his or her option under the Plan at any time by following an electronic or other withdrawal procedure determined by the Administrator from time to time. All of the Participant's Contributions credited to his or her account will, at the discretion of the Administrator, (i) be retained in Participant's account and used to purchase shares of Common Stock at the next Exercise Date, or (ii) be paid to such Participant as soon as reasonably practicable after receipt of notice of withdrawal and such Participant's options for the Offering Period shall be terminated automatically, and no further payroll deductions or contributions for the purchase of shares of Common Stock shall be made for such Offering Period. If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, Contributions will not resume at the beginning of the succeeding Offering Period, unless the Participant re-enrolls in the Plan as prescribed by the Administrator from time to time.
(b) A Participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period will not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or in succeeding Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant withdraws.
11. Termination of Employment. Unless otherwise determined by the Administrator, upon a Participant's ceasing to be an Eligible Employee for any reason, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan and the Contributions credited to such Participant's account during the Offering Period but not yet used to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Plan will be returned to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 15, and such Participant's option will be automatically terminated. Unless determined otherwise by the Administrator in a manner that is permitted by, and compliant with, Section 423 of the Code, a Participant whose employment transfers between entities through a termination with an immediate rehire (with no break in service) by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary or Designated Affiliate shall not be treated as terminated under the Plan.
12. Interest. No interest will accrue on the Contributions of a Participant in the Plan, except as may be required by applicable law, as determined by the Administrator.
13. Stock. Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 19 hereof, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that will be made available for sale under the Plan will be 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The limitation set forth in this section may be used to satisfy purchases of shares of Common Stock under either the 423 Component or the Non-423 Component of the Plan.
14. Administration.
(a) Unless otherwise designated by the Board, the Committee shall serve as the Administrator. The Administrator will have full and exclusive discretionary authority to construe, interpret and apply the terms of the Plan, to designate separate Offerings under the Plan, to designate Subsidiaries or Affiliates as participating in the Plan, to determine eligibility and adjudicate all disputed claims filed under the Plan, including whether Eligible Employees shall participate in the 423 Component or the Non-423 Component and which entities shall be Designated Subsidiaries or Designated Affiliates, and to establish such procedures that it deems necessary for the administration of the Plan. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Plan, the Administrator may adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures for jurisdictions outside of the United States. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is specifically authorized to adopt rules, procedures and subplans,
2019 Proxy Statement      69
which, for purposes of the Non-423 Component, may be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code, regarding, without limitation, eligibility to participate, the definition of Compensation, handling of Contributions, making of Contributions to the Plan (including, without limitation, in forms other than payroll deductions), establishment of bank or trust accounts to hold Contributions, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, obligations to pay payroll tax, determination of beneficiary designation requirements, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates that vary with applicable local requirements.
(b) Every finding, decision and determination made by the Administrator will, to the full extent permitted by law, be final and binding upon all parties, including the Company, Designated Subsidiary, Designated Affiliate, Participant, Eligible Employee, or any beneficiary of such person, as applicable.
(c) To the extent allowable pursuant to applicable law, each member of the Board, the Committee, the Administrator or any employee of the Company, a Designated Subsidiary, or a Designated Affiliate (each such person, a "Covered Person") shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by such Covered Person in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action or failure to act pursuant to the Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in satisfaction of judgment in such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her; provided, however, that he or she has acted in accordance with his or her duties and responsibilities to the Company under applicable law, and provided that he or she gives the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she is a party before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his or her own behalf. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such Covered Persons may be entitled pursuant to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.
(d) To the extent not prohibited by Applicable Law, the Committee may, from time to time, delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee or subcommittees of the Committee, the Administrator or other persons or groups of persons as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable under conditions or limitations that it may set at or after the time of the delegation. For purposes of the Plan, reference to the Committee will be deemed to refer to any subcommittee, subcommittees, or other persons or groups of persons to whom the Committee delegates authority pursuant to this Section 14(d).
15. Designation of Beneficiary.
(a) If permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any shares of Common Stock and cash, if any, from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death subsequent to an Exercise Date on which the option is exercised but prior to delivery to such Participant of such shares and cash. In addition, if permitted by the Administrator, a Participant may file a designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death prior to exercise of the option. If a Participant is married and the designated beneficiary is not the spouse, spousal consent will be required for such designation to be effective.
(b) Such designation of beneficiary, if permitted, may be changed by the Participant at any time by notice in a form determined by the Administrator. In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant's death, the Company will deliver such shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
(c) All beneficiary designations will be in such form and manner as the Administrator may designate from time to time.
70      2019 Proxy Statement
16. Transferability. Neither Contributions credited to a Participant's account nor any rights with regard to the exercise of an option or to receive shares of Common Stock under the Plan may be assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as provided in Section 15 hereof) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw funds from an Offering Period in accordance with Section 10 hereof.
17. Use of Funds. The Company may use all Contributions received or held by it under the Plan for any corporate purpose, and the Company will not be obligated to segregate such Contributions, except as may be required by applicable local law, as determined by the Administrator. Until shares of Common Stock are issued, Participants will only have the rights of an unsecured creditor with respect to the Plan, although Participants in specified Offerings may have additional rights where required under local law, as determined by the Administrator.
18. Reports. Individual accounts will be maintained for each Participant in the Plan. Statements of account will be given to participating Eligible Employees at least annually, which statements will set forth the amounts of Contributions, the Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
19. Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Corporate Transactions.
(a) Adjustments. Subject to any required action by the stockholders of the Company, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that shall be made available for sale under the Plan, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that each Participant may purchase during the Offering Period pursuant to the Maximum Share Amount or over a calendar year under the USD 25,000 limitation (pursuant to Section 3(b)) and the per share price used to determine the Purchase Price shall be proportionately adjusted for any increase or decrease in the number of issued shares of Common Stock resulting from any nonreciprocal transaction between the Company and its stockholders, (such as a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering or recapitalization through a large, nonrecurring cash dividend), that affects the Common Stock (or other securities of the Company) or the price of shares of Common Stock (or other securities) and causes a change in the per share value of the Common Stock underlying outstanding options. Such adjustment shall be made by the Administrator, whose determination in that respect shall be final, binding and conclusive. Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares of Common Stock subject to an option.
(b) Dissolution or Liquidation. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any Offering Period then in progress will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date, and will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed dissolution or liquidation, unless provided otherwise by the Administrator. The New Exercise Date will be before the date of the Company's proposed dissolution or liquidation. The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically, prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participant's option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.
(c) Certain Corporate Transactions. In the event of a reorganization, merger, or consolidation of the Company with one or more corporations in which the Company is not the surviving corporation (or survives as a direct or indirect subsidiary of such other constituent corporation or its parent), or upon a sale of substantially all of the property or stock of the Company to another corporation, each outstanding option will be assumed or an equivalent option substituted by the successor corporation or a Parent or Subsidiary of the successor corporation. In the event that the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the option, the Offering Period with respect to which such option relates will be shortened by setting a New Exercise Date on which such Offering Period shall end. The New Exercise Date will occur before the date of the Company's proposed merger or Change in Control. The Administrator will notify each Participant in writing or electronically prior to the New Exercise Date, that the Exercise Date for the Participant's option has been changed to the New Exercise Date and that the Participant's option will be exercised automatically on the New Exercise Date, unless prior to such date the Participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Section 10 hereof.
2019 Proxy Statement      71
20. Amendment or Termination.
(a) Subject to any applicable law or government regulation and to the rules of any Exchange or quotation system on which the shares of Common Stock may be listed or quoted, the Plan may be amended, modified, suspended or terminated by the Board without the approval of the stockholders of the Company. Except as provided in Section 19, no amendment may make any change in any option previously granted which adversely affects the rights of any Participant or any beneficiary (as applicable) without the consent of the affected Participant or beneficiary. To the extent necessary to comply with Section 423 of the Code (or any successor rule or provision or any other applicable law, regulation or Exchange rule), the Company shall obtain stockholder approval of any amendment in such a manner and to such a degree as required.
(b) Without stockholder approval and without regard to whether any Participant rights may be considered to have been "adversely affected," the Administrator or its delegate, to the extent permitted under the terms of the Plan, applicable law, the Bylaws of the Company and under the Committee charter, may change the Offering Periods, limit the frequency or number of changes in the amount withheld during an Offering Period, establish the exchange rate applicable to amounts withheld in a currency other than U.S. dollars, permit payroll withholding in excess of the amount designated by a Participant to adjust for delays or mistakes in the Company's processing of properly completed Contribution elections, establish reasonable waiting and adjustment periods and/or accounting and crediting procedures to ensure that amounts applied toward the purchase of shares of Common Stock for each Participant properly correspond with amounts withheld from the Participant's Compensation, and establish such other limitations or procedures as the Committee deems appropriate.
21. Notices. All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan will be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form and manner specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
22. Conditions Upon Issuance of Shares. Shares of Common Stock will not be issued with respect to an option unless the exercise of such option and the issuance and delivery of such shares pursuant thereto will comply with all applicable provisions of U.S. and non-U.S. law, including, without limitation, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the requirements of any Exchange, and will be further subject to the approval of counsel for the Company with respect to such compliance. As a condition to the exercise of an option, the Company may require the person exercising such option to represent and warrant at the time of any such exercise that the shares are being purchased only for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such shares if, in the opinion of counsel for the Company, such a representation is required by any of the aforementioned applicable provisions of law.
23. Notification of Sale of Shares of Common Stock. Each Participant shall give the Administrator prompt notice of any disposition of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the option granted under the Plan in accordance with such procedures as may be established by the Administrator. The Administrator may require that until such time as a Participant disposes of shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the option granted under the Plan, the Participant shall hold all such shares of Common Stock in the Participant's name and with a third-party broker/administrator designated by the Company until the lapse of any time period(s) established by the Administrator.
24. Clawback/Recoupment Policy. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all shares of Common Stock acquired pursuant to the Plan shall be and remain subject to any incentive compensation clawback or recoupment policy currently in effect or as may be adopted by the Board and, in each case, as may be amended from time to time. No such policy adoption or amendment shall in any event require the prior consent of any Participant.
25. Code Section 409A; Tax Qualification.
(a) Options granted under the 423 Component are exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code. Options granted under the Non-423 Component to U.S. taxpayers are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A under the short-term deferral exception and any ambiguities shall be construed and interpreted in accordance with such intent. Subject to Section 23(b), options granted to U.S. taxpayers under the Non-423 Component are subject to such terms and conditions that will permit such options to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral exception available under Section 409A of the Code, including the requirement that the shares of Common Stock subject to an option
72      2019 Proxy Statement be delivered within the short-term deferral period. Subject to Section 23(b), in the case of a Participant who would otherwise be subject to Section 409A of the Code, to the extent the Company determines that an option or the exercise, payment, settlement or deferral is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the option shall be granted, exercised, paid, settled or deferred in a manner that will comply with Section 409A of the Code, including Department of Treasury regulations and other interpretive guidance issued thereunder, including without limitation any such regulations or other guidance that may be issued after the Effective Date. Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall have no liability to a Participant or any other party if the option that is intended to be exempt from, or compliant with Section 409A of the Code is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Company with respect thereto.
(b) Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify an option for favorable tax treatment under the laws of the U.S. or jurisdictions outside of the U.S. or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Section 409A of the Code), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, including Section 26(a). The Company is not constrained in its corporate activities by any potential negative tax impact on Participants under the Plan.
26. Term of Plan. The Plan will be effective as of the Effective Date and will continue in effect through the tenth (10th) anniversary thereof, unless sooner terminated under Section 20.
27. Stockholder Approval. The Plan will be subject to approval by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. Such stockholder approval will be obtained in the manner and to the degree required under Applicable Laws.
28. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. The Plan shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the U.S. State of Delaware (except its choice-of-law provisions). The jurisdiction and venue for any disputes arising under, or any action brought to enforce (or otherwise relating to) this Plan shall be exclusively in the courts in the U.S. State of Delaware, including the U.S. federal courts located therein (should federal jurisdiction exist).
29. No Right to Employment. Participation in the Plan by a Participant shall not be construed as giving a Participant the right to be retained as an employee of the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate, as applicable. Furthermore, the Company, a Subsidiary or an Affiliate may dismiss a Participant from employment at any time, free from any liability or any claim under the Plan.
30. Severability. If any provision of the Plan is or becomes or is deemed to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason in any jurisdiction or as to any Participant, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining parts of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as to such jurisdiction or Participant as if the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been included.
31. Compliance with Applicable Laws. The terms of this Plan are intended to comply with all Applicable Laws and will be construed accordingly.
