CONSENT SOLICITATION STATEMENT 
This Consent Solicitation Statement is being furnished to Limited Partners of AIMCO Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership"), who hold Partnership Common Units ("OP Units"), or any of the other following classes of Partnership Units which vote together with the OP Units (collectively with the OP Units, the "Voting Units"):

[END TABLE]
This consent solicitation (the "Consent Solicitation") is made by AIMCO-GP, Inc., the general partner of the Partnership (the "General Partner"). This Consent Solicitation Statement is first being mailed to holders of Voting Units on or about March 21, 2019. 
What is the purpose of this Consent Solicitation? 
The General Partner is asking Limited Partners who hold Voting Units to consent to certain amendments (the "Amendments") to the Partnership's Fourth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (as amended to date, the "Partnership Agreement"). There are two sets of proposed Amendments. "Proposal One" would provide flexibility for Apartment Investment and Management Company ("Aimco") to acquire and hold properties outside of the Partnership. "Proposal Two" would ensure that the Partnership's tax audit procedures are consistent with recent changes to IRS rules. Proposal One and Proposal Two (together, the "Proposals") are described in more detail below. If any of the Amendments are approved by the Limited Partners, the General Partner will amend and restate the Partnership Agreement (the "Restated Partnership Agreement") to reflect those Amendments. Attached as Exhibit A is a proposed Fifth Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of AIMCO Properties, L.P. (excluding exhibits) that reflects both sets of Amendments, and is marked to show changes. This Consent Solicitation Statement includes information that the General Partner is required to provide you under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
Who is entitled to consent? 
You will be entitled to vote on the Proposals if you held Voting Units as of the close of business on March 15, 2019 (the "Record Date"). As of the Record Date, 12,800,911 Voting Units were issued, outstanding and entitled to vote on the Proposals. Each holder of a Voting Unit is entitled to one vote per unit. The General Partner expects that some of its employees may solicit Limited Partners personally and by telephone. None of these employees will receive any additional or special compensation for doing this.  What consent is required? 
Approval of each of the Proposals requires the affirmative consent (the "Required Consent") of Limited Partners holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Voting Units held by all Limited Partners other than any partner owned by Aimco (collectively, the "Voting Limited Partners"). 
If approved, when will the Amendments be effective? 
The Restated Partnership Agreement will be executed by the General Partner and effective promptly after the receipt of the Required Consent, which may occur prior to the Expiration Date (defined below) if the Required Consent is received before then. The General Partner will disclose the results of this Consent Solicitation promptly after the Expiration Date, or receipt of the Required Consent if the Required Consent is received before then. If approved, all Limited Partners will be bound by the Restated Partnership Agreement, whether or not they consent to the Proposals. 
Who pays for the cost of the Consent Solicitation? 
The Partnership will bear the costs of preparing and mailing the Consent Solicitation Statement. 
When is the deadline to deliver my consent? 
The Consent Solicitation will expire at, and your consent must be received by, April 5, 2019 (the "Expiration Date"). You may revoke your consent at any time prior to the Partnership's receipt of the Required Consent. 
How do I consent? 
Limited Partners must sign and return the consent form accompanying this Consent Solicitation Statement in the postage-paid envelope provided, or by fax to the number provided in the consent form, in order to vote on the Proposals. Because the affirmative consent of Limited Partners holding more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Voting Units held by all Voting Limited Partners is required to approve each of the Proposals, returning a consent form marked "Abstains" for a Proposal will equate to a vote against that Proposal. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, failure to sign and return a consent form by the Expiration Date will constitute a consent in favor of both Proposals. 
A consent form that is signed but not marked "Consents," "Withholds Consent" or "Abstains" with respect to a Proposal will be treated as a consent in favor of that Proposal. Limited Partners may revoke their consents at any time prior to the Expiration Date by dating, signing and delivering to the Partnership a written notice that clearly expresses the revocation of consent, or by delivering a properly executed, subsequently dated consent form withholding a previously granted consent. However, any revocation received after the Partnership's receipt of the Required Consent will not be effective. 
Do I have any appraisal rights? 
Neither Delaware law nor the Partnership Agreement requires that the Limited Partners be entitled to appraisal rights in connection with the Proposals, and no such appraisal rights will be afforded to Limited Partners who withhold consent to either of the Proposals. 
Whom do I contact if I have questions? 
Please direct all questions to AIMCO Properties, L.P., c/o Alliance Advisors, 200 Broadacre Drive, 3rd Floor, Bloomfield, NJ 07003, or call toll free (844) 876-6185.  PROPOSAL ONE 
Background 
Aimco is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ("REIT"), focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment and limited development of quality apartment communities located in some of the largest markets in the United States. The General Partner is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Aimco, and has exclusive control of the Partnership's operations. Through the General Partner and another wholly-owned subsidiary, AIMCO-LP Trust (the "Special Limited Partner"), as of December 31, 2018, Aimco owned 94.3% of the outstanding OP Units. 
Aimco is currently organized as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, with the Partnership as Aimco's operating partnership. Accordingly, Aimco currently conducts all of its business and owns all of its assets only through the Partnership. Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, Aimco is required to contribute to the Partnership any assets that it may acquire, including all proceeds from offerings of its securities. In exchange for the contribution of these assets, Aimco receives additional interests in the Partnership. This structure is intended to ensure that each OP Unit has a value equivalent to that of one share of Aimco's Class A Common Stock ("Aimco common stock"). 
This equivalence in value is recognized in certain provisions of the Partnership Agreement. Under the agreement, after a one year holding period, holders of OP Units have the right (the "Redemption Right") to tender their units for redemption and receive, in exchange for each unit, either (i) one share of Aimco common stock, or (ii) cash in an amount equal to the value of one share of Aimco common stock at the time, with the form of consideration at the election of the Partnership. Also, the Partnership makes quarterly distributions to holders of OP Units in an amount per unit equal to the per share dividend paid at that time to holders of Aimco common stock (an "Aimco dividend equivalent distribution"). 
Proposed Amendments 
Aimco has recently recognized that this UPREIT structure limits its ability to structure transactions in ways that may be desirable. Accordingly, Aimco is proposing to amend the Partnership Agreement to allow Aimco to acquire, own and dispose of assets outside of the Partnership. These assets might include assets distributed to Aimco or its subsidiaries, including the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner (collectively, the "Aimco Partners"), by the Partnership, or acquired from third parties. However, the Partnership would not be permitted to distribute assets to the Aimco Partners unless, after giving effect to such distribution, the net asset value of the Partnership would be at least twice the sum of (i) the value of all outstanding OP Units held by limited partners other than the Aimco Partners (the "Non-Aimco Holders"), and (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of all outstanding Partnership Preferred Units. The Non-Aimco Holders would continue to receive an Aimco dividend equivalent distribution. The distribution provisions in the Partnership Agreement would be modified so that the Aimco dividend equivalent distribution due to the Non-Aimco Holders is required to be paid before any distribution is paid to the Aimco Partners with respect to their OP Units. The Aimco Partners would continue to be entitled to receive priority distributions with respect to any Partnership Preferred Units that they own. After the Non-Aimco Holders and the Aimco Partners have received their Aimco dividend equivalent distributions, any remaining available cash would be distributed 1% to the Non-Aimco Holders and 99% to the Aimco Partners (subject to adjustment based on subsequent changes in the number of OP Units held by Non-Aimco Holders). Any such cash received by the Aimco Partners may be retained, invested or distributed by the Aimco Partners, provided that upon any such distribution by Aimco, the Non-Aimco Holders would be entitled to receive their Aimco dividend equivalent distribution. The limited partners' Redemption Right would continue without any changes, except that, if for any reason, the holder of any tendered OP Units has not received all of the Aimco dividend equivalent distributions that such holder was entitled to receive at the time of the redemption, the holder will receive additional shares of Aimco common stock or cash, in either case, with a value equal to the unpaid amount.  Please refer to the attached Exhibit A for the full text of the Proposal One Amendments. In Exhibit A, new text is underscored and deleted text is shown as a strikethrough. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings set forth in the form of Restated Partnership Agreement attached as Exhibit A. 
The Amendments include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The definition of "Adjustment Factor" is revised to clarify the treatment of a dividend to Aimco  stockholders in which stockholders can elect to receive stock or cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The definition of "Available Cash" is revised to deduct any cash distributed to Non-Aimco Holders of OP Units in lieu of an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The new defined terms, "Preferred Return" and "Preferred Return Shortfall" are added, which  are used to specify the amount of the preferred distribution payable to holders of OP Units (the Aimco dividend equivalent distribution).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The definition of "REIT Shares Amount" is revised so that a holder who tenders OP Units for Redemption  will receive additional shares or cash equal in value to any unpaid portion of the preferred return relating to those Units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The new defined terms, "Aimco Partners Sharing Percentage" and  "Non-Aimco Holders Sharing Percentage" are added, which are used to specify the applicable allocation of Available Cash, Net Income and Net Loss between the Aimco Partners, on the one hand, and Non-Aimco Holders, on the other hand.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 5.1 is revised to provide that distributions of Available Cash to holders of OP Units are paid as  follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• First, to the Non-Aimco Holders to the extent of their Preferred Return  Shortfalls;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Second, to the Aimco Partners to the extent of their Preferred Return Shortfalls; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Third, 1% to the Non-Aimco Holders and 99% to the Aimco Partners (with  such percentages subject to adjustment based on changes in the number of OP Units held by Non-Aimco Holders).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 5.2 is revised to permit the General Partner to make in-kind  distributions only to the Aimco Partners and not to any Non-Aimco Holders if, after giving effect to such distribution, the net asset value of the Partnership, as reasonably determined by the General Partner  in good faith, would exceed 200% of the sum of (i) the product of (x) the number of OP Units then held by Non-Aimco Holders, (y) the Value of a REIT Share, and (z) the Adjustment Factor,  and (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of all outstanding Preferred Partnership Units (all calculated as of the date of such distribution).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 6.2 is revised to allocate income and loss of the Partnership consistent with the revisions to  Section 5.1.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 7.5 is revised to eliminate the prohibition on Aimco Partners holding assets other than interests in  the Partnership.  
[END TABLE]
Certain Considerations 
Reduced cash flow at the Partnership. The key aspect of Proposal One is that the proposed Amendments would allow the General Partner to cause the Partnership to distribute assets only to the Aimco Partners (and not the Non-Aimco Holders). If a significant portion of the Partnership's assets are distributed to the Aimco Partners, it would reduce cash flow at the Partnership and could adversely affect the Partnership's ability to make distributions to partners. This risk would be exacerbated if, after the distribution, the cash flow of the Partnership's remaining assets declines.  Reduced assets at the Partnership. If a significant portion of the Partnership's assets are distributed only to the Aimco Partners (and not the Non-Aimco Holders), upon liquidation of the Partnership, there would be less asset value available to satisfy creditors and make liquidating distributions to partners. This risk would be exacerbated if, after the distribution, the value of the Partnership's remaining assets declines. 
A recharacterization of transactions undertaken by Aimco with respect to properties held outside of the Partnership ("REIT Properties") could result in taxation of the Limited Partners. The IRS could recharacterize transactions undertaken by Aimco with respect to REIT Properties as having been undertaken by the Partnership. Under such recharacterization, properties that are purportedly REIT Properties could be treated as being owned by the Partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Any gain realized on transactions involving such REIT Properties could be allocated to the Limited Partners, such that the Limited Partners could be subject to tax. While the Partnership and Aimco will endeavor to structure any transactions and arrangements among the Partnership, Aimco and the Limited Partners such that Aimco (and not the Partnership) will be treated as the owner of the REIT Properties for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Partnership and Aimco can give the Limited Partners no assurance that the IRS will not attempt to challenge such characterization. 
Recommendation of the General Partner 
The General Partner believes that Proposal One will provide flexibility for Aimco to structure future transactions that benefit Aimco stockholders (and therefore holders of OP Units as well), while preserving the economic benefits of OP Units. In reaching the recommendation set forth below, the General Partner considered the factors discussed above in the section entitled "Certain Considerations," as well as the following additional factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Aimco Holders will continue to receive Aimco dividend equivalent  distributions. Non-Aimco Holders would continue to receive quarterly distributions in an amount per OP Unit equal to the per share dividend paid at that time to holders of Aimco common stock. These distributions would be payable to the Non-Aimco Holders before any distribution is paid to the Aimco Partners with respect to their OP Units.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Aimco Holders will continue to have the right to redeem their OP  Units. Non-Aimco Holders would continue to have the right to tender their OP Units for redemption and receive, in exchange for each unit, either (i) one share of Aimco common stock, or (ii) cash  in an amount equal to the value of one share of Aimco common stock at the time (with the form of consideration at the election of the Partnership). In addition, following the effectiveness of the Amendments, if for any reason, the holder of any  tendered OP Units has not received all of the Aimco dividend equivalent distributions that such holder was entitled to receive at the time of the redemption, the holder will receive additional shares of Aimco common stock or cash, in either case,  with a value equal to the unpaid amount.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Amendments will give Aimco flexibility. The Amendments will allow Aimco to acquire, own and dispose of  assets outside of the Partnership. These assets might include assets distributed to Aimco or its subsidiaries by the Partnership, or acquired from third parties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Partnership will be required to retain a certain amount of assets. The Partnership would not be  permitted to distribute assets to the Aimco Partners unless, after giving effect to such distribution, the net asset value of the Partnership would be at least twice the sum of (i) the value of all outstanding OP Units held by the Non-Aimco Holders, and (ii) the aggregate liquidation preference of all outstanding Partnership Preferred Units.  
[END TABLE]
The General Partner believes that Proposal One is in the best interests of the Partnership and its Limited Partners and recommends that the Voting Limited Partners "CONSENT" to Proposal One.  PROPOSAL TWO 
Background 
The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 changed the rules applicable to U.S. federal income tax audits of partnerships, and the collection of any tax resulting from any such audits or other tax proceedings. Under the new rules (which are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017), the Partnership itself may be liable for an increase in taxes that would ordinarily apply at the partner-level (including interest and penalties) resulting from an adjustment of partnership tax items on audit, regardless of changes in the composition of the partners (or their relative ownership) between the year under audit and the year of the adjustment. The new rules also include an elective alternative method under which the additional taxes resulting from the adjustment are assessed from the affected partners. Although it is uncertain how certain aspects of these new rules will be implemented, it is possible that they could result in the Partnership being required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties as a result of an audit adjustment. 
Proposed Amendments 
Please refer to the attached Exhibit A for the full text of the Proposal Two Amendments. In Exhibit A, new text is underscored and deleted text is shown as a strikethrough. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein have the respective meanings set forth in the form of Restated Partnership Agreement attached as Exhibit A. 
The Amendments include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The following new defined terms are added: "Imputed Underpayment Amount," "Partnership Audit  Rules," "Partnership Representative," "Tax Matters Partner" and "TEFRA Rules."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 6.2 is modified to provide that the Partnership Representative may take actions to comply with the  Partnership Audit Rules and to allocate the burden of any assessments thereunder among the Partners.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Section 10.3 is modified to provide that the General Partner is designated as the "tax matters  partner" of the Partnership for taxable years before the Partnership Audit Rules apply.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A new Section 10.4 is added which provides that the General Partner is designated as the Partnership  Representative, and sets forth the rights and obligations of the Partnership Representative.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Section 10.4B provides that the Partnership Representative will have the sole authority to act on behalf  of the Partnership in connection with, and make all relevant decisions regarding, application of the Partnership Audit Rules.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Section 10.4C provides that the Partners will cooperate in good faith to timely provide information  requested by the Partnership Representative as needed to comply with the Partnership Audit Rules, including, without limitation, to make any elections available to the Partnership under the Partnership Audit Rules.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Section 10.4D provides that if any partnership adjustment is determined with respect to the Partnership,  the Partnership Representative may cause the Partnership to elect to have such adjustment passed through to the Partners for the year to which the adjustment relates. If the Partnership Representative does not cause the Partnership to so elect, then  any imputed underpayment or partnership adjustment that does not give rise to an imputed underpayment will be apportioned among the Partners for the taxable year in which the adjustment is finalized in such manner as may be necessary so that, to the  maximum extent possible, the tax and economic consequences of the imputed underpayment or other partnership adjustment and any associated interest and penalties are borne by the Partners based upon their interests in the Partnership for the reviewed  year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Section 10.4E provides that each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership from and  against any liability with respect to its share of any tax deficiency paid or payable by the Partnership that is allocable to the Partner. Any such obligation of a Partner will be implemented through adjustments to distributions otherwise payable to  that Partner, but the Partnership Representative may require Partners to contribute to the Partnership their Imputed Underpayment Amount imposed on and paid by the Partnership. Such obligations under Section 10.4E survive the termination of the  Partners' interests in the Partnership. Any amount so withheld from distributions to a Partner will be treated as an amount distributed to such Partner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• New Section 10.4F provides that the Partnership will reimburse the Partnership Representative and Designated  Individual for all expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the Partnership Representative's or Designated Individual's performance of its duties under Section 10.4, and the Partnership Representative and Designated Individual  are authorized to expend Partnership funds for professional services and costs associated therewith. Neither the Partnership Representative nor Designated Individual shall be liable to the Partnership or Partners for any losses arising out of the  Partnership Representative's or Designated Individual's performance of its duties, although the Partnership Representative may be so liable if it or the Designated Individual has engaged in willful breach, fraud, gross negligence or  willful misconduct in the performance of its duties.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Previous Section 10.4 is renumbered as Section 10.5.  
[END TABLE]

Any statements that express, or involve discussions as to, expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions, strategies, future events or performance (often, but not always, through the use of words or phrases such as result, are expected to, will continue, is anticipated, aim, believe, will, could, should, would, estimated, may, plan, potential, future, projection, goals, target, outlook, predict and intend or words of similar meaning) are not statements of historical facts and may be forward looking. Forward-looking statements involve estimates, assumptions and uncertainties. Accordingly, any such statements should be read together with the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Aimco and the Partnership for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 ("Form 10-K"), and you should refer to that section of the Form 10-K (in addition to any assumptions and other factors referred to specifically in connection with such forward-looking statements). Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and neither the General Partner, Aimco nor the Partnership undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date on which such statement is made, unless otherwise required by law. New factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors, nor can it assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained or implied in any forward-looking statement.

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement. 
"Act" means the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, as it may be amended from time to time, and any successor to such statute. 
"Actions" has the meaning set forth in Section 7.7 hereof. 
"Additional Funds" has the meaning set forth in Section 4.3A hereof. 
"Additional Limited Partner" means a Person who is admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 4.2 and Section 12.2 hereof and who is shown as such on the books and records of the Partnership. 
"Adjusted Capital Account Deficit" means, with respect to any PartnerHolder, the deficit balance, if any, in such Partner'sHolder's Capital Account as of the end of the relevant Fiscal Year, after giving effect to the following adjustments: 
(i)    decrease such deficit by any amounts that such PartnerHolder is obligated to restore pursuant to this Agreement or by operation of law upon liquidation of such Partner'sHolder's Partnership Interest or is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentence of each of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5); and 
(ii)    increase such deficit by the items described in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) and (6). 
The foregoing definition of "Adjusted Capital Account Deficit" is intended to comply with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
"Adjustment Factor" means 1.0; provided, however, that in the event that: 
(i)    the Previous General Partner (a) declares or pays a dividend on its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares or makes a distribution to all holders of its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares,   (b) splits or subdivides its outstanding REIT Shares or (c) effects a reverse stock split or otherwise combines its outstanding REIT Shares into a smaller number of REIT Shares, the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Adjustment Factor previously in effect by a fraction, (i) the numerator of which shall be the number of REIT Shares issued and outstanding on the record date for such dividend, distribution, split, subdivision, reverse split or combination (assuming for such purposes that such dividend, distribution, split, subdivision, reverse split or combination has occurred as of such time) and (ii) the denominator of which shall be the actual number of REIT Shares (determined without the above assumption) issued and outstanding on the record date for such dividend, distribution, split, subdivision, reverse split or combination; 
(ii)    the Previous General Partner distributes any rights, options or warrants to all holders of its REIT Shares to subscribe for or to purchase or to otherwise acquire REIT Shares (or other securities or rights convertible into, exchangeable for or exercisable for REIT Shares) at a price per share less than the Value of a REIT Share on the record date for such distribution (each a "Distributed Right"), then the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted by multiplying the Adjustment Factor previously in effect by a fraction (a) the numerator of which shall be the number of REIT Shares issued and outstanding on the record date plus the maximum number of REIT Shares purchasable under such Distributed Rights and (b) the denominator of which shall be the number of REIT Shares issued and outstanding on the record date plus a fraction (1) the numerator of which is the maximum number of REIT Shares purchasable under such Distributed Rights times the minimum purchase price per REIT Share under such Distributed Rights and (2) the denominator of which is the Value of a REIT Share as of the record date; provided, however, that, if any such Distributed Rights expire or become no longer exercisable, then the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted, effective retroactive to the date of distribution of the Distributed Rights, to reflect a reduced maximum number of REIT Shares or any change in the minimum purchase price for the purposes of the above fraction; and 
(iii)    the Previous General Partner shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all holders of its REIT Shares evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities, but excluding any dividend or distribution referred to in subsection (i) above), which evidences of indebtedness or assets relate to assets not received by the Previous General Partner, the General Partner and/or the Special Limited Partner pursuant to a pro rata distribution by the Partnership, then the Adjustment Factor shall be adjusted to equal the amount determined by multiplying the Adjustment Factor in effect immediately prior to the close of business on the date fixed for determination of shareholders entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction (i) the numerator shall be such Value of a REIT Share on the date fixed for such determination and (ii) the denominator shall be the Value of a REIT Share on the dates fixed for such determination less the then fair market value (as determined by the General Partner, whose determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the evidences of indebtedness or assets so distributed applicable to one REIT Share. 
Any adjustments to the Adjustment Factor shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such event, retroactive to the record date, if any, for such event, provided, however, that any Limited Partner may waive, by written notice to the General Partner, the effect of any. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any transaction described above with respect to REIT Shares that would otherwise require an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor applicable, no such adjustment shall be made if the Partnership concurrently effects a similar and proportional transaction with respect to the Partnership Common Units held by such Limited Partner, and, thereafter, such adjustment will not be effective as to such Partnership Common Units provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, if. If the Previous General Partner declares or pays a dividend on its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares or makes a distribution to all holders of its outstanding REIT Shares in REIT Shares, no adjustmentsmakes an Elective Dividend, no adjustment to the Adjustment Factor shall be made if the Partnership concurrently paysmakes a distribution with respect to eachto Holders of Partnership Common Units in an amount per Unit consisting of either (x) (i) a number of Partnership Common Units (or fraction thereof) equal to the aggregatenumber of REIT Shares (or fraction thereof) paid as a dividend with respect to eachall REIT Share, orShares, divided by the total number of REIT Shares outstanding as of the record date for such  dividend, and (ii) cash in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash paid as a dividend with respect to all REIT Shares, divided by the total number of REIT Shares outstanding as of the record date for such dividend, or (y) cash in an amount equal to the aggregate value, as determined in good faith by the General Partner, of boththe number of REIT Shares (or fraction thereof) and the cash paid as a dividend with respect to eachall REIT  Share Shares, divided by the total number of REIT Shares outstanding as of the record date for such dividend (the portion of such cash amount in clause (y) that  is attributable to the value of the REIT Shares paid as a dividend is referred to herein as the "Elective Dividend Cash Payment") .

Subject to Section 11.6C hereof, Net Income and Net Loss of the Partnership shall be determined and allocated with respect to each Fiscal Year of the Partnership as of the end of each such year. Except as otherwise provided in this Article 6, and subject to Section 11.6C hereof, an allocation to a Unitholder of a share of Net Income or Net Loss shall be treated as an allocation of the same share of each item of income, gain, loss or deduction that is taken into account in computing Net Income or Net Loss. 
Section 6.2    General Allocations. Subject to the terms of any Partnership Unit Designation, and except as otherwise provided in this Article 6 and subject to Section 11.6C hereof, all Net Income and Net Loss shall be allocated to each of the Holders of Partnership Common Units in accordance with their respective Partnership Common Units at the end of eachfor any relevant Fiscal Year. (or other taxable year or taxable period) will be allocated as follows: 
A.     Net Income. Net Income shall be allocated in the following manner and order of priority: 
(1)    First, to each Holder, in an amount that will cause such allocation, together with the amount of all previous allocations of Net Income pursuant to this Section 6.2A(1) after the Amendment Date, to be equal to the cumulative distributions received by such Holder with respect to its Partnership Common Units pursuant to (i) Section  5.1,  and (ii) in  connection with an Elective Dividend by the Previous General Partner (provided that any distribution described in this clause (ii) shall  be limited to the Elective Dividend Cash Payment received by such Holder), for all taxable periods beginning on and after the Amendment Date; 
(2)    Second, any remaining Net Income to each Holder in proportion to, and to the extent that, the amount of cumulative Net Loss previously allocated to such Holder exceeds the cumulative amount of Net Income previously allocated to such Holder pursuant to this Section 6.2A(2), in each case after the Amendment Date; and 
(3)    Third, with respect to all other Net Income, the Non-Aimco Holders Sharing Percentage to the Non-Aimco Holders, and the Aimco Partners Sharing Percentage to the Aimco Partners, on a pari passu basis.

C.    Net Loss Limitation. Any Net Loss allocated pursuant to Section 6.2B  will not exceed the maximum amount of Net Loss that can be so allocated without causing any Holder to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the end of any Fiscal Year. In the event that any but not all of the Holders would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as a consequence of an allocation of Net Loss pursuant to Section 6.2B, the  limitation set forth in the immediately preceding sentence will be applied on a Holder-by-Holder basis so as to allocate the maximum permissible Net Loss to each Holder under Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d). 
D.     Liquidating Event. If a Liquidating Event occurs in a Partnership taxable year, Net Income and Net Loss (or, if necessary, separate items of income, gain, loss and deduction constituting such Net Income and Net Loss) for such taxable year and any prior taxable years (to the extent permitted by Section 761(c)  of the Code) shall be allocated among the Holders in such amounts as will cause, to the greatest extent possible, the Capital Account of each Non-Aimco Holder to equal the amount such Non-Aimco Holder would be entitled to receive were such Holder to require the Partnership to redeem all of such Holder's  Partnership Common Units pursuant to Section 8.6.  If the Gross Asset Values of the Partnership's  assets are adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (b) of  the definition of "Gross  Asset Value," after  items are allocated pursuant to Sections 6.2A(1)  and (2) and  Section 6.2B,  such adjustments shall be allocated in accordance with this Section 6.2D. 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Partnership Representative in its discretion is expressly authorized to take any action necessary or appropriate to comply with the Partnership Audit Procedures, and to appropriately allocate the burden of any assessments thereunder among the Partners (as determined in the sole good faith judgment of the General Partner).

Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2 hereof, or any other provision of this Article 6, if there is a net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Holder of Partnership Common Units shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holder's share of the net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined under Regulations Section 1.704-2(g). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Holder pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 6.3B(1) is intended to qualify as a "minimum gain chargeback" within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
(2)    Partner Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(4) or in Section 6.3B(1) hereof, if there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year, each Holder of Partnership Common Units who has a share of the Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(5), shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such year (and, if necessary, subsequent years) in an amount equal to such Holder's share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section 1.7042(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each General Partner, Limited Partner and other Holder pursuant thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with Regulations Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 6.3B(2) is intended to qualify as a "chargeback of partner nonrecourse debt minimum gain" within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
(3)    Nonrecourse Deductions and Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Any Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the Holders of Partnership Common Units in accordance with   their Partnership Common Units. Any Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the Holder(s) who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i). 
(4)    Qualified Income Offset. If any Holder of Partnership Common Units unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of Partnership income and gain shall be allocated, in accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d), to such Holder in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by such Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Holder as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.3B(4) shall be made if and only to the extent that such Holder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided in this Article 6 have been tentatively made as if this Section 6.3B(4) were not in the Agreement. It is intended that this Section 6.3B(4) qualify and be construed as a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith. 
(5)    Gross Income Allocation. In the event that any Holder of Partnership Common Units has a deficit Capital Account at the end of any Fiscal Year that is in excess of the sum of (1) the amount (if any) that such Holder is obligated to restore to the Partnership upon complete liquidation of such Holder's Partnership Interest (including, the Holder's interest in outstanding Partnership Preferred Units and other Partnership Units) and (2) the amount that such Holder is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Holder shall be specially allocated items of Partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess to eliminate such deficit as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 6.3B(5) shall be made if and only to the extent that such Holder would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided in this Article 6 have been tentatively made as if this Section 6.3B(5) and Section 6.3B(4) hereof were not in the Agreement. 
(6)     Limitation on Allocation of Net Loss. To the extent that any allocation of Net Loss would cause or increase an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit as to any Holder of Partnership Common Units, such allocation of Net Loss shall be reallocated among the other Holders of Partnership Common Units in accordance with their respective Partnership Common Units, subject to the limitations of this Section 6.3B(6).
(76)    Section 754 Adjustment. To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) or Code Section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2) (iv)(m)(2) or Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to a Holder of Partnership Common Units in complete liquidation of its interest in the Partnership, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Holders in accordance with their Partnership Common Units in the event that Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Holders to whom such distribution was made in the event that Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies. 
(87)    Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in Sections 6.3B(1), (2), (3), (4), (5),and(6) and (7) hereof (the "Regulatory Allocations") are intended to comply with certain regulatory requirements, including the requirements of Regulations Sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1 hereof, the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among the Holders of Partnership Common Units so that to the extent possible without violating the requirements giving rise to the Regulatory Allocations, the net amount of such allocations of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to each Holder of a Partnership Common Unit shall be equal to the net amount that would have been allocated to each such Holder if the Regulatory Allocations had not occurred.  C.     Special Allocations Upon Liquidation. Notwithstanding any provision in this Article 6 to the contrary, in the event that the Partnership disposes of all or substantially all of its assets in a transaction that will lead to a liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to Article 13 hereof, then any Net Income or Net Loss realized in connection with such transaction and thereafter (and, if necessary, constituent items of income, gain, loss and deduction) shall be specially allocated among the Partners as required so as to cause liquidating distributions pursuant to Section 13.2A(4) hereof to be made in the same amounts and proportions as would have resulted had such distributions instead been made pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof. 
DC .     Allocation of Excess Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of determining a Holder's proportional share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), each Holder's interest in Partnership profits shall be such Holder's share of Partnership Common Units. 
Section 6.4    Tax Allocations. 
A.     In General. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6.4, for income tax purposes under the Code and the Regulations each Partnership item of income, gain, loss and deduction (collectively, "Tax Items") shall be allocated among the Holders of Partnership Common Units in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Sections 6.2 and 6.3 hereof. 
B.     Allocations Respecting Section 704(c) Revaluations. Notwithstanding Section 6.4A hereof, Tax Items with respect to Property that is contributed to the Partnership with a Gross Asset Value that varies from its basis in the hands of the contributing Partner immediately preceding the date of contribution shall be allocated among the Holders of Partnership Common Units for income tax purposes pursuant to Regulations promulgated under Code Section 704(c) so as to take into account such variation. The Partnership shall account for such variation under any method approved under Code Section 704(c) and the applicable Regulations as chosen by the General Partner, including, without limitation, the "traditional method" as described in Regulations Section 1.704-3(b). In the event that the Gross Asset Value of any partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to subsection (b) of the definition of "Gross Asset Value" (provided in Article 1 hereof), subsequent allocations of Tax Items with respect to such asset shall take account of the variation, if any, between the adjusted basis of such asset and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as under Code Section 704(c) and the applicable Regulations.

The General Partner shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or documents as may be reasonable and necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability to the extent provided by applicable law) in the State of Delaware and any other state, or the District of Columbia or other jurisdiction, in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. 
Section 7.3    Restrictions on General Partner's Authority. 
A.     The General Partner may not take any action in contravention of this Agreement, including, without limitation: 
(1)    take any action that would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; 
(2)    possess Partnership property, or assign any rights in specific Partnership property, for other than a Partnership purpose, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; 
(3)    admit a Person as a Partner, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement;

(5)    enter into any contract, mortgage, loan or other agreement that prohibits or restricts, or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting, the ability of (a) the General Partner, the Previous General Partner or the Partnership from satisfying its obligations under Section 8.6 hereof in full or (b) a Limited Partner from exercising its rights under Section 8.6 hereof to effect a Redemption in full, except, in either case, with the written consent of such Limited Partner affected by the prohibition or restriction. 
B.     The General Partner shall not, without the prior Consent of the Limited Partners, undertake, on behalf of the Partnership, any of the following actions or enter into any transaction that would have the effect of such transactions: 
(1)    except as provided in Section 7.3C hereof, amend, modify or terminate this Agreement other than to reflect the admission, substitution, termination or withdrawal of Partners pursuant to Article 11 or Article 12 hereof; 
(2)    make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors or appoint or acquiesce in the appointment of a custodian, receiver or trustee for all or any part of the assets of the Partnership;

(2)    to reflect the admission, substitution or withdrawal of Partners or the termination of the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement, and to amend Exhibits A and C in connection with such admission, substitution or withdrawal; 
(3)    to reflect a change that is of an inconsequential nature and does not adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect, or to cure any ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision in this Agreement not inconsistent with law or with other provisions, or make other changes with respect to matters arising under this Agreement that will not be inconsistent with law or with the provisions of this Agreement; 
(4)    to satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any order, directive, opinion, ruling or regulation of a federal or state agency or contained in federal or state law; 
(5)    (a) to reflect such changes as are reasonably necessary (i) for either the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner, as the case may be, to maintain its status as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2) or (ii) for the Previous General Partner to maintain its status as a REIT or to satisfy the REIT RequirementRequirements; (b) to reflect the Transfer of all or any part of a Partnership Interest among the Previous General Partner, the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner or any other "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) with respect to the Previous General Partner;

The General Partner will provide notice to the Limited Partners when any action under this Section 7.3C is taken. 
D.     Notwithstanding Sections 7.3B and 7.3C hereof, this Agreement shall not be amended, and no action may be taken by the General Partner, without the Consent of each Partner adversely affected, if such amendment or action would (i) convert a Limited Partner Interest in the Partnership into a General Partner Interest (except as a result of the General Partner acquiring such Partnership Interest), (ii) modify the limited liability of a Limited Partner, (iii) alter the rights of any Partner to receive the distributions to which such Partner is entitled, pursuant to Article 5 or Section 13.2A(4) hereof, or alter the allocations specified in Article 6 hereof (except, in any case, as permitted pursuant to Sections 4.2 and 7.3C hereof), (iv) alter or modify the Redemption rights, Cash Amount or REIT Shares Amount as set forth in Sections 8.6 and 11.2 hereof, or amend or modify any related definitions, or (v) amend this Section 7.3D; provided, however, that the Consent of each Partner adversely affected shall not be required for any amendment or action that affects all Partners holding the same class or series of Partnership Units on a uniform or pro rata basis. Further, no amendment may alter the restrictions on the General Partner's authority set forth elsewhere in this Section 7.3 without the Consent specified therein. Any such amendment or action consented to by any Partner shall be effective as to that Partner, notwithstanding the absence of such consent by any other Partner.  Section 7.4    Reimbursement of the General Partner. 
A.     The General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as general partner of the Partnership except as provided in elsewhere in this Agreement (including the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 hereof regarding distributions, payments and allocations to which it may be entitled in its capacity as the General Partner). 
B.     Subject to Sections 7.4C and 15.11 hereof, the Partnership shall be liable for, and shall reimburse the General Partner on a monthly basis, or such other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole and absolute discretion, for all sums expended in connection with the Partnership's business, including, without limitation, (i) expenses relating to the ownership of interests in and management and operation of, or for the benefit of, the Partnership, (ii) compensation of officers and employees, including, without limitation, payments under future compensation plans of the General Partner that may provide for stock units, or other phantom stock, pursuant to which employees of the General Partner will receive payments based upon dividends on or the value of REIT Shares, (iii) director fees and expenses; (iv) all costs and expenses of the General Partner being a public company, including costs of filings with the SEC, reports and other distributions to its shareholders and (v) income taxes or other similar types of costs, including but not limited to franchise taxes or related fees (in lieu of reimbursement, the Partnership may instead (in whole or in part) specially allocate income as necessary to reimburse the General Partner in full); provided, however, that the amount of any reimbursement shall be reduced by any interest earned by the General Partner with respect to bank accounts or other instruments or accounts held by it on behalf of the Partnership as permitted pursuant to Section 7.5 hereof. Such reimbursements shall be in addition to any reimbursement of the General Partner as a result of indemnification pursuant to Section 7.7 hereof. 
C.     To the extent practicable, Partnership expenses shall be billed directly to and paid by the Partnership and, subject to Section 15.11 hereof, reimbursements to the General Partner or any of its Affiliates by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 7.4 shall be treated as "guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Code Section 707(c). 
Section 7.5    Outside Activities of the Previous General Partner and the General Partner. Neither the General Partner nor the Previous General Partner shall directly or indirectly enter into or conduct any business, other than in connection with (a) the ownership, acquisition and disposition of Partnership Interests as General Partner, (b) the management of the business of the Partnership, (c) the operation of the Previous General Partner as a reporting company with a class (or classes) of securities registered under the Exchange Act, (d) the Previous General Partner's operations as a REIT, (e) the offering, sale, syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities or other interests, (f) financing or refinancing of any type related to the Partnership or its assets or activities, (g) the General Partner's qualification as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) and, (h) the acquisition, ownership, financing, operation, management and disposition of assets held directly by the Previous General Partner, any of the Aimco Partners or any of their Subsidiaries, excluding the Partnership, and (i) such activities as are incidental thereto. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the General Partner or the Previous General Partner from executing guarantees of Partnership debt for which it would otherwise be liable in its capacity as General Partner. Subject to Section 7.3B hereof, the General Partner, the Previous General Partner, the Special Limited Partner and all "qualified REIT subsidiaries" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)), taken as a group, shall not own any assets or take title to assets (other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the Partnership) other than Partnership Interests as the General Partner or Special Limited Partner and other than such cash and cash equivalents, bank accounts or similar instruments or accounts as such group deems reasonably necessary, taking into account Section 7.1D hereof and the requirements necessary for the Previous General Partner to qualify as a REIT and for the Previous General Partner, the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner to carry out their respective responsibilities contemplated under this Agreement and the Charter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Previous General Partner or the General Partner acquires assets in its own name and owns Property other than through the Partnership, the Partners agree to negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement, including, without limitation, the definition of "Adjustment Factor," to reflect such activities and the  direct ownership of assets by the Previous General Partner or the General Partner. The General Partner and any Affiliates of the General Partner may acquire Limited Partner Interests and shall be entitled to exercise all rights of a Limited Partner relating to such Limited Partner Interests. 
Section 7.6    Contracts with Affiliates. 
A.     The Partnership may lend or contribute funds or other assets to its Subsidiaries or other Persons in which it has an equity investment, and such Persons may borrow funds from the Partnership, on terms and conditions established in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner. The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit in favor of any Subsidiary or any other Person. 
B.     Except as provided in Section 7.5 hereof and subject to Section 3.1 hereof, the Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, limited liability companies, partnerships, corporations, business trusts or other business entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions consistent with this Agreement and applicable law as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes to be advisable. 
C.     Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement, neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer or convey any property to the Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are determined by the General Partner in good faith to be fair and reasonable. 
D.     The General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion and without the approval of the Limited Partners, may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans funded by the Partnership for the benefit of employees of the General Partner, the Partnership, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of them in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit of the Partnership or any of the Partnership's Subsidiaries. 
E.     The General Partner is expressly authorized to enter into, in the name and on behalf of the Partnership, a right of first opportunity arrangement and other conflict avoidance agreements with various Affiliates of the Partnership and the General Partner, on such terms as the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, believes are advisable. 
Section 7.7    Indemnification. 
A.     To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Partnership shall indemnify each Indemnitee from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, that relate to the operations of the Partnership ("Actions") as set forth in this Agreement in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not indemnify an Indemnitee (i) for willful misconduct or a knowing violation of the law or (ii) for any transaction for which such Indemnitee received an improper personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of this Agreement. Without limitation, the foregoing indemnity shall extend to any liability of any Indemnitee, pursuant to a loan guaranty or otherwise, for any indebtedness of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership (including, without limitation, any indebtedness which the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership has assumed or taken subject to), and the General Partner is hereby authorized and empowered, on behalf of the Partnership, to enter into one or more indemnity agreements consistent with the provisions of this Section 7.7 in favor of any Indemnitee having or potentially having liability for any such indebtedness. It is the intention of this Section 7.7A that the Partnership indemnify each Indemnitee to the fullest extent permitted by law. The termination of any proceeding by judgment, order or settlement does not create a presumption that the Indemnitee did not meet the requisite standard of conduct set forth in this Section 7.7A. The termination of any proceeding by conviction of an Indemnitee or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent   by an Indemnitee, or an entry of an order of probation against an Indemnitee prior to judgment, does not create a presumption that such Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified in this Section 7.7A with respect to the subject matter of such proceeding. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, and neither the General Partner nor any Limited Partner shall have any obligation to contribute to the capital of the Partnership or otherwise provide funds to enable the Partnership to fund its obligations under this Section 7.7. 
B.     To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses incurred by an Indemnitee who is a party to a proceeding or otherwise subject to or the focus of or is involved in any Action shall be paid or reimbursed by the Partnership as incurred by the Indemnitee in advance of the final disposition of the Action upon receipt by the Partnership of (i) a written affirmation by the Indemnitee of the Indemnitee's good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the Partnership as authorized in this Section 7.7A has been met, and (ii) a written undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct has not been met. 
C.     The indemnification provided by this Section 7.7 shall be in addition to any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee unless otherwise provided in a written agreement with such Indemnitee or in the writing pursuant to which such Indemnitee is indemnified. 
D.     The Partnership may, but shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of any of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this Agreement. 
E.     Any liabilities which an Indemnitee incurs as a result of acting on behalf of the Partnership or the General Partner (whether as a fiduciary or otherwise) in connection with the operation, administration or maintenance of an employee benefit plan or any related trust or funding mechanism (whether such liabilities are in the form of excise taxes assessed by the IRS, penalties assessed by the Department of Labor, restitutions to such a plan or trust or other funding mechanism or to a participant or beneficiary of such plan, trust or other funding mechanism, or otherwise) shall be treated as liabilities or judgments or fines under this Section 7.7, unless such liabilities arise as a result of (i) such Indemnitee's intentional misconduct or knowing violation of the law, or (ii) any transaction in which such Indemnitee received a personal benefit in violation or breach of any provision of this Agreement or applicable law. 
F.     In no event may an Indemnitee subject any of the Partners to personal liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this Agreement. 
G.     An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under this Section 7.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement. 
H.     The provisions of this Section 7.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.7 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the Partnership's liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 7.7 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted.  I.     It is the intent of the Partners that any amounts paid by the Partnership to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall be treated as "guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Code Section 707(c). 
Section 7.8    Liability of the General Partner. 
A.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, neither the General Partner nor any of its directors or officers shall be liable or accountable in damages or otherwise to the Partnership, any Partners or any Assignees for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment or mistakes of fact or law or of any act or omission if the General Partner or such director or officer acted in good faith. 
B.     The Limited Partners expressly acknowledge that the General Partner is acting for the benefit of the Partnership, the Limited Partners and the General Partner's shareholders collectively and that the General Partner is under no obligation to give priority to the separate interests of the Limited Partners or the General Partner's shareholders (including, without limitation, the tax consequences to Limited Partners, Assignees or the General Partner's shareholders) in deciding whether to cause the Partnership to take (or decline to take) any actions. 
C.     Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in Section 7.1A hereof, the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either directly or by or through its employees or agents (subject to the supervision and control of the General Partner). The General Partner shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent appointed by it in good faith. 
D.     Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 7.8 or any provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on the General Partner's, and its officers' and directors', liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners under this Section 7.8 as in effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or be asserted. 
E.     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except for fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, or pursuant to any express indemnities given to the Partnership by any Partner pursuant to any other written instrument, no Partner shall have any personal liability whatsoever, to the Partnership or to the other Partner(s), for the debts or liabilities of the Partnership or the Partnership's obligations hereunder, and the full recourse of the other Partner(s) shall be limited to the interest of that Partner in the Partnership. To the fullest extent permitted by law, no officer, director or shareholder of the General Partner shall be liable to the Partnership for money damages except for (i) active and deliberate dishonesty established by a non-appealable final judgment or (ii) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services. Without limitation of the foregoing, and except for fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, or pursuant to any such express indemnity, no property or assets of any Partner, other than its interest in the Partnership, shall be subject to levy, execution or other enforcement procedures for the satisfaction of any judgment (or other judicial process) in favor of any other Partner(s) and arising out of, or in connection with, this Agreement. This Agreement is executed by the officers of the General Partner solely as officers of the same and not in their own individual capacities. 
F.     To the extent that, at law or in equity, the General Partner has duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the Partnership or the Limited Partners, the General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to any other Partner for its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the General Partner otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to replace such other duties and liabilities of such General Partner.  Section 7.9    Other Matters Concerning the General Partner. 
A.     The General Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture or other paper or document believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or parties. 
B.     The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers, architects, engineers, environmental consultants and other consultants and advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance upon the opinion of such Persons as to matters that the General Partner reasonably believes to be within such Person's professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion. 
C.     The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact. Each such attorney shall, to the extent provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and perform all and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by the General Partner hereunder. 
D.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the Act, any action of the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or any decision of the General Partner to refrain from acting on behalf of the Partnership, undertaken in the good faith belief that such action or omission is necessary or advisable in order (i) to protect the ability of the Previous General Partner to continue to qualify as a REIT, (ii) for the Previous General Partner otherwise to satisfy the REIT Requirements, (iii) to avoid the Previous General Partner incurring any taxes under Code Section 857 or Code Section 4981 or (iv) for the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner to continue to qualify as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)), is expressly authorized under this Agreement and is deemed approved by all of the Limited Partners. 
Section 7.10    Title to Partnership Assets. Title to Partnership assets, whether real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or collectively with other Partners or Persons, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine, including Affiliates of the General Partner. The General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for which legal title is held in the name of the General Partner or any nominee or Affiliate of the General Partner shall be held by the General Partner for the use and benefit of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the General Partner shall use its best efforts to cause beneficial and record title to such assets to be vested in the Partnership as soon as reasonably practicable. All Partnership assets shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records, irrespective of the name in which legal title to such Partnership assets is held. 
Section 7.11    Reliance by Third Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to assume that the General Partner has full power and authority, without the consent or approval of any other Partner or Person, to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and take any and all actions on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner as if it were the Partnership's sole party in interest, both legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the General Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or expediency of any act or action of the General Partner or its representatives. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of the   Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming thereunder that (i) at the time of the execution and delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and effect, (ii) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the Partnership and (iii) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership. 
ARTICLE 8 
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LIMITED PARTNERS 
Section 8.1    Limitation of Liability. The Limited Partners shall have no liability under this Agreement except as expressly provided in this Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10.410.5 hereof) or under the Act. 
Section 8.2    Management of Business. No Limited Partner or Assignee (other than the General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any officer, director, member, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates, in their capacity as such) shall take part in the operations, management or control (within the meaning of the Act) of the Partnership's business, transact any business in the Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the Partnership. The transaction of any such business by the General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any officer, director, member, employee, partner, agent, representative, or trustee of the General Partner, the Partnership or any of their Affiliates, in their capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners or Assignees under this Agreement. 
Section 8.3    Outside Activities of Limited Partners. Subject to any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 7.6D hereof and any other agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or its Affiliates with the General Partner, the Partnership or a Subsidiary (including, without limitation, any employment agreement), any Limited Partner and any Assignee, officer, director, employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate or shareholder of any Limited Partner shall be entitled to and may have business interests and engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership, including business interests and activities that are in direct or indirect competition with the Partnership or that are enhanced by the activities of the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any Partners shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any Limited Partner or Assignee. Subject to such agreements, none of the Limited Partners nor any other Person shall have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby in any business ventures of any other Person (other than the General Partner, to the extent expressly provided herein), and such Person shall have no obligation pursuant to this Agreement, subject to Section 7.6D hereof and any other agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or its Affiliates with the General Partner, the Partnership or a Subsidiary, to offer any interest in any such business ventures to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or any such other Person, even if such opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or such other Person, could be taken by such Person. 
Section 8.4    Return of Capital. Except pursuant to the rights of Redemption set forth in Section 8.6 hereof, no Limited Partner shall be entitled to the withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent of distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the Partnership as provided herein. Except to the extent provided in Article 6 hereof or otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Limited Partner or Assignee shall have priority over any other Limited Partner or Assignee either as to the return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. 
Section 8.5    Rights of Limited Partners Relating to the Partnership. 
A.     In addition to other rights provided by this Agreement or by the Act, and except as limited by Section 8.5C hereof, each Limited Partner shall have the right, for a purpose reasonably related to such Limited   Partner's interest as a limited partner in the Partnership, upon written demand with a statement of the purpose of such demand and at such Limited Partner's own expense: 
(1)    to obtain a copy of (i) the most recent annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC by the Previous General Partner or the General Partner pursuant to the Exchange Act and (ii) each report or other written communication sent to the shareholders of the Previous General Partner; 
(2)    to obtain a copy of the Partnership's federal, state and local income tax returns for each Fiscal Year; 
(3)    to obtain a current list of the name and last known business, residence or mailing address of each Partner; 
(4)    to obtain a copy of this Agreement and the Certificate and all amendments thereto, together with executed copies of all powers of attorney pursuant to which this Agreement, the Certificate and all amendments thereto have been executed; and 
(5)    to obtain true and full information regarding the amount of cash and a description and statement of any other property or services contributed by each Partner and that each Partner has agreed to contribute in the future, and the date on which each became a Partner. 
B.     The Partnership shall notify any Limited Partner that is a Qualifying Party, on request, of the then current Adjustment Factor or any change made to the Adjustment Factor. 
C.     Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.5, the General Partner may keep confidential from the Limited Partners, for such period of time as the General Partner determines in its sole and absolute discretion to be reasonable, any information that (i) the General Partner believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or other information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith believes is not in the best interests of the Partnership or the General Partner or (ii) the Partnership or the General Partner is required by law or by agreements with unaffiliated third parties to keep confidential. 
Section 8.6    Redemption Rights of Qualifying Parties. 
A.     After the first Twelve-Month Period, a Qualifying Party, but no other Limited Partner or Assignee, shall have the right (subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein) to require the Partnership to redeem all or a portion of the Redeemable Units held by such Tendering Party (such Redeemable Units being hereafter "Tendered Units") in exchange (a "Redemption") for REIT sharesShares issuable on, or the Cash Amount payable on, the Specified Redemption Date, as determined by the Partnership in its sole discretion. Any Redemption shall be exercised pursuant to a Notice of Redemption delivered to the General Partner by the Qualifying Party when exercising the Redemption right (the "Tendering Party"). A Tendering Party shall have no right to receive distributions with respect to any Tendered Units (other than the Cash Amount) paid after delivery of the Notice of Redemption, whether or not the Partnership Record Date for such distribution precedes or coincides with such delivery of the Notice of Redemption. If the Partnership elects to redeem Tendered Units for cash, the Cash Amount shall be delivered as a certified check payable to the Tendering Party or, in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion, in immediately available funds. 
B.     If the Partnership elects to redeem Tendered Units for REIT Shares rather than cash, then the Partnership shall direct the Previous General Partner to issue and deliver such REIT Shares to the Tendering Party pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 8.6B, in which case, (i) the Previous General Partner, acting as a distinct legal entity, shall assume directly the obligation with respect thereto and shall satisfy the Tendering Party's exercise of its Redemption right, and (ii) such transaction shall be treated, for federal income tax purposes, as a transfer by the Tendering Party of such Tendered Units to the Previous General Partner in exchange for REIT sharesShares. The percentage of the Tendered Units tendered for Redemption by the Tendering Party for which the Partnership elects to cause the Previous General Partner to issue REIT Shares   (rather than cash) is referred to as the "Applicable Percentage." In making such election to cause the Previous General Partner to acquire Tendered Units, the Partnership shall act in a fair, equitable and reasonable manner that neither prefers one group or class of Qualifying Parties over another nor discriminates against a group or class of Qualifying Parties. If the Partnership elects to redeem any number of Tendered Units for REIT Shares, rather than cash, on the Specified Redemption Date, the Tendering Party shall sell such number of the Tendered Units to the Previous General Partner in exchange for a number of REIT Shares equal to the product of the REIT Shares Amount and the Applicable Percentage. The Tendering Party shall submit (i) such information, certification or affidavit as the Previous General Partner may reasonably require in connection with the application of the Ownership Limit and other restrictions and limitations of the Charter to any such acquisition and (ii) such written representations, investment letters, legal opinions or other instruments necessary, in the Previous General Partner's view, to effect compliance with the Securities Act. The product of the Applicable Percentage and the REIT Shares Amount, if applicable, shall be delivered by the Previous General Partner as duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and accessible REIT Shares and, if applicable, Rights, free of any pledge, lien, encumbrance or restriction, other than the Ownership Limit and other restrictions provided in the Charter, the Bylaws of the Previous General Partner, the Securities Act and relevant state securities or "blue sky" laws. Neither any Tendering Party whose Tendered Units are acquired by the Previous General Partner pursuant to this Section 8.6B, any Partner, any Assignee nor any other interested Person shall have any right to require or cause the Previous General Partner or the General Partner to register, qualify or list any REIT Shares owned or held by such Person, whether or not such REIT Shares are issued pursuant to this Section 8.6B, with the SEC, with any state securities commissioner, department or agency, under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or with any stock exchange; provided, however, that this limitation shall not be in derogation of any registration or similar rights granted pursuant to any other written agreement between the Previous General Partner and any such Person. Notwithstanding any delay in such delivery, the Tendering Party shall be deemed the owner of such REIT Shares and Rights for all purposes, including, without limitation, rights to vote or consent, receive dividends, and exercise rights, as of the Specified Redemption Date. REIT Shares issued upon an acquisition of the Tendered Units by the Previous General Partner pursuant to this Section 8.6B may contain such legends regarding restrictions under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws as the Previous General Partner in good faith determines to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with such laws. 
C.     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6A and 8.6B hereof, the Tendering Parties (i) where the Redemption would consist of less than all the Partnership Common Units held by Partners other than the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner, shall not be entitled to elect or effect a Redemption to the extent that the aggregate Percentage Interests of the Limited Partners (other than the Special Limited Partner) would be reduced, as a result of the Redemption, to less than one percent (1%) and (ii) shall have no rights under this Agreement that would otherwise be prohibited under the Charter. To the extent that any attempted Redemption would be in violation of this Section 8.6C, it shall be null and void ab initio, and the Tendering Party shall not acquire any rights or economic interests in REIT Shares otherwise issuable by the Previous General Partner under Section 8.6B hereof. 
D.     In the event that the Partnership declines to cause the Previous General Partner to acquire all of the Tendered Units from the Tendering Party in exchange for REIT Shares pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof following receipt of a Notice of Redemption (a "Declination"): 
(1)    The Previous General Partner or the General Partner shall give notice of such Declination to the Tendering PartyPartner on or before the close of business on the Cut-Off Date. 
(2)    The Partnership may elect to raise funds for the payment of the Cash Amount either (a) by requiring that the General Partner contribute such funds from the proceeds of a registered public offering (a "Public Offering Funding") by the Previous General Partner of a number of REIT Shares ("Registrable Shares") equal to the REIT Shares Amount with respect to the Tendered Units or (b) from any other sources (including, but not limited to, the sale of any Property and the incurrence of additional Debt) available to the Partnership.  (3)    Promptly upon the General Partner's receipt of the Notice of Redemption and the Previous General Partner or the General Partner giving notice of the Partnership's Declination, the General Partner shall give notice (a "Single Funding Notice") to all Qualifying Parties then holding a Partnership Interest (or an interest therein) and having Redemption rights pursuant to this Section 8.6 and require that all such Qualifying Parties elect whether or not to effect a Redemption of their Partnership Common Units to be funded through such Public Offering Funding. In the event that any such Qualifying Party elects to effect such a Redemption, it shall give notice thereof and of the number of Partnership Common Units to be made subject thereon in writing to the General Partner within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of the Single Funding Notice, and such Qualifying Party shall be treated as a Tendering Party for all purposes of this Section 8.6. In the event that a Qualifying Party does not so elect, it shall be deemed to have waived its right to effect a Redemption for the current Twelve-Month Period; provided, however, that the Previous General Partner shall not be required to acquire Partnership Common Units pursuant to this Section 8.6D more than twice within a Twelve-Month Period. 
Any proceeds from a Public Offering Funding that are in excess of the Cash Amount shall be for the sole benefit of the Previous General Partner and/or the General Partner. The General Partner and/or the Special Limited Partner shall make a Capital Contribution of such amounts to the Partnership for an additional General Partner Interest and/or Limited Partner Interest. Any such contribution shall entitle the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner, as the case may be, to an equitable Percentage Interest adjustment. 
E.     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 8.6B hereof, the Previous General Partner shall not, under any circumstances, elect to acquire Tendered Units in exchange for the REIT Shares Amount if such exchange would be prohibited under the Charter. 
F.     Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (but subject to Section 8.6C hereof), with respect to any Redemption pursuant to this Section 8.6: 
(1)    All Partnership Common Units acquired by the Previous General Partner pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof shall be contributed by the Previous General Partner to either or both of the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner in such proportions as the Previous General Partner, the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner shall determine. Any Partnership Common Units so contributed to the General Partner shall automatically, and without further action required, be converted into and deemed to be a General Partner Interest comprised of the same number of Partnership Common Units. Any Partnership Common Units so contributed to the Special Limited Partner shall remain outstanding. 
(2)    Subject to the Ownership Limit, no Tendering Party may effect a Redemption for less than five hundred (500) Redeemable Units or, if such Tendering Party holds (as a Limited Partner or, economically, as an Assignee) less than five hundred (500) Redeemable Units, all of the Redeemable Units held by such Tendering Party. 
(3)    Each Tendering Party (a) may effect a Redemption only once in each fiscal quarter of a Twelve-Month Period and (b) may not effect a Redemption during the period after the Partnership Record Date with respect to a distribution and before the record date established by the Previous General Partner for a distribution to its shareholders of some or all of its portion of such Partnership distribution. 
(4)    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, with respect to any Redemption or acquisition of Tendered Units by the Previous General Partner pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof, in the event that the Previous General Partner or the General Partner gives notice to all Limited Partners (but excluding any Assignees) then owning Partnership Interests (a "Primary Offering Notice") that the Previous General Partner desires to effect a primary offering of its equity securities then, unless the Previous General Partner and the General Partner otherwise consent, commencement of the actions denoted in Section 8.6E hereof as to a Public Offering Funding with respect to any Notice of Redemption thereafter received, whether or not the Tendering Party is a Limited Partner, may be delayed until the earlier of (a) the completion of the primary offering or (b) ninety (90) days following the giving of the Primary Offering Notice.  (5)    Without the Consent of the Previous General Partner, no Tendering Party may effect a Redemption within ninety (90) days following the closing of any prior Public Offering Funding. 
(6)    The consummation of such Redemption shall be subject to the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, if any, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. 
(7)    The Tendering Party shall continue to own (subject, in the case of an Assignee, to the provision of Section 11.5 hereof) all Redeemable Units subject to any Redemption, and be treated as a Limited Partner or an Assignee, as applicable, with respect to such Redeemable Units for all purposes of this Agreement, until such Redeemable Units are either paid for by the Partnership pursuant to Section 8.6A hereof or transferred to the Previous General Partner (or directly to the General Partner or Special Limited Partner) and paid for, by the issuance of the REIT Shares, pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof on the Specified Redemption Date. Until a Specified Redemption Date and an acquisition of the Tendered Units by the Previous General Partner pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof, the Tendering Party shall have no rights as a shareholder of the Previous General Partner with respect to the REIT Shares issuable in connection with such acquisition. 
For purposes of determining compliance with the restrictions set forth in this Section 8.6F, all Partnership Common Units beneficially owned by a Related Party of a Tendering Party shall be considered to be owned or held by such Tendering Party. 
G.     In connection with an exercise of Redemption rights pursuant to this Section 8.6, the Tendering Party shall submit the following to the General Partner, in addition to the Notice of Redemption: 
(1)    A written affidavit, dated the same date as the Notice of Redemption, (a) disclosing the actual and constructive ownership, as determined for purposes of Code Sections 856(a)(6) and 856(h), of REIT Shares by (i) such Tendering Party and (ii) any Related Party and (b) representing that, after giving effect to the Redemption, neither the Tendering Party nor any Related Party will own REIT Shares in excess of the Ownership Limit; 
(2)    A written representation that neither the Tendering Party nor any Related Party has any intention to acquire any additional REIT Shares prior to the closing of the Redemption on the Specified Redemption Date; and 
(3)    An undertaking to certify, at and as a condition to the closing of the Redemption on the Specified Redemption Date, that either (a) the actual and constructive ownership of REIT Shares by the Tendering Party and any Related Party remain unchanged from that disclosed in the affidavit required by Section 8.6G(1) or (b) after giving effect to the Redemption, neither the Tendering Party nor any Related Party shall own REIT Shares in violation of the Ownership Limit. 
Section 8.7    Partnership Right to Call Limited Partner Interests. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, on and after the date on which the aggregate Percentage Interests of the Limited Partners (other than the Special Limited Partner) are less than one percent (1%), the Partnership shall have the right, but not the obligation, from time to time and at any time to redeem any and all outstanding Limited Partner Interests (other than the Special Limited Partner's Limited Partner Interest) by treating any Limited Partner as a Tendering Party who has delivered a Notice of Redemption pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof for the amount of Partnership Common Units to be specified by the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, by notice to such Limited Partner that the Partnership has elected to exercise its rights under this Section 8.7. Such notice given by the General Partner to a Limited Partner pursuant to this Section 8.7 shall be treated as if it were a Notice of Redemption delivered to the General Partner by such Limited Partner. For purposes of this Section 8.7, (a) any Limited Partner (whether or not otherwise a Qualifying Party) may, in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion, be treated as a Qualifying Party that is a Tendering Party and (b) the provisions of Sections 8.6C(i), 8.6F(2), 8.6F(3) and 8.6F(5) hereof shall not apply, but the remainder of Section 8.6 hereof shall apply, mutatis mutandis.

Section 10.2    Tax Elections.

The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such election (including, without limitation, any election under Code Sections 461(h) and 754) upon the General Partner's determination in its sole and absolute discretion that such revocation is in the best interests of the Partners. 
B.     The General Partner is expressly authorized to make any elections, including applicable safe harbor elections, in connection with the issuance of Partnership Interests for services that it deems to be in the best interest of the Partnership. Furthermore, the General Partner is authorized to amend this Agreement as it deems necessary to provide that (1) the Partnership is authorized and directed to elect applicable safe harbor elections, and (2) the Partnership and each of its Partners (including any person to whom a Partnership Interest is transferred in connection with the performance of services) agrees to comply with all requirements of the safe harbor with respect to all Partnership Interests transferred in connection with the performance of services while the election remains effective.

Section  10.4    Partnership Representative. 
A.    The General Partner is hereby designated to serve as the "partnership representative " with  respect to the Partnership, as provided in Section 6223(a)  of the Partnership Audit Rules (the "Partnership  Representative").  For each taxable year in which the Partnership Representative is an entity, the Partnership shall appoint the "designated  individual" identified  by the Partnership Representative to act on behalf of the Partnership Representative in accordance with the applicable Treasury Regulations (the "Designated  Individual").  Each Partner expressly consents to such designations and agrees that it will execute, acknowledge, deliver, file and record at the appropriate public offices such documents as may be necessary or appropriate to evidence such consent. 
B.    The Partnership Representative shall have the sole authority to act on behalf of the Partnership in connection with and make all relevant decisions regarding application of the Partnership Audit Rules, including, but not limited to, any elections under the Partnership Audit Rules or any decisions to settle, compromise, challenge, litigate or otherwise alter the defense of any proceeding before the IRS. 
C.    The Partners agree to cooperate in good faith to timely provide information requested by the Partnership Representative as needed to comply with the Partnership Audit Rules, including, without limitation, to make any elections available to the Partnership under the Partnership Audit Rules. Each Partner agrees that, upon request of the Partnership, such Partner shall take such actions as may be necessary or desirable (as determined by the Partnership Representative) to (i) allow  the Partnership to comply with the provisions of Section 6226  of the Partnership Audit Rules so that any "partnership  adjustments" (as  defined in Section 6241(2)  of the Partnership Audit Rules) are taken into account by the Partners and former Partners rather than the Partnership; (ii) use  the provisions of Section 6225(c)  of the Partnership Audit Rules including, but not limited  to, filing amended tax returns with respect to any "reviewed  year" (within  the meaning of Section 6225(d)(1)  of the Partnership Audit Rules) or using the alternative procedure to filing amended returns to reduce the amount of any partnership adjustment otherwise required to be taken into account by the Partnership or (iii) otherwise allow the Partnership and its Partners to address and respond to any matters arising under the Partnership Audit Rules. 
D.    Notwithstanding other provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if any partnership adjustment is determined with respect to the Partnership, the Partnership Representative may cause the Partnership to elect pursuant to Section 6226  of the Partnership Audit Rules to have such adjustment passed through to the Partners for the year to which the adjustment relates (i.e., the "reviewed  year" within  the meaning of Section 6225(d)(1)  of the Partnership Audit Rules). In the event that the Partnership Representative has not caused the Partnership to so elect pursuant to Section 6226  of the Partnership Audit Rules, then any "imputed  underpayment" (as  determined in accordance with Section 6225  of the Partnership Audit Rules) or partnership adjustment that does not give rise to an "imputed underpayment" shall  be apportioned among the Partners of the Partnership for the taxable year in which the adjustment is finalized in such manner as may be necessary (as determined by the Partnership Representative in good faith) so that, to the maximum extent possible, the tax and economic consequences of the imputed underpayment or other partnership adjustment and any associated interest and penalties (any such amount, an "Imputed  Underpayment Amount")  are borne by the Partners based upon their interests in the Partnership for the reviewed year. Imputed Underpayment Amounts also shall include any imputed underpayment within the meaning of Section 6225 of the Partnership Audit Rules paid (or payable) by any entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes in which the Partnership holds (or has held) a direct or indirect interest other than through entities treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent that the Partnership bears the economic burden of such amounts, whether by law or contract. 
E.    Each Partner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership from and against any liability with respect to such Partner's share of any tax deficiency paid or payable by the Partnership that is allocable to the Partner as determined in accordance with the second to last sentence of paragraph (D)  above with respect to an audited or reviewed taxable year for which such Partner was a partner in the Partnership. The obligations set forth in this paragraph (E)  shall survive the termination of any Partner's  interest in the Partnership, the termination of this Agreement and/or the termination, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Partnership, and shall remain binding on each Partner for the period of time necessary to resolve with the IRS (or any other applicable taxing authority) all income tax matters relating to the Partnership and for Partners to satisfy their indemnification obligations, if any, pursuant to this Section 10.4. Any obligation of a Partner pursuant to this paragraph (E)  shall be implemented through adjustments to distributions otherwise payable to such Partner as determined in accordance with Article 5;  provided however, that, at the written request of the Partnership Representative, each Partner or former Partner may be required to contribute to the Partnership such Partner's  Imputed Underpayment Amount imposed on and paid by the Partnership; provided further, that if a Partner or former Partner individually directly pays, pursuant to the Partnership Audit Rules, any such Imputed Underpayment Amount, then such payment shall reduce any offset to distribution or required capital contribution of such Partner or former Partner. Any amount withheld from distributions pursuant to this paragraph (E)  shall be treated as an amount distributed to such Partner or former Partner for all purposes under this Agreement. 
F.    All expenses incurred by the Partnership Representative or Designated Individual in connection with its duties as partnership representative or designated individual, as applicable, shall be expenses of the Partnership (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any costs and expenses incurred in connection with any claims asserted against the Partnership Representative or Designated Individual, as applicable, except, in the case of the Partnership Representative, to the extent the Partnership Representative is determined to have performed its duties in the manner described in the final sentence of this paragraph F), and the Partnership shall reimburse the Partnership Representative or Designated Individual, as applicable, for all such costs and expenses. Nothing herein shall be construed to restrict the Partnership Representative or Designated Individual from engaging lawyers, accountants, tax advisers, or other professional advisers or experts to assist the Partnership Representative or Designated Individual in discharging its duties hereunder. Neither the Partnership  Representative nor the Designated Individual shall be liable to the Partnership, any Partner or any Affiliate thereof for any costs or losses to any persons, any diminution in value or any liability whatsoever arising as a result of the performance of its duties pursuant to this Section 10.4; provided, however, that the Partnership Representative may be so liable if it or the Designated Individual has engaged in (i) willful  breach of any provision of this Section 10.4 or (ii) fraud,  willful misconduct or gross negligence, in each case, with respect to its performance of its duties pursuant to this Section 10.4.  
Section 10.410.5    Withholding for Taxes, Etc. 
A.     Withholding. Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to withhold from such Limited Partner any amount of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, that the Partnership is, or may in the future be, required to withhold or pay with respect to any amount distributable, allocable or payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes required to be withheld or paid by the Partnership pursuant to Code Section 1441, Code Section 1442, Code Section 1445 or Code Section 1446. Amounts withheld by the General Partner may be estimated by the General Partner, in its sole discretion, based on its expectations of future transactions involving the Partnership that may give rise to taxes of such Limited Partner. The General Partner may withhold amounts for taxes (including estimated or projected taxes) from cash or other distributions otherwise payable to a Limited Partner, or from any REIT Shares or Cash Amount otherwise payable to a Limited Partner in connection with a Redemption. 
B.     Certain Tax Payments. Each Limited Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to pay on behalf of or with respect to such Limited Partner any amount of federal, state, local or foreign taxes that the General Partner determines, in its sole discretion, that the Partnership is required to pay with respect to any amount distributable, allocable or payable to such Limited Partner pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any taxes required to be paid by the Partnership pursuant to Code Section 1441, Code Section 1442, Code Section 1445 or Code Section 1446. Any amount paid on behalf of or with respect to a Limited Partner shall constitute a loan by the Partnership to such Limited Partner, which loan shall be repaid by such Limited Partner within fifteen (15) days after notice from the General Partner that such payment must be made unless (i) the Partnership withholds such payment from a distribution that would otherwise be made to the Limited Partner or (ii) the General Partner determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that such payment may be satisfied out of the Available Funds of the Partnership that would, but for such payment, be distributed to the Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to the Partnership a security interest in such Limited Partner's Partnership Interest to secure such Limited Partner's obligation to pay to the Partnership any amounts required to be paid pursuant to this Section 10.410.5B. In the event that a Limited Partner fails to pay any amounts owed to the Partnership pursuant to this Section 10.410.5B within fifteen (15) days after the notice from the General Partner specified above, then the General Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, either (x) elect to make the payment to the Partnership on behalf of such defaulting Limited Partner, and in such event shall be deemed to have loaned such amount to such defaulting Limited Partner and shall succeed to all rights and remedies of the Partnership as against such defaulting Limited Partner (including, without limitation, the right to receive distributions), or (y) cause the Partnership to redeem from such Limited Partner a number of Partnership Common Units (or fraction thereof) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the aggregate amount owed by such Limited Partner to the Partnership pursuant to this Section 10.410.5B, by (ii) the product of (1) the Adjustment Factor in effect as of date of redemption specified by the General Partner, and (2) the Value of a REIT Share (assuming for such purpose that the Valuation Date is the date of redemption specified by the General Partner). If the General Partner elects to cause the Partnership to redeem any Limited Partner's Partnership Common Units pursuant to clause (y) above, it shall promptly so notify such Limited Partner in writing of the date of such redemption and the number of Partnership Common Units so redeemed. Any amounts payable by a Limited Partner under this Section 10.410.5B shall bear interest at the base rate on corporate loans at large United States money center commercial banks, as published from time to time in the Wall Street Journal, plus four (4) percentage points (but not higher than the maximum lawful rate) from the date such amount is due (i.e., fifteen (15) days after demand) until such amount is paid in full. Each Limited Partner   shall take such actions as the Partnership or the General Partner shall request in order to perfect or enforce the security interest created hereunder, or to assist the Partnership in effecting any redemption of such Limited Partner's Partnership Common Units as specified in clause (y) above.

Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Article 11 (other than Section 11.6D hereof), the Partnership Interests of the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner may be Transferred, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, to or among the Previous General Partner, the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner, and any other Person that is, at the time of such Transfer, a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) with respect to the Previous General Partner. Any transferee of the entire General Partner Interest pursuant to this Section 11.1C shall automatically become, without further action or Consent of any Limited Partners, the sole general partner of the Partnership, subject to all the rights, privileges, duties and obligations under this Agreement and the Act relating to a general partner. Any transferee of a Limited Partner Interest pursuant to this Section 11.1C shall automatically become, without further action or Consent of any Limited Partners, a Substituted Limited Partner. Upon any Transfer permitted by this Section 11.1C, the transferor Partner shall be relieved of all its obligations under this Agreement. The provisions of Section 11.2B (other than the last sentence thereof), 11.3, 11.4A and 11.5 hereof shall not apply to any Transfer permitted by this Section 11.1C. 
Section 11.2    Transfer of General Partner's Partnership Interest. 
A.     The General Partner may not Transfer any of its General Partner Interest or withdraw from the Partnership except as provided in Sections 11.2B and 11.2C hereof. 
B.     The General Partner shall not withdraw from the Partnership and shall not Transfer all or any portion of its interest in the Partnership (whether by sale, disposition, statutory merger or consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) without the Consent of the Limited Partners, which Consent may be given or withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of the Limited Partners. Upon any Transfer of such a Partnership Interest pursuant to the Consent of the Limited Partners and otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.2B, the transferee shall become a successor General Partner for all purposes herein, and shall be vested with the powers and rights of the transferor General Partner, and shall be liable for all obligations and responsible for all duties of the General Partner, once such transferee has executed such instruments as may be necessary to effectuate such admission and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to be bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement with respect to the Partnership Interest so acquired. It is a condition to any Transfer otherwise permitted hereunder that the transferee assumes, by operation of law or express agreement, all of the obligations of the transferor General Partner under this Agreement with respect to such Transferred Partnership Interest, and such Transfer shall relieve the transferor General Partner of its obligations under this Agreement without the Consent of the Limited Partners. In the event that the General Partner withdraws from the Partnership, in violation of this Agreement or otherwise, or otherwise dissolves or terminates, or upon the bankruptcy of the General Partner, a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners may elect to continue the Partnership business by selecting a successor General Partner in accordance with the Act.  C.     The General Partner may merge with another entity if immediately after such merger substantially all of the assets of the surviving entity, other than the General Partner Interest held by the General Partner, are contributed to the Partnership as a Capital Contribution in exchange for Partnership Units. 
Section 11.3    Limited Partners' Rights to Transfer. 
A.     General. Prior to the end of the first Twelve-Month Period, no Limited Partner shall Transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any transferee without the Consent of the General Partner, which Consent may be withheld in its sole and absolute discretion; provided, however, that any Limited Partner may, at any time, without the consent of the General Partner, (i) Transfer all or part of its Partnership Interest to any Designated Party, any Family Member, any Controlled Entity or any Affiliate, provided that the transferee is, in any such case, a Qualified Transferee, or (ii) pledge (a "Pledge") all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to a lending institution, that is not an Affiliate of such Limited Partner, as collateral or security for a bona fide loan or other extension of credit, and Transfer such pledged Partnership Interest to such lending institution in connection with the exercise of remedies under such loan or extension or credit (any Transfer or Pledge permitted by this proviso is hereinafter referred to as a "Permitted Transfer"). After such first Twelve-Month Period, each Limited Partner, and each transferee of Partnership Units or Assignee pursuant to a Permitted Transfer, shall have the right to Transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest to any Person, subject to the provisions of Section 11.6 hereof and to satisfaction of each of the following conditions: 
(1)    General Partner Right of First Refusal. The transferring Partner shall give written notice of the proposed Transfer to the General Partner, which notice shall state (i) the identity of the proposed transferee and (ii) the amount and type of consideration proposed to be received for the Transferred Partnership Units. The General Partner shall have ten (10) Business Days upon which to give the Transferring Partner notice of its election to acquire the Partnership Units on the proposed terms. If it so elects, it shall purchase the Partnership Units on such terms within ten (10) Business Days after giving notice of such election; provided, however, that in the event that the proposed terms involve a purchase for cash, the General Partner may at its election deliver in lieu of all or any portion of such cash a note payable to the Transferring Partner at a date as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event later than one hundred eighty (180) days after such purchase, and bearing interest at an annual rate equal to the total dividends declared with respect to one (1) REIT Share for the four (4) preceding fiscal quarters of the General Partner, divided by the Value as of the closing of such purchase; provided, further, that such closing may be deferred to the extent necessary to effect compliance with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, if applicable, and any other applicable requirements of law. If it does not so elect, the Transferring Partner may Transfer such Partnership Units to a third party, on terms no more favorable to the transferee than the proposed terms, subject to the other conditions of this Section 11.3. 
(2)    Qualified Transferee. Any Transfer of a Partnership Interest shall be made only to a single Qualified Transferee; provided, however, that, for such purposes, all Qualified Transferees that are Affiliates, or that comprise investment accounts or funds managed by a single Qualified Transferee and its Affiliates, shall be considered together to be a single Qualified Transferee; provided, further, that each Transfer meeting the minimum Transfer restriction of Section 11.3A(3) hereof may be to a separate Qualified Transferee. 
(3)    Minimum Transfer Restriction. Any Transferring Partner must Transfer not less than the lesser of (i) the greater of five hundred (500) Partnership Units or one-third (1/3) of the number of Partnership Units owned by such Partner as of the Effective Date or (ii) all of the remaining Partnership Units owned by such Transferring Partner; provided, however, that, for purposes of determining compliance with the foregoing restriction, all Partnership Units owned by Affiliates of a Limited Partner shall be considered to be owned by such Limited Partner. 
(4)    Transferee Agreement to Effect a Redemption. Any proposed transferee shall deliver to the General Partner a written agreement reasonably satisfactory to the General Partner to the effect that the transferee will, within six (6) months after consummation of a Partnership Common Units Transfer, tender   its Partnership Common Units for Redemption in accordance with the terms of the Redemption rights provided in Section 8.6 hereof. 
(5)    No Further Transfers. The transferee (other than a Designated Party) shall not be permitted to effect any further Transfer of the Partnership Units, other than to the General Partner. 
(6)    Exception for Permitted Transfers. The conditions of Sections 11.3A(1) through 11.3A(5) hereof shall not apply in the case of a Permitted Transfer. 
It is a condition to any Transfer otherwise permitted hereunder (whether or not such Transfer is effected during or after the first Twelve-Month Period) that the transferee assumes by operation of law or express agreement all of the obligations of the transferor Limited Partner under this Agreement with respect to such Transferred Partnership Interest, and no such Transfer (other than pursuant to a statutory merger or consolidation wherein all obligations and liabilities of the transferor Partner are assumed by a successor corporation by operation of law) shall relieve the transferor Partner of its obligations under this Agreement without the approval of the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transferee of any Transferred Partnership Interest shall be subject to any and all ownership limitations (including, without limitation, the Ownership Limit) contained in the Charter that may limit or restrict such transferee's ability to exercise its Redemption rights, including, without limitation, the Ownership Limit. Any transferee, whether or not admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, shall take subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder. Unless admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, no transferee, whether by a voluntary Transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, shall have any rights hereunder, other than the rights of an Assignee as provided in Section 11.5 hereof. 
B.     Incapacity. If a Limited Partner is subject to Incapacity, the executor, administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or receiver of such Limited Partner's estate shall have all the rights of a Limited Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners, for the purpose of settling or managing the estate, and such power as the Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to Transfer all or any part of its interest in the Partnership. The Incapacity of a Limited Partner, in and of itself, shall not dissolve or terminate the Partnership. 
C.     Opinion of Counsel. In connection with any Transfer of a Limited Partner Interest, the General Partner shall have the right to receive an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to it to the effect that the proposed Transfer may be effected without registration under the Securities Act and will not otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Interests Transferred. If, in the opinion of such counsel, such Transfer would require the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act or would otherwise violate any federal or state securities laws or regulations applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Units, the General Partner may prohibit any Transfer otherwise permitted under this Section 11.3 by a Limited Partner of Partnership Interests. 
D.     Adverse Tax Consequences. No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Interests (including any Redemption, any other acquisition of Partnership Units by the General Partner or any acquisition of Partnership Units by the Partnership) may be made to any person if (i) in the opinion of legal counsel for the Partnership, it would result in the Partnership being treated as an association taxable as a corporation, or (ii) such Transfer is effectuated through an "established securities market" or a "secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof)" within the meaning of Code Section 7704.Upon any Transfer by a Limited Partner of its Partnership Interests, such Limited Partner shall (a) provide the Partnership and the transferee receiving such an interest an affidavit satisfying the requirements of Section 1446(f)(2) of the Code stating, under penalty of perjury, (i) the  transferor Limited Partner's  United States taxpayer identification number and (ii) that  such Limited Partner is not a "foreign  person" within  the meaning of Code Section 1446,  and (b) provide  the Partnership with such other information and assistance as the Partnership may request to ensure that the Company is not subject to withholding under Section 1446  of the Code.  Section 11.4    Substituted Limited Partners. 
A.     No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute a transferee (including any Designated Party or other transferees pursuant to Transfers permitted by Section 11.3 hereof) as a Limited Partner in its place. A transferee (including, but not limited to, any Designated Party) of the interest of a Limited Partner may be admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner only with the Consent of the General Partner, which Consent may be given or withheld by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion. The failure or refusal by the General Partner to permit a transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted Limited Partner shall not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership or the General Partner. Subject to the foregoing, an Assignee shall not be admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner until and unless it furnishes to the General Partner (i) evidence of acceptance, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, of all the terms, conditions and applicable obligations of this Agreement, (ii) a counterpart signature page to this Agreement executed by such Assignee and (iii) such other documents and instruments as may be required or advisable, in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner, to effect such Assignee's admission as a Substituted Limited Partner. 
B.     A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner in accordance with this Article 11 shall have all the rights and powers and be subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under this Agreement. 
C.     Upon the admission of a Substituted Limited Partner, the General Partner shall amend Exhibit A to reflect the name, address and number of Partnership Units of such Substituted Limited Partner and to eliminate or adjust, if necessary, the name, address and number of Partnership Units of the predecessor of such Substituted Limited Partner. 
Section 11.5    Assignees. If the General Partner, in its sole and absolute discretion, does not consent to the admission of any permitted transferee under Section 11.3 hereof as a Substituted Limited Partner, as described in Section 11.4 hereof, such transferee shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this Agreement. An Assignee shall be entitled to all the rights of an assignee of a limited partnership interest under the Act, including the right to receive distributions from the Partnership and the share of Net Income, Net Losses and other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the Partnership attributable to the Partnership Units assigned to such transferee and the rights to Transfer the Partnership Units provided in this Article 11, but shall not be deemed to be a holder of Partnership Units for any other purpose under this Agreement (other than as expressly provided in Section 8.6 hereof with respect to a Qualifying Party that becomes a Tendering Party), and shall not be entitled to effect a Consent or vote with respect to such Partnership Units on any matter presented to the Limited Partners for approval (such right to Consent or vote, to the extent provided in this Agreement or under the Act, fully remaining with the transferor Limited Partner). In the event that any such transferee desires to make a further assignment of any such Partnership Units, such transferee shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article 11 to the same extent and in the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to make an assignment of Partnership Units. 
Section 11.6    General Provisions. 
A.     No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than as a result of a permitted Transfer of all of such Limited Partner's Partnership Units in accordance with this Article 11, with respect to which the transferee becomes a Substituted Limited Partner, or pursuant to a redemption (or acquisition by the Previous General Partner) of all of its Partnership Units pursuant to a Redemption under Section 8.6 hereof and/or pursuant to any Partnership Unit Designation. 
B.     Any Limited Partner who shall Transfer all of its Partnership Units in a Transfer (i) permitted pursuant to this Article 11 where such transferee was admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, (ii) pursuant to the exercise of its rights to effect a redemption of all of its Partnership Units pursuant to a Redemption under Section 8.6 hereof and/or pursuant to any Partnership Unit Designation or (iii) to the Previous General Partner or the General Partner, whether or not pursuant to Section 8.6B hereof, shall cease to be a Limited Partner.  C.     If any Partnership Unit is Transferred in compliance with the provisions of this Article 11, or is redeemed by the Partnership, or acquired by the Previous General Partner pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof, on any day other than the first day of a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net LossesLoss, each item thereof and all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to such Partnership Unit for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the transferor Partner or the Tendering Party, as the case may be, and, in the case of a Transfer or assignment other than a Redemption, to the transferee Partner (including, without limitation, the General Partner and the Special Limited Partner as transferees of the Previous General Partner in the case of an acquisition of Partnership Common Units pursuant to Section 8.6 hereof), by taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code Section 706(d), using the "interim closing of the books" method or another permissible method selected by the General Partner. Solely for purposes of making such allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which a Transfer occurs shall be allocated to the transferee Partner and none of such items for the calendar month in which a Transfer or a Redemption occurs shall be allocated to the transferor Partner or the Tendering Party, as the case may be, if such Transfer occurs on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the month, otherwise such items shall be allocated to the transferor. All distributions of Available Cash attributable to such Partnership Unit with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such Transfer, assignment or Redemption shall be made to the transferor Partner or the Tendering Party, as the case may be, and, in the case of a Transfer other than a Redemption, all distributions of Available Cash thereafter attributable to such Partnership Unit shall be made to the transferee Partner. 
D.     In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer herein contained, in no event may any Transfer or assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner (including any Redemption, any acquisition of Partnership Units by the Previous General Partner or any other acquisition of Partnership Units by the Partnership) be made (i) to any person or entity who lacks the legal right, power or capacity to own a Partnership Interest; (ii) in violation of applicable law; (iii) of any component portion of a Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions, separate and apart from all other components of a Partnership Interest; (iv) in the event that such Transfer would cause either (a) the Previous General Partner to cease to comply with the REIT Requirements or (b) the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner to cease to qualify as a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2); (v) if such Transfer would, in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership or the General Partner, cause a termination of the Partnership for federal or state income tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption (or acquisition by the Previous General Partner) of all Partnership Common Units held by all Limited Partners other than the Special Limited Partner); (vi) if such Transfer would, in the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership, cause the Partnership to cease to be classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes (except as a result of the Redemption (or acquisition by the Previous General Partner) of all Partnership Common Units held by all Limited Partners other than the Special Limited Partner); (vii) if such Transfer would cause the Partnership to become, with respect to any employee benefit plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined in ERISA Section 3(14)) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Code Section 4975(c)); (viii) if such Transfer would, in the opinion of legal counsel to the Partnership, cause any portion of the assets of the Partnership to constitute assets of any employee benefit plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section 2510.2-101; (ix) if such Transfer requires the registration of such Partnership Interest pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities laws; (x) if such Transfer causes the Partnership to become a "publicly traded partnership," as such term is defined in Code Section 469(k)(2) or Code 7704(b); or (xi) if such Transfer subjects the Partnership to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or ERISA, each as amended. 
ARTICLE 12 
ADMISSION OF PARTNERS 
Section 12.1    Admission of Successor General Partner. A successor to all of the General Partner's General Partner Interest pursuant to Section 11.2 hereof who is proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner shall be admitted to the Partnership as the General Partner, effective immediately prior to such Transfer. Any such successor shall carry on the business of the Partnership without dissolution. In each case, the admission   shall be subject to the successor General Partner executing and delivering to the Partnership an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and such other documents or instruments as may be required to effect the admission. 
Section 12.2    Admission of Additional Limited Partners. 
A.     After the admission to the Partnership of an Original Limited Partner on the date hereof, a Person (other than an existing Partner) who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the General Partner (i) evidence of acceptance, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the power of attorney granted in Section 2.4 hereof, (ii) a counterpart signature page to this Agreement executed by such Person and (iii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner in order to effect such Person's admission as an Additional Limited Partner. 
B.     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.2, no Person shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion. The admission of any Person as an Additional Limited Partner shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such Person is recorded on the books and records of the Partnership, following the consent of the General Partner to such admission. 
C.     If any Additional Limited Partner is admitted to the Partnership on any day other than the first day of a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item thereof and all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit allocable among Partners and Assignees for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated among such Additional Limited Partner and all other Partners and Assignees by taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code Section 706(d), using the "interim closing of the books" method or another permissible method selected by the General Partner. Solely for purposes of making such allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which an admission of any Additional Limited Partner occurs shall be allocated among all the Partners and Assignees including such Additional Limited Partner, in accordance with the principles described in Section 11.6C hereof. All distributions of Available Cash with respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such admission shall be made solely to Partners and Assignees other than the Additional Limited Partner, and all distributions of Available Cash thereafter shall be made to all the Partners and Assignees including such Additional Limited Partner. 
Section 12.3    Amendment of Agreement and Certificate of Limited Partnership. For the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall take all steps necessary and appropriate under the Act to amend the records of the Partnership and, if necessary, to prepare as soon as practical an amendment of this Agreement (including an amendment of Exhibit A) and, if required by law, shall prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate and may for this purpose exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant to Section 2.4 hereof. 
Section 12.4    Admission of Initial Limited Partners. The Persons listed on Exhibit A as limited partners of the Partnership shall be admitted to the Partnership as Limited Partners upon their execution and delivery of this Agreement. 
ARTICLE 13 
DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION 
Section 13.1    Dissolution. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of Substituted Limited Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission of a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon the withdrawal of the General Partner, any successor General Partner shall continue the business of the Partnership without dissolution. However, the Partnership shall   dissolve, and its affairs shall be wound up, upon the first to occur of any of the following (each a "Liquidating Event"): 
A.     the expiration of its term as provided in Section 2.5 hereof; 
B.     an event of withdrawal, as defined in the Act (including, without limitation, bankruptcy), of the sole General Partner unless, within ninety (90) days after the withdrawal, a "majority in interest" (as such phrase is used in Section 17-801(3) of the Act) of the remaining Partners agree in writing, in their sole and absolute discretion, to continue the business of the Partnership and to the appointment, effective as of the date of withdrawal, of a successor General Partner: 
C.     an election to dissolve the Partnership made by the General Partner in its sole and absolute discretion, with or without the Consent of the Limited Partners; 
D.     entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to the provisions of the Act; 
E.     the occurrence of a Terminating Capital Transaction; 
F.     the Redemption (or acquisition by the Previous General Partner, the General Partner and/or the Special Limited Partner) of all Partnership Common Units other than Partnership Common Units held by the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner; or 
G.     the Redemption (or acquisition by the General Partner) of all Partnership Common Units other than Partnership Common Units held by the General Partner. 
Section 13.2    Winding Up. 
A.     Upon the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, the Partnership shall continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner, liquidating its assets and satisfying the claims of its creditors and Partners. After the occurrence of a Liquidating Event, no Partner shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not necessary to or appropriate for, the winding up of the Partnership's business and affairs. The General Partner (or, in the event that there is no remaining General Partner or the General Partner has dissolved, become bankrupt within the meaning of the Act or ceased to operate, any Person elected by a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners (the General Partner or such other Person being referred to herein as the "Liquidator")) shall be responsible for overseeing the winding up and dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of the Partnership's liabilities and property, and the Partnership property shall be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value thereof, and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by the General Partner, include shares of stock in the Previous General Partner) shall be applied and distributed in the following order: 
(1)    First, to the satisfaction of all of the Partnership's debts and liabilities to creditors other than the Partners and their Assignees (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof); 
(2)    Second, to the satisfaction of all of the Partnership's debts and liabilities to the General Partner (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof), including, but not limited to, amounts due as reimbursements under Section 7.4 hereof; 
(3)    Third, to the satisfaction of all of the Partnership's debts and liabilities to the other Partners and any Assignees (whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof); and 
(4)    Subject to the terms of any Partnership Unit Designation, the balance, if any, to the General Partner, the Limited Partners and any Assignees in accordance with and in proportion to their positive Capital Account balances, after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all periods.  The General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any services performed pursuant to this Article 13. 
B.     Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 13.2A hereof that require liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the Partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Partners as creditors) and/or distribute to the Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in common and in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.2A hereof, undivided interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation. Any such distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best interest of the Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt. 
C.     In the event that the Partnership is "liquidated" within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made pursuant to this Article 13 to the Partners and Assignees that have positive Capital Accounts in compliance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2) to the extent of, and in proportion to, positive Capital Account balances. If any Partner has a deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all contributions, distributions and allocations for all taxable years, including the year during which such liquidation occurs), such Partner shall have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Partnership with respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed to the Partnership or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever. In the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator, a pro rata portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the Partners pursuant to this Article 13 may be withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of any installment obligations owed to the Partnership, provided that such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be distributed to the General Partner and Limited Partners in the manner and order of priority set forth in Section 13.2A hereof as soon as practicable. 
Section 13.3    Deemed Distribution and Recontribution. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 13, in the event that the Partnership is liquidated within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), but no Liquidating Event has occurred, the Partnership's Property shall not be liquidated, the Partnership's liabilities shall not be paid or discharged and the Partnership's affairs shall not be wound up. Instead, for federal income tax purposes the Partnership shall be deemed to have distributed the Property in kind to the Partners and the Assignees, who shall be deemed to have assumed and taken such Property subject to all Partnership liabilities, all in accordance with their respective Capital Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Partners and the Assignees shall be deemed to have recontributed the Partnership Property in kind to the Partnership, which shall be deemed to have assumed and taken such Property subject to all such liabilities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 13.3 shall be deemed to have constituted any Assignee as a Substituted Limited Partner without compliance with the provisions of Section 11.4 hereof. 
Section 13.4    Rights of Limited Partners. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) each Limited Partner shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership for the return of its Capital Contribution, (b) no Limited Partner shall have the right or power to demand or receive property other than cash from the Partnership and (c) no Limited Partner shall have priority over any other Limited Partner as to the return of its Capital Contributions, distributions or allocations. 
Section 13.5    Notice of Dissolution. In the event that a Liquidating Event occurs or an event occurs that would, but for an election or objection by one or more Partners pursuant to Section 13.1 hereof, result in a dissolution of the Partnership, the General Partner shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter, provide written notice thereof to each of the Partners and, in the General Partner's sole and absolute discretion or as required by the Act,   to all other parties with whom the Partnership regularly conducts business (as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner), and the General Partner may, or, if required by the Act, shall, publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in each place in which the Partnership regularly conducts business (as determined in the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner). 
Section 13.6    Cancellation of Certificate of Limited Partnership. Upon the completion of the liquidation of the Partnership cash and property as provided in Section 13.2 hereof, the Partnership shall be terminated, a certificate of cancellation shall be filed with the State of Delaware, all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership or association in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be cancelled, and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken. 
Section 13.7    Reasonable Time for Winding-Up. A reasonable time shall be allowed for the orderly winding-up of the business and affairs of the Partnership and the liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 13.2 hereof, in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding-up, and the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect between the Partners during the period of liquidation.

For purposes of obtaining a written consent, the General Partner may require a response within a reasonable specified time, but not less than fifteen (15) days, and failure to respond in such time period shall constitute a consent that is consistent with the General Partner's recommendation with respect to the proposal; provided, however, that an action shall become effective at such time as requisite consents are received even if prior to such specified time. 
Section 14.3    Meetings of the Partners. 
A.     Meetings of the Partners may be called by the General Partner and shall be called upon the receipt by the General Partner of a written request by a Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners. The call shall state the nature of the business to be transacted. Notice of any such meeting shall be given to all Partners not less than seven (7) days nor more than thirty (30) days prior to the date of such meeting. Partners may vote in person or by proxy at such meeting. Whenever the vote or Consent of Partners is permitted or required under this Agreement, such vote or Consent may be given at a meeting of Partners or may be given in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Section 14.3B hereof. 
B.     Any action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the Partners may be taken without a meeting if a written consent setting forth the action so taken is signed by a majority of the Percentage Interests of the Partners (or such other percentage as is expressly required by this Agreement for the action in question). Such consent may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall have the same force and effect as a vote of a majority of the Percentage Interests of the Partners (or such other percentage as is expressly required by this Agreement). Such consent shall be filed with the General Partner. An action so taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on the effective date so certified.  C.     Each Limited Partner may authorize any Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Limited Partner is entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or participating at a meeting. Every proxy must be signed by the Limited Partner or its attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy (or there is receipt of a proxy authorizing a later date). Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the Limited Partner executing it, such revocation to be effective upon the Partnership's receipt of written notice of such revocation from the Limited Partner executing such proxy. 
D.     Each meeting of Partners shall be conducted by the General Partner or such other Person as the General Partner may appoint pursuant to such rules for the conduct of the meeting as the General Partner or such other Person deems appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. Without limitation, meetings of Partners may be conducted in the same manner as meetings of the General Partner's shareholders and may be held at the same time as, and as part of, the meetings of the General Partner's shareholders.

Section 15.11    Limitation to Preserve REIT Status. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, to the extent that the amount paid, credited, distributed or reimbursed by the Partnership to any REIT Partner or its officers, directors, employees or agents, whether as a reimbursement, fee, expense or indemnity (a "REIT Payment"), would constitute gross income to the REIT Partner (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified REIT subsidiary" (within the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2)) of a REIT, to such REIT) for purposes of Code Section 856(c)(2) or Code Section 856(c)(3), then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the amount of such REIT Payments, as selected by the General Partner in its discretion from among items of potential distribution, reimbursement, fees, expenses and indemnities, shall be reduced for any Fiscal Year so that the REIT Payments, as so reduced, for or with respect to such REIT Partner shall not exceed the lesser of: 
(1)    an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) four and nine-tenths percent (4.9%) of the REIT Partner's (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, such REIT's)  total gross income (but excluding the amount of any REIT Payments) for the Fiscal Year that is described in subsections (A) through (H) of Code Section 856(c)(2) over (b) the amount of gross income (within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(2)) derived by the REIT Partner (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, by such REIT) from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (H) of Code Section 856(c)(2) (but not including the amount of any REIT Payments); or 
(2)    an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (a) twenty-four percent (24%) of the REIT Partner's (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, such REIT's)  total gross income (but excluding the amount of any REIT Payments) for the Fiscal Year that is described in subsections (A) through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(3) over (b) the amount of gross income (within the meaning of Code Section 856(c)(3)) derived by the REIT Partner (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, by such REIT) from sources other than those described in subsections (A) through (I) of Code Section 856(c)(3) (but not including the amount of any REIT Payments);  provided, however, that REIT Payments in excess of the amounts set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above may be made if the General Partner, as a condition precedent, obtains an opinion of tax counsel that the receipt of such excess amounts shall not adversely affect the REIT Partner's (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, such REIT's)  ability to qualify as a REIT. To the extent that REIT Payments may not be made in a Fiscal Year as a consequence of the limitations set forth in this Section 15.11, such REIT Payments shall carry over and shall be treated as arising in the following Fiscal Year. The purpose of the limitations contained in this Section 15.11 is to prevent any REIT Partner (or, if the REIT Partner is a "qualified  REIT subsidiary" (within  the meaning of Code Section 856(i)(2))  of a REIT, such REIT) from failing to qualify as a REIT under the Code by reason of such REIT Partner's share of items, including distributions, reimbursements, fees, expenses or indemnities, receivable directly or indirectly from the Partnership, and this Section 15.11 shall be interpreted and applied to effectuate such purpose. 
Section 15.12    No Partition. No Partner nor any successor-in-interest to a Partner shall have the right while this Agreement remains in effect to have any property of the Partnership partitioned, or to file a complaint or institute any proceeding at law or in equity to have such property of the Partnership partitioned, and each Partner, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns hereby waives any such right. It is the intention of the Partners that the rights of the parties hereto and their successors-in-interest to Partnership property, as among themselves, shall be governed by the terms of this Agreement, and that the rights of the Partners and their successors-in-interest shall be subject to the limitations and restrictions as set forth in this Agreement. 
Section 15.13    No Third-Party Rights Created Hereby. The provisions of this Agreement are solely for the purpose of defining the interests of the Partners, inter se; and no other person, firm or entity (i.e., a party who is not a signatory hereto or a permitted successor to such signatory hereto) shall have any right, power, title or interest by way of subrogation or otherwise, in and to the rights, powers, title and provisions of this Agreement. No creditor or other third party having dealings with the Partnership shall have the right to enforce the right or obligation of any Partner to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership or to pursue any other right or remedy hereunder or at law or in equity. None of the rights or obligations of the Partners herein set forth to make Capital Contributions or loans to the Partnership shall be deemed an asset of the Partnership for any purpose by any creditor or other third party, nor may any such rights or obligations be sold, transferred or assigned by the Partnership or pledged or encumbered by the Partnership to secure any debt or other obligation of the Partnership or any of the Partners.
