PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
To be held on Thursday, March 14, 2019 
General Information Concerning Solicitation and Voting 
The enclosed Proxy is solicited on behalf of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company" or "Arrowhead") for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Thursday, March 14, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Pacific time, and at any adjournment(s) thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice"). This year's meeting will be a completely "virtual" meeting of stockholders. You can attend the Annual Meeting online, vote your shares electronically, and submit your questions during the Annual Meeting, by visiting www.virtualshareholdermeeting.com/ARWR2019. You will need to have your 16-digit Control Number included on your Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability") or your proxy card (if you received a printed copy of the proxy materials) to join the Annual Meeting. 
The Company anticipates that the Notice of Internet Availability in connection with these proxy solicitation materials will first be mailed on or about February 1, 2019 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and we will post our proxy materials on the website referenced in the Notice of Internet Availability. As more fully described in the Notice of Internet Availability, all stockholders may choose to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice of Internet Availability or may request to receive a printed set of our proxy materials. 
Record Date 
Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on January 23, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, the Company had outstanding 94,200,893 shares of common stock ("Common Stock"). 
Revocability of Proxies 
Any proxy given by a stockholder of record pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before its use by delivering to the Secretary of the Company, at or before the taking of the vote at the Annual Meeting, a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Stockholders may also revoke their proxy by entering a new vote over the Internet or by telephone. 
Voting and Solicitation 
Each share of the Company's Common Stock is entitled to one vote on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder may appoint only one proxy holder or representative to attend the Annual Meeting on his or her behalf. Stockholders do not have the right to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Shares of Common Stock represented by properly executed proxies will, unless such proxies have been previously revoked, be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. In the absence of specific instructions to the contrary, properly executed proxies will be voted FOR the Proposals 1, 2 and 4 and "1 Year" on Proposal 3 and submitted to a vote of stockholders at the Annual Meeting pursuant to this proxy statement. No business other than that set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected to come before the Annual Meeting. Should any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders properly arise, the persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote such proxy in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors (the "Board"). 
If you will not be able to attend the Annual Meeting to vote in person, you may vote your shares via the Internet or by telephone or by mail as set forth in the Notice. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    General Information Concerning Solicitation and Voting 
The Company has engaged a proxy solicitor, Alliance Advisors, LLC, to encourage voting by our stockholders. It is estimated that the total cost for the solicitation campaign will be approximately $10,000. Proxies may also be solicited by certain of the directors, officers and employees of the Company, without additional compensation. The Company will bear the costs of solicitation. In addition, the Company expects to reimburse brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of shares for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. 
If your shares are held in street name, the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany this proxy statement will tell you how to use the Internet or telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account. If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail. 
Quorum; Abstentions; Broker Non-Votes 
The required quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting is a majority of the votes eligible to be cast by holders of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date. Shares that are voted "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" on a matter are treated as being present at the meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum with respect to such matter. For certain proposals, brokers may not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter if they have not received specific instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares ("broker non-votes"). In accordance with the rules of Nasdaq, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees who hold Arrowhead shares in street name for their customers have authority to vote on "routine" proposals when they have not received instructions from beneficial owners. However, banks, brokerage firms and other nominees are precluded from exercising their voting discretion with respect to non-routine matters. Shares subject to a broker non-vote will be counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting; the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes on the proposals presented herein is discussed below. 
With regard to the election of directors, votes may be cast in favor of a director nominee or withheld. Because directors are elected by plurality, abstentions from voting and broker non-votes will be entirely excluded from the vote and will have no effect on its outcome. If a quorum is present at the meeting, the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes, up to five directors, will be elected. Because Proposal Nos. 2, 3 and 4 must be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting (the "Required Vote"), abstentions will be counted in tabulations of the votes cast on each such proposal and will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal, whereas broker non-votes will be excluded from the vote and will have no effect on its outcome. 
Deadline for Receipt of Stockholder Proposals 
Any stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), who intends to present a proposal at the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must ensure that the proposal is received by the Corporate Secretary at Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 225 South Lake Avenue, Suite 1050, Pasadena, CA 91101, not later than October 4, 2019, in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for that meeting; provided, however, that if the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held before February 13, 2020 or after April 13, 2020, you must provide specified information to us a reasonable time before we begin to print and send our proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting. Proposals received after the specified dates may be excluded from the Company's proxy statement. 
Additionally, our Bylaws provide for notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a director or to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. To be considered timely under these provisions, the stockholder's notice must be received by the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above between 90 and 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting; provided, however, that if the 2020 Annual Meeting date is advanced by more than 30 days before or delayed by more than 60 days after the anniversary date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, then stockholders must provide notice within time periods specified in our Bylaws. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Proposal One — Election of Directors 
Proposal One — Election of Directors 
The Board has nominated the following five persons as directors to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting and until their successors have been duly elected.

Corporate Governance Policies and Practices 
The following is a summary of our corporate governance policies and practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are separated, which allows our Chief Executive Officer  to focus on strategic planning and execution as well as our day-to-day business operations, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead the Board in its fundamental  role of providing advice to and oversight of management. While our Bylaws do not require that our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our Board believes that having separate positions is the appropriate leadership structure  for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of the members of the Board are independent directors, as defined by Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Board has  determined that all of the Company's directors are independent, except Dr. Anzalone, due to his employment relationship with the Company, and Dr. Given, who is the brother of Bruce Given, the Company's Chief Operating Officer. Non-employee directors do not receive consulting or other fees from the Company, other than Board and Committee compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board has appointed an independent Lead Director. The Lead Director is tasked with assuring that the Board committees  and other relevant issues have independent leadership.

Risk management includes not only understanding company-specific risks and the steps  management implements to manage those risks, but also what level of risk is acceptable and appropriate for the Company. Management is responsible for establishing our business strategy, identifying and assessing the related risks and implementing  appropriate risk management practices. The Board regularly reviews our business strategy and management's assessment of the related risk and discusses with management the appropriate level of risk for the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All the Company's employees, officers and directors are subject to the Company's Code of Business Conduct and  Ethics Policy, which is available on the Company's website at www.arrowheadpharma.com. The ethics policy meets the requirements of Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, as well as the code of ethics requirements of the SEC.

[END TABLE]
Board Meetings and Committees 
The Board held a total of nine meetings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Board has three standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating Committee. 
The functions of the Audit Committee are to select independent public accountants, to review the scope and results of the year-end audit with management and the independent auditors, to review the Company's accounting principles and its system of internal accounting controls, to review the Company's annual and quarterly reports before filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to review any related-party transactions. The Audit Committee met four times during fiscal 2018. The current members of the Audit Committee are William Waddill, Chairman, Mauro Ferrari, and Michael S. Perry. The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee who served during 2018 were independent directors under the rules of the SEC and the listing standards of Nasdaq Marketplace Rules and are financially literate. The Board has determined that Mr. Waddill is an "audit committee financial expert" in accordance with the applicable regulations, based on his experience as noted above. The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at www.arrowheadpharma.com. 
The functions of the Compensation Committee are to review the goals and achievements of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer for the prior year and approve the goals of the Company and the Chief Executive Officer for the next year, to review and approve salaries, bonuses, equity awards and other benefits payable to the Company's executive officers and to administer the Company's 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 2013 Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee is specifically responsible for determining the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee reviews compensation recommendations made by the Chief Executive Officer for other senior executives of the Company and the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer at least annually; the Chief Executive Officer is not present during discussions or deliberations regarding his compensation. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Compensia, Inc., a compensation consulting firm, to provide advice and guidance with regard to compensation for our named executive officers. The decision to engage the consultant was not made or recommended by management and the Compensation Committee has the sole discretion to engage or change the consultant. The Compensation Committee met three times during fiscal 2018. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Michael S. Perry, Chairman, Mauro Ferrari and William Waddill. The Board has determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are independent 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Proposal One — Election of Directors directors under the listing rules of Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. The Compensation Committee's charter is available on the Company's website at www.arrowheadpharma.com. The Compensation Committee has not delegated any of its responsibilities or authorities granted under its charter. 
The Nominating Committee is responsible for proposing a slate of directors for election by the stockholders at each Annual Stockholders Meeting and for proposing candidates to fill any vacancies. The Nominating Committee met twice during fiscal 2018. The current members of the Nominating Committee are Michael S. Perry, Chairman, Mauro Ferrari and William Waddill. The Nominating Committee's charter is available on the Company's website at www.arrowheadpharma.com. The Nominating Committee manages the process for evaluating current Board members at the time they are considered for re-nomination. After considering the appropriate skills and characteristics required on the Board, the current makeup of the Board, the results of the evaluations and the wishes of the Board members to be re-nominated, the Nominating Committee recommends to the Board whether those individuals should be re-nominated. 
On at least an annual basis, the Nominating Committee reviews with the Board whether it believes the Board would benefit from adding new members and, if so, the appropriate skills and characteristics required for any new members. If the Board determines that a new member would be beneficial, the Nominating Committee solicits and receives recommendations for candidates and manages the process for evaluating candidates. All potential candidates, regardless of their source, are reviewed under the same process. The Nominating Committee (or its chairman) screens the available information about the potential candidate(s). Based on the results of the initial screening, interviews with candidates are scheduled with Nominating Committee members, other members of the Board and senior members of management. Upon completion of these interviews and other due diligence, the Nominating Committee may nominate a candidate to the Board for election. 
Candidates for independent Board member positions are identified through recommendations from directors or others associated with the Company, as well as through a formal search process managed by an executive recruiter. Arrowhead stockholders may also recommend candidates by sending the candidate's name and resume to the Nominating Committee pursuant to the procedures, set forth above, for communication with the Board. As described above, our Bylaws also provide for separate notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a director to be considered by stockholders at a meeting, including requirements as to the timing, form and content of a stockholder's notice. 
The Nominating Committee has no predefined minimum criteria for selecting Board nominees, although it believes that all directors should share qualities such as governance and business experience at the corporate level, relevant non-competitive experience and strong communication and analytical skills. Independent directors must meet the criteria for independence set forth by Nasdaq and the SEC. In any given search, the Nominating Committee may also define particular characteristics for candidates to balance the overall skills and characteristics of the Board and the needs of the Company. During any search, the Nominating Committee reserves the right to modify its stated search criteria for exceptional candidates. 
As part of the Nominating Committee's goal of building a diverse board, the Nominating Committee is committed to actively seeking out highly qualified diverse candidates (including women and minority candidates) to include in the pool from which Board nominees are chosen. The Nominating Committee assesses its effectiveness in achieving this goal as part of its annual assessment of the composition of the Board. 
In 2018, the Board established an ad hoc Science Committee to review and advise on science topics of interest to the Company. The committee is chaired by Dr. Mauro Ferrari and Dr. Given and Dr. Perry serve as members of the committee. 
No incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board held during fiscal 2018, and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board during fiscal 2018 on which such person served. 
In addition, two of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. It is the Company's policy to encourage, but not require, that all directors attend our annual stockholder meetings. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Director Compensation 
Director Compensation 
Directors who are also employees of the Company receive no separate compensation from the Company for their service as members of the Board. For 2019, the Company modified the structure of director compensation to provide a base retainer for each director with higher base retainers for service by the Chairman of the Board and the Lead Independent Director. The Company provides additional retainers for committee service with higher retainers for committee leadership. In prior years, director compensation consisted of a base retainer only with no allocation for committee services. The Compensation Committee made the change to further align compensation according to specific leadership and committee service contributions by each director. Year over year, total director compensation increased modestly in 2019 to reflect the increased demands and complexity as the Company adds to and advances our pipeline. 
The below table sets forth compensation levels for each of our outside directors for calendar 2018 and 2019.

Proposal Two — Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation 
The compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") is described below in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis of this proxy statement for the year ended September 30, 2018. The Board is asking stockholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, as set forth in the compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
Although the vote we are asking you to cast is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board value the views of our stockholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining future compensation arrangements for our named executive officers. 
The Board has adopted a policy providing for annual advisory votes to approve executive compensation. Unless the Board modifies its policy on the frequency of holding advisory votes to approve executive compensation, the next such advisory vote will occur in 2020. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board 
Proposal Two must be approved by the Required Vote, assuming a quorum is present. For this purpose, abstentions will be counted as a vote against the proposal, while broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Proposal Three — Advisory Vote on Frequency of Executive Compensation Advisory Votes 
Proposal Three — Advisory Vote on Frequency of Executive Compensation Advisory Votes 
In Proposal 2, we are asking stockholders to cast an advisory vote to approve the compensation disclosed in this proxy statement that we paid in fiscal 2018 to our named executive officers. This advisory vote is referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote. In this Proposal 3, the Board is asking stockholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote on how frequently we should have say-on-pay votes in the future. Stockholders will be able to mark the enclosed proxy card or voting instruction form on whether to hold say-on-pay votes every one, two or three years. Alternatively, you may indicate that you are abstaining from voting. 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company recommend, in a non-binding vote, whether an advisory vote to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers should occur every one, two or three years." 
This vote, like the say-on-pay vote itself, is not binding on the Board. Although the Board and the Compensation Committee recognize the potential benefits of having less frequent advisory votes to approve executive compensation (including allowing the Company additional time to effectively evaluate the relationship between the executive compensation and long-term Company performance and stockholder return), we recognize that the widely adopted standard is to hold Say on Pay votes annually. The Board and Compensation Committee also acknowledge current stockholder expectations regarding having the opportunity to express their views on the Company's executive compensation on an annual basis. In light of investor expectations and prevailing market practice, our Board and the Compensation Committee recommends that the advisory vote to approve executive compensation occur every year. 
Proposal 3 must be approved by the Required Vote, assuming a quorum is present. For this purpose, abstentions will be counted as a vote against the proposal, while broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.

Our Company 
We develop medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, our therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. Arrowhead's RNAi-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing. 
Arrowhead is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic basis, typically characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins. The depth and versatility of our RNAi technologies enable us to potentially address conditions in virtually any therapeutic area and pursue disease targets that are not otherwise addressable by small molecules and biologics.

Business Development 
Amgen Inc. 
Amgen Inc. acquired a worldwide, exclusive license in September 2016 to develop and commercialize ARO-LPA (now referred to as AMG 890). In August 2018, we received a $10 million milestone payment from Amgen triggered by the start of an Amgen-sponsored Phase 1 clinical study designed to assess its safety in volunteers with elevated levels of lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). AMG 890 (ARO-LPA) is designed to reduce production of apolipoprotein A, a key component of lipoprotein(a), which has been genetically linked with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, independent of cholesterol and LDL levels. 
We are eligible to receive up to $617 million in option payments and development, regulatory and sales milestone payments, as well as single-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-AMG1 agreement and up to low double-digit royalties for sales of products under the ARO-LPA (AMG 890) agreement. We received $10 million of the total $617 million in August 2018 as discussed above. 
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
In October 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to develop and commercialize ARO-HBV. In addition, we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement with Janssen to potentially collaborate for up to three additional RNAi therapeutics against new targets to be selected by Janssen. 
Under the terms of the license agreement, we received $175 million as an upfront payment. Separately, Johnson & Johnson Innovation — JJDC, Inc. (JJDC) made a $75 million equity investment in Arrowhead at a price of $23.00 per share of Arrowhead common stock. 
In addition, Arrowhead is eligible to receive up to approximately $1.6 billion in milestone payments for the license agreement. Arrowhead is also eligible to receive approximately $1.9 billion in option and milestone payments for the collaboration and option agreement related to up to three additional targets. Arrowhead is further eligible to receive tiered royalties up to mid teens under the license agreement and up to low teens under the collaboration and option agreement on product sales. 
Platform 
In 2018, we continued to develop and deploy our Targeted RNAi Molecule platform, or TRiM™, to identify and develop new therapeutics. TRiM™ utilizes ligand-mediated delivery and is designed to enable tissue-specific targeting, while being structurally simple. The TRiM™ platform is designed to offer several potential competitive advantages including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Clinical Stage Candidates 
ARO-AAT is a clinical-stage RNAi therapeutic candidate for the treatment of liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. ARO-AAT is designed to knock down the Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) gene transcript and reduce the hepatic production of the mutant AAT protein. ARO-AAT is a next-generation subcutaneously administered compound that follows a previous generation AAT compound ARC-AAT. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2017: ARO-AAT nominated; CTA filed  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 2018: Clinical trial commenced. Initial results from AROAAT1001 were presented in November 2018 at The Liver Meeting®, the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD). Key data include:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three monthly doses of 300 mg ARO-AAT led to reductions in serum alpha-1 antitrypsin to below the level of quantitation in 100% of subjects.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Single and multiple doses of ARO-AAT appeared to be well-tolerated at all doses  tested.  
[END TABLE]
ARO-ANG3 is designed to reduce production of angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), a liver synthesized inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. ANGPTL3 inhibition has been shown to lower serum LDL, serum and liver triglyceride and has genetic validation as a novel target for cardiovascular disease.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
ARO-AMG1 is being developed against an undisclosed genetically-validated cardiovascular target under a license and collaboration agreement with Amgen. We completed the Arrowhead Deliverable, as defined in our collaboration agreement with Amgen, during 2018. 
Candidates in Development 
ARO-ENaC is designed to reduce production of the epithelial sodium channel alpha subunit (aENaC) in the airways of the lung. In cystic fibrosis patients, increased ENaC activity contributes to airway dehydration and reduced mucociliary transport. A CTA is planned for 2019. 
ARO-HIF2 is being developed for the treatment of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). ARO-HIF2 is designed to inhibit the production of HIF-2a, which has been linked to tumor progression and metastasis in ccRCC. Arrowhead believes it is an attractive target for intervention because over 90% of ccRCC tumors express a mutant form of the Von Hippel-Landau protein that is unable to degrade HIF-2a, leading to its accumulation during tumor hypoxia and promoting tumor growth. A CTA is planned for 2019.

Based on our overall operating environment and these results, the Compensation Committee took the following key actions and maintained key policies with respect to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary — Approved base salary increases of 4-20% for our  NEOs for 2018, including a 4% increase for our CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive Compensation — Approved annual cash bonuses for 2018 ranging from 100% to 150% of target  annual incentive compensation opportunities, including an annual cash bonus for our CEO in the amount of $975,000, equal to 150% of his target annual incentive compensation opportunity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity Compensation — Granted our CEO a long-term incentive compensation opportunity in the form of a  performance-based restricted stock unit ("PRSU") award with a grant date value of $1,840,000 vesting upon the achievement of three equally weighted, pre-established and rigorous performance  milestones and granted our other Named Executive Officers long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of time-based restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards that may be settled for shares of our common stock with grant date  values ranging from $220,800 to $644,000. A minimum three-year vesting is required for time-based equity awards granted to our other executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clawback Policy — Maintained a clawback policy allowing the Company to recover compensation from any  executive officer should the Board of Directors determine that a material misstatement of the Company's financial statements was due to fraud, negligence, or intentional misconduct by any executive officer of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ownership Guidelines — Maintained the achievement of stock ownership guidelines of six times his annual  base salary for our CEO and twice their annual base salary for our COO and CFO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Double Trigger" Feature for Acceleration of Equity Awards — Maintained the agreements for  outstanding equity awards granted to our CEO pursuant to our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 2013 Incentive Plan to provide that, upon a change in control of the Company, the vesting of such awards will accelerate only in the event of a subsequent  involuntary termination of employment (a "double-trigger" arrangement).  
[END TABLE]
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in March 2018, we conducted a non-binding stockholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" vote). Our stockholders approved the Say-on-Pay proposal with approximately 93% of the votes cast in favor of the proposal. Based on the vote and feedback from our stockholders, we attribute the increase in the votes cast in favor primarily to the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adoption of 100% performance-based equity awards for our CEO which is preferred by stockholders and unusual in our peer  group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjustments in our compensation practices including adoption of minimum vesting requirements; compensation recovery  ("clawback") policy, double-trigger acceleration of equity awards for our CEO; and stock ownership guidelines for our CEO and CFO,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of aggressive corporate goals in 2017 and 2018; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Substantial increases in market capitalization and TSR in 2017 and 2018.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, we continued our stockholder engagement program, reaching out to our top 20 institutional stockholders beneficially owning over 50% of our outstanding common stock to solicit their views and concerns and reviewed the feedback and policies of ISS. Based on this review, as well as our commitment to good corporate governance, the Compensation Committee continued the above mentioned practices for the executive compensation review in 2018. 
Additionally, we received communications from California-based public pension funds on governance topics, including board diversity. In response, the Nominating Committee recommitted to including diverse candidates in future board searches and adopted corresponding changes to the Nominating Committee Charter available on the Company's website. 
We value the opinions of our stockholders and will continue to consider the outcome of future Say-on-Pay votes, as well as feedback received throughout the year, when making compensation decisions for our executive officers. The Compensation Committee is committed to being responsive to stockholder feedback regarding our executive compensation program, policies, and practices, including concerns expressed through the Say-on-Pay vote. 
Pay-for-Performance Analysis 
We believe our executive compensation program is reasonable, competitive, and appropriately balances the goals of attracting, motivating, rewarding, and retaining our executive officers with the goal of aligning their interests with those of our stockholders. To ensure this alignment and to motivate and reward individual initiative and effort, a significant portion of our executive officers' target annual total direct compensation opportunity is both performance-based and "at-risk." 
We emphasize performance-based compensation that appropriately rewards our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, through two separate compensation elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• First, we provide the opportunity to participate in our annual incentive compensation plan which provides cash payments if  they produce short-term financial, operational, and strategic results that meet or exceed the objectives set forth each year in our annual operating plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition, we grant equity awards as long-term incentive compensation. For our CEO in fiscal 2018, this awards is to be  earned based entirely on the achievement of pre-established corporate performance objectives which are both challenging and designed to drive our financial and operational performance and long-term growth,  and, in the case of our other executive officers, are either dependent on the future appreciation in value of our common stock or are subject to the risk of fluctuations in the value of our common stock and, therefore, are "at risk."

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
The pay mix for our CEO for each of the last three fiscal years illustrates the ongoing emphasis on our performance-based compensation philosophy: 
We believe that, ultimately, the creation of sustainable long-term stockholder value will depend on our ability to successfully bring to market the products we develop or partner with strategic collaborators to bring them to market. Consequently, the Compensation Committee strives to incent our executive officers to create that value through a robust and attractive pipeline of drug candidates. As a result, our executive compensation program is designed to provide incentives that facilitate these efforts. Particularly for our CEO, the Compensation Committee has awarded performance milestone-based equity awards directly linked to goals that promote the development of our pipeline and other related business and market-based objectives. The Compensation Committee closely tracks the progress against these objectives to monitor our success over each product's development period and evaluates our executive officers primarily on that progress. 
To ensure that we remain faithful to our compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee regularly evaluates the relationship between the reported values of the equity awards granted to our executive officers, the amount of compensation realizable (and, ultimately, realized) from such awards in subsequent years and our total stockholder return over this period.

Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
We endeavor to maintain sound governance standards consistent with our executive compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee evaluates our executive compensation program on a regular basis to ensure that it is consistent with our short-term and long-term goals given the dynamic nature of our business and the market in which we compete for executive talent. The following summarizes our executive compensation and related policies and practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  Maintain an  Independent Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee consists solely of independent directors.   ✓  Retain an  Independent Compensation Advisor. The Compensation Committee engaged its own compensation advisor to provide information and analysis with its 2018 compensation review, and other advice on executive compensation independent of  management. This consultant performed no consulting or other services for us in 2018.   ✓  Annual   Executive  Compensation Review. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review and approval of our compensation strategy, including a review and determination of our  compensation peer group used for comparative purposes and a review of our compensation-related risk profile to ensure that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk-taking and that the level of risk that they do  encourage is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us.   ✓  Compensation  At-Risk. Our executive compensation program is designed so that a significant portion of compensation is at risk based on our performance, as well as short-term cash and long-term  equity incentives to align the interests of our executive officers and stockholders.   ✓  Stock  Ownership Policy. We maintain a stock ownership policy that requires our CEO, COO, and CFO to maintain a minimum ownership level of our common stock.   ✓  Compensation  Recovery (Clawback) Policy. We have established a clawback policy allowing the Company to recover compensation should the Board determine that a material misstatement of the Companys financial statements was due  to fraud, negligence, or intentional misconduct by any executive officer of the Company.   ✓  Conduct an  Annual Stockholder Advisory Vote on NEO Compensation. We conduct an annual stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.   ✓  Use a Pay-for-Performance Philosophy. The majority of our CEOs compensation is directly linked to corporate performance; we also structure target total  direct compensation opportunities with a significant long-term equity component, thereby making a substantial portion of the CEOs and each additional executive officers target total direct compensation dependent upon our stock price  and/or total stockholder return.   ✓  Double Trigger Feature for Acceleration of CEO Equity  Awards  The outstanding equity awards granted to our CEO pursuant to our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 2013 Incentive Plan to provide that, upon a change in control of the Company, the vesting of such awards will  accelerate only in the event of a subsequent involuntary termination of employment (adouble-trigger arrangement).         ×   No Executive Retirement Plans. We do not offer pension arrangements or retirement plans or arrangements to our executive officers that are different from or in addition to those offered to our other  employees.   ×   No Perquisites. Currently, we do not provide perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive  officers.   ×   No  Special Welfare or  Health Benefits. Our executive officers participate in broad-based Company-sponsored health and welfare benefits programs on the same basis as our other full-time, salaried  employees, except for a premium for life insurance for our CEO.   ×   No   Post-Employment Tax  Payment Reimbursement. We do not provide any tax reimbursement payments (including gross-ups) on any severance or  change-in-control payments or benefits.   ×   No   Hedging and Limit on Pledging of Our Equity Securities. We prohibit our executive officers and the non-employee members of our Board from hedging our equity securities. Executive officers  may pledge up to 50% of owned and vested shares with the approval of the Board.   ×   No   Dividends or Dividend Equivalents Payable on Unvested Equity Awards. We do not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested RSU awards or PRSU awards.   ×   No   Stock Option Re-pricing. Our employee stock plan does not permit options to purchase shares of our common stock to be repriced to a lower exercise or strike price without the approval of  our stockholders.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Executive Compensation Philosophy 
Our executive compensation philosophy reflects our two fundamental objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to attract, motivate, and retain a highly skilled team of executives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to align our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders by rewarding short-term and long-term  performance and aligning compensation to increases in stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that the compensation of our executive officers should be directly linked to the achievement of specific objectives that are expected to increase stockholder value. In furtherance of this goal, the Compensation Committee has established the following guidelines as a foundation for compensation decisions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a competitive total compensation package that enables us to attract, retain, and motivate highly-qualified  executives with the skills and experience required for the achievement of business goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• promote the achievement of key strategic and financial performance measures by linking short-term and long-term compensation  to the achievement of measurable goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward significant achievements outside of pre-established goals;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recognize that pharmaceutical research, development, and commercialization require sustained and focused effort over many  years, and involve a high degree of risk and therefore balance incentives for short-term and long-term compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employ outside compensation expertise and market data from industry peers to help assure that our compensation policies and  practices are consistent with industry practice and meet our goals for our compensation program;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consider our cash resources and cost of capital to balance cash and equity compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• align our executive officers' incentives with the creation of stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Program Design 
Our practice is to combine a mixture of compensation elements that balance achievement of our short-term goals with our longer-term performance. Currently, our executive compensation program consists of three principal elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual incentive compensation opportunity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that cash compensation in the form of base salary and an annual incentive compensation opportunity provides our executive officers with short-term rewards for success in operations, and that long-term incentive compensation in the form of RSU and PRSU awards that may be settled for shares of our common stock, and options to purchase shares of our common stock, align the objectives of our executive officers with those of our stockholders with respect to long-term performance and success. 
The Compensation Committee takes into consideration, among other things, our financial and working capital condition when approving performance objectives and making compensation decisions for our executive officers. Since we seek to preserve cash and currently do not operate at a profit, overall target total direct compensation opportunities are weighted more heavily toward long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards. Thus, a significant portion of each executive officer's target total direct compensation is "at risk," and dependent on the increase in the value of our common stock. The Compensation Committee periodically reassesses the appropriate weighting of cash and equity compensation. 
In the case of long-term incentive compensation, typically the Compensation Committee designs these awards to vest, or be earned, over a multi-year period, meaning that long-term value creation, contrasted with short-term gain, presents the best opportunity for our executive officers to benefit from their awards. 
We do not maintain a specific policy on the percentage allocation between short-term and long-term incentive compensation elements. 
Governance of Executive Compensation Program 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee discharges many of the responsibilities of our Board relating to the compensation of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, and the non-employee members of our Board. The Compensation 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Committee has overall responsibility for overseeing our compensation and benefits philosophy and policies generally, overseeing and evaluating the compensation plans, policies, and practices applicable to our CEO and our other executive officers, and ensuring that the target total direct compensation opportunities of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, are consistent with our compensation philosophy, policies, and objectives. 
The members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by our Board, and each member is an independent director (as "independence" is currently defined in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ listing standards). Currently, the members of the Compensation Committee are Michael S. Perry (Chairman), Mauro Ferrari, and William Waddill. 
The Compensation Committee reviews our executive compensation program annually on a calendar year basis, generally in December. The Compensation Committee draws on a number of resources to assist in the evaluation of the various components of our executive compensation program including, but not limited to, input from our CEO, the advice of an external compensation consultant (as identified below) retained by the Compensation Committee, information provided in the public filings of industry peers and industry data compiled yearly by Radford in its Global Life Sciences Survey, which represents a nationally-based assessment of executive compensation widely used within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry sectors. 
The Compensation Committee relies upon the judgment of its members in making compensation decisions. In addition, the Compensation Committee incorporates judgment in the assessment process to respond to and adjust for the evolving business environment. The members of the Compensation Committee have extensive experience in executive management, as well as compensation practices and policies. 
Compensation-Setting Process 
The Compensation Committee develops recommendations for the target total direct compensation opportunities for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee does not use a single method or measure in making its compensation decisions, nor does it position compensation levels based upon a specific or target level relative to a peer group or other companies. Nonetheless, the pay practices at other companies are an important factor that the Compensation Committee considers in assessing the reasonableness of compensation and ensuring that our compensation practices are competitive in the marketplace. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee evaluates the compensation of our executive officers relative to the median of the competitive market. However, as discussed hereafter, various other factors are taken into consideration in determining our executive officers' compensation and the Compensation Committee does not target compensation at any specific level relative to the competitive market. When reviewing our current executive compensation arrangements and approving each compensation element and the target total direct compensation opportunity for our executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our performance against the financial and operational objectives established by the Compensation Committee and our Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each individual executive officer's skills, experience, and qualifications relative to other similarly-situated  executives at the companies in our compensation peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The scope of each executive officer's role compared to other similarly-situated executives at the companies in our  compensation peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The performance of each individual executive officer, based on a subjective assessment of his or her contributions to our  overall performance, ability to lead his or her business unit or function and work as part of a team, all of which reflect our core values;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation practices of our compensation peer group and the positioning of each executive officer's compensation  in a ranking of peer company compensation levels; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The recommendations provided by our CEO with respect to the compensation of our other executive officers.   
[END TABLE]
These factors provide the framework for compensation decision-making and final decisions regarding the compensation opportunity for each executive officer. No single factor is determinative in setting pay levels, nor was the impact of any factor on the determination of pay levels quantifiable. 
Role of Chief Executive Officer 
In discharging its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee works with members of our management, including our CEO. Our management assists the Compensation Committee by providing information on corporate and individual performance, 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation market compensation data, and management's perspective on compensation matters. The Compensation Committee solicits and reviews our CEO's recommendations with respect to the compensation levels for individual executive officers other than himself based on the performance evaluation of each executive officer's manager and his own evaluation of the executive officer's performance. 
The Compensation Committee reviews and discusses these recommendations and proposals with our CEO and considers them as one factor in formulating the recommendations for the compensation for our executive officers, including our other Named Executive Officers. Our CEO recuses himself from all discussions and recommendations regarding his own compensation. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee engages an external compensation consultant to assist it by providing information, analysis, and other advice relating to our executive compensation program and the decisions resulting from its annual executive compensation review. The Compensation Committee has the final authority to engage and terminate the engagement of any compensation consultant that it retains. 
For the period from October 2017 through September 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Compensia, Inc., a national compensation consulting firm, as its external compensation consultant ("Compensia"). Compensia assisted the Compensation Committee in its review of executive and non-employee director compensation practices for 2018, including the competitiveness of compensation levels, executive compensation design, comparisons with our industry peers, and other technical considerations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and update of our compensation peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and analysis of the compensation arrangements for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and analysis of the compensation arrangements for the non-employee members of  our Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and update of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of our proxy statement for our 2019 Annual Meeting of  Stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Support on other ad hoc matters.  
[END TABLE]
The terms of Compensia's engagement include reporting directly to the Compensation Committee and to the Compensation Committee chair. 
In 2018, Compensia did not provide any other services to us. The Compensation Committee has evaluated Compensia's independence pursuant to the listing standards of the NASDAQ and the relevant SEC rules and has determined that no conflict of interest has arisen as a result of the work performed by Compensia. 
Competitive Positioning 
For each of the past five years, the Compensation Committee has directed its external compensation consultant to conduct a comparative study and report on compensation levels and practices relative to industry peers, including a competitive assessment of our executive compensation program as compared to the market data for base salaries, target total cash compensation, long-term incentive compensation, and target total direct compensation. Typically, the findings of this study are presented to the Compensation Committee by the compensation consultant in conjunction with the Compensation Committee's annual review of our executive compensation program. 
Because the biotechnology sector is dynamic, the comparator group used by the Compensation Committee to assess the competitive positioning of the compensation of our executive officers is updated annually to ensure that peer companies continue to meet the established criteria. For purposes of its review of our executive compensation program in fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee directed Compensia to update its compensation peer group reflecting the competitive market for executive talent based on the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Publicly-held, pre-commercial U.S. biotechnology companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies with market capitalizations between 0.5x to 2.0x our market capitalization at the time of the peer selection; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies with between 50 to 500 employees.  
[END TABLE]
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
The compensation peer group was selected in such a manner that our market capitalization was very near the median for all peer companies. Consideration was also given to the frequency or infrequency with which a company was identified as a peer with other peer companies. The increase in the Company's market capitalization indicated significant redesign of the peer group for 2018. 
For 2018, the compensation peer group consisted of the following companies: 
The compensation study prepared by Compensia and presented in December 2018 provided an assessment of our compensation practices as compared to industry peers. Compensation levels for our executive officers, in the aggregate, were determined to be within the range of compensation provided to similarly placed executives and consistent with our compensation philosophy. 
Individual Compensation Elements 
In 2018, the principal elements of our executive compensation program were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an annual incentive compensation opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• welfare and health benefits; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• post-employment compensation arrangements.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
Base salary represents the fixed portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, and is an important element of compensation intended to attract and retain highly-talented individuals. 
The initial base salaries for our executive officers were negotiated on an individual basis at the time of hire. Thereafter, using the competitive market data provided by its compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee reviews and determines adjustments to the base salaries for each of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, as part of its annual executive compensation review. In addition, the base salaries of our executive officers may be adjusted by the Compensation Committee in the event of a promotion or significant change in responsibilities. Generally, the Compensation Committee sets base salaries with reference to the competitive range of the market median of our compensation peer group and applicable executive compensation survey data, as well as its assessment of the factors described in "Governance of Executive Compensation Program — Compensation-Setting Process" above. 
In December 2017, consistent with the recommendation of our CEO, the Compensation Committee determined to increase the base salaries of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers. In making these decisions, the Compensation Committee considered the current risks and challenges facing us, as well as the factors described in "Governance of Executive Compensation Program — Compensation-Setting Process" above. The increases for Kenneth Myszkowski and Zhen Li reflect market-based adjustments and increased leadership responsibilities, respectively.

In determining the amount of the annual incentive award for each of our executive officers, including each of our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee evaluated the corporate performance objectives that had been established at the beginning of the calendar year (as set forth below) as well as other corporate and individual achievements and performance throughout the year. These performance objectives addressed milestones for our lead products, research and development milestones for our drug pipeline and business development objectives. In December 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that we had largely achieved or exceeded our primary business objectives set for calendar 2018, as described below.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
We view long-term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards as a critical element of our executive compensation program. The realizable value of these equity awards over time bears a direct relationship to our stock price, and, therefore, these awards are an incentive for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, to create value for our stockholders. Equity awards also help us retain qualified executive officers in a competitive market. 
Long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of equity awards are granted to our executive officers by the Compensation Committee. The amount and forms of such equity awards are determined by the Compensation Committee after considering the factors described in "Governance of Executive Compensation Program — Compensation-Setting Process" above. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
Performance-Based RSU Award for Chief Executive Officer 
Annual equity awards granted to our executive officers are solely in the form of restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards that may be settled for shares of our common stock. In the case of our CEO, the award is entirely performance-based ("PRSU"). On January 1, 2018, Dr. Anzalone was granted a performance-based RSU ("PRSU") of 500,000 shares to be vested in three equal installments on the achievement of the following milestones:

The equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers in fiscal 2018 are set forth in the "Fiscal 2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the "Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below. 
Welfare and Health Benefits 
Our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in all of our employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, vision, life, and disability insurance, in each case on the same basis as our other employees, subject to applicable law. In addition, we provide additional life insurance for our CEO for the benefit of his heirs. We also provide vacation and other paid holidays to all our employees, including our executive officers, all of which we believe to be comparable to those provided at peer companies. These benefit programs are designed to enable us to attract and retain our workforce in a competitive marketplace. Our health, welfare, and vacation benefits are designed to ensure that we have a productive and focused workforce through reliable and competitive health and other benefits. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Our retirement savings plan ("401(k) plan") is a tax-qualified retirement savings plan, pursuant to which qualified employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are able to contribute certain amounts of their annual compensation, subject to limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service. Historically, we have made matching contributions of 100% of the first 3% of base salary and of 50% of the next 2% of base salary contributed to the plan. The value of these benefits for each of our Named Executive Officers is reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, we do not provide significant perquisites or other personal benefits to our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, except as generally made available to our employees, or in situations where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective and for recruitment and retention purposes. 
In the future, we may provide perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as those described in the preceding paragraph. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation Committee. 
Employment Arrangements 
We have entered into a written employment agreement with our CEO and have written employment offer letters with our other executive officers. In filling each of our executive positions, we recognized the need to develop competitive compensation packages to attract qualified candidates in a dynamic labor market. At the same time, in formulating these compensation packages, we were sensitive to the need to integrate new executive officers into the executive compensation structure that we were seeking to develop, balancing both competitive and internal equity considerations. Each of these arrangements provides for "at will" employment. 
For detailed descriptions of the employment arrangements we maintained with our Named Executive Officers for 2018, see "Termination Benefits — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Post-Employment Compensation Arrangements 
We have entered into an employment agreement with our CEO, and we also have agreements with our CFO and General Counsel that provide for certain payments and benefits in the event of certain involuntary terminations of employment. We believe that having in place reasonable and competitive post-employment compensation arrangements are essential to attracting and retaining highly-qualified executive officers. These agreements are designed to provide reasonable compensation to executive officers who leave our employ under certain circumstances to facilitate their transition to new employment. Further, in some instances we seek to mitigate any potential employer liability and avoid future disputes or litigation by requiring a departing executive officer to sign a separation and release agreement acceptable to us as a condition to receiving post-employment compensation payments or benefits. 
The Compensation Committee does not consider the specific amounts payable under these agreements when establishing annual compensation. We do believe, however, that these arrangements are necessary to offer compensation packages that are competitive. 
In addition, our 2013 Incentive Plan provides for the acceleration of vesting of outstanding and unvested equity awards in the event of a change in control of the Company, as defined in the plan, except as otherwise determined by our Board. The Company has amended the agreements for outstanding equity awards granted to our CEO pursuant to our 2004 Equity Incentive Plan and 2013 Incentive Plan to provide that, upon a change in control of the Company, the vesting of such awards will accelerate only in the event of a subsequent involuntary termination of employment (a "double-trigger" arrangement). 
For detailed descriptions of the post-employment compensation arrangements we maintained with our Named Executive Officers for 2018, as well as an estimate of the potential payments and benefits payable under these arrangements, see "Termination Benefits — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Other Compensation Policies and Practices 
Equity Awards Grant Policy 
We do not have any program, plan, or obligation that requires us to grant equity awards on specified dates, although historically we have granted such awards to our existing executive officers and employees at least annually and to newly-hired employees on the commencement of their employment. We do not have any program, plan, or practice to grant options to 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation purchase shares of our common stock to our executive officers in coordination with the release of material nonpublic information. Equity awards may occasionally be granted following a significant change in job responsibilities or to meet other special retention or performance objectives. 
Authority to grant equity awards to our employees rests with the Compensation Committee, although the Compensation Committee has delegated authority to our CEO to grant equity awards to non-executive employees within prescribed limits set by the Compensation Committee. With respect to our executive officers, except for our CEO, recommendations for equity awards are made by our CEO and reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. 
Under the terms of our 2013 Incentive Plan, pursuant to which new equity awards are granted, the exercise price of any option to purchase shares of our common stock awarded under the plan must be equal to at least 100% of the fair market value of our common stock (which is determined based on the closing sales price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Market) on the date of grant. 
Stock Ownership Policy 
We maintain a stock ownership policy for our CEO, COO, and CFO to further align their respective interests with the interests of our stockholders, and to further promote our commitment to sound corporate governance. This policy requires our CEO to own a minimum number of shares of our common stock equal to a value of six times his annualized base salary and our COO and CFO to own a minimum number of shares of our common stock equal to a value of twice their annualized base salary. Each of these executive officers has achieved the required ownership. 
Compensation Recovery ("Clawback") Policy 
In December 2017, our Board adopted a compensation recovery ("clawback") policy as follows: 
"If Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the "Company") is required to materially restate any of its financial statements, the Board of Directors (the "Board") shall assess the degree to which any fraud, negligence, or intentional misconduct by any executive officer of the Company was responsible for such restatement. If the Board determines that any executive officer was responsible for causing such restatement, the Board shall, in addition to any other lawful remedies the Board or the Company may take, seek recovery of all or a portion of the incentive compensation awarded to the executive officer for the performance period covered by the restated financial statement, provided that such recovery shall not extend to payments made more than three years prior to the date the financial record was restated. In addition, the Board may, in its absolute discretion, revoke any of the responsible executive officer's unpaid or unvested incentive compensation outstanding as of the date of the Board's determination of the executive officer's responsibility for the financial restatement." 
In addition, our 2013 Incentive Plan provides for the recovery of awards made under the plan in accordance with any applicable compensation recovery or recoupment policy, including as required by law, regulation, or national securities exchange rule. 
Policy Prohibiting Hedging and Pledging 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our employees, including our executive officers, and the non-employee members of our Board from short-term trading, options trading, trading on margin, pledging our common stock as collateral, and all hedging transactions with respect to our securities, except for pledging up to 50% owned and vested stock as collateral for a loan subject to the approval of the Board. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Prior to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December of 2017 (the "US Tax Act"), compensation that satisfied conditions set forth under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to qualify as "performance-based compensation" was not subject to a $1 million limit on deductibility, and the limit did not apply to compensation paid to the Chief Financial Officer. The US Tax Act eliminates the performance-based compensation exception and applies the limit to the Chief Financial Officer and certain former executive officers. However, it provides a transition rule with respect to remuneration provided under a written contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not materially modified after that date. With eliminating the exemption for performance-based compensation, we expect that we will be unable to deduct all compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and our other Named Executive Officers covered by the new tax law, other than previously granted awards that comply with the transition rules. We monitor the application of Section 162(m) and the associated Treasury regulations on an ongoing basis and the advisability of qualifying 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation executive compensation for deductibility. Notwithstanding the repeal of the exemption for "performance-based compensation," the Compensation Committee intends to maintain its commitment to structuring the Company's executive compensation programs in a manner designed to align pay with performance. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
We follow the Financial Accounting Standard Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718") for our stock-based compensation awards. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires us to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and non-employee members of our Board, including options to purchase shares of our common stock and other stock awards, based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the executive compensation tables required by the federal securities laws, even though the recipient of the awards may never realize any value from their awards. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
In reviewing our various compensation programs, the Compensation Committee considers how our compensation policies and practices may affect our risk profile and whether such policies and practices may encourage undue risk-taking by our employees. More specifically, the Compensation Committee considers the general design philosophy of our policies and practices for our employees whose conduct would be most affected by incentives established pursuant to these compensation policies. In considering these issues, the Compensation Committee concluded that the use of a performance-based annual incentive compensation plan and long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of equity awards did not appear to create undue risks for us or encourage excessive risk-taking behavior on the part of our Named Executive Officers. 
With respect to the annual incentive awards for our executive officers, the amount of an individual's award depends principally on overall Company performance, as determined by the Compensation Committee, which reduces the ability and incentive for an individual to take undue risks at the expense of our performance in an effort to increase the amount of his or her annual incentive award. Our performance objectives are reviewed regularly by the Compensation Committee and our Board and are considered to be generally of the nature that promote the steady progression of our development programs and would not encourage or reward excessive risk-taking. In addition, our Board has the ability to intervene in instances where actions by our executive officers vis-à-vis Company performance objective attainment would be considered unduly risky to prevent or penalize such actions. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee of the Company has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(6)  The amount reported for Christopher Anzalone in the Stock Awards column reflects the grant date fair value of a January  2016 restricted stock unit award that is subject to vesting upon the achievement of specific performance-based conditions. We determined the performance conditions were not probable of being achieved as of the grant date, as defined under applicable  accounting guidance, and assigned a grant date fair value of $0 based on this evaluation. If we had determined that as of the date of the grant it was probable that 100% of the performance-based conditions would be achieved, we would have assigned a  grant date fair value of $3,321,000 for the restricted stock units. The amount reported in the Summary Compensation Table for this award may not represent the amount that Christopher Anzalone will realize from the award. Whether, and to what extent,  a named executive officer realizes value will depend on our actual operating performance, stock price fluctuations and the named executive officer's continued employment.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are required to calculate and disclose the median annual compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO, Dr. Anzalone), the annual compensation of Dr. Anzalone, and the ratio of these two amounts. 
Our median employee was identified using the entire population of our employees as of September 30, 2018 based on a consistently applied compensation measure, or CACM, that reasonably reflects the annual compensation of employees. The CACM selected by us for our disclosure included annual base salary, overtime for the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2018, the cash bonus amount for fiscal 2018, the grant-date fair value for stock-based awards (calculated in accordance with requirements for the Summary Compensation Table), and welfare and health benefits for fiscal 2018. 
Based on the CACM methodology described above, we identified the median employee and calculated the 2018 compensation for this selected employee in the same manner we determine the annual total compensation of our NEOs for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table. The median employee total compensation is $134,747. Dr. Anzalone's 2018 compensation as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table is $1,619,901. As a result, our CEO to median employee pay ratio for 2018 is 12:1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated by a method consistent with the SEC requirements, described above, based on our payroll and employment records. As a result of a variety of factors, including employee populations, potential differences in the components used for the CACM, compensation philosophies and certain assumptions, pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio. The pay ratio is not utilized by our management or our compensation committee for compensation-related decisions. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Proposal Four — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors 
Proposal Four — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors 
Our Audit Committee, with the ratification of our Board, selected the accounting firm of Rose, Snyder & Jacobs, LLP ("RS&J") as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and that selection is now being submitted to the stockholders. 
A representative of RS&J will be available at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions or make any other statements such representative deems appropriate. 
Stockholders are not required to ratify the appointment of RS&J as our independent auditor. However, we are submitting the appointment for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider whether or not to retain RS&J. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee may direct the appointment of a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. 
Vote Required; Recommendation of the Board 
In order to be ratified, Proposal Four must be approved by a majority of Required Vote, assuming a quorum is present. For this purpose, abstentions will be counted as a vote against the proposal.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Audit Fees 
Audit Fees 
The Audit Committee regularly reviews and determines whether specific projects or expenditures with our independent auditors, Rose, Snyder & Jacobs, LLP may potentially affect their independence.

Pre-approval is generally provided by the Audit Committee for up to one year, detailed to the particular service or category of services to be rendered and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee may also pre-approve additional services of specific engagements on a case-by-case basis. All engagements of our independent registered public accounting firm in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the audit committee. 
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees invoiced by RS&J for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017:

Report of the Audit Committee 
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company's audited financial statements for fiscal 2018, which include the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, and the notes thereto. 
Composition. At September 30, 2018, The Audit Committee of the Board was comprised of three directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. The members of the Audit Committee were William Waddill, Mauro Ferrari and Michael S. Perry. All members of the Audit Committee were "independent," as defined in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and Rule 5605(c) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, and are financially literate. 
Responsibilities. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include engaging an accounting firm as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Management has primary responsibility for the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to oversee these processes. 
Review with Management and independent registered public accounting firm. On December 7, 2018, the Audit Committee consisted of William Waddill, Mauro Ferrari and Michael S. Perry. On that date, the Audit Committee met separately to review the Company's consolidated audited financial statements and held discussions with management and RS&J. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The members of the Audit Committee discussed with RS&J matters required to be discussed under the applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and the Audit Committee discussed the firm's independence with RS&J. 
Conclusion. Based upon the Audit Committee's review of the financial statements and discussions with management and RS&J, the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the report of RS&J to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, as filed with the SEC. 
This report is submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT    Review and Approval of Related-Party Transactions 
Review and Approval of Related-Party Transactions 
Our Board has adopted policies and procedures for the review and approval of related-party transactions and has delegated to the Audit Committee the authority to review and approve the material terms of any proposed related-party transactions. To the extent that a proposed related-party transaction may involve a non-employee director or nominee for election as a director and may be material to a consideration of that person's independence, the matter may also be considered by the other disinterested directors. 
Pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and our Corporate Governance Committee Charter, each of our officers, directors and employees must disclose related-party transactions to our Board. In order to avoid conflicts of interest, our executive officers and directors may not acquire any ownership interest in any supplier, customer or competitor (other than nominal amounts of stock in publicly traded companies), enter into any consulting or employment relationship with any customer, supplier or competitor, or engage in any outside business activity that is competitive with any of our businesses, without first disclosing the proposed transaction. After the proposed transaction has been disclosed, a determination will be made by our Board or Audit Committee as to what course to follow, depending on the nature or extent of the conflict. Furthermore, our executive officers and directors may not serve on any board of directors of any customer, supplier or competitor unless such board service has been disclosed to us and approved by our Board. 
In determining whether to approve or ratify a related-party transaction, the Board and/or Committee may consider, among other factors it deems appropriate, the potential benefits to us, the impact on a director's or nominee's independence or an executive officer's relationship with or service to us, whether the related-party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. In deciding to approve a transaction, the Board or Audit Committee may, in its sole discretion, impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on us or the related party in connection with its approval of any transaction. Any transactions involving the compensation of executive officers, however, are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee. If a related-party transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines to be followed in our ongoing dealings with the related party. Thereafter, the Audit Committee reviews and assesses the ongoing relationship with each related party to see that it is in compliance with the Audit Committee's guidelines and that the related-party transaction remains appropriate.
