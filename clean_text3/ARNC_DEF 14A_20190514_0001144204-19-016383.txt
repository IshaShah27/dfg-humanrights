Director Nominees (Page 8)
Arconic's Board of Directors currently comprises 12 members, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John C. Plant, and independent Lead Director Arthur D.

Hess notified the Board that they will not stand for re-election and will retire from the Board effective as of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting. As a result, the Board determined to decrease the size of the Board from 12 to 10 members, effective as of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, and intends to elect a new independent Lead Director at its first meeting following the 2019 Annual Meeting.

Executive Compensation Highlights (Page 40)
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section includes a discussion of the Company's compensation philosophy and design and 2018 compensation decisions.
Arconic's executive compensation philosophy to provide pay for performance and shareholder alignment underlies our 2018 compensation structure, which is designed based on four guiding principles:
 Make equity long-term incentive (LTI) compensation the most significant portion of total compensation for senior executives and managers. 
​
 Choose annual incentive compensation (IC) metrics and LTI metrics that focus management's actions on achieving the greatest positive impact on Arconic's financial performance. 
​
 Set IC and LTI targets that challenge management to achieve continuous improvement in performance and deliver long-term growth. 
​
 Target total compensation at median of market, while using IC and LTI compensation to motivate performance and to attract and retain exceptional talent. 
​
Based on input from investors and benchmarking analyses, the Company designed an executive compensation structure aimed to drive shareholder value for Arconic. Best practices in 2018 include:

2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 1 Election of Directors
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Arconic's Board of Directors comprises 12 members, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John C. Plant, and independent Lead Director Arthur D. Collins, Jr. On March 4, 2019, directors Arthur D. Collins, Jr. and David P. Hess notified the Board that they will not stand for re-election and will retire from the Board effective as of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting. As a result, the Board determined to decrease the size of the Board from 12 to 10 members, effective as of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting, and intends to elect a new independent Lead Director at its first meeting following the 2019 Annual Meeting.
The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee, has nominated 10 incumbent directors to stand for reelection to the Board for a one-year term expiring in 2020: James F. Albaugh, Amy E. Alving, Christopher L. Ayers, Elmer L. Doty, Rajiv L. Gupta, Sean O. Mahoney, David J. Miller, E. Stanley O'Neal, John C. Plant, and Ulrich R. Schmidt. Each of the 10 director nominees was elected by shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of the 10 director nominees qualifies for election under the Company's criteria for evaluation of directors (see "Minimum Qualifications for Director Nominees and Board Member Attributes" on page 13). Included in each nominee's biography below is a description of the qualifications, experience, attributes and skills of such nominee.
In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that each director nominee, except Messrs. Plant and Doty (due to their executive roles as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and as President and Chief Operating Officer, respectively), qualifies as an independent director under New York Stock Exchange corporate governance listing standards and the Company's Director Independence Standards. See "Director Independence" on page 28.
If any of the Board's nominees is unable to serve or for good cause will not serve as a director, the Board of Directors may reduce its size or choose a substitute nominee. If any substitute nominees are designated, we will file an amended proxy statement that, as applicable, identifies the substitute nominees, discloses that such nominees have consented to being named in the revised proxy statement and to serve if elected, and includes certain biographical and other information about such nominees required by SEC rules.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of Ms. Alving and Messrs. Albaugh, Ayers, Doty, Gupta, Mahoney, Miller, O'Neal, Plant, and Schmidt. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Summary of Director Attributes and Skills
Our directors have a diversity of experience that spans a broad range of industries, including the aerospace, automotive and finance sectors. They bring to our Board a wide variety of skills, qualifications and viewpoints that strengthens the Board's ability to carry out its oversight role on behalf of our shareholders. In the director nominee biographies below, we describe certain areas of individual expertise that each director brings to our Board.
The table below is a summary of the range of skills and experiences that each director nominee brings to the Board. Because it is a summary, it does not include all of the skills, experiences, qualifications, and diversity that each director nominee offers, and the fact that a particular experience, skill, or qualification is not listed does not mean that a nominee does not possess it.

Shareholder Nominations
​
The Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that any shareholder entitled to vote at an annual meeting of shareholders may nominate one or more director candidates for election at that annual meeting by following certain prescribed procedures. The shareholder must provide to Arconic's Corporate Secretary timely written notice of the shareholder's intent to make such a nomination or nominations. In order to be timely, the shareholder must provide such written notice not earlier than the 120th day and not later than the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice by the shareholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.

Minimum Qualifications for Director Nominees and Board Member Attributes
​
The Governance and Nominating Committee has adopted Criteria for Identification, Evaluation and Selection of Directors:
1.
Directors must have demonstrated the highest ethical behavior and must be committed to the Company's values. 
​
2.
Directors must be committed to seeking and balancing the legitimate long-term interests of all of the Company's shareholders, as well as its other stakeholders, including its customers, employees and the communities where the Company has an impact. Directors must not be beholden primarily to any special interest group or constituency. 
​
3.
It is the objective of the Board that all non-management directors be independent. In addition, no director should have, or appear to have, a conflict of interest that would impair that director's ability to make decisions consistently in a fair and balanced manner. 
​
4.
Directors must be independent in thought and judgment. They must each have the ability to speak out on difficult subjects; to ask tough questions and demand accurate, honest answers; to constructively challenge management; and at the same time, act as an effective member of the team, engendering by his or her attitude an atmosphere of collegiality and trust. 
​
5.
Each director must have demonstrated excellence in his or her area and must be able to deal effectively with crises and to provide advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer and his or her peers. 
​
6.
Directors should have proven business acumen, serving or having served as a chief executive officer, or other senior leadership role, in a significant, complex organization; or serving or having served in a significant policy-making or leadership position in a well-respected, nationally or internationally recognized educational institution, not-for-profit organization or governmental entity; or having achieved a widely recognized position of leadership in the director's field of endeavor which adds substantial value to the oversight of material issues related to the Company's business. 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 1 Election of Directors (continued)
​
7.
Directors must be committed to understanding the Company and its industry; to regularly preparing for, attending and actively participating in meetings of the Board and its committees; and to ensuring that existing and future individual commitments will not materially interfere with the director's obligations to the Company. The number of other board memberships, in light of the demands of a director nominee's principal occupation, should be considered, as well as travel demands for meeting attendance. 
​
8.
Directors must understand the legal responsibilities of board service and fiduciary obligations. All members of the Board should be financially literate and have a sound understanding of business strategy, business environment, corporate governance and board operations. At least one member of the Board must satisfy the requirements of an "audit committee financial expert." 
​
9.
Directors must be self-confident and willing and able to assume leadership and collaborative roles as needed. They need to demonstrate maturity, valuing Board and team performance over individual performance and respect for others and their views. 
​
10.
New director nominees should be able and committed to serve as a member of the Board for an extended period of time. 
​
11.
While the diversity, the variety of experiences and viewpoints represented on the Board should always be considered, a director nominee should not be chosen nor excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual orientation or identity. In selecting a director nominee, the committee will focus on any special skills, expertise or background that would complement the existing Board, recognizing that the Company's businesses and operations are diverse and global in nature. 
​
12.
Directors should have reputations, both personal and professional, consistent with the Company's image and reputation. 
​
Process of Evaluation of Director Candidates
​
The Governance and Nominating Committee makes a preliminary review of a prospective director candidate's background, career experience and qualifications based on available information or information provided by an independent search firm, which identifies or provides an assessment of a candidate, or by a shareholder nominating or suggesting a candidate. If a consensus is reached by the committee that a particular candidate would likely contribute positively to the Board's mix of skills and experiences, and a Board vacancy exists or is likely to occur, the candidate is contacted to confirm his or her interest and willingness to serve. The committee conducts interviews and may invite other Board members or senior Arconic executives to interview the candidate to assess the candidate's overall qualifications. The committee considers the candidate against the criteria it has adopted in the context of the Board's then current composition and the needs of the Board and its committees.
At the conclusion of this process, the committee reports the results of its review to the full Board. The report includes a recommendation as to whether the candidate should be nominated for election to the Board. This procedure is the same for all candidates, including director candidates identified by shareholders.
The Governance and Nominating Committee retains from time to time the services of a search firm that specializes in identifying and evaluating director candidates. Services provided by the search firm include identifying potential director candidates meeting criteria established by the committee, verifying information about the prospective candidate's credentials, and obtaining a preliminary indication of interest and willingness to serve as a Board member.

2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Director Compensation
Our non-employee director compensation program is designed to attract and retain outstanding director candidates who have the requisite experience and background as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and to recognize the substantial time and effort necessary to exercise oversight of a complex global organization like Arconic and fulfill the other responsibilities required of our directors. Messrs. Doty and Plant, our employee directors, do not receive additional compensation for their Board service.
The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews director compensation periodically and recommends changes to the Board when it deems appropriate. In 2017, the committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC, to conduct an independent review of our director compensation program. Pearl Meyer & Partners assessed the structure of our director compensation program compared to competitive market practices of similarly situated companies. In addition, Pay Governance LLC, an independent compensation consultant, provided advice regarding Board Chairman compensation. Based on the market information and recommendations by Pearl Meyer & Partners and Pay Governance, and taking into account various factors, including the responsibilities and time commitment of the directors, the Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Board in turn, reviewed and adopted the compensation program for non-employee directors that was in effect during 2018. In February 2019, in connection with the appointment of our Chairman, John C. Plant, to also serve as our Chief Executive Officer and the concurrent appointment of Arthur D. Collins, Jr. as the Company's independent Lead Director, Pearl Meyer & Partners provided advice regarding Lead Director compensation. Based on the recommendations by Pearl Meyer & Partners, and taking into account various factors, the Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Board in turn, reviewed and adopted the current compensation program for non-employee directors. The Company's non-employee director compensation for 2018 and 2019 is summarized in the table below under "Director Fees."
Information regarding the retention of Pearl Meyer & Partners and Pay Governance can be found under "Corporate Governance—Compensation Consultants" on page 30.

​
Directors' Alignment with Shareholders
Stock Ownership Guideline for Directors
​
In order to further align the interests of our directors with the long-term interests of our shareholders, non-employee directors are required to own, until retirement from the Board, at least $750,000 in Arconic common stock. Compliance with the ownership value requirement is measured annually and if the stock price declines in value, directors must continue to invest in Arconic stock until the stock ownership guideline is reached. Effective as of December 5, 2017, each director is required to reach the stock ownership guideline within six years of his or her initial appointment as a non-employee director.
Under the director compensation program in effect prior to November 1, 2016, directors who were not in compliance with the ownership value requirement were required to invest at least 50% of the fees they received as directors in Arconic stock until the stock ownership guideline was reached, either by deferring fees into deferred share units under the Company's deferred fee plan for directors or purchasing shares on the open market. Deferred share units provide directors with the same economic interest as if they own Arconic common stock. Specifically, the deferred share units track the performance of our common stock and accrue dividend equivalents that are equal in value to dividends paid on our common stock. Upon a director's retirement from the Board, the deferred share units are settled in cash at a value equivalent to the then-prevailing market value of our common stock.
Beginning November 1, 2016, directors receive a portion of their annual compensation in Arconic deferred restricted share units, which count towards meeting the stock ownership value requirement. The annual deferred restricted share unit award vests on the first anniversary of the grant date, or, if earlier, the date of the next subsequent annual meeting of shareholders following the grant date, subject to continued service through the vesting date (however, accelerated vesting provisions apply for certain termination scenarios, such as death and change in control, and pro-rata vesting provisions apply in the event of a director's termination of service for any other reason). Settlement of the annual deferred restricted share units is deferred pursuant to the Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors. Also, beginning November 1, 2016, directors may elect to defer the cash portion of their annual compensation into additional Arconic deferred restricted share units (but not into deferred share units), as described under "Director Deferral Program" on page 20. Each Arconic deferred restricted share unit is an undertaking by the Company to issue to the recipient one share of Arconic common stock upon settlement.
Accordingly, whether a director holds shares of Arconic common stock, deferred share units or deferred restricted share units, directors have the same economic interest in the performance of the Company, which further aligns directors' interests with those of our shareholders.
The following table shows the aggregate value of each current director's holdings in Arconic common stock, deferred restricted share units, and deferred share units as of March 15, 2019, based on the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on that date. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Prohibitions against Short Sales, Hedging, Margin Accounts and Pledging

Company policy prohibits members of the Board of Directors from pledging, holding in margin accounts, or engaging in short sales or hedging transactions with respect to any of their Company stock.

In 2018, we did not issue any option awards to directors, and we do not have a non-equity incentive plan for directors. Accordingly, no such compensation is reported and we have omitted columns (d) and (e) from the table. In addition, the Company does not provide retirement benefits to non-employee directors. The last director to participate in the Company's Fee Continuation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (which was frozen in 1995) retired from the Board effective May 1, 2015. Further, the Company does not pay above-market or preferential earnings on fees that are deferred. The Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors and a predecessor plan have the same investment options as the Company's 401(k) tax-qualified savings plan for salaried employees. We therefore do not report changes in pension value or earnings on deferred fees and we have omitted column (f) from the table. 
​ Charles P. Blankenship, who served as a director and Chief Executive Officer upon joining the Company on January 15, 2018, received no compensation for service as a director; his executive compensation is reflected in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 54.
​ Fees Earned or Paid in Cash (Column (b)). This column reflects the cash fees earned by directors for Board and committee service in 2018, whether or not such fees were deferred.
​ Stock Awards (Column (c)). The amounts in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of deferred restricted share unit awards granted to each non-employee director under the 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718. Except as described below, the deferred restricted share unit award constitutes the equity portion of each director's compensation for service from the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in 2018 until the Company's annual meeting of shareholders in 2019 and vests over such period (however, accelerated vesting provisions apply for certain termination scenarios, such as death and change in control, and pro-rata vesting applies in the event of a director's termination of service for any other reason). The exact number of deferred restricted share units comprising an equity award is calculated by dividing the dollar value of the award (as specified in our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy) by the closing price of our common stock on the day of grant, rounded to the nearest whole share. The grant date fair value of each deferred restricted share unit granted to Mr. Hess on January 22, 2018 was $30.43. The grant date fair value of each deferred restricted share unit granted to Messrs. Albaugh, Ayers, Collins, Doty, Gupta, Hess, Mahoney, Miller, O'Neal, Plant and Schmidt and Ms. Alving on May 18, 2018 was $18.08. The grant date fair value of each deferred restricted share unit granted to Mr. Plant on October 23, 2018 was $20.65. As of December 31, 2018, the aggregate number of unvested deferred restricted share units outstanding for each non-employee director was as follows: Mr. Albaugh (8,296); Ms. Alving (8,296); Mr. Ayers (8,296); Mr. Collins (8,296); Mr. Doty (8,296); Mr. Gupta (8,296); Mr. Hess (8,296); Mr. Mahoney (8,296); Mr. Miller (8,296); Mr. O'Neal (8,296); Mr. Plant (14,591); and Mr. Schmidt (8,296). The foregoing numbers do not include deferred restricted share units that have vested—see "—Director Deferral Program" on page 20.
​ The amount listed in Column (b) represents (i) a cash retainer of  $120,000 for service as a non-employee director during 2018, (ii) a cash retainer of  $5,500 for service on the Audit Committee from January 1 through June 30, 2018 and (iii) cash fees of  $15,000 for meetings in excess of regularly scheduled meetings during 2018. The amount listed in Column (c) represents an annual equity award of 8,296 deferred restricted share units granted on May 18, 2018.
​ Ms. Alving was elected to the Board of Directors effective May 16, 2018. The amount listed in Column (b) represents (i) a cash retainer of  $75,161 for service as a non-employee director from May 16 through December 31, 2018, (ii) a cash retainer of  $5,500 for service on

Director Compensation (continued)
​
Director Deferral Program
Prior to November 1, 2016, non-employee directors were able to defer all or part of their cash compensation pursuant to the Company's 2005 Deferred Fee Plan for Directors (or a predecessor plan) and to invest any such deferred amounts into Arconic deferred share units or into the other investment options provided under the Company's 401(k) tax-qualified savings plan.
Beginning November 1, 2016, the Board of Directors adopted the Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors pursuant to which non-employee directors may elect to defer all or part of the cash portion of their annual compensation and to invest such deferred amounts into fully-vested Arconic restricted share units or into the investment options provided under the Company's 401(k) tax-qualified savings plan other than the Arconic Stock Fund (which represents Arconic deferred share units). The annual equity award granted to non-employee directors in the form of Arconic restricted share units is, by its terms, deferred under the Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors.
Deferred amounts are paid either in a lump sum or installments, as elected by the director, upon retirement from the Board of Directors. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Corporate Governance
Arconic is a values-based company. Our values guide our behavior at every level and apply across the Company on a global basis. The Board has adopted a number of policies to support our values and good corporate governance, which we believe are important to the success of our business and in advancing shareholder interests. We highlight below certain of our corporate governance practices and features:
Shareholder Engagement
Our directors and executive officers value direct and recurring engagement with our shareholders as part of our continuing efforts to create shareholder value, to refine our corporate governance practices and to address any shareholder concerns. Each year we seek opportunities to meet with, and receive input from, our shareholders, and we intend to continue to seek such opportunities in the future.
Proxy Access
Shareholders may nominate director candidates to Arconic's Board and include those nominees in Arconic's proxy statement in accordance with the Company's Bylaws.
Shareholders' Right to Call Special Meetings
Shareholders are permitted to call special meetings in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
Shareholders' Action by Written Consent
Shareholders may act by written consent in accordance with the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws.
Annual Election of Directors
The Board of Directors is not a classified board; each director is elected annually for a one-year term.
No Supermajority Voting Requirements
The Certificate of Incorporation does not contain any provisions that require a supermajority vote of shareholders.
Delaware Corporation
The Company is incorporated in Delaware, a leading jurisdiction with a comprehensive and coherent set of corporate laws that are responsive to the evolving legal and business needs of corporations.
Strong Independent Lead Director
The Board recognizes that in circumstances where the positions of Chairman and CEO are combined, a strong and independent Lead Director with a clearly defined role and set of responsibilities is paramount for constructive and effective leadership. Arconic's independent Lead Director has a clear mandate and significant authority and responsibilities, which are described below and in our Board-approved Corporate Governance Guidelines.
Prohibition against Short Sales, Hedging, Margin Accounts and Pledging
Our Insider Trading Policy contains restrictions that, among other things:
 prohibit short sales of Arconic securities and derivative or speculative transactions in Arconic securities; 
​
 prohibit the use of financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Arconic securities; and 
​
 prohibit directors and executive officers from holding Arconic securities in margin accounts or pledging Arconic securities as collateral. 
​
Commitment to Sustainability
The Company is committed to operating sustainably in the communities in which we do business. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

The Structure and Role of the Board of Directors
Board Leadership Structure
​
The Company's current Board leadership structure comprises a combined Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, an independent director serving as the Lead Director, and strong, active independent directors. The Board will continue to exercise its judgment under the circumstances at the time to evaluate the Board leadership structure that the Board believes will provide effective leadership, oversight and direction, while optimizing the functioning of both the Board and management and facilitating effective communication between the two. The Board has concluded that the current structure provides a well-functioning and effective balance between strong Company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent directors. A combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer confers advantages, including those listed below.
 By serving in both positions, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is able to draw on his detailed knowledge of the Company to provide the Board, in coordination with the Lead Director, leadership in focusing its discussions, review and oversight of the Company's strategy, business, and operating and financial performance. 
​
 A combined role ensures that the Company presents its message and strategy to stakeholders with a unified voice. 
​
 The structure allows for efficient decision-making and focused accountability. 
​
The Board believes that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders for Mr. Plant to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, considering the strong role of our independent Lead Director and other corporate governance practices providing independent oversight of management as set forth below.

The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
​
The Board of Directors is actively engaged in overseeing and reviewing the Company's strategic direction and objectives, taking into account, among other considerations, the Company's risk profile and exposures. It is management's responsibility to manage risk and bring to the Board's attention the most material risks to the Company. The Board has oversight responsibility of the processes established to report and monitor material risks applicable to the Company. The Board annually reviews the Company's enterprise risk management and receives regular updates on risk exposures.
The Board as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight, including succession planning relating to the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and risks relating to the competitive landscape, strategy, economic conditions, capital requirements, and operations of the Company. The committees of the Board also oversee the Company's risk profile and exposures relating to matters within the scope of their authority. The Board regularly receives detailed reports from the committees regarding risk oversight in their areas of responsibility.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews treasury risks (including those relating to cash generation, liquidity, insurance, credit, debt, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates), financial accounting and reporting risks, legal and compliance risks, and risks relating to information technology including cybersecurity, tax matters, asset impairments, contingencies, and internal controls.
The Cybersecurity Advisory Subcommittee was established by the Audit Committee to assist the Audit Committee in fulfilling its responsibility of reviewing the Company's enterprise risk relating to cybersecurity.
The Compensation and Benefits Committee considers risks related to the attraction and retention of talent, and the design of compensation programs and incentive arrangements.

Corporate Governance (continued)
​
Our policy on Board diversity relates to the selection of nominees for the Board. Our policy provides that while diversity and variety of experiences and viewpoints represented on the Board should always be considered, a director nominee should not be chosen nor excluded solely or largely because of race, color, gender, national origin or sexual orientation or identity. In selecting a director nominee, the Governance and Nominating Committee focuses on skills, expertise and background that would complement the existing Board, recognizing that the Company's businesses and operations are diverse and global in nature.
The following chart shows the tenure of the directors on our Board following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, assuming that all of the director nominees are elected to new terms. The board tenure provides a mix of fresh perspectives and Company experience, which contributes to a rich dialogue representing a range of viewpoints.
​
Board Meetings and Attendance
​
The Board met 14 times in 2018. The number of Board committee meetings can be found below in "—Committees of the Board." Attendance by incumbent directors at Board and committee meetings averaged 97%. Each incumbent director attended 75% or more of the aggregate of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during 2018 (or, in the case of Ms. Alving, who joined the Board in May 2018, 75% or more of the aggregate of all such meetings after joining the Board).
Under Arconic's Corporate Governance Guidelines, all directors are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. Twelve out of the then-thirteen members of the Board, including all incumbent directors, attended the Company's 2018 annual meeting. In addition to Board meetings, directors visit Arconic business operations to deepen their understanding of the Company and interact with on-site employees. In addition, new directors receive an orientation that includes meetings with key members of management and visits to Company facilities.
Board, Committee and Director Evaluations
​
The Board of Directors annually assesses the effectiveness of the full Board, the operations of its committees and the contributions of director nominees. The Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the evaluation of the Board as a whole and its committees, as well as individual evaluations of those directors who are being considered for possible re-nomination to the Board.

Committees of the Board
There are four standing committees of the Board and one subcommittee of the Audit Committee. The Board has adopted written charters for each committee and subcommittee, which are available on our website at http://www.arconic.com under "Investors—Corporate Governance—Committees."
The table below sets forth the standing Board committees and subcommittee and the members of each as of March 15, 2019. Each of the Audit, Compensation and Benefits, Finance, and Governance and Nominating Committees is composed solely of directors who have been determined by the Board of Directors to be independent in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regulations, NYSE listing standards and the Company's Director Independence Standards (including the heightened independence standards for members of the Audit and Compensation and Benefits Committees).

Voting for Directors
Arconic's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws provide a majority voting standard for election of directors in uncontested elections. If the number of shares voted "for" an incumbent director's election does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election (with votes cast including votes against in each case and excluding abstentions and broker nonvotes with respect to that director's election) in an uncontested election, the nominee must promptly tender his or her resignation, and the Board will decide, through a process managed by the Governance and Nominating Committee and excluding the nominee, whether to accept the resignation at its next regularly scheduled Board meeting. The Board's explanation of its decision will be promptly disclosed in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. Any director nominee not already serving on the Board who fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election will not be elected to the Board. An election of directors is considered to be contested if the number of candidates for election as directors exceeds the number of directors to be elected, with the determination being made in accordance with the Bylaws.
Communications with Directors
The Board of Directors is committed to meaningful engagement with Arconic shareholders and welcomes input and suggestions. Shareholders and other interested parties wishing to contact the Lead Director or the non-management directors as a group may do so by sending a written communication to the attention of the Lead Director c/o Arconic Inc., Corporate Secretary's Office, 390 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022-4608. To communicate issues or complaints regarding questionable accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, send a written communication to the Audit Committee c/o Arconic Inc., Corporate Secretary's Office, 390 Park Avenue, New York, NY 10022-4608. Alternatively, you may place an anonymous, confidential, toll free call in the United States to Arconic's Integrity Line at 855-585-8256. For a listing of Integrity Line telephone numbers outside the United States, go to http://www.arconic.com under "Who We Are—How We Work—Ethics and Compliance."
Communications addressed to the Board or to a Board member are distributed to the Board or to any individual director or directors as appropriate, depending upon the facts and circumstances outlined in the communication.
The Board of Directors has asked the Corporate Secretary's Office to submit to the Board all communications received, excluding only those items that are not related to Board duties and responsibilities, such as junk mail and mass mailings; product complaints and product inquiries; new product or technology suggestions; job inquiries and resumes; advertisements or solicitations; and surveys.
Director Independence
In its Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board recognizes that independence depends not only on directors' individual relationships, but also on the directors' overall attitude. Providing objective, independent judgment is at the core of the Board's oversight function. Under the Company's Director Independence Standards, which conform to the corporate governance listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, a director is not considered "independent" unless the Board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company or any subsidiary in the consolidated group. The Director Independence Standards comprise a list of all categories of material relationships affecting the determination of a director's independence. Any relationship that falls below a threshold set forth in the Director Independence Standards, or is not otherwise listed in the Director Independence Standards, and is not required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K, is deemed to be an immaterial relationship.
The Board has affirmatively determined that all the directors are independent except Messrs. Doty and Plant, who are employed by the Company and therefore do not meet the independence standards set forth in the Director Independence Standards. In the course of its determination regarding independence, the Board did not find any material relationships between the Company and any of the directors, other than Messrs. Doty's and Plant's employment. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

Related Person Transactions
Review, Approval and Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons
​
The Company has a written Related Person Transaction Approval Policy regarding the review, approval and ratification of transactions between the Company and related persons. The policy applies to any transaction in which the Company or a Company subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A related person means any director or executive officer of the Company, any nominee for director, any shareholder known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, and any immediate family member of any such person.
Under this policy, reviews are conducted by management to determine which transactions or relationships should be referred to the Governance and Nominating Committee for consideration. The Governance and Nominating Committee then reviews the material facts and circumstances regarding a transaction and determines whether to approve, ratify, revise or reject a related person transaction, or to refer it to the full Board or another committee of the Board for consideration. The Company's Related Person Transaction Approval Policy operates in conjunction with other aspects of the Company's compliance program, including its Business Conduct Policies, which require that all directors, officers and employees have a duty to be free from the influence of any conflict of interest when they represent the Company in negotiations or make recommendations with respect to dealings with third parties, or otherwise carry out their duties with respect to the Company.
The Board has considered the following types of potential related person transactions and pre-approved them under the Company's Related Person Transaction Approval Policy as not presenting material conflicts of interest:
(i)
employment of Arconic executive officers (except employment of an Arconic executive officer that is an immediate family member of another Arconic executive officer, director, or nominee for director) as long as the Compensation and Benefits Committee has approved the executive officers' compensation;
​
(ii)
director compensation that the Board has approved;
​
(iii)
any transaction with another entity in which the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of  $1,000,000 or 2% of the other entity's total annual revenues, if a related person's interest arises only from:
​
 (a)
such person's position as an employee or executive officer of the other entity; or
​
 (b)
such person's position as a director of the other entity; or
​
 (c)
the ownership by such person, together with his or her immediate family members, of less than a 10% equity interest in the aggregate in the other entity (other than a partnership); or
​
 (d)
both such position as a director and ownership as described in (b) and (c) above; or
​
 (e)
such person's position as a limited partner in a partnership in which the person, together with his or her immediate family members, have an interest of less than 10%;
​
(iv)
charitable contributions in which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer), or a director or trustee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of  $250,000 or 2% of the charitable organization's total annual receipts;
​
(v)
transactions, such as the receipt of dividends, in which all shareholders receive proportional benefits;
​
(vi)
transactions involving competitive bids;
​
(vii)
transactions involving the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; and
​
(viii)
transactions with a related person involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services.

Transactions with Related Persons in 2018
​
Based on information provided by the directors, the executive officers, and the Company's legal department, the Governance and Nominating Committee determined that there are no material related person transactions to be reported in this proxy statement. We indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law against personal liability in connection with their service to the Company. This indemnity is required under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the Bylaws, and we have entered into agreements with these individuals contractually obligating us to provide this indemnification to them.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No member of the Compensation and Benefits Committee has served as one of our officers or employees at any time. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the compensation committee of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Board. None of our executive officers serves as a member of the board of directors of any other company that has an executive officer serving as a member of our Compensation and Benefits Committee.
Compensation Consultants
During 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee continued its retention of Pay Governance LLC as its independent compensation consultant. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Philosophy and Design—Compensation Decision-Making Process—Use of Independent Compensation Consultant." The committee assessed Pay Governance's independence and found no conflict of interest. In its assessment, the committee took into account the following factors:
 Pay Governance provides no other services to the Company; 
​
 the amount of fees received from the Company by Pay Governance as a percentage of Pay Governance's total revenue; 
​
 the policies and procedures that Pay Governance has in place to prevent conflicts of interest; 
​
 any business or personal relationships between the consultant(s) at Pay Governance performing consulting services and any Compensation and Benefits Committee members or any executive officer; and 
​
 any ownership of Company stock by the consultant(s). 
​
In addition, during 2018, the Governance and Nominating Committee continued to retain Pearl Meyer & Partners to provide consultation services regarding non-employee director compensation. The committee did not find any conflict of interest with Pearl Meyer and considered the following factors in its determination:
 Pearl Meyer provides no other services to the Company; 
​
 the amount of fees received from the Company by Pearl Meyer as a percentage of Pearl Meyer's total revenue; 
​
 the policies and procedures that Pearl Meyer has in place to prevent conflicts of interest; 
​
 any business or personal relationships between the consultant(s) at Pearl Meyer performing consulting services and any Board members or any executive officer; and 
​
 any ownership of Company stock by the consultant(s).

Business Conduct Policies and Code of Ethics
The Company's Business Conduct Policies, which have been in place for many years, apply equally to the directors and to all officers and employees of the Company, as well as those of our controlled subsidiaries, affiliates and joint ventures. The directors and employees in positions to make discretionary decisions are surveyed annually regarding their compliance with the policies.
The Company also has a Code of Ethics applicable to the CEO, CFO and other financial professionals, including the principal accounting officer, and those subject to it are surveyed annually for compliance with it. Only the Audit Committee can amend or grant waivers from the provisions of the Company's Code of Ethics, and any such amendments or waivers will be posted promptly at http://www.arconic.com. To date, no such amendments have been made or waivers granted.
Recovery of Incentive Compensation
The Board of Directors adopted the following policy in 2006:
If the Board learns of any misconduct by an executive officer that contributed to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, it shall take such action as it deems necessary to remedy the misconduct, prevent its recurrence and, if appropriate, based on all relevant facts and circumstances, take remedial action against the wrongdoer in a manner it deems appropriate. In determining what remedies to pursue, the Board shall take into account all relevant factors, including whether the restatement was the result of negligent, intentional or gross misconduct. The Board will, to the full extent permitted by governing law, in all appropriate cases, require reimbursement of any bonus or incentive compensation awarded to an executive officer or effect the cancellation of unvested restricted or deferred stock awards previously granted to the executive officer if: (a) the amount of the bonus or incentive compensation was calculated based upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement; (b) the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement; and (c) the amount of the bonus or incentive compensation that would have been awarded to the executive had the financial results been properly reported would have been lower than the amount actually awarded. In addition, the Board may dismiss the executive officer, authorize legal action for breach of fiduciary duty or take such other action to enforce the executive's obligations to Arconic Inc. as the Board determines fit the facts surrounding the particular case. The Board may, in determining appropriate remedial action, take into account penalties or punishments imposed by third parties, such as law enforcement agencies, regulators or other authorities. The Board's power to determine the appropriate punishment for the wrongdoer is in addition to, and not in replacement of, remedies imposed by such entities.
The 2009 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan, the 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, the Incentive Compensation Plan for annual cash incentives and the Arconic Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) Compliant Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan each incorporate the terms of this policy.

2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors and executive officers, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company's common stock and other equity securities with the SEC within specified periods. Due to the complexity of the reporting rules, the Company undertakes to file such reports on behalf of its directors and executive officers and has instituted procedures to assist them with these obligations. Based solely on a review of filings with the SEC and written representations from the Company's directors and executive officers, the Company believes that in 2018 all of its directors and executive officers filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a), with the exception of  (i) director David P. Hess, who filed a late Form 4 on March 22, 2018, reporting the grant of restricted share units on January 22, 2018; (ii) Vice President and Controller W. Paul Myron, who filed a late Form 4 on May 23, 2018, reporting the grant of restricted share units on May 16, 2018; and (iii) Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary Katherine H. Ramundo, who filed a late Form 4 on May 23, 2018, reporting the grant of restricted share units on May 16, 2018. The untimeliness of each of the foregoing Form 4s was due to administrative error by the Company.

Stock Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers
The following table shows the ownership of Arconic common stock, deferred share units, and deferred restricted share units, as of March 15, 2019, by each director, each of the named executive officers, and all directors and executive officers (serving as of March 15, 2019) as a group.
Deferred share units provide holders with the same economic interest as if they own Arconic common stock. Upon a holder's separation from the Company, the deferred share units are settled in cash at a value equivalent to the then-prevailing market value of our common stock.
Each Arconic deferred restricted share unit is an undertaking by the Company to issue to the recipient one share of Arconic common stock upon settlement. Deferred amounts are paid either in a lump sum or installments, as elected by the director, upon retirement from the Board.

Item 2 Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Under its written charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has sole authority and is directly responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation, oversight, evaluation and termination of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the Company's financial statements.
The Audit Committee annually evaluates the qualifications, performance and independence of the Company's independent auditors. Based on its evaluation, the Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or its predecessor firms have served continuously as the Company's independent auditors since 1950. The Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The Audit Committee is responsible for the approval of the engagement fees and terms associated with the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. In addition to assuring the regular rotation of the lead audit partner as required by law, the Audit Committee is involved in the selection and evaluation of the lead audit partner and considers whether, in order to assure continuing auditor independence, there should be a regular rotation of the independent registered public accounting firm.
Although the Company's Bylaws do not require that we seek shareholder ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, we are doing so as a matter of good corporate governance. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by shareholders.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ITEM 2, to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.   TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Item 2 Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (continued)
​
Report of the Audit Committee
In accordance with its written charter, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for assisting the Board to fulfill its oversight of:
 the integrity of the Company's financial statements and internal controls, 
​
 the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, 
​
 the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, and 
​
 the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors. 
​
It is the responsibility of the Company's management to prepare the Company's financial statements and to develop and maintain adequate systems of internal accounting and financial controls. The Company's internal auditors are responsible for conducting internal audits intended to evaluate the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's financial and operating internal control systems.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2018 (the "independent auditors"), is responsible for performing independent audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors also review the Company's interim financial statements in accordance with applicable auditing standards.
In evaluating the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the Audit Committee has (i) received the written disclosures and the letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) regarding the audit firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, (ii) discussed with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP the firm's independence from the Company and management and (iii) considered whether PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has assured that the lead audit partner is rotated at least every five years in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission and PCAOB requirements, and considered whether there should be a regular rotation of the audit firm itself in order to assure the continuing independence of the outside auditors. The Audit Committee has concluded that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP is independent from the Company and its management.
The Audit Committee has reviewed with the independent auditors and the Company's internal auditors the overall scope and specific plans for their respective audits, and the Audit Committee regularly monitored the progress of both in assessing the Company's compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including their findings, required resources and progress to date.
At every regular meeting, the Audit Committee meets separately, and without management present, with the independent auditors and the Company's Vice President—Internal Audit to review the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's accounting and financial reporting. The Audit Committee also meets separately at its regular meetings with the Chief Financial Officer and the Chief Legal Officer, and meets separately twice a year with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer.
The Audit Committee has met and discussed with management and the independent auditors the fair and complete presentation of the Company's financial statements. The Audit Committee has also discussed and reviewed with the independent auditors all communications required by GAAP, including those described in Auditing Standards No. 16, "Communication with Audit Committees", as adopted by the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has discussed significant accounting policies applied in the financial statements, as well as alternative treatments. Management has represented that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with both management and the independent auditors.

Item 2 Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (continued)

Relying on the foregoing reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board approved, inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the Audit Committee has approved, subject to shareholder ratification, the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

Audit and Non-Audit Fees
The following table shows fees for professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) for the past two fiscal years ended December 31 (in millions):
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​ ​ ​  2018   ​ ​ ​  2017   ​ 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures for pre-approval of audit, audit-related, tax and other services, and for pre-approval of fee levels for such services. See "Attachment A–Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures for Audit and Non-Audit Services." All services set forth in the table above were approved by the Audit Committee before being rendered.
Audit Fees include the base audit fee, effects of foreign currency exchange rates on the base audit fee, and scope adjustments to the base audit requirements. The decrease in audit fees from 2017 to 2018 was principally due to changes in statutory auditors, partially offset by non-recurring audit work.
Audit-Related Fees include due diligence and audit services for divestitures and agreed-upon or expanded audit procedures for accounting or regulatory requirements. The increase in audit-related fees from 2017 to 2018 was principally due to services for potential transactions.
Tax Fees include U.S. federal, state and local tax support, international tax support, and review and preparation of tax returns.
All Other Fees include benchmarking services across a number of Arconic entities.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

Item 3 Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Board of Directors is asking you to approve, on an advisory basis, the executive compensation programs and policies and the resulting 2018 compensation of the individuals listed in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 54 (our "named executive officers"), as described in this proxy statement.
Because the vote is advisory, the result will not be binding on the Compensation and Benefits Committee and it will not affect, limit or augment any existing compensation or awards. The Compensation and Benefits Committee will, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements.
The Board has determined that advisory votes on executive compensation will be submitted to shareholders on an annual basis, at least until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of shareholder votes in 2023. The next advisory vote on executive compensation will occur at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
We believe you should read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the compensation tables in determining whether to approve this proposal.
The Board of Directors recommends approval of the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ITEM 3, to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as stated in the above resolution.
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") has:
1.
reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement; and

2.
based on the review and discussions referred to in paragraph (1) above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's proxy statement relating to the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Leadership Team Transitions
​
Effective as of February 6, 2019, Chairman of the Board John C. Plant was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), succeeding Chip Blankenship as CEO. In addition, board member Elmer L. Doty was appointed to serve as President and Chief Operating Officer (COO). Mr. Blankenship had been appointed as CEO of Arconic on January 15, 2018 and had replaced David P. Hess who stepped down as Interim CEO but remained a board member.
Other management changes included the February 2019 departure of Mark J. Krakowiak, then Executive Vice President, Strategy and Development, and the resignation of Eric V. Roegner as Executive Vice President and Group President, EP&S in April 2018. The presidents of the three business units comprising EP&S—Arconic Engineered Structures, Arconic Engines, and Arconic Fastening Systems—currently report directly to Mr. Doty.
Investor Feedback and Implementation of 2018 Compensation Strategy
​
With 95% of the votes cast at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders in favor of our say-on-pay proposal, our investors reinforced their support of our compensation philosophy and design. Arconic also solicits feedback from investors on a regular basis throughout the year. Investor engagement offers us an opportunity to obtain investor comments and insights related to investors' policies and views on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Arconic management and the Compensation Committee take into consideration investor feedback when it reviews annually the best practices of comparable companies with respect to compensation design and mix, short-term and long-term performance metrics, long-term incentive mix by award type, performance periods, vesting provisions, short-term and long-term incentive payout history, and stock ownership guidelines. Overall, in 2018, there was positive investor feedback to the significant changes to our executive compensation practices that were made in 2017, including (1) the application of a three-year performance period for performance restricted share units (RSUs); (2) the addition of a return metric (return on net assets) for  TABLE OF CONTENTS

performance RSUs; and (3) the addition of a relative total shareholder return (TSR) multiplier for performance RSUs. The Compensation Committee took into consideration this feedback and additional factors when making compensation decisions for 2018, including as follows:

2018 Company Performance
​
Arconic's revenue in 2018 was $14.0 billion, up 8% year over year, driven by higher volumes across all business segments; higher aluminum prices and favorable product mix primarily in the Global Rolled Products segment; and favorable foreign currency movements; partially offset by a decline in volumes in the industrial gas turbine end market; lower sales from the divestitures of the Latin America extrusions business (divested in April 2018) and the rolling mill in Fusina, Italy (divested in March 2017); the ramp-down of Arconic's North American packaging operations; and costs related to settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to new product introductions.
Net income in 2018 was $642 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, versus a net loss of  $74 million, or $0.28 per share, in 2017. Net income excluding special items in 2018 was $676 million, or $1.36 per share, versus $618 million, or $1.22 per share, in 2017. Operating income in 2018 was $1.3 billion versus $480 million in 2017. Operating income excluding special items in 2018 was $1.4 billion versus $1.5 billion in 2017, down 4%, as higher volumes were more than offset by unfavorable product pricing and mix and higher aluminum prices.
During the first quarter of 2018, Arconic completed the early redemption of its remaining outstanding 5.72% Notes due in 2019, with aggregate principal amount of  $500 million, for $518 million in cash including accrued and unpaid interest. The Company ended the year with debt of  $6.3 billion and cash on hand of  $2.3 billion. In 2018, cash provided from operations was $217 million, cash used for financing activities was $649 million, and cash provided from investing activities was $565 million. Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the year was $465 million. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

2018 Incentive Compensation Results
​
Consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance practices, a shortfall against targets in 2018 resulted in payouts that were well below target for annual incentive compensation and below target for long-term incentive compensation. The corporate annual incentive compensation plan had a payout of 18.5% based on 2018 performance against the targets set under the plan. One-third of the 2016 performance-based restricted share unit awards was earned at 55.5% based on performance against targets for the 2018 annual performance period. LTI performance-based restricted share unit awards granted since 2017 are based on three-year performance periods: 2017–2019 for the 2017 grant and 2018–2020 for the 2018 grant.
Compensation Philosophy and Design
Arconic's executive compensation philosophy to provide pay for performance and shareholder alignment underlies our 2018 compensation structure, which is designed based on four guiding principles:
 Make equity long-term incentive (LTI) compensation the most significant portion of total compensation for senior executives and managers, increasing the proportion of performance-based equity incentives with the level of responsibility. 
​
 Choose annual incentive compensation (IC) metrics and LTI metrics that focus management's actions on achieving the greatest positive impact on Arconic's financial performance and that include a means to assess and motivate performance relative to peers. 
​
 Set annual IC and LTI targets that challenge management to achieve continuous improvement in performance and deliver long-term growth. 
​
 Target total compensation at median of market, while using annual IC and LTI compensation to motivate performance and to attract and retain exceptional talent.

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)
​
Long-Term Incentives and Pay at Risk
​
Consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy and guiding principles, including emphasis on LTI as the most significant portion of compensation, 2018 annual target total direct compensation for Mr. Blankenship included nearly 90% pay at risk (excluding special one-time sign-on equity and cash awards):
Annual target total direct compensation in 2018 (excluding any special one-time awards) for our other NEOs who served the entire year also had a strong emphasis on equity and pay at risk:
Messrs. Blankenship and Krakowiak received special one-time grants of restricted share units and/or stock options subject to time-based vesting in connection with their commencement of employment with us (which awards have since been forfeited in their entirety due to each executive's separation from the Company). In addition, Ms. Ramundo received a special one-time retention RSU award in 2018. Details of these awards are discussed further below. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)
​
The following shows the proportion of LTI awards granted in the form of performance-based awards to Mr. Blankenship, as well as the continuing NEOs, compared to the median proportion of LTI performance-based awards granted among our CEO peer group in 2018:
Our allocation of LTI compensation in the form of performance-based awards is consistently the highest percentage compared to the 16 companies in our CEO peer group, based on such companies' prior year disclosures (see "CD&A— Comparator Peer Groups" for the list of the peers).
Challenging Payout Curves
​
The Compensation Committee has continued the practice of setting payout curves with a steep drop-off below target to incentivize hitting target and flatter curve above target so that higher payouts can only be earned with significant performance above target.
Under the 2018 annual cash IC plan:
 earning 50% of the payout required performance at 95% of target for the adjusted operating income metric and 97% of target for the controllable free cash flow metric; and 
​
 earning 150% payout level required performance at 112% of target for the adjusted operating income metric and 117% of target for the controllable free cash flow metric. 
​
Under the 2018 LTI plan (for the 2018 performance period applicable to the third tranche of the 2016 performance RSU grant):
 earning 50% of the payout required performance at 87% of target for the RONA metric, 99% of target for the revenue metric, and 94% of target for the EBITDA margin metric; and 
​
 earning 150% of the payout required performance at 132% of target for the RONA metric, 104% of target for the revenue metric, and 117% of target for the EBITDA margin metric. 
​
Investor Engagement and Benchmarking
​
We actively engage in compensation and governance-related discussions with investors throughout the year to obtain comments and insights that guide our executive compensation programs. Conversations with our investors' governance and compensation professionals help us understand investor priorities and provide us with guidance on our compensation and governance practices. In 2018, we continued our ongoing dialogue with investors, holding meetings and calls with governance and compensation professionals at 18 of our largest 50 shareholders.
The Company also conducts an annual comparative study of the 16 companies in Arconic's CEO peer group (see "CD&A—Comparator Peer Groups"). The study reviews compensation design and mix, short-term and long-term performance metrics, long-term incentive mix by award type, performance periods, vesting provisions, short-term and long-term incentive payout history, stock ownership guidelines and change-in-control provisions. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)
​
The investor insights and results from the peer benchmarking study guided the Compensation Committee in the 2018 design of Arconic's executive compensation programs and practices.
Compensation Decision-Making Process in 2018
​
Use of Independent Compensation Consultant. The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to retain its own advisors, including compensation consultants. In 2018, the Compensation Committee directly retained Pay Governance LLC, which is independent and without conflicts of interest with the Company. See "Corporate Governance—Compensation Consultants" on page 30. Pay Governance provided advice, as requested by the Compensation Committee, on the amount and form of certain executive compensation components, including, among other things, executive compensation best practices, insights concerning Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and say-on-pay policies, analysis and review of the Company's compensation plans for executives and advice on setting the CEO's compensation. Pay Governance also provided advice on the CD&A in this proxy statement. We use comparative compensation data from the proxy statements of the CEO peer group companies and survey data from Willis Towers Watson to help evaluate whether our compensation programs are competitive with the market. The latter is not customized based on parameters developed by Willis Towers Watson. Willis Towers Watson does not provide any advice or recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the amount or form of executive or director compensation.
Use of Peer Groups and Tally Sheets. The Compensation Committee uses peer group data to determine the target compensation levels of our CEO and other NEOs. We aim to set target annual direct compensation of each of our NEOs at the median of the applicable peer group. In making annual compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee also reviews tally sheets that summarize various elements of historic and current compensation for each NEO. This information includes compensation opportunity, actual compensation realized, and wealth accumulation. We have found that the tally sheets help us synthesize the various components of our compensation programs in making decisions.
Conservative Compensation Risk Profile. We evaluate the risk profile of our compensation programs when establishing policies and approving plan design. These evaluations have noted numerous factors that effectively manage or mitigate compensation risk, including the following:
 A balance of corporate and business unit weighting in incentive compensation programs; 
​
 A balanced mix between short-term and long-term incentives; 
​
 Caps on incentives; 
​
 Use of multiple performance measures in the annual cash incentive compensation plan and the equity LTI plan; 
​
 Discretion retained by the Compensation Committee to adjust awards; 
​
 Stock ownership guidelines requiring holding substantial equity in the Company until retirement; 
​
 Claw-back policies applicable to all forms of incentive compensation; 
​
 Anti-hedging provisions in the Company's Insider Trading Policy; and 
​
 Restricting stock options to 20% of the value of equity awards to senior officers. 
​
In addition, (i) no business unit has a compensation structure significantly different from that of other units or that deviates significantly from the Company's overall risk and reward structure; (ii) unlike financial institutions involved in the financial crisis, where leverage exceeded capital by many multiples, the Company has a conservative leverage policy; and (iii) compensation incentives are not based on the results of speculative trading. In 1994, the Board of Directors adopted resolutions creating the Strategic Risk Management Committee with oversight of hedging and derivative risks and a mandate to use such instruments to manage risk and not for speculative purposes. As a result of these evaluations, we have determined that it is not reasonably likely that risks arising from our compensation and benefit plans would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Tax Deductibility and our Incentive Compensation Plans. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, restricts deductibility for federal income tax purposes of annual individual compensation in excess of  $1 million paid to covered executive officers. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Section 162(m)'s deductibility limitation was subject to an exception for compensation that meets the requirements of "qualified performance-based compensation." However, effective for tax years beginning after 2017, this exception has been eliminated, subject to limited transition relief that applies to certain written binding contracts which were in effect on  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis (continued)
​
November 2, 2017. Accordingly, for 2018 and later years, compensation in excess of  $1 million paid to our covered NEOs generally will not be deductible and no assurances can be given that compensation payable under certain of our compensation programs which were intended to qualify for the performance-based exception will in fact be deductible.
As a general matter, while the Compensation Committee considers tax deductibility as one of several relevant factors in determining executive compensation, it retains the flexibility to approve compensation that is not deductible by Arconic for federal income tax purposes. Further, the Compensation Committee believes that a significant portion of our NEOs' compensation should continue to be tied to Arconic's performance, notwithstanding the elimination of the qualified performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m).
Compliance with Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our stock ownership requirements further align the interests of management with those of our shareholders by requiring executives to hold substantial equity in Arconic until retirement. Our stock ownership guidelines require that the CEO retain equity equal in value to six times his base salary and that each of the other continuing NEOs retain equity equal in value to three times salary. Unlike many of our peers, we do not count any unvested or unexercised options, restricted share units, performance-based restricted share units or any stock appreciation rights towards compliance. Our guidelines reinforce management's focus on long-term shareholder value and commitment to the Company. Until the stock ownership requirements are met, each executive is required to retain until retirement 50% of shares acquired upon vesting of restricted share units (including performance-based restricted shares units) or upon exercise of stock options that vest after March 1, 2011, after deducting shares used to pay for the option exercise price and taxes. As of January 31, 2019, the continuing NEOs listed in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table—Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers and Ms. Ramundo—who were appointed to their respective positions within the past three years, had not yet met the guidelines.
No Short Sales, Derivative or Speculative Transactions, Hedging, or Pledging of Arconic Securities. Short sales of Arconic securities (a sale of securities which are not then owned) and derivative or speculative transactions in Arconic securities by our directors, officers and employees are prohibited. No director, officer or employee or any designee of such director, officer or employee is permitted to purchase or use financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Arconic securities. Directors and officers subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are prohibited from holding Arconic securities in margin accounts, pledging Arconic securities as collateral, or maintaining an automatic rebalance feature in savings plans, deferred compensation plans or deferred fee plans.
Compensation Decisions
Analysis of 2018 Compensation Decisions
​
The Compensation Committee uses its business judgment to determine the appropriate compensation targets and awards for the NEOs, in addition to assessing several factors that include:
 Market positioning based on peer group data (described below); 
​
 Individual, Group, and Corporate performance; 
​
 Complexity and importance of the role and responsibilities; 
​
 Aggressiveness of targets; 
​
 Contributions that positively impact the Company's future performance; 
​
 Unanticipated events impacting target achievement; 
​
 Retention of key individuals in a competitive talent market; and 
​
 Leadership and growth potential. 
​
Based on these factors, an individual multiplier between 0% and 150% is applied to each NEO IC award and equity grant target to reflect the Committee's assessment of the individual's 2018 performance. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​

​  2018 Median Revenue: $14.535 billion  ​ 
[END TABLE]
Arconic's peer group used to make 2018 compensation decisions for executives other than the CEO consisted of companies heavily weighted towards industrials with revenues between $6 billion and $26 billion. See "Attachment B—Arconic Inc. Peer Group Companies for Market Information for 2018 Executive Compensation Decisions."
The data from each of these peer groups described above is considered in establishing executive compensation targets and to ensure that Arconic provides and maintains compensation levels in line with the market, including similar companies, and to attract, retain and motivate employees.
2018 Base Salary and Target Annual Incentive Compensation Levels
Base salaries and target annual incentive compensation levels are designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain executive talent, as well as to align pay with performance. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee determines each NEO's targeted total cash compensation (salary and target incentive compensation), taking into consideration alignment to market data of industry peers.
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Compensation
​
Each of our NEOs, other than Mr. Hess, was eligible to participate in our corporate annual cash IC plan for 2018. The corporate annual cash IC plan for 2018 was designed to achieve operating goals set at the beginning of the year based on the financial measures set forth in the following table. Our payout of 18.5% was based on 2018 actual performance versus IC plan target. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​

The Compensation Committee also took into account individual performance factors in setting each NEO's annual IC payment. In addition, for Messrs. Myers and Roegner, who led business groups in 2018, the performance of the applicable business group factored into their annual cash IC award.

2018 Equity Awards: Stock Options and Performance-Based Restricted Share Units
​
Long-term stock incentives are performance-based. We grant long-term stock awards to NEOs to align their interests with those of shareholders, link their compensation to stock price performance over a multi-year period and support their retention. In January 2018, stock awards were made to all of the NEOs, excluding Mr. Hess in his role as Interim CEO and Mr. Krakowiak who joined the company after our grant date for annual awards (but who instead received a special sign-on equity award, as detailed below).
In general, we provide two types of annual equity awards to NEOs and our senior-most executives:
 Approximately 20% of the grant date value of 2018 LTI equity awards for each of our NEOs is granted in the form of stock options. We believe that stock options further align our NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders because the options have no value unless the stock price increases. Stock options vest ratably over a three-year period (one-third vests each year on the anniversary of the grant date) subject to continued employment (subject to certain exceptions) and have a ten-year term. We grant stock options to our NEOs at a fixed time every year, generally, as in 2018, on the date of the Board and Compensation Committee meetings in January. The exercise price of employee stock options is the closing price of our stock on the grant date, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange. 
​
 Approximately 80% of the grant date value of 2018 LTI equity awards for each of our NEOs was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units. 
​
Performance-based restricted share units support longer-term operational targets, which differ from the financial metrics in our IC plan. The awards granted in 2018 will be earned based on the performance metrics as follows (specific targets and results will be disclosed at the end of the 2018–2020 performance period): Total Shareholder Return defined as the change in stock price plus reinvested dividends expressed as a percentage, which will be measured from 12/31/2017 to 12/31/2020 and ranked after the 3-year period

2018 Performance Results for Performance-Based Restricted Share Units – 2016 Grant
Prior to 2017, performance-based restricted share unit awards were earned at the end of a three-year performance period based on the average of the annual payout percentages over the three-year period. Consequently, grants made in 2016 were still subject to the 2018 annual performance period, which represents the final one-third tranche of the 2016 grant. The results for the 2018 performance period of the 2016 grant were as follows:

The 2016 grant, which vested in January 2019 after the three-year 2016–2018 performance period, was the last outstanding award to include an annual performance period, with the final one-third tranche subject to the 2018 annual performance period. LTI performance-based restricted share unit awards granted since 2017 are based on three-year performance periods: 2017–2019 for the 2017 grant and 2018–2020 for the 2018 grant.

Individual Compensation Arrangements and Performance-Based Pay Decisions
​
Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer – Kenneth J. Giacobbe
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Giacobbe performance share awards and stock options with a total grant-date value of  $1,200,140, taking into consideration relevant peer company data and based on his individual performance in 2017. Eighty percent of the award ($960,089) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units, and 20% ($240,051) in stock options, which was in line with his target award. To better align his pay with those of industry peer companies and based on his individual performance review in 2017, Mr. Giacobbe received a base salary increase in 2018 of 3% over his then most current 2017 base salary. Despite continued strong individual performance and substantial contributions to the strategy review in 2018, Mr. Giacobbe's annual IC award for 2018 of  $94,813 was below target at 18.5%, which was based on the final Corporate IC plan total weighted result of 18.5%, as described above, and a corresponding 100% individual multiplier.
Executive Vice President and Group President, Global Rolled Products and Transportation and Construction Solutions – Timothy D. Myers
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Myers performance share awards and stock options with a total grant-date value of  $1,320,225, taking into consideration relevant peer company data and based on his individual performance in 2017. Eighty percent of the award ($1,056,189) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units, and 20% ($264,036) in stock options, which was above the target award based on his strong performance leading the combined GRP and TCS groups in 2017. To better align his pay with those of industry peer companies and based on his individual performance review in 2017, Mr. Myers received a base salary increase in 2018 of 4% over his then most current 2017 base salary. Despite continued strong individual performance in 2018, Mr. Myers' annual IC award for 2018 of  $233,818 was below target at 43.1%. The award was based on the final Corporate (weighted at 40%) and combined TCS and GRP IC plan (weighted at 60%) totals of 18.5% and 59.4%, respectively, and a corresponding 100% individual multiplier.

Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary – Katherine H. Ramundo
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Ramundo performance share awards and stock options with a total grant-date value of  $1,200,140, taking into consideration relevant peer company data and based on her individual performance in 2017. Eighty percent of the award ($960,089) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units, and 20% ($240,051) in stock options, which was in line with her target award. Ms. Ramundo has not received any base salary increase since her commencement of employment with Arconic in September 2016. Despite exceptional individual performance and substantial contributions to the strategy review in 2018, Ms. Ramundo's annual IC award for 2018 of $101,750 was below target at 18.5%, which was based on the final Corporate IC plan total weighted result of 18.5%, as described above, and a corresponding 100% individual multiplier. In May 2018, Ms. Ramundo also received a special one-time retention equity award with a grant-date value of  $1,000,095 in the form of RSUs, which will vest on December 31, 2019, subject to her continued employment with the Company. In light of the level of management turnover accompanying the CEO transition process and challenges of the strategy review that would be the focus of most of the year, along with the uncertainty created by the announcement of the pending relocation of the Company headquarters from New York where Ms. Ramundo is based, the Compensation Committee believed that it would be in the best interest of the Company to ensure that Ms. Ramundo remain incentivized to continue her employment with Arconic and to minimize distractions. Therefore, the Compensation Committee awarded Ms. Ramundo this retention award to help secure her services through this critical period in the history of the Company.
Former Chief Executive Officer–Charles P. Blankenship
On October 19, 2017, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Blankenship in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company, which became effective on January 15, 2018 (the "Effective Date"). Pursuant to the letter agreement, Mr. Blankenship's annual base salary was  $1,250,000 and his target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity was 150% of his salary. He received a 2018 annual equity award with a grant date fair value of  $8,500,138, which was issued on January 19, 2018. Eighty percent of the award ($6,800,104) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units, and 20% ($1,700,034) in stock options, which was in line with his target award taking into consideration relevant CEO peer group company data. In addition, Mr. Blankenship was paid a special sign-on cash bonus of  $650,000 and granted special one-time equity awards of stock options with a grant date fair value of  $4,000,030, vesting in full on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, as well as restricted share units with a grant date fair value of  $3,000,242, vesting in full on the third anniversary of the grant date. The special one-time equity awards were issued on January 19, 2018 and were subject to his continued employment with the Company and the 50% holding requirement until stock ownership requirements are met. Pursuant to the letter agreement, Mr. Blankenship was also required to purchase shares of Arconic common stock with an aggregate purchase price of  $1,000,000 by June 30, 2018, which may not be disposed of until the earlier of  (1) the date upon which he meets the stock ownership guidelines or (2) termination of employment. Following his separation from the Company on February 6, 2019, all unvested equity stock awards and stock options were forfeited and canceled, including his special one-time equity awards in their entirety and the majority of his January 2018 annual equity award (other than one-third of his 2018 annual stock option grant, which vested on January 19, 2019).
Under the terms of his letter agreement, Mr. Blankenship was eligible to participate in the Company's Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Severance Plan and that, for purposes of his participation in the Executive Severance Plan, a resignation by him for good reason (as defined in the letter agreement) would constitute a severance event. Mr. Blankenship also entered into a confidentiality, developments, non-competition and non-solicitation agreement attached to the letter agreement, which includes a perpetual confidentiality covenant as well as non-competition and employee and customer non-solicitation covenants that apply during employment and for a period of one year following termination of employment for any reason.
Former Executive Vice President, Strategy and Development – Mark J. Krakowiak
Mr. Krakowiak commenced his employment at Arconic in his role as EVP, Strategy and Development, on January 29, 2018. Mr. Krakowiak did not receive any annual LTI award in 2018, having started after the annual grant date. However, pursuant to the terms in his offer letter, Mr. Krakowiak was entitled to a sign-on LTI equity award of  $1,200,000 in the form of time-vested RSUs in two tranches, subject to continued employment at the time of each vesting tranche. The first tranche was in the amount of  $700,107 and was granted on February 15, 2018, subject to ratable vesting over three years. The second tranche of  TABLE OF CONTENTS​

​
$500,000 would have been granted one year thereafter in February 2019, subject to cliff vesting upon the second anniversary from the date of grant. He also received a one-time $500,000 cash sign-on bonus. Mr. Krakowiak's annual IC award for 2018 of $64,348 was below target at 18.5%, which was based on the final Corporate IC plan total weighted result of 18.5%, as described above, and a corresponding 100% individual multiplier. Following his separation from the Company on February 8, 2019, the first tranche of Mr. Krakowiak's sign-on LTI equity award was forfeited and canceled in its entirety and the second tranche was not granted.
Former Executive Vice President and Group President, Engineered Products and Solutions – Eric V. Roegner
In January 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded Mr. Roegner performance share awards and stock options with a total grant-date value of  $1,200,140, taking into consideration relevant peer company data and based on his individual performance in 2017. Eighty percent of the award ($960,089) was granted in the form of performance-based restricted share units, and 20% ($240,051) in stock options, which was in line with his target award. To better align his pay with those of industry peer companies, Mr. Roegner received a base salary increase in 2018 of 5% over his then most current 2017 base salary. He received an amount below his target annual incentive compensation payment of  $23,695, which was prorated through his separation from the Company in July 2018 and factored in the Corporate and EP&S Group payout results of 18.5% and 0% (weighted 40% and 60%), respectively, under the annual IC plan. As Mr. Roegner was not retirement-eligible at the time of his separation from the Company, any unvested equity stock awards and stock options were forfeited and canceled, including his January 2018 award in its entirety.
Former Interim CEO – David P. Hess
Mr. Hess served as Interim CEO at a monthly base salary rate of  $91,667, which applied until the appointment of Mr. Blankenship as CEO on January 15, 2018. Mr. Hess was ineligible to participate in the Company's IC plan in any year. All equity grants made to him in 2018 were awarded in his capacity as a Board member in accordance with our Director compensation program (see the "Director Compensation" section starting on page 15).

Notes to 2018 Summary Compensation Table:
Column (a) – Named Executive Officers. The named executive officers include the former Chief Executive Officer, the former Interim Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, and the four other most highly compensated executives who, other than Mr. Roegner, were serving as executive officers at December 31, 2018. Under applicable SEC rules, we have excluded 2016 and 2017 compensation for Messrs. Blankenship and Krakowiak and 2016 compensation for Messrs. Hess, Myers, and Roegner and Ms. Ramundo, as they were not named executive officers in those years. For purposes of determining the most highly compensated executive officers, the amounts shown in column (h) were excluded. Mr. Blankenship served as CEO from January 15, 2018 until the appointment of John C. Plant as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on February 6, 2019. As Mr. Blankenship was not retirement-eligible at the time of his separation from the Company, any unvested equity stock awards and stock options were forfeited and canceled, including his 2018 stock awards in their entirety and two-thirds of his 2018 annual option award.

2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​ Mr. Hess served as Interim CEO until the appointment of Mr. Blankenship as CEO on January 15, 2018. Mr. Hess's 2018 salary amount does not include any cash retainer amount and stock awards for his services as a non-employee board member following his resignation as Interim CEO. His 2018 non-employee director compensation may be found on page 18 in the 2018 Director Compensation table. Mr. Hess's 2017 salary amount includes $14,333 in cash retainer, and his 2017 stock award includes $19,076 in RSUs, both of which were received as a board member prior to his appointment as Interim CEO on April 13, 2017.
​ Mr. Krakowiak served as EVP, Strategy and Development from January 29, 2018 until February 8, 2019. Based on the terms of his sign-on equity award, as Mr. Krakowiak was not retirement-eligible at the time of his separation from the Company, his unvested stock award was forfeited and canceled in its entirety.
​ Mr. Roegner's salary amount reflects the time he served as EVP, EP&S until his separation from the Company on July 31, 2018. As Mr. Roegner was not retirement-eligible at the time of his separation from the Company, any unvested equity stock awards and stock options were forfeited and canceled, including his 2018 stock and option awards in their entirety.
​
Column (c) – Salary. This column represents each of the named executive officer's annual base salary. Effective March 1, 2018, the Compensation and Benefits Committee approved salary increases for Messrs. Giacobbe, Myers and Roegner based on their strong performance in the previous year and to bring their salaries closer to market. Further details are included in the "Individual Compensation Arrangements and Performance-Based Pay Decisions" section on pages 51-53.
Columns (e) and (f) – Stock Awards and Option Awards. The value of stock awards in column (e) and stock options in column (f) equals the grant date fair value, which is calculated in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation. Performance share awards granted in January 2018 are shown at 100% of target. The fair value of the performance awards on the date of grant was as follows:

​ Kenneth J. Giacobbe  ​ ​ ​ ​  ​   $960,089  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​  ​   $1,920,179  ​ ​

​ Eric V. Roegner ​ ​ ​ ​  ​   $960,089  ​ ​ ​ ​ ​  ​   $1,920,179  ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
Stock awards are valued at the market price of a share of stock on the date of grant as determined by the closing price of our common stock. At the date of grant on January 19, 2018, the closing price of our common stock was $30.22. At December 31, 2018, the closing price of our common stock was $16.86.
For a discussion of the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock awards and stock options, please refer to the following sections and pages in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Stock-Based Compensation" on pages 50 to 51, and the disclosures on "Stock-Based Compensation" in Notes A and I to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 62 and 86 to 87, respectively.

2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​
Column (g) – Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation. Reflects cash payments made under the annual Incentive Compensation Plan for 2018 performance. See the "2018 Annual Cash Incentive Compensation Plan Design, Targets and Results" section starting on page 50.
Column (h) – Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. The amounts shown reflect the aggregate change in the actuarial present value in each year of each named executive officer's accumulated benefit under all defined benefit and actuarial plans, including supplemental plans. Increases are attributable to changes in the discount rate and mortality assumptions used for measurement of pension obligations year over year. Messrs. Blankenship, Hess, Krakowiak and Roegner and Ms. Ramundo have no changes in pension value in any of their years of reportable compensation because they were not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan, which was closed to employees hired after March 1, 2006 and subsequently frozen to future benefit accruals as of April 1, 2018. For 2018, Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers had net decreases of  $77,002 and $173,407, respectively, which for purposes of the Summary Compensation Table must be reported as $0, as negative values may not be applied.
Earnings on deferred compensation are not reflected in this column because the return on earnings is calculated in the same manner and at the same rate as earnings on externally managed investments of salaried employees participating in the tax-qualified 401(k) plan, and dividends on Company stock are paid at the same rate as dividends paid to shareholders.
Column (i) – All Other Compensation.

Options granted since 2009 have a term of ten years and ordinarily vest ratably over three years (one-third each year), generally subject to continued employment, other than 363,970 of Mr. Blankenship's stock options, which would have vested in full on the fourth anniversary of the grant date but were forfeited and canceled due to his separation from the Company.
​ As Mr. Roegner was not retirement-eligible at the time of his separation from the Company, any unvested equity awards were forfeited and canceled.
​ Mr. Hess was granted 123,210 RSUs in October 2017 relating to his Interim CEO role. The terms of such RSUs provide that the RSUs vest on January 15, 2018, with payment of the vested RSUs to be made in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the vesting date. This RSU award is disclosed in the "2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested" table below and in the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table on page 61. Information about equity awards to Mr. Hess in connection with his service as a non-employee director is disclosed in the "2018 Director Compensation" section beginning on page 18.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio
Background
Item 402(u) of the SEC's Regulation S-K, which was mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires disclosure of the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to our median employee's annual total compensation. The ratio disclosed below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u).
Methodology and Determined Ratio
We determined the median annual total compensation by analyzing base salary and wages (including overtime, shift premium, etc.) for all active employees (annualized based on full-time or part-time hourly or salaried status for 2017 if employed for less than the full year) in and outside the United States as of December 31, 2017. Once the median employee was identified using this consistently-applied compensation metric (CACM), we calculated the median employee's total compensation on the  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​
basis of the proxy statement summary compensation table rules. The estimated total compensation of the median employee based on this methodology and criteria for 2018 is $50,232.
For purposes of calculating the Company's CEO pay ratio, the Company determined the total CEO compensation by adding Mr. Hess's compensation in 2018 as Interim CEO until his resignation on January 15, 2018 (which does not include his cash retainer and RSU awards received as a board member), to Mr. Blankenship's 2018 compensation as CEO beginning on January 15, 2018. As a result, the total CEO compensation was $17,724,625. Consequently, the annual CEO total compensation is 353 times that of the median annual total compensation of all other employees in 2018.
Additional Information
The total CEO compensation amount above includes special one-time sign on-awards of  $650,000 in cash, $3,000,242 in RSUs and $4,000,030 in stock options that Mr. Blankenship received in accordance with the terms of his letter agreement upon his appointment as CEO. Excluding these special one-time sign-on awards, the total CEO compensation amount would be $10,074,353.
Consequently, the annual CEO total compensation excluding the special one-time sign-on awards would be 201 times that of the median annual total compensation of all other employees in 2018, which the Company believes would be the more relevant measure.

 Ms. Ramundo and Messrs. Blankenship, Krakowiak, Hess and Roegner do not appear in the table as they are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit pension plan, which was closed to employees hired after March 1, 2006.
​
Valuation and Assumptions: For a discussion of the valuation method and assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of the accumulated benefit, please refer to the following sections in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018: "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits" and Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Qualified Defined Benefit Plan. In 2018, Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers participated in the Arconic Retirement Plan. The Arconic Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers a majority of U.S. salaried employees. Benefits under the plan are based upon years of service and final average earnings as of March 31, 2018. Final average earnings include salary plus 100% of annual cash incentive compensation, and are calculated using the average of the highest five of the last ten years of earnings (high consecutive five for Mr. Giacobbe). The amount of annual compensation that may be taken into account under the Arconic Retirement Plan is subject to a limit imposed by the U.S. tax code, which was $275,000 for 2018. The base benefit payable at age 65 is 1.1% of final average earnings up to the Social Security covered compensation limit plus 1.475% of final average earnings above the Social Security covered compensation limit, times years of service. Final average earnings and service after April 1, 2018 are no longer reflected as the company has moved all future benefits to the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan. Benefits are payable as a single life annuity, a reduced 50% joint and survivor annuity, a reduced 75% joint and survivor annuity, or a single lump sum payment after termination of employment. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​
Nonqualified Defined Benefit Plans. Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers participate in the Excess Benefits Plan C. This plan is a nonqualified plan which provides for benefits taking into account compensation that exceeds the limits on compensation imposed by the U.S. tax code. The benefit formula is identical to the Arconic Retirement Plan formula. Benefits under the nonqualified plan are payable as a reduced 50% joint and survivor annuity if the executive is married. Otherwise, the benefit is payable as a single life annuity.
Arconic Retirement Savings Plan. For U.S. salaried employees, the Company makes an Employer Retirement Income Contribution (ERIC) in an amount equal to 3% of salary and annual incentive eligible for contribution to the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan. This benefit was previously provided to employees hired after March 1, 2006, including Messrs. Blankenship, Krakowiak, Hess and Roegner and Ms. Ramundo, as a pension contribution in lieu of a defined benefit pension plan. However, following the freeze of pension accruals effective April 1, 2018, all salaried employees are now eligible. In addition to the 3% ERIC contributions, Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers were eligible for 3% transition contribution to the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, as were all other employees impacted by the freeze of pension accruals. The Company contributed $8,250 to each of the aforementioned individuals' accounts in 2018 and $16,500 each to Messrs. Giacobbe and Myers. In addition, all U.S. salaried employees, including the named executive officers, are eligible to receive a Company matching contribution of 100% up to the first 6% of deferred salary. In 2018, the Company matching contribution amount was $16,500 each for Messrs. Blankenship, Myers, Krakowiak and Roegner and Ms. Ramundo and $15,950 for Mr. Giacobbe. Mr. Hess did not make any contributions to the plan. These amounts are included in the column "All Other Compensation" in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 54.

​
The investment options under the nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan are the same choices available to all salaried employees under the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan and the named executive officers do not receive preferential earnings on their investments. The named executive officers may defer up to 25% of their salaries in total to the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan and up to 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation to the Deferred Compensation Plan. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​
The Company contributes matching contributions on employee base salary deferrals that exceed the limits on compensation imposed by the U.S. tax code. In 2018, the Company matching contribution amount was $52,250 for Mr. Blankenship, $16,050 for Mr. Myers, $16,500 for Ms. Ramundo and $2,713 for Mr. Roegner. No matching contributions were made for Messrs. Giacobbe, Krakowiak, or Hess, as they did not make any deferred elections under the plan.
In addition, when the U.S. tax code limits Employer Retirement Income Contributions (ERIC) and 2018 transition contributions, if applicable, to the Arconic Retirement Savings Plan are reached, the ERIC and transition contributions are made into the Deferred Compensation Plan. In 2018, the Company contributed $27,891 for Mr. Blankenship, $6,675 for Mr. Giacobbe, $8,070 for Mr. Myers, $5,663 for Mr. Krakowiak, $19,703 for Ms. Ramundo, $15,269 for Mr. Hess and $11,774 for Mr. Roegner.
These amounts are included in the column "All Other Compensation" in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" on page 54.
All nonqualified pension and deferred compensation obligations are general unsecured liabilities of the Company until paid. Upon termination of employment, deferred compensation will be paid in cash as a lump sum or in up to ten annual installments, depending on the individual's election, account balance and retirement eligibility. The foregoing terms do not apply to the RSUs granted to Mr. Hess as Interim CEO, which vested on January 15, 2018, with payment of the vested RSUs to be made in three equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the vesting date.
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Executive Severance Plan. All of the NEOs, other than Mr. Hess, were eligible for the Company's Executive Severance Plan during 2018. The plan provides that, upon a termination of employment without cause and subject to execution and non-revocation of a general release of legal claims against the Company, the applicable NEO will receive a cash severance payment equal to one year of base salary and one year of target annual cash incentive (two years for the Chief Executive Officer), continued health care benefits for a two-year period, and two additional years of retirement accrual calculated as described in the plan.
The following table shows the severance payments and benefits that would have been payable to Messrs. Blankenship, Giacobbe, Myers and Krakowiak and Ms. Ramundo under the Executive Severance Plan upon a termination without cause on December 31, 2018. Mr. Hess was not eligible for the Executive Severance Plan. In connection with Mr. Roegner's separation from the Company in July 2018, he received severance payments and benefits pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan—see the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" and the accompanying footnotes above.

Change in Control Severance Plan. All of the NEOs, other than Mr. Hess, were eligible for the Company's Change in Control Severance Plan during 2018. The plan is designed to serve shareholders by assuring that the Company will have the continued dedication of the covered executives, notwithstanding the possibility, threat or occurrence of a change in control. These protections are intended to encourage the executives' full attention and dedication to the Company in the event of any threatened or pending change in control, which can result in significant distraction by virtue of the personal uncertainties and risks that executives frequently face under such circumstances. Severance benefits under the Change in Control Severance Plan are provided upon a termination of employment without cause or resignation by the executive for good reason, in either case within two years after a change in control of the Company. TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Executive Compensation (continued)
​
Upon a qualifying termination, the severance benefits under the Change in Control Severance Plan are: (i) a cash payment equal to two times annual salary plus target annual cash incentive compensation, (ii) a cash payment equal to the target annual cash incentive compensation amount prorated through the severance date, (iii) continuation of health care benefits for two years, (iv) two additional years of applicable pension credit and company savings plan contributions, and (v) six months of outplacement benefits. The multiple on the benefits (i-iv) for the Chief Executive Officer is three. There is no excise tax gross-up provision under the Plan.
The terms of the 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, provide that unvested equity awards, including awards held by the continuing NEOs, do not immediately vest upon a change in control if a replacement award is provided. However, the replacement award will vest immediately if, within a two-year period following a change in control, a plan participant is terminated without cause or leaves for good reason. Performance-based stock awards will be converted to time-vested stock awards upon a change in control under the following terms: (i) if 50% or more of the performance period has been completed as of the date on which the change in control has occurred, then the number of shares or the value of the award will be based on actual performance completed as of the date of the change in control; or (ii) if less than 50% of the performance period has been completed as of the date on which the change in control has occurred, then the number of shares or the value of the award will be based on the target number or value.
The following table shows the severance payments and benefits that would have been payable to the eligible NEOs under the Change in Control Severance Plan if both a change in control and a termination without cause or resignation for good reason occurred on December 31, 2018, under the terms of the plan as in effect on such date, as well as the estimated net present value of unvested equity awards that would have become vested upon such termination or resignation. Equity award values are estimated using the Company's closing stock price on December 31, 2018, which was $16.86 per share. Mr. Hess was not eligible for the Change in Control Severance Plan.

Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  
We are seeking shareholder approval to amend and restate the 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated (the "2013 Plan" or "Amended 2013 Plan," as applicable), to authorize 20,000,000 additional shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, to extend the term of the plan by one year and to adopt certain other changes described below. In February 2019, the Board of Directors approved the Amended 2013 Plan, subject to approval by shareholders at the May 2019 annual meeting. If approved, the Amended 2013 Plan will become effective on May 14, 2019 (the "Amendment Effective Date"). If the Amended 2013 Plan is not approved by shareholders, then the existing 2013 Plan will continue in full force and effect, for as long as shares remain available for issuance thereunder.
Board Recommendation
​
The Board recommends that you vote for approval of the Amended 2013 Plan. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and our shareholders to approve the Amended 2013 Plan so that we have sufficient shares available to continue to offer equity awards and motivate outstanding employee performance. Based on the amount of awards granted in the past, as discussed in more detail below, the shares remaining available for awards under the 2013 Plan will be insufficient to satisfy our equity compensation needs beyond 2021. The 2013 Plan is the Company's only active employee equity plan. If our shareholders do not approve the Amended 2013 Plan, we will experience a shortfall of shares available for issuance for stock-based compensation awards that may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain and reward employees who contribute to our long-term success, placing us at a competitive disadvantage.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ITEM 4, the approval of the 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, including increase of reserved shares

 Does not include employment inducement awards granted outside of the Company's stock incentive plans pursuant to the exemption from shareholder approval under the NYSE's Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.08. Such awards were granted on February 15, 2019, consisting of 1,000,000 restricted share units granted to Chairman and CEO, John C. Plant, and 385,000 restricted share units granted to President and COO, Elmer L. Doty. 
​ Under the 2013 Plan, stock-based awards are granted from a pool of available shares, with stock options and stock appreciation rights counting against such pool as 1 share and restricted shares and restricted share units (full value awards) counting as 2.33 shares (this share counting rule is unchanged under the Amended 2013 Plan).

Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Request for Increase in Share Reserve for the Amended 2013 Plan
​
We are requesting 20,000,000 shares to be added to our share reserve under the Amended 2013 Plan. Unless and until the Amended 2013 Plan is approved by our stockholders, no awards may be granted thereunder with respect to the additional shares for which we are requesting approval. The Amended 2013 Plan has a total fungible equity pool, assigning a ratio for counting usage of shares upon issuance of stock options and stock appreciation rights of one to one so that a grant of a stock option or stock appreciation right will be counted against the share limit as one share of common stock, and assigning a ratio for counting usage of shares upon issuance of restricted shares, restricted share units or other awards (that is, full value awards) of 2.33 to one, so that any grant of a full value award will be counted against the maximum share limit as 2.33 shares of common stock.
Our potential dilution, or "overhang," from outstanding awards and shares available for future awards under the Amended 2013 Plan is approximately 6.5%. This percentage is calculated on a fully-diluted basis, by dividing the total shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards (15,788,158) plus the shares available for future awards under the Amended 2013 Plan (15,695,465) (together, the numerator) by the total shares of Company common stock outstanding as of March 25, 2019 (453,083,173) plus the number of shares in the numerator.
We have calculated that the average "burn rate" for awards that we granted in the last three fiscal years is approximately 1.2%. "Burn rate" is the number of awards granted (stock options and restricted share units) divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (basic). We calculated our average burn rate based on awards that we have granted during fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 without applying any multiplier to the number of restricted share units granted.
Based solely on the average rate at which awards were granted over the past three fiscal years, and assuming that future awards under the Amended 2013 Plan would be made at this average rate, the total number of shares available for grant under the Amended 2013 Plan is calculated to last approximately three to four years. However, the amount of shares granted in the past is not necessarily indicative of the amount that may be granted in the future. The amount of future grants is not currently known and will depend on various factors that cannot be predicted, including but not limited to the stock price of the Company's common stock on the future dates of grant, the volatility of the stock and the types of awards that will be granted.
Material Changes to the 2013 Plan
​
The following summary highlights the proposed material changes to the 2013 Plan. The Amended 2013 Plan also includes other administrative, clarifying, and conforming changes.
 The number of shares reserved for issuance pursuant to awards granted under the Amended 2013 Plan has been increased by 20,000,000 shares to an aggregate of 66,666,666 shares since the inception of the plan in 2013. 
​
 The term of the plan has been extended by one year, such that the Amended 2013 Plan will expire on May 2, 2024. 
​
 The minimum vesting requirements have been revised to mandate a vesting period of at least one year for all awards (other than substitute awards and non-employee director awards that have a vesting period of at least 50 weeks), except with respect to awards relating to 5% of the shares available for grant as of the Amendment Effective Date (the previous minimum vesting provision required a three-year pro-rata vesting period for restricted shares and restricted share units, one year for options and stock appreciation rights and no minimum vesting for other awards). 
​
 The 2013 Plan has been updated to reflect the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and that it is no longer possible to grant performance awards to covered employees that qualify for a deduction limit exception under Section 162(m) of the Code. For grants of performance awards to executive officers, the Amended 2013 Plan retains individual award limits, while increasing the limit for restricted share units or restricted share awards from 1,333,333 to 1,500,000 award shares per calendar year, and includes certain other performance award rules similar to those previously required under Section 162(m), in each case unless otherwise expressly determined by the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board. 
​
 The existing prohibition on the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents on unvested or unearned restricted share units has been extended to apply to all awards, including restricted shares and other awards. 
​
 The definition of  "fair market value" has been revised, so that where the Amended 2013 Plan requires the value of the shares to be determined as of a particular date but the NYSE is not open for business on such date, the value of a share will generally be determined by reference to the closing price reported for the immediately preceding NYSE business day, rather than on the next following business day.

​
Key Governance Terms and Practices under the Amended 2013 Plan
​
The Amended 2013 Plan includes a number of provisions that promote best practices by reinforcing the alignment between equity compensation arrangements for eligible employees and non-employee directors and shareholders' interests. These provisions include, but are not limited to, the following:
 No Liberal Share Recycling. Shares will not be added back to the available pool of shares authorized under the Amended 2013 Plan when shares are (i) tendered in payment of the purchase price of a stock option or other award, (ii) withheld for taxes, (iii) purchased with the proceeds of an option exercise or (iv) subject to a stock appreciation right but not issued upon settlement thereof. 
​
 Minimum Vesting Periods. Generally, all awards granted under the Amended 2013 Plan will have a minimum vesting period of one year measured from the date the award is granted, except as described above, as well as under "Minimum Vesting Requirements." 
​
 Limitation on Payment of Dividends or Equivalents. The Amended 2013 Plan prohibits the payment of dividends or dividend equivalents in any form prior to the vesting of any award. 
​
 Double-Trigger Equity Vesting upon a Change in Control. The Amended 2013 Plan does not provide for "single-trigger" vesting acceleration upon a change in control (vesting may occur only if awards are not assumed or replaced). It provides for "double-trigger" vesting of awards that are assumed or replaced by an acquirer, which generally means that vesting would accelerate only if the participant is terminated without cause or quits for good reason (as those terms are defined in the Arconic Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan) within 24 months following the change in control. 
​
 No Repricing. The Amended 2013 Plan expressly prohibits repricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights, whether by reducing the exercise price, granting replacement awards with a lower exercise price or replacing underwater awards with cash. 
​
 Clawback Feature. The Amended 2013 Plan contains a clawback feature reflecting the policy previously adopted by the Company and further authorizes the Company to recover from participants awards or payments as may be required under any Company recoupment policy then in effect or any recoupment requirement imposed by applicable laws, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. See "Corporate Governance—Recovery of Incentive Compensation" on page 31. In addition, the Amended 2013 Plan authorizes cancellation of awards if a participant engages in conduct that is injurious to the Company, monetarily, reputationally or otherwise, as well as in certain other circumstances. 
​
 Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit. The Amended 2013 Plan limits the aggregate amount of compensation payable to an individual as compensation for services as a non-employee director in a calendar year, whether in cash or in equity. 
​
 No Discounted or Reload Stock Options. The exercise price of a stock option or stock appreciation right under the Amended 2013 Plan may not be less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date such award is granted, except in connection with an adjustment upon a capitalization event or as provided for substitute awards (see "Adjustment Provision" and "Substitute Awards" below). Stock options with a reload feature will not be granted under the Amended 2013 Plan. 
​
Principal Features of the Amended 2013 Plan
​
In this section we have summarized the principal features of the Amended 2013 Plan. This summary is not a complete description of the Amended 2013 Plan and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Amended 2013 Plan, which is attached as Attachment D.
Purpose of the Amended 2013 Plan
​
The purpose of the Amended 2013 Plan is to encourage participants to acquire a proprietary interest in the long-term growth and financial success of the Company and to further link the interests of such individuals to the long-term interests of shareholders.
The Amended 2013 Plan authorizes the plan administrator, which will generally be the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of Directors, to grant stock-based awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Amended 2013 Plan also authorizes the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board, to make stock-based awards to non-employee directors.

Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Limitation on Authorized Shares and Fungible Equity Pool
​
If the Amended 2013 Plan is approved by shareholders, the maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock authorized to be granted under the Amended 2013 Plan will be 66,666,666 shares, plus shares subject to any outstanding awards under prior plans as of the initial effective date of the 2013 Plan, to the extent that such awards are subsequently forfeited, cancelled or expire, subject to adjustment as described below under "Adjustment Provision." Such number of reserved shares reflects the reverse stock split of the Company's common stock at a ratio of 1 for 3, effective October 5, 2016. This share pool represents an increase of 20,000,000 shares to the shares available for grant under the 2013 Plan.
Shares subject to awards under the Amended 2013 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled or expire will become available for issuance thereunder. Shares tendered in payment of the purchase price of a stock option or other award or withheld to pay taxes may not be added back to the available pool of shares authorized under the Amended 2013 Plan, nor may shares purchased using option proceeds or not issued upon settlement of a stock appreciation right.
Administration of the Amended 2013 Plan
​
Under the Amended 2013 Plan, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board (for purposes of this Item, the "Committee"), which is composed of non-employee directors, has authority to grant awards to employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the full Board of Directors has authority to grant awards to non-employee directors upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee.
The Board of Directors also may assume responsibilities otherwise assigned to the Committee. The Board may not amend the Amended 2013 Plan without shareholder approval if such approval would be required pursuant to applicable law or the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or such other stock exchange on which the shares trade. The Board or the Committee generally may not amend the Amended 2013 Plan or the terms of any award previously granted without the consent of the affected participant, if such action would materially impair the rights of such participant under any outstanding award. Neither the Board nor the Committee may amend the terms of any stock option or stock appreciation right to reduce its exercise price, or cancel or replace any outstanding options or stock appreciation rights in exchange for options or rights with lower exercise prices, or for other awards or cash at a time when the exercise price of such stock options or stock appreciation rights is higher than the fair market value of a share of the Company's stock.
The Committee has the authority, subject to the terms of the Amended 2013 Plan, to select employees to whom it will grant awards, to determine the types of awards and the number of shares covered, to set the terms and conditions of the awards, to cancel or suspend awards and to modify outstanding awards. The Committee also has authority to interpret the Amended 2013 Plan, to establish, amend and rescind rules applicable to the Amended 2013 Plan or awards under the Amended 2013 Plan, to approve the terms and provisions of any agreements relating to Amended 2013 Plan awards, to determine whether any corporate transaction, such as a spin-off or joint venture, will result in a participant's termination of service, to make adjustments in performance award criteria or in the terms and conditions of other awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles and to make all determinations relating to awards under the Amended 2013 Plan. The Board of Directors has similar authority with respect to awards to non-employee directors. The Amended 2013 Plan permits delegation of certain authority to executive officers in limited instances to make, cancel or suspend awards to employees who are not Arconic directors or executive officers, and the Committee may delegate other of its administrative powers to the extent not prohibited by applicable laws.
Eligibility
​
All employees of Arconic and its subsidiaries and all non-employee directors of Arconic are eligible to be selected as participants. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 43,000 employees, including six executive officers, and 12 non-employee directors were eligible to receive awards under the Amended 2013 Plan. As of March 15, 2019, approximately 1,650 employees, including seven executive officers, and ten non-employee directors hold awards under the Amended 2013 Plan.
Term
​
No award may be granted under the Amended 2013 Plan after May 2, 2024. TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Shares Issuable for Awards
​
Shares of Arconic common stock issuable under the Amended 2013 Plan may come from authorized but unissued shares, treasury shares, shares purchased on the open market or otherwise or any combination of the foregoing.
Types of Awards
​
The following types of awards may be granted under the Amended 2013 Plan:
 Nonqualified stock options (without reload features); 
​
 Stock appreciation rights; 
​
 Restricted shares; 
​
 Restricted share units; and 
​
 Other forms of awards authorized by the Amended 2013 Plan. 
​
These forms of awards may have a performance feature under which the award is not earned unless performance goals are achieved.
Minimum Vesting Requirements
​
The Amended 2013 Plan mandates a minimum one-year vesting period for all awards granted thereunder, except that up to 5% of the shares available for grant as of the Amendment Effective Date may be made subject to awards that do not have such a minimum vesting requirement. The minimum vesting requirement does not apply to substitute awards or to awards granted to non-employee directors which vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the next annual meeting of the Company's shareholders (provided such next annual meeting is at least 50 weeks after the immediately preceding year's annual meeting). The minimum vesting requirement does not prevent the Company from granting awards that contain rights to accelerated vesting on a termination of employment or service or otherwise accelerating vesting, as provided in the Amended 2013 Plan.
Stock Option Awards
​
Under the Amended 2013 Plan, stock option awards entitle a participant to purchase shares of Arconic common stock during the option term at a fixed price that may not be less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, except in connection with an adjustment upon a capitalization event or as provided for substitute awards (see "Adjustment Provision" and "Substitute Awards" below). The maximum term of stock options granted is ten years. The Committee has discretion to cap the amount of gain that may be obtained in the exercise of the stock option. The option price must be paid in full by the participant upon exercise of the option, in cash, shares or other consideration having a fair market value equal to the option price or by a combination of cash, shares or other consideration specified by the Committee.
Stock Appreciation Rights
​
A stock appreciation right (SAR) entitles the holder to receive, on exercise, the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date (or, if the Committee so determines, as of any time during a specified period before the exercise date) over the SAR grant price. The SAR grant price is set by the Committee and may not be less than the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant, except in connection with an adjustment upon a capitalization event or as provided for substitute awards. The Committee may grant SAR awards as stand-alone awards or in combination with a related stock option award under the Amended 2013 Plan. Payment by the Company upon exercise will be in cash, stock or other property or any combination of cash, stock or other property as the Committee may determine. The Committee has discretion to cap the amount of gain that may be obtained in the exercise of a stock appreciation right. The maximum term of stock appreciation rights is ten years, or if granted in tandem with an option, the expiration date of the option. TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Restricted Shares
​
A restricted share is a share issued with such contingencies or restrictions as the Committee may impose. Until the conditions or contingencies are satisfied or lapse, the stock is subject to forfeiture. A recipient of a restricted share award has the right to vote the shares and receive dividends on them upon vesting, unless the Committee determines otherwise. If the participant ceases to be an employee before the end of the contingency period, the award is forfeited, subject to such exceptions as authorized by the Committee.
Restricted Share Units
​
A restricted share unit is an award of a right to receive, in cash or shares, as the Committee may determine, the fair market value of one share of Company common stock, on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine.
Other Awards
​
Other awards of shares and other awards that are valued in whole or in part by reference to, or are otherwise based on, shares or other property may be granted to eligible individuals, subject to such terms and conditions as approved by the Committee.
Performance Awards
​
A performance award may be in any form of award permitted under the Amended 2013 Plan. We have in the past granted performance awards in the form of restricted share units. The Committee may select periods of at least one year during which performance criteria chosen by the Committee are measured for the purpose of determining the extent to which a performance award has been earned. The Committee decides whether the performance levels have been achieved, what amount of the award will be paid and the form of payment, which may be cash, stock or other property or any combination thereof. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, performance awards granted to executive officers will be subject to additional terms (see "Performance Awards Granted to Executive Officers" below).
Dividends and Dividend Equivalents
​
No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid on stock options or stock appreciation rights. Dividend equivalents may not be paid on any unvested restricted share units but will be accrued and paid only if and when the restricted share units vest. No dividends or dividend equivalents may be paid on unearned performance-based restricted share units. In no event will any other award under the Amended 2013 Plan provide for the participant's receipt of dividends or dividend equivalents in any form prior to the vesting of such award or applicable portion of such award.
Substitute Awards
​
The Committee may grant awards to employees of companies acquired by Arconic or a subsidiary in exchange or substitution for, or upon assumption of, outstanding stock-based awards issued by the acquired company. Shares covered by substitute awards will not reduce the number of shares otherwise available for award under the Amended 2013 Plan.
Stock Option and SAR Repricing Prohibited
​
The Amended 2013 Plan prohibits repricing of stock options or stock appreciation rights without shareholder approval. Repricing means the cancellation of an option or stock appreciation right in exchange for cash or other awards at a time when the exercise price of such option or stock appreciation right is higher than the fair market value of a share of the Company's stock, the grant of a new stock option or stock appreciation right with a lower exercise price than the original option or stock appreciation right, or the amendment of an outstanding award to reduce the exercise price. The grant of a substitute award (as described above) is not a repricing, nor is an adjustment upon a capitalization event. TABLE OF CONTENTS

Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit
​
Notwithstanding any other provision in the Amended 2013 Plan or in any Company policy regarding non-employee director compensation, the maximum amount of total compensation payable to a non-employee director for services in a calendar year may not exceed $750,000, calculated as the sum of  (i) the grant date fair value (determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718) of all awards payable in shares and the maximum cash value of any other award granted under the Amended 2013 Plan, plus (ii) cash compensation in the form of Board and committee retainers and meeting or similar fees. Compensation counts towards this limit for the calendar year in which it is granted or earned by a non-employee director, and not later when distributed, in the event it is deferred.
Adjustment Provision
​
The Amended 2013 Plan defines certain transactions with our shareholders, not involving our receipt of consideration, that affect the shares or the share price of the Company's common stock as "equity restructurings" (e.g., a stock dividend, stock split, spin-off, rights offering or recapitalization through a large, nonrecurring cash dividend). In the event that an equity restructuring occurs, the Committee will adjust the terms of the Amended 2013 Plan and each outstanding award as it deems equitable to reflect the equity restructuring, which may include (i) adjusting the number and type of securities subject to each outstanding award and/or adjusting the number of shares available under the Amended 2013 Plan or the individual award limitations, (ii) adjusting the terms and conditions of (including the grant or exercise price), and the performance targets or other criteria included in, outstanding awards; and (iii) granting new awards or making cash payments to participants. Such adjustments will be nondiscretionary, although the Committee will determine whether an adjustment is equitable.
Other types of transactions may also affect the Company's common stock, such as a dividend or other distribution, reorganization, merger or other changes in corporate structure. In the event that there is such a transaction, which is not an equity restructuring, or in the case of other unusual or nonrecurring transactions or events or changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles, the Committee will determine, in its discretion, whether any adjustment to the Amended 2013 Plan and/or to any outstanding awards is appropriate to prevent any dilution or enlargement of benefits under the Amended 2013 Plan or to facilitate such transactions or events or give effect to such changes in laws, regulations or principles.
Consideration for Awards
​
Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, and except as required to pay the purchase price of stock options, recipients of awards are not required to make any payment or provide consideration other than rendering of services.
Transferability of Awards
​
Awards may be transferred by laws of descent and distribution or to a guardian or legal representative or, unless otherwise provided by the Committee or limited by applicable laws, to family members or a trust for family members; provided however, that awards may not be transferred to a third party for value or consideration.
Change in Control Provisions
​
The definition of change in control generally provides that if one of the following events has occurred, a change in control of Arconic will have happened: (i) the acquisition by an individual, entity or group of 30% or more of the Company's common stock or the combined voting power of all voting securities of the Company, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) individuals who, as of May 24, 2017, constituted the Board (the "Incumbent Board") ceasing for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, subject to certain exceptions providing, in general, that directors joining the Board after May 24, 2017 whose election or nomination is approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then comprising the Incumbent Board will be considered members of the Incumbent Board, (iii) the consummation of certain corporate transactions involving the Company, and (iv) approval by the shareholders of the Company of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
The Amended 2013 Plan provides for double-trigger equity vesting in the event of a change in control. If outstanding awards under the Amended 2013 Plan are replaced by the acquirer or related entity in a change in control of the Company, those replacement awards will not immediately vest on a "single trigger" basis, but would accelerate only if the participant is terminated without cause or quits for good reason (as those terms are defined in the Arconic Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan) within 24 months following the change in control. If outstanding awards under the Amended 2013 Plan are not exchanged for replacement awards in the event of a change in control, unless the Committee determines otherwise at the time of grant of a particular award:
 all outstanding stock option and SAR awards vest and are immediately exercisable; and 
​
 any restrictions, conditions or limitations on restricted share awards, restricted share units or other share unit awards lapse. 
​
In the event of a change in control of the Company, all performance awards will be earned at the target amount of shares covered by the award if the change in control event occurs when less than 50% of the performance period has been completed, or at the actual amount of the award if the change in control event occurs when 50% or more of the performance period has been completed. Such earned performance awards then continue to vest in accordance with their original schedule unless they are not exchanged for replacement awards, in which case the treatment described above for time-based awards will apply.
Clawback
​
The Amended 2013 Plan contains a clawback feature reflecting the policy previously adopted by the Company and further authorizes the Company to recover from participants awards or payments as may be required under any Company recoupment policy then in effect or any recoupment requirement imposed by applicable laws, including pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. See "Corporate Governance — Recovery of Incentive Compensation" on page 31. In addition, the Amended 2013 Plan authorizes cancellation of awards if a participant engages in certain specified conduct that is injurious to the Company or any subsidiary or if cancellation is necessary to comply with applicable laws or due to the inability or impracticability of the Company to obtain or maintain approval from any regulatory body whose approval is necessary to lawfully grant awards or issue or sell shares under the Amended 2013 Plan.
Performance Awards Granted to Executive Officers
​
The Amended 2013 Plan establishes the following rules for the grant and administration of performance awards granted to executive officers, unless otherwise expressly determined by the Committee:
The vesting and payment of performance awards (other than options or stock appreciation rights) will be subject to achievement by the Company on a consolidated basis, or by specified subsidiaries, business divisions or business units and/or the individual executive officer of performance goals established by the Committee within the first 25% of the performance period, which will be one year or longer. Performance goals may be based on measures including, without limitation, (i) GAAP or non-GAAP metrics, (ii) total shareholder return or other return-based metrics, (iii) operational, strategic, corporate or personal professional objectives, (iv) sustainability or compliance targets or (v) any other metric that is capable of measurement as determined by the Committee. In addition, performance goals may be calculated to exclude special or unusual items or to take into account items such as fluctuations in market forces or foreign currency exchange rates. The Committee may adjust downward the amount payable on vesting of a performance award (other than an option or stock appreciation right) but may not adjust upward and may not waive the achievement of the performance goals. The annual limits on performance awards per executive officer are: 1,500,000 shares if the award is in the form of restricted shares or restricted share units; 3,333,333 shares if the award is in the form of stock options or stock appreciation rights; and $15 million in value if the award is paid in property other than shares.
Performance awards granted to covered executive officers under the 2013 Plan that were intended to qualify as deductible "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act continue to be governed by the applicable provisions of the 2013 Plan relevant to such qualified awards, notwithstanding the amendments adopted in the Amended 2013 Plan.

Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
Tax Aspects of the Amended 2013 Plan
​
The following is a summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to equity awards under the Amended 2013 Plan based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. The Amended 2013 Plan is not qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. The summary is general in nature and is not intended to cover all tax consequences that may apply to a particular employee, director or to our company. The provisions of the Code and regulations thereunder relating to these matters are complicated, may change and their impact in any one case may depend upon the particular circumstances. Further, this summary does not discuss the tax consequences of a participant's death or the provisions of any income tax laws of any municipality, state or foreign country in which a participant may reside.
The grant of a nonqualified stock option or SAR under the Amended 2013 Plan has no U.S. federal income tax consequences for a U.S. citizen or resident or the Company. Upon exercise of a stock option or SAR, the participant realizes ordinary income and Arconic may take a tax deduction, subject to the limits of Section 162(m) of the Code. The amount of this deduction (subject to Section 162(m) of the Code) and income is equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the fair market value of the shares on the grant date. The Committee may permit or require participants to surrender Arconic shares in order to satisfy the required withholding tax obligation.
Regarding Amended 2013 Plan awards (other than options or stock appreciation rights) that are settled either in cash or in stock or other property that is either transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g., restricted share unit awards), a U.S. citizen or resident must recognize ordinary income equal to the cash or the fair market value of shares or other property received. Arconic may take a deduction at the same time and for the same amount, subject to the limits of Section 162(m) of the Code. If required, income tax must be withheld on the income recognized by the participant.
Regarding Amended 2013 Plan awards (other than options or SARs) that are settled in stock or other property that is subject to contingencies restricting transfer and to a substantial risk of forfeiture (e.g., restricted share awards), a U.S. citizen or resident will generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares or other property received (less any amount paid by the participant) when the shares or other property first become transferable or not subject to substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs first. Arconic may take a deduction at the same time and for the same amount, subject to the limits of Section 162(m) of the Code.
Section 162(m) of the Code, as amended by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, limits to $1 million the amount that a publicly held corporation is allowed each year to deduct for the compensation paid to the corporation's chief executive officer, chief financial officer and certain of the corporation's current and former executive officers. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Section 162(m)'s deductibility limitation was subject to an exception for compensation meeting the requirements of  "qualified performance-based compensation." Stock options and certain performance awards granted under the 2013 Plan (together, "Outstanding Qualified Performance-Based Awards") were intended to qualify for such exception. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has eliminated the exception for qualified performance-based compensation, effective for tax years beginning after 2017. Accordingly, any amount payable to covered executive officers pursuant to such Outstanding Qualified Performance-Based Awards or otherwise in excess of  $1 million per year will be deductible only if it qualifies for limited transition relief applicable to certain written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017. Although Outstanding Qualified Performance-Based Awards continue to be governed by the applicable terms of the 2013 Plan as in effect prior to the adoption of the Amended 2013 Plan, due to the uncertain scope of the transition relief, no assurances can be given that amounts payable pursuant to such awards will in fact be deductible.
Section 409A of the Code imposes certain requirements on non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements. These include requirements on an individual's election to defer compensation and the individual's selection of the timing and form of distribution of the deferred compensation. Section 409A also generally provides that distributions must be made on or following the occurrence of certain events (i.e., the individual's separation from service, a predetermined date, or the individual's death). Section 409A imposes restrictions on an individual's ability to change his or her distribution timing or form after the compensation has been deferred. For certain individuals who are officers, Section 409A requires that such individual's distribution commence no earlier than six months after such officer's separation from service.
Certain awards under the Amended 2013 Plan may be designed to be subject to the requirements of Section 409A in form and in operation. For example, restricted share units that provide for a settlement date following the vesting date (or such other date on which the awards become nonforfeitable) may be subject to Section 409A. If an award under the Amended 2013 Plan is subject to and fails to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A, the recipient of that award may recognize ordinary income  TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 4 Approval of 2013 Arconic Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, Including Increase of Reserved Shares  (continued)
​
on the amounts deferred under the award, to the extent vested, which may be prior to when the compensation is actually or constructively received. Also, if an award that is subject to Section 409A fails to comply with the requirements of Section 409A, Section 409A imposes an additional 20% federal penalty tax on compensation recognized as ordinary income, as well as interest on such deferred compensation.
If the Committee determines that an award, payment, distribution, transaction or other action would cause a participant to become subject to taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, such award will not be given effect and the related provisions of the Amended 2013 Plan or award agreement will be modified as necessary to comply with Section 409A of the Code, without consent of or notice to the participant.
The Committee may adjust awards to participants who are not U.S. citizens or U.S. residents to recognize differences in local law or tax policy and may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of awards to minimize tax equalization obligations for expatriate employees.
Recent Share Price
​
On March 25, 2019, the closing market price for Arconic common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $18.60 per share.
New Plan Benefits
​
Future awards to employees and officers under the Amended 2013 Plan are generally made at the discretion of the Committee, or, in the case of director awards, at the discretion of the Board of Directors upon the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board and subject to the parameters and compensation limits of the Amended 2013 Plan, or pursuant to a deferral election by a non-employee director under the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the Amended 2013 Plan in the future are generally not determinable at this time.
However, as discussed above under "Director Compensation," under our current Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy, each non-employee director of the Company following the 2019 Annual Meeting will be granted, on the second market trading day following the date of the meeting, an annual restricted share unit award with a grant date value equal to $150,000.
Prior Grants to Named Executive Officers and Other Employees
​
On November 1, 2016, Alcoa Inc. separated into two standalone companies — Arconic Inc. (the new name for Alcoa Inc.) and Alcoa Corporation. Prior to the separation, awards covering 14,717,891 shares of Alcoa Inc. common stock had been granted under the 2013 Plan, which number of shares has been adjusted to reflect a 1-for-3 reverse stock split effected on October 5, 2016 but has not been adjusted to reflect the effect of the separation. Following the reverse stock split and the separation, from November 1, 2016 to March 15, 2019, awards covering 11,480,452 shares of Arconic common stock have been granted under the 2013 Plan. All of the foregoing share amounts include any performance adjustments made on earned performance restricted share units but do not reflect any forfeitures. TABLE OF CONTENTS

Item 5 Shareholder Proposal
The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Avenue, 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, sponsored this proposal.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" ITEM 5, the shareholder proposal, for the reasons set forth following the proposal.
The text of the shareholder proposal follows:
"Proposal 5 – Special Shareholder Meeting
Resolved, Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders in the aggregate of 10% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting.
Special shareholder meetings allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison. This proposal topic, sponsored by William Steiner, also won 78% support at a Sprint annual meeting with 1.7 Billion yes-votes. Nuance Communications (NUAN) shareholders gave 94%-support in 2018 to a rule 14a-8 proposal calling for 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting.
Our current higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting may be unreachable due to the baked-in time constraints and the detailed technical requirements that can easily trigger disqualifying errors by shareholders.
It is a good incentive to improve the corporate governance rules of our company after our stock has fallen from $23 to $20 in the 5-years leading up to the due date for this proposal. Also, John Plant, our Chairman, and Arthur Collins, who chaired our executive pay committee, each received about 7-times as many negative votes as certain other Arconic directors.
Any claim that a shareholder right to call a special meeting can be costly—may be moot. When shareholders have a good reason to call a special meeting—our board should be able to take positive responding action to make a special meeting unnecessary.
Please vote yes:
Special Shareholder Meeting—Proposal 5."
Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition
The Board has considered the above proposal carefully, and believes that it is not in the best interests of our shareholders. Your Board therefore recommends that you vote "AGAINST" the proposal for the following reasons.
The Board of Directors is committed to good governance practices and has previously approved amendments to the Company's governing documents to permit shareholders to request special meetings.
Background. In 2013, the Board of Alcoa Inc., the Company's predecessor, approved amendments to the Company's governing documents to permit special meetings to be called by holders of 25% of the Company's outstanding common stock, subject to customary holding period and procedural requirements, and shareholders approved these amendments with 96.7% of the votes cast. In 2017, in connection with the Company's reincorporation from Pennsylvania to Delaware, the Board approved that the new Delaware Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company would provide shareholders with substantially the same right to call special meetings as provided under the previous Pennsylvania governing documents. The Delaware Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws became effective on December 31, 2017, the date of the reincorporation, and was approved by more than 98% of the votes cast by shareholders on the proposal to approve the merger to effect the reincorporation. More recently, at the 2018 Annual Meeting, Arconic's shareholders had an opportunity to review and vote on a shareholder proposal to adopt a 10% ownership threshold for the right to call special meetings. A significant majority of votes cast at that meeting voted AGAINST adopting a 10% threshold.
Current Ownership Threshold is Consistent with Market Practice and Strikes an Appropriate Balance. The Board continues to believe that a 25% ownership threshold for the right to call special meetings, as provided in the Company's current Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, is consistent with market practice and strikes an appropriate balance  TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Item 5 Shareholder Proposal (continued)
​
between enhancing shareholder rights and protecting against the risk that shareholders with small minority ownership interests, including shareholders with special interests, could call special meetings that potentially cause disruption and substantial costs to be incurred by the vast majority of shareholders. Arconic's current 25% threshold is equal to or lower than the comparable threshold adopted by approximately 66% of corporations in the S&P 500 Index that permit shareholders to call a special meeting. In addition, by reducing the ownership threshold to 10%, a small minority of our shareholders (currently as few as one shareholder) could use the special meeting platform to advance their own agenda, without regard to the interests of Arconic and its broader shareholder base.
The Board believes special meetings should only be called to consider extraordinary events that are of interest to a broad shareholder base and that need immediate attention prior to the next annual meeting. For example, the Board has called two special meetings during the past three years in connection with important proposals, including proposals relating to the Company's reincorporation from Pennsylvania to Delaware, demonstrating that the Board is prepared to call special meetings where appropriate. However, special meetings are expensive and require significant legal, administrative, printing and distribution costs, and can potentially divert the attention of directors and management away from their oversight and operational responsibilities, respectively, in order to address the details of holding a special meeting. Such a diversion could potentially operate against the best interests of our shareholders overall, in order to serve the narrow interests of the shareholders requesting the special meeting.
Other Shareholder Rights. The Board believes that the Company's current special meeting shareholder right should be considered in the context of Arconic's overall corporate governance, including the shareholder rights provided under its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. In addition to the existing right of holders of 25% of Arconic's outstanding common stock to call a special meeting, Arconic has:
 a declassified Board, providing shareholders with the opportunity to elect all members of the Board on an annual basis; 
​
 no supermajority voting provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws; 
​
 a proxy access bylaw, which allows eligible shareholders or groups of shareholders to include director nominees for up to the greater of two candidates or 20% of the Board in the Company's annual proxy materials; 
​
 provided shareholders with the ability to take action without a meeting if written consent is received from shareholders holding not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to take such action at a meeting at which all shares of Arconic stock entitled to vote thereon were present and voted; 
​
 changed the Company's jurisdiction of incorporation from Pennsylvania to Delaware, a leading jurisdiction with a comprehensive and coherent set of corporate laws that are responsive to the evolving legal and business needs of corporations organized under Delaware law; 
​
 executive compensation programs to reflect the Company's financial and strategic goals; and 
​
 a Finance Committee of the Board to review and provide advice and counsel regarding the Company's capital structure, financing transactions, significant transactions such as acquisitions and divestitures, and other financial matters. 
​
In addition, shareholders have numerous other protections and ways to make their voice heard, including through Arconic's robust shareholder engagement efforts and the fact that under Delaware law and New York Stock Exchange rules, Arconic must submit certain important matters to a shareholder vote, including mergers, large share issuances, the adoption of equity compensation plans and amendments to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation.
Board Recommends a Vote Against this Proposal. The existing 25% threshold protects shareholder interests by ensuring that special meeting matters are (i) of concern to a significant number of shareholders, (ii) worth the significant expense to the Company, and (iii) not an unnecessary distraction to the Board and management. Based on the foregoing, the Board believes the adoption of this proposal for a 10% threshold is unnecessary and not in the best interests of Arconic or its shareholders.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "AGAINST" ITEM 5, the shareholder proposal, for the reasons discussed above.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Questions and Answers About the Meeting and Voting
1.
Who is entitled to vote and how many votes do I have? 
​
If you were a holder of record of Arconic common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "common stock"), at the close of business on March 25, 2019, you are eligible to vote at the annual meeting. For each matter presented for vote, you have one vote for each share you own.
​
2.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record/registered shareholder and as a beneficial owner of shares? 
​
Shareholder of Record or Registered Shareholder. If your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare, you are considered a "shareholder of record" or a "registered shareholder" of those shares.
Beneficial Owner of Shares. If your shares are held in an account at a bank, brokerage firm or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name. In that case, you will have received these proxy materials from the bank, brokerage firm or other similar organization holding your account and, as a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, brokerage firm or similar organization as to how to vote the shares held in your account.
​
3.
How can I attend the annual meeting? 
​
If you plan to attend the meeting, you will need an admission ticket. You may attend the meeting if you were a shareholder as of the close of business on March 25, 2019. Only shareholders and authorized guests of the Company may attend the meeting and all attendees will be required to show a valid form of ID (such as a government-issued form of photo identification).
Shareholder of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and would like an admission ticket to the annual meeting, have your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") available and call 1-866-804-9594 or visit www.ArconicAdmissionTicket.com and follow the instructions provided.
Beneficial Owner of Shares. If you hold your shares in street-name (i.e., through an account at a bank, brokerage firm or similar organization) and would like an admission ticket to attend the meeting, please direct such requests to: Corporate Election Services, P.O. Box 125, Pittsburgh, PA 15230-0125, or call 1-877-382-0000 or email ArconicAgent@ProxyAgent.com. Please include proof of share ownership, such as a letter from your bank or broker or a recent brokerage statement. Street-name holders planning on voting in person at the annual meeting must provide a "legal proxy" from their bank or broker.
​
4.
Will the annual meeting be webcast? 
​
Yes, our annual meeting will be webcast live on May 14, 2019. You are invited to visit http://www.arconic.com under "Investors — Annual Meeting" at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 14, 2019, to access the webcast of the meeting. An archived copy of the webcast also will be available on our website.
​
5.
How do I vote if I am a shareholder of record? 
​
By Telephone or Internet. All shareholders of record can vote by telephone within the United States, U.S. territories and Canada, by calling the toll-free number on the proxy card, or through the Internet, following the procedures and instructions described on the proxy card. The telephone and Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been recorded properly. TABLE OF CONTENTS
2019 Proxy Statement   ​
Questions and Answers About the Meeting and Voting (continued)
​
By Mail. All shareholders of record can also vote by mail, by signing, dating and returning the proxy card. If you are a shareholder of record and received a Notice, you may request a written proxy card by following the instructions included in the Notice. If you sign and return your proxy card but do not mark any selections giving specific voting instructions, your shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
In Person. All shareholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. See Question 3 regarding how to attend the annual meeting.
Whether you plan to attend the meeting or not, we encourage you to vote by proxy as soon as possible. The proxy committee will vote your shares according to your directions.
​
6.
How do I vote if I am a beneficial owner of shares? 
​
Your broker is not permitted to vote on your behalf on the election of directors and other matters to be considered at the annual meeting (except on the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors for 2019), unless you provide specific instructions by completing and returning the voting instruction form from your broker, bank or other financial institution or following the instructions provided to you for voting your shares via telephone or the Internet. For your vote to be counted, you will need to communicate your voting decisions to your broker, bank or other financial institution before the date of the annual meeting. If you wish to vote your shares at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from that entity and bring it with you to hand in with your ballot. See Question 3 regarding how to obtain an admission ticket to the annual meeting.
​
7.
How do I vote if I participate in one of the employee savings plans? 
​
You must provide the trustee of the employee savings plan with your voting instructions in advance of the meeting. You may do so by returning your voting instructions by mail, or submitting them by telephone or electronically using the Internet. You cannot vote your shares in person at the annual meeting; the trustee is the only one who can vote your shares. The trustee will vote your shares as you have instructed. If the trustee does not receive your instructions, your shares generally will be voted in proportion to the way the other plan participants voted. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustee, your voting instructions must be received by 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 12, 2019.
​
8.
Can I change my vote? 
​
There are several ways in which you may revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions before the time of voting at the meeting (please note that, in order to be counted, the revocation or change must be by 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 14, 2019, or by 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time on May 12, 2019, in the case of instructions to the trustee of an employee savings plan). To revoke your proxy or change your voting instructions:
 Vote again by telephone or at the Internet website; 
​
 Mail a revised proxy card or voting instruction form that is dated later than the prior one; 
​
 Shareholders of record may vote in person at the annual meeting; 
​
 Shareholders of record may notify Arconic's Corporate Secretary in writing that a prior proxy is revoked; or 
​
 Employee savings plan participants may notify the plan trustee in writing that prior voting instructions are revoked or are changed. 
​
Only the latest validly executed proxy that you submit will be counted.
​
9.
Is my vote confidential? 
​
Yes. Proxy cards, ballots and voting tabulations that identify shareholders are kept confidential except:
 as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements and to assert or defend claims for or against the Company; 
​
 in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; 
​
 to allow for the independent inspector of election to certify the results of the vote; or 
​

​
 if a shareholder makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management. 
​
Corporate Election Services, the independent proxy tabulator used by Arconic, counts the votes and acts as the inspector of election for the 2019 Annual Meeting.
​
10.
What constitutes a "quorum" for the meeting? 
​
A quorum consists of a majority of the outstanding shares, present at the meeting or represented by proxy. A quorum is necessary to conduct business at the annual meeting. You are part of the quorum if you have voted by proxy. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if any) count as "shares present" at the meeting for purposes of determining a quorum. If you vote to abstain on one or more proposals, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
​
11.
What is the effect of an "ABSTAIN" vote? 
​
If you choose to abstain in voting on the election of directors, your abstention will have no effect, as the required vote is calculated as follows: votes "FOR" divided by the sum of votes "FOR" plus votes "AGAINST."
If you choose to abstain on voting on any other matter at our annual meeting, your abstention will be counted as a vote "AGAINST" the proposal, as the required vote is calculated as follows: votes "FOR" divided by the sum of votes "FOR" plus votes "AGAINST" plus votes "ABSTAINING."
​
12.
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals, and how are votes counted? 
​
At the close of business on March 25, 2019, the record date for the meeting, Arconic had outstanding 453,083,173 shares of common stock. Each share of common stock outstanding on the record date is entitled to one vote for each director nominee and one vote for each of the other proposals to be voted on.
The Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") and the NYSE listing standards govern the voting standards applicable to actions taken by our shareholders at the annual meeting. Under our Bylaws, assuming a quorum is present at the annual meeting, in all matters other than the election of directors, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the matter will be the act of the Company's shareholders. Under the DGCL and our Bylaws, shares that abstain constitute shares that are present and entitled to vote, and have the practical effect of being voted "against" the matter, other than in the election of directors.
With respect to the election of directors, in order to be elected, each nominee must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting in respect of his or her election, meaning that the number of shares voted "FOR" a director's election exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the number of votes cast with respect to that director's election. Broker non-votes and abstentions will have no impact, as they are not counted as votes cast for this purpose.
​
13.
What is a Broker Non-Vote? 
​
A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker submits a proxy for the meeting with respect to a discretionary matter but does not vote on non-discretionary matters because the beneficial owner did not provide voting instructions on those matters. Under NYSE rules, the proposal to ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019 (Item 2) is considered a "discretionary" item. This means that brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on Item 2 on behalf of clients (beneficial owners) who have not furnished voting instructions at least 15 days before the date of the annual meeting. In contrast, all of the other proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement are "nondiscretionary" items—brokerage firms that have not received voting instructions from their clients on these matters may not vote on these proposals.

Questions and Answers About the Meeting and Voting (continued)
​
14.
What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice? 
​
If you are a shareholder of record or participate in Arconic's Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan or employee savings plans, you will receive one Notice (or if you are an employee with an Arconic email address, an email proxy form) for all shares of common stock held in or credited to your accounts as of the record date, if the account names are exactly the same. If your shares are registered differently and are in more than one account, you will receive more than one Notice or email proxy form, and in that case, you can and are urged to vote all of your shares, which will require you to vote more than once. To avoid this situation in the future, we encourage you to have all accounts registered in the same name and address whenever possible. You can do this by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-888-985-2058 (in the United States and Canada) or 1-201-680-6578 (all other locations) or through the Computershare website, www.computershare.com.
​
15.
What is "householding"? 
​
Shareholders of record who have the same last name and address and who request paper copies of the proxy materials will receive only one copy unless one or more of them notifies us that they wish to receive individual copies. This method of delivery, known as "householding," will help ensure that shareholder households do not receive multiple copies of the same document, helping to reduce our printing and postage costs, as well as saving natural resources. Householding will not in any way affect dividend check mailings.
We will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of the Annual Report, Proxy Statement, or other proxy materials, as applicable, to a security holder at a shared address to which a single copy of the document was delivered. Please direct such requests to Corporate Election Services, P.O. Box 125, Pittsburgh, PA 15230-0125, or at 1-877-382-0000 or email to papercopy@sendmaterial.com.
Shareholders of record may request to begin or to discontinue householding in the future by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-888-985-2058 (in the United States and Canada), 1-201-680-6578 (all other locations), by mail to Computershare, P.O. Box 505000, Louisville, KY 40233-5000 or through the Computershare website, www.computershare.com. Shareholders owning their shares through a bank, broker or other nominee may request to begin or to discontinue householding by contacting their bank, broker or other nominee.

ATTACHMENT A – Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures for Audit and Non-Audit Services
I. Statement of Policy
​
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence. Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent auditor has received pre-approval under this policy, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee before the service is provided. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels under this policy will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee before the service is provided.
The term of any pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period. The Audit Committee will periodically revise the list of pre-approved services, based on subsequent determinations.
II. Delegation
​
The Audit Committee delegates pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Committee. In addition, the Chairman may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of the other members of the Audit Committee. The Chairman or member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.
III. Audit Services
​
The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees will be subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will approve, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, company structure or other matters.
In addition to the annual Audit services engagement approved by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant pre-approval for other Audit services, which are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide.
IV. Audit-Related Services
​
Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements and that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee believes that the provision of Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor.
V. Tax Services
​
The Audit Committee believes that the independent auditor can provide Tax services to the Company such as tax compliance and support, without impairing the auditor's independence. However, the Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the sole purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.
VI. All Other Services
​
The Audit Committee may grant pre-approval to those permissible non-audit services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and recurring services, and would not impair the independence of the auditor. TABLE OF CONTENTS

​
VII. Pre-Approval Fee Levels
​
Pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditor will be established periodically by the Audit Committee. Any proposed services exceeding these levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
VIII. Supporting Documentation
​
With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the independent auditor has provided detailed descriptions regarding the specific services to be provided. Upon completion of services, the independent auditor will provide to management detailed back-up documentation, including hours, personnel and task description relating to the specific services provided.
IX. Procedures
​
Requests or applications to provide services that require separate approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the independent auditor and the Chief Financial Officer and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on auditor independence.

Net income excluding Special items and Diluted EPS excluding Special items are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that these measures are meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Arconic excluding the impacts of Restructuring and other charges, Discrete tax items, and Other special items (collectively, "Special items"). There can be no assurances that additional special items will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both Net income determined under GAAP as well as Net income excluding Special items. Discrete tax items for each period included the following: 
​
 for the year ended December 31, 2018, a benefit related to certain prior year foreign investment losses no longer recapturable ($74); a benefit to reverse a foreign tax reserve that is effectively settled ($38), a benefit to release valuation allowances and revalue deferred taxes due to current year tax law and tax rate changes in various U.S. states ($12), a benefit to record prior year adjustments in various jurisdictions ($7), a benefit to recognize the tax impact of prior year foreign losses in continuing operations that were supported by foreign income in other comprehensive income ($6), partially offset by a charge to establish a tax reserve in Spain ($60); a net charge resulting from the Company's finalized analysis of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 ($59); and a net charge for a number of small items ($3); and 
​
 for the year ended December 31, 2017, a charge resulting from the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts of 2017 that principally relates to the revaluation of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to 21% ($272), charge for a reserve against a foreign attribute resulting from the Company's Delaware reincorporation ($23), partially offset by a benefit for the reversal of state valuation allowances ($69) and a number of small items ($3). 
​ Other special items included the following: 
​
 for the year ended December 31, 2018, costs related to settlements of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions ($38), a benefit from establishing a tax indemnification receivable ($29) reflecting Alcoa Corporation's 49% share of the Spanish tax reserve, costs related to the early redemption of the Company's outstanding 5.720% Senior Notes due 2019 ($19), legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower ($18), strategy and portfolio review costs ($7), a charge for a number of small tax items ($5), and an other charge ($1); and 
​
 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an impairment of goodwill related to the forgings and extrusions business ($719), a gain on the sale of a portion of Arconic's investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock ($351), a gain on the exchange of the remaining portion of Arconic's investment in Alcoa Corporation common stock ($167), a favorable adjustment to the Firth Rixson earn-out ($81), costs associated with the Company's early redemption of  $1,250 of outstanding senior notes ($76), proxy, advisory, and governance-related costs ($58), a favorable adjustment to a separation-related guarantee liability ($25), costs associated with the separation of Alcoa Inc. ($18), legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower ($14), and costs associated with the Company's Delaware reincorporation ($3).

​ The tax impact on special items is based on the applicable statutory rates whereby the difference between such rates and Arconic's consolidated estimated annual effective tax rate is itself a Special item. 
​ The average number of shares applicable to diluted EPS excluding Special items, includes certain share equivalents as their effect was dilutive. For all periods presented, share equivalents associated with outstanding employee stock options and awards and shares underlying outstanding convertible debt (acquired through the acquisition of RTI) were dilutive based on Net income excluding Special items. For the year ended December 31, 2017, share equivalents associated with mandatory convertible preferred stock were anti-dilutive based on Net income excluding Special items.

Reconciliation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow

​ ​ ​ ​ ​  December 31, 2018   ​ ​ ​  December 31, 2017   ​ 
[END TABLE]
 Accounting guidance effective in 2018 changed the classification of Cash receipts from sold receivables in the cash flow statement, reclassifying it from Operating activities to Investing activities. Under the prior accounting guidance, Cash receipts from sold receivables were included in the (Increase) in receivables line in the Operating activities section of the statement of cash flows. 
​
There has been no change in the net cash funding in the sale of accounts receivable program in the fourth quarter of 2018. It remains at $350.
Adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures (due to the fact that these expenditures are considered necessary to maintain and expand Arconic's asset base and are expected to generate future cash flows from operations), as well as cash receipts from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables. In conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting guidance on changes to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments within the statement of cash flows, specifically as it relates to the requirement to reclassify cash receipts from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables from operating activities to investing activities, the Company has changed the calculation of its measure of Adjusted free cash flow to include cash receipts from net sales of beneficial interest in sold receivables. This change to our measure of Adjusted free cash flow is being implemented to ensure consistent presentation of this measure across all historical periods. The adoption of this accounting guidance does not reflect a change in our underlying business or activities. It is important to note that Adjusted free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non-discretionary expenditures, such as mandatory debt service requirements, are not deducted from the measure.

Controllable free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews Operating income excluding Special items, adding back noncash depreciation and amortization, and adjusting for controllable items including capital expenditures and changes in working capital. The Controllable free cash flow presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The adjustment for incentive compensation included the normalization of foreign currency exchange rates realized in 2018 results to those contemplated in Arconic's 2018 Plan.

Adjusted revenue is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as Adjusted revenue is more reflective of historical revenue performance.

Arconic's definition of Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to  TABLE OF CONTENTS

investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Arconic's operating performance and the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA, excluding Special items is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Arconic excluding the impacts of Special items, such as costs associated with the settlement of certain customer claims primarily related to product introductions, strategy and portfolio review, and legal and other advisory costs related to Grenfell Tower (collectively "Special items"). This measure provides additional information with respect to Arconic's operating performance and the Company's ability to meet its financial obligations excluding such costs.

[END TABLE]
RONA is a non-GAAP financial measure. RONA is calculated as Net income excluding Special items divided by working capital and net PP&E. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors as RONA helps management and investors determine the percentage of net income the company is generating from its assets. This ratio tells how effectively and efficiently the company is using its assets to generate earnings. See "Reconciliation of Net income excluding Special items" for a description of Special items. 
​ The Deferred purchase program relates to an arrangement to sell certain customer receivables to several financial institutions on a recurring basis. Arconic is adding back the receivable for the purposes of the Working capital calculation. 
​ The adjustment for performance-based restricted share units included the normalization of foreign currency exchange rates realized in 2018 results to those contemplated in Arconic's 2018 Plan.

(A) To provide for either (I) termination of any such Award in exchange for an amount of cash, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction or event described above in this Section 4(f)(i) the Committee determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the exercise of such Award or realization of the Participant's rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment) or (II) the replacement of such Award with other rights or property selected by the Committee in its sole discretion;
(B) To provide that such Award be assumed by the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, or shall be substituted for by similar options, rights or awards covering the stock of the successor or survivor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares and prices;

Any payment by the Company in respect of such right may be made in cash, Shares, other property or any combination thereof, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine.

Any Restricted Share issued hereunder may be evidenced in such manner as the Committee in its sole discretion shall deem appropriate, including, without limitation, book-entry registration or issuance of a stock certificate or certificates. In the event any stock certificate is issued in respect of Restricted Shares awarded under the Plan, such certificate shall be registered in the name of the Participant and shall bear an appropriate legend referring to the terms, conditions, contingencies and restrictions applicable to such Award.

Change in Control Severance Plan), such Award shall become vested and exercisable to the extent outstanding at the time of such termination of service. Any Replacement Award that has become vested and exercisable pursuant to this paragraph shall expire on the earlier of  (A) thirty six (36) months following the date of termination of such Participant's service (or, if later, the conclusion of the applicable post-termination exercise period pursuant to the applicable Award Agreement) and (B) the last day of the term of such Replacement Award;

Change in Control Severance Plan) or by the Participant for Good Reason (as such term is defined in the Arconic Inc. Change in Control Severance Plan), such Award shall become free of all contingencies, restrictions and limitations and become vested and transferable to the extent outstanding;

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Committee may amend the Plan in such manner as may be necessary so as to have the Plan conform to local rules and regulations in any jurisdiction outside the United States or to qualify for or comply with any tax or regulatory requirement for which or with which the Board or Committee deems it necessary or desirable to qualify or comply.

SECTION 15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.
(a) Transferability of Awards. Awards may be transferred by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Except as set forth herein, awards shall be exercisable, during the Participant's lifetime, only by the Participant or, if permissible under applicable law, by the Participant's guardian or legal representative. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or limited by applicable laws, a Participant may, in the manner established by the Committee, designate a beneficiary to exercise the rights of the Participant with respect to any Award upon the death of the Participant. Unless otherwise provided by the Committee or limited by applicable laws, Awards may be transferred to one or more Family Members, individually or jointly, or to a trust whose beneficiaries include the Participant or one or more Family Members under terms and conditions established by the Committee. The Committee shall have authority to determine, at the time of grant, any other rights or restrictions applicable to the transfer of Awards; provided however, that no Award may be transferred to a third party for value or consideration. Except as provided in this Plan or the terms and conditions established for an Award, any Award shall be null and void and without effect upon any attempted assignment or transfer, including, without limitation, any purported assignment, whether voluntary or by operation of law, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition, attachment, divorce or trustee process or similar process, whether legal or equitable.
(b) Award Entitlement. No Employee or Director shall have any claim to be granted any Award under the Plan and there is no obligation for uniformity of treatment of Employees or Directors under the Plan.
(c) Terms and Conditions of Award. The prospective recipient of any Award under the Plan shall be deemed to have become a Participant subject to all the applicable terms and conditions of the Award upon the grant of the Award to the prospective recipient, unless the prospective recipient notifies the Company within 30 days of the grant that the prospective recipient does not accept the Award. This Section 15(c) is without prejudice to the Company's right to require a Participant to affirmatively accept the terms and conditions of an Award.
(d) Award Adjustments. The Committee shall be authorized to make adjustments in Performance Award criteria or in the terms and conditions of other Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events affecting the Company or its financial statements or changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles. The Committee may correct any defect, supply any omission or reconcile any inconsistency in the Plan or any Award in the manner and to the extent it shall deem desirable to carry it into effect.
(e) Committee Right to Cancel. The Committee shall have full power and authority to determine whether, to what extent and under what circumstances any Award shall be canceled or suspended at any time prior to a Change in Control: (i) if an Employee, without the consent of the Committee, while employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or after termination of such employment, becomes associated with, employed by, renders services to or owns any interest (other than an interest of up to 5% in a publicly traded company or any other nonsubstantial interest, as determined by the Committee) in any business that is in competition with the Company or any Subsidiary; (ii) in the event of the Participant's willful engagement in conduct which is injurious to the Company or any Subsidiary, monetarily, reputationally or otherwise; (iii) in the event of an Executive Officer's misconduct described in Section 15(f); or (iv) in order to comply with applicable laws as described in Section 15(h) below. For purposes of clause (ii), no act, or failure to act, on the Participant's part shall be deemed "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by the Participant not in good faith and without reasonable belief that the Participant's act, or failure to act, was in the best interest of the Company or a Subsidiary. In the event of a dispute concerning the application of this Section 15(e), no claim by the Company shall be given effect unless the Board determines that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Committee has the right to cancel an Award or Awards hereunder, and the Board finding to that effect is adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters of the entire membership of the Board (after reasonable notice to the Participant and an opportunity for the Participant to provide information to the Board in such manner as the Board, in its sole discretion, deems to be appropriate under the circumstances).
(f) Clawback. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, in accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, if the Board learns of any misconduct by an Executive Officer that contributed to the Company having to restate all or a portion of its financial statements, the Board will, to the full extent permitted by governing law, in all appropriate cases, effect the cancellation and recovery of Awards (or the value of Awards) previously granted to the Executive Officer if: (i) the amount of the Award was calculated based upon the achievement of certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement, (ii) the executive engaged in intentional misconduct that caused or partially caused the need for the restatement, and (iii) the amount of the Award had the financial results been properly reported  TABLE OF CONTENTS

All certificates for Shares delivered under the Plan pursuant to any Award shall be subject to such stock transfer orders and other restrictions as the Committee may deem advisable under the rules, regulations, and other requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any stock exchange upon which the Shares are then listed and any applicable Federal or state securities law, and the Committee may cause a legend or legends to be put on any such certificates to make appropriate reference to such restrictions.
(h) Compliance with Securities Laws and Other Requirements. No Award granted hereunder shall be construed as an offer to sell securities of the Company, and no such offer shall be outstanding, unless and until the Company in its sole discretion has determined that any such offer, if made, would be in compliance with all applicable requirements of the U.S. Federal securities laws and any other laws, rules, regulations, stock exchange listing or other requirements to which such offer, if made, would be subject. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver Shares pursuant to Awards granted hereunder prior to: (i) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable, and (ii) completion of any registration or other qualification with respect to the Shares under any applicable law in the United States or in a jurisdiction outside of the United States or procurement of any ruling or determination of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable or at a time when any such registration, qualification or determination is not current, has been suspended or otherwise has ceased to be effective. The inability or impracticability of the Company to obtain or maintain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained, and shall constitute circumstances in which the Committee may determine to amend or cancel Awards pertaining to such Shares, with or without consideration to the affected Participants.
(i) Dividends. No Award of Options or Stock Appreciation Rights shall have the right to receive dividends or dividend equivalents. A recipient of an Award of Restricted Shares shall receive dividends on the Restricted Shares, subject to this Section 15(i) and such other contingencies or restrictions, if any, as the Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose. Dividend equivalents shall accrue on Restricted Share Units (including Restricted Share Units that have a performance feature) and shall only be paid if and when such Restricted Share Units vest. Dividend equivalents that accrue on Restricted Share Units will be calculated at the same rate as dividends paid on the common stock of the Company. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on Restricted Share Units that have not vested or on Restricted Share Units that have not been earned during a Performance Period and in no event shall any other Award provide for the Participant's receipt of dividends or dividend equivalents in any form prior to the vesting of such Award or applicable portion thereof.
(j) Consideration for Awards. Except as otherwise required in any applicable Award Agreement or by the terms of the Plan, recipients of Awards under the Plan shall not be required to make any payment or provide consideration other than the rendering of services.
(k) Delegation of Authority by Committee. The Committee may delegate to one or more Executive Officers or a committee of Executive Officers the right to grant Awards to Employees who are not Executive Officers or Directors of the Company and to cancel or suspend Awards to Employees who are not Executive Officers or Directors of the Company. The Committee may delegate other of its administrative powers under the Plan to the extent not prohibited by applicable laws.
(l) Tax Obligations. The Company shall be authorized to withhold from any Award granted or payment due under the Plan the amount of Tax Obligations due in respect of an Award or payment hereunder and to take such other action as may be necessary in the opinion of the Company to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such Tax Obligations, including without limitation requiring the Participant to pay cash, withholding otherwise deliverable cash or Shares having a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld, forcing the sale of Shares issued pursuant to an Award (or exercise or vesting  TABLE OF CONTENTS

​
thereof) having a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld, or requiring the Participant to deliver to the Company already-owned Shares having a fair market value equal to the amount required to be withheld. For purposes of the foregoing, "Tax Obligations" means tax, social insurance and social security liability obligations and requirements in connection with the Awards, including, without limitation, (i) all U.S. Federal, state, and local income, employment and any other taxes (including the Participant's U.S. Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) obligation) that are required to be withheld by the Company (or a Subsidiary, as applicable), (ii) the Participant's and, to the extent required by the Company (or a Subsidiary, as applicable), the Company's (or a Subsidiary's) fringe benefit tax liability, if any, associated with the grant, vesting, or exercise of an Award or sale of Shares issued under the Award, and (iii) any other taxes, social insurance, social security liabilities or premium for which the Participant has an obligation, or which the Participant has agreed to bear, with respect to such Award (or exercise thereof or issuance of Shares or other consideration thereunder). Furthermore, the Committee shall be authorized to, but is not required to, establish procedures for election by Participants to satisfy such obligations for the payment of such taxes by delivery of or transfer of Shares to the Company or by directing the Company to retain Shares otherwise deliverable in connection with the Award. All personal taxes applicable to any Award under the Plan are the sole liability of the Participant.
(m) Other Compensatory Arrangements. Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable or applicable only in specific cases.
(n) Governing Law. The Plan and all determinations made and actions taken thereunder, to the extent not otherwise governed by the laws of the United States, shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of America, without reference to principles of conflict of laws, and construed accordingly.
(o) Severability. If any provision of this Plan is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, or would disqualify the Plan or any Award under any law deemed applicable by the Committee, such provision shall be construed or deemed amended to conform to applicable laws or if it cannot be construed or deemed amended without, in the determination of the Committee, materially altering the intent of the Plan, it shall be stricken and the remainder of the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.
(p) Awards to Non-U.S. Employees. Awards may be granted to Employees and Directors who are foreign nationals or residents or employed outside the United States, or both, on such terms and conditions different from those applicable to Awards to Employees and Directors who are not foreign nationals or residents or who are employed in the United States as may, in the judgment of the Committee, be necessary or desirable in order to recognize differences in local law, regulations or tax policy. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee or the Board, as applicable, are specifically authorized to (i) adopt rules and procedures regarding the conversion of local currency, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with local requirements and (ii) adopt sub-plans, Award Agreements and Plan and Award Agreement addenda as may be deemed desirable to accommodate foreign laws, regulations and practice. The Committee also may impose conditions on the exercise or vesting of Awards in order to minimize the Company's or a Subsidiary's obligation with respect to tax equalization for Employees on assignments outside their home countries. Notwithstanding the discretion of the Committee under this section, the Participant remains solely liable for any applicable personal taxes.
(q) Repricing Prohibited. Except as provided in Section 4(f), the terms of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights may not be amended, and action may not otherwise be taken without shareholder approval, to: (i) reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, (ii) cancel outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for Options or Stock Appreciation Rights with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, or (iii) replace outstanding Options or Stock Appreciation Rights in exchange for other Awards or cash at a time when the exercise price of such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights is higher than the Fair Market Value of a Share.
(r) Deferral. The Committee may require or permit Participants to elect to defer the issuance of Shares or the settlement of Awards in cash or other property to the extent that such deferral complies with Section 409A of the Code. The Committee may also authorize the payment or crediting of interest, dividends or dividend equivalents on any deferred amounts.
(s) Compliance with Section 409A of the Code. Except to the extent specifically provided otherwise by the Committee and notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, Awards under the Plan are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code so as to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes or penalties under Section 409A of the Code. If  TABLE OF CONTENTS

​
the Committee determines that an Award, payment, distribution, transaction or any other action or arrangement contemplated by the provisions of the Plan would, if undertaken, cause a Participant to become subject to any additional taxes or other penalties under Section 409A of the Code, then unless the Committee specifically provides otherwise, such Award, payment, distribution, transaction or other action or arrangement shall not be given effect to the extent it causes such result and the related provisions of the Plan and/or Award Agreement will be deemed modified, or, if necessary, suspended in order to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code to the extent determined appropriate by the Committee, in each case without the consent of or notice to the Participant. No payment that constitutes deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code that would otherwise be made under the Plan or an Award Agreement upon a Participant's termination of employment will be made or provided unless and until such termination is also a "separation from service," as determined in accordance with Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything elsewhere in the Plan or an Award Agreement to the contrary, if a Participant is a "specified employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code at the time of termination of employment with respect to an Award, then solely to the extent necessary to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code, the commencement of any payments or benefits under the Award shall be delayed to the extent required by Code Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i). Further notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code in order to make payment of an Award upon a Change in Control, the applicable transaction or event described in SECTION 2 must qualify as a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company or as a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company pursuant to Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(v) of the Code, and if it does not, then unless otherwise specified in the applicable Award Agreement, payment of such Award will be made on the Award's original payment schedule or, if earlier, upon the death of the Participant. Although the Company may attempt to avoid adverse tax treatment under Section 409A of the Code, the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on holders of Awards under the Plan.
(t) Effect of Headings. The Section headings and subheadings herein are for convenience of reference only, are not to be considered a part hereof, and shall in no way modify or restrict any of the terms or provisions hereof.
SECTION 16. TERM OF PLAN. No Award shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after May 2, 2024, but any Award theretofore granted may extend beyond that date. The Plan became effective upon its approval by the Company's shareholders on May 3, 2013 and was subsequently amended and restated by the Board and re-approved by shareholders, effective May 6, 2016. On February 1, 2018, the Board approved the First Amendment to the Plan. On March 27, 2018, the Board approved a second amendment and restatement of the Plan, which was approved by the Company's shareholders on May 16, 2018. On February 12, 2019 (the "Third Restatement Date"), the Board approved a third amendment and restatement of the Plan, which shall be presented for approval by the Company's shareholders on May 14, 2019. For avoidance of doubt, no amendment or restatement of the Plan shall affect the terms or conditions of any Outstanding Qualified Performance-Based Award, to the extent that it would result in a material modification of such Award within the meaning of P.L. 115-97, Section 13601(e)(2).
SECTION 17. TERMINATION OF PRIOR PLAN. No stock options or other awards may be granted under the Amended and Restated 2009 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan after May 2, 2013, but all such awards theretofore granted shall extend for the full stated terms thereof and be administered under the Amended and Restated 2009 Alcoa Stock Incentive Plan. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, all outstanding awards previously granted under Prior Plans shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the applicable Prior Plans under which such awards were granted.
