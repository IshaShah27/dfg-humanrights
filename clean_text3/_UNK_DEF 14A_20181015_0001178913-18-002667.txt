[END TABLE]
As Follows are the Grounds for the Application:
A.          Preliminary Clarification - The Jurisdiction of the Honorable Court          The DFNS Company (A Company Incorporated in the USA) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  The said application relates to the proposed arrangement for the companies of the DFNS Group and for the convening of creditors' meetings in the Achidatex Company (which is an Israel company under liquidation proceedings - Dissolution File 19612-12-15) and the DFNS Company - A foreign company incorporated in the United States of America (previously listed on NASDAQ - OTC was moved to a lower level of listing defined as Pink Sheet - and eventually was suspended from trade and today there is no securities or trade activity).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  The courts in Israel have the jurisdiction to dissolve foreign companies and/or to order the convening of creditors' meetings and shareholders' meetings pursuant to Section 350, such as the DFNS Company, in light of the provisions of Section 380(a) of the Companies Ordinance [New Version], 5743-1983 (hereinafter: the "Companies Ordinance"), which makes the acquiring of international jurisdiction conditional on the existence of assets in Israel..  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Section 380 of the Companies Ordinance stipulates -  
[END TABLE]
"380. (A) The provisions of Chapters XII to XVI of this Ordinance and the provisions of the Third Chapter of the Ninth Part of the Companies Law, 5759-1999 (in this section - the Settlement or Compromise Chapter) shall also apply, mutatis mutandis, in accordance with the circumstances, to dissolution, by a court or under its supervision, of a foreign company which has assets in Israel, whether registered in Israel or not registered in Israel, and of any other corporation or incorporation for which the Minister has made the provisions of this Ordinance applicable to them in an order."
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Therefore, in order for the Israeli courts to be vested with "international jurisdiction", regarding a foreign company1, for dissolution proceedings or proceedings for a Creditors' Arrangement pursuant to Section 350 of the Companies Law, it is required that the foreign company have "assets in Israel".  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  In the judgment in the case of Civil Appeal 2706/11 Sybil Germany Public Company Limited vs. Hermetich Trusts (1975) Ltd. (Published in Nevo), the Supreme Court interpreted the term "asset" in the widest sense, and also applied it to "rights of claim".  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  In this case, the DFNS Company directly holds 24% of the issued and paid up share capital of the Achidatex Company, which is a company incorporated and active in Israel, and holds - through the Export Erez Inc. Company - the remaining 74% of the issued share capital of the Achidatex Company. Moreover, the DFNS Company holds granddaughter companies which operated in Israel - the Mayotex Company Ltd. and Export Erez Company Ltd. Consequently, there is not, nor can there be any dispute that the DFNS Company has an "asset" in Israel, in a manner which vests the court in Israel with the jurisdiction to order the convening of the creditors' meetings in its affairs pursuant to Section 350 of the Companies Law, even though we are talking about a foreign company (an outside company).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  Above and beyond anything which may be required it will be noted that the directors of the DFNS Company are Israeli directors who live permanently in Israel (Mr. Uri Nissani), the DFNS Company had business ties with companies in Israel, including through a subsidiary and a granddaughter company, and the controlling interest in the DFNS Company is Mr. Uri Nissani (through the Yechiam Company Ltd., which is a company incorporated in Israel).

[END TABLE]
Should the arrangements not be approved, the dividend to which the creditors will be entitled may be near zero, whilst the Dissolution Fund will bear the costs of conducting the proceedings, without any guarantee regarding the final result.
[BEGIN TABLE]
67.  The only sources available for payment for the creditors in the DFNS Company group are: (a) Monies which may be received from the office holders liability insurance police issued by AIG; and (b) personal guarantees which were given by the Controlling Interest to creditors.  
[END TABLE]
In the view of the Controlling Interest - His contribution to the arrangement is significant for a private person and reflects the maximum amount which he can make for the arrangement.
Regarding the monies of the policy - in order to receive payment therefrom, there is a need to prove a covered causes of action against the office holder and the directors in the companies, in their roles as such, and to substantiate the claims of damage, all in consideration of the limitation of the liability ceiling in the policy (which according to the thinking of the Liquidator and the office Holder stands at 5 million dollars and which according to the thinking of AIG stands at 2.5 million dollars).
The Pending Claims are in the preliminary stages with their being no guarantee regrading he final results, inter alia, considering the disputes on the issue of liability, the damage and the insurance cover (for some of the Pending Claims). Therefore, considering the risks and the chances involved in the continued conducting of the proceedings, and considering the recommendation of the Mediator, the Office Holder and the Controlling Interest believe that this is a reasonable and appropriate arrangement.
[BEGIN TABLE]

As stated above - should the creditors' arrangement not be approved by the Hon. Court, or whatever reason, the parties reserve all their claims, while nothing stated in this application and/or which is omitted from the proposed creditors' arrangements shall derogate from any claim and/or right available to any of the parties and all their rights and claims are reserved.
