PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF TRUSTEES 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Our Board has nominated eleven trustees for election at this year's annual meeting to hold office until the next annual meeting. 
Nine of the nominees are currently trustees and were elected to the Board by our shareholders at our 2018 annual meeting. The other two nominees are the President and Chief Executive Officer, Joseph D. Russell, Jr., and recently retired Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, John Reyes, who are currently trustees and were appointed to the Board effective January 1, 2019, to serve until this year's annual meeting. Each of the eleven nominees has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected. We expect all nominees to attend our 2019 annual meeting. 
If any of our nominees become unavailable to stand for election, the proxies named on the proxy card intend to vote your Common Stock for the election of any substitute nominee proposed by the Board of Trustees. 
We believe that each nominee has the skills, experience and personal qualities the Board seeks in its trustees and that the combination of these nominees creates an effective Board that functions well and serves the best interests of Public Storage and our shareholders. 
The Board is responsible for overseeing management and providing sound governance on behalf of our shareholders. Risk management oversight is a key priority. 
The Board carries out its responsibilities through highly capable trustees, including our Lead Independent Trustee, a strong committee structure and adherence to our corporate governance principles. 
BOARD EVALUATIONS 
AND NOMINATIONS 
In our annual Board evaluation and nomination process, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee (Governance Committee) evaluates our trustees in light of current needs of the Board and the company. In addition, during the course of the year, the committee discusses Board succession and reviews potential candidates. The Governance Committee has retained a third party to assist in identifying potential nominees. 
Our annual process involves assessments at the Board, Board Committee, and individual trustee levels under the direction of the Governance Committee Chair. This process assists the Board on who it should nominate to stand for election based on current company and Board needs. In addition, the Governance Committee's Board candidate nomination process includes the continual evaluation of potential new candidates for Board membership, which it takes into consideration when recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each annual meeting of shareholders. 
To facilitate Board refreshment, our governance guidelines further provide that trustees will not be nominated or appointed to the Board if they are 73 years or older on the first day of their term of service. Term limits on trustees' service have not been instituted. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 12 
BOARD QUALIFICATIONS 
The Governance Committee has developed a matrix of skills to assess the qualifications of trustee candidates, including: 
(a) diversity enhancing qualities – age, remaining time until mandatory retirement age, gender and diverse background; 
(b) core trustee attributes – independence, high integrity and ethical standards, public company service, risk management experience, understanding or experience with complex public companies or like organizations, and ability to work collegially and collaboratively with other trustees and management; and 
(c) skills such as financial literacy, industry experience, operational management experience, capital markets/banking expertise, corporate governance, real estate, tax, senior executive experience, and other expertise that may be important for the company's strategies. 
The Governance Committee considers all these relevant attributes of each Board candidate, including their professional skills, experience and knowledge, and gender, race, ethnicity, nationality and background, with the goal of putting forth a diverse slate of candidates with a combination of skills, experience, and personal qualities that will serve the Board and its committees, our company, and our shareholders well. 
BOARD FOCUS ON DIVERSITY 
Board succession and an appropriate balance of refreshment and experience, including diversity, are a focus of the Governance Committee and the Board. Our Board reflects diverse perspectives, including a complementary mix of skills, experience and backgrounds, which we believe are paramount to our ability to represent the interests of all shareholders. 
Our trustees, a majority of whom are independent, have a broad range of experience in varying fields, including finance, real estate, financial reporting, banking, international affairs, and governance. A majority of our trustees hold or have held directorships at other U.S. public companies. Four of our trustees, in addition to our Chairman and our CEO, have served as chief executive officers, and all have demonstrated superb leadership and intellectual and analytical skills gained from deep experience in management, finance and corporate governance. Two of our current trustees are women and 45% of our current trustees are age 60 or younger. Additionally, our Chairman and our CEO have also provided meaningful in-person opportunities for the Board to interact with key members of management beyond our executive officers on a quarterly basis. Fifty percent of our current executive officers are diverse based on gender or ethnicity (which includes our Chief Legal Officer and our Chief Human Resources Officer). Similarly, over 50% percent of our 5,400 employees are diverse based on ethnicity and over 71% of our employees are female. Our Board recognizes the importance of diversity across the company including on the Board, and supports management's efforts to enhance all aspects of diversity throughout the company. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 13 
NOMINEE QUALIFICATIONS 
The Board has nominated eleven trustees, nine of whom are incumbents elected at our 2018 annual meeting, and two of whom were appointed to the Board effective January 1, 2019 to serve until our 2019 annual meeting and who are our current President and CEO and our recently retired Senior Vice President and CFO. Six of our nominees are independent. The Board believes that our trustee nominees provide Public Storage with the combined skills, experience, and personal qualities needed for an effective and engaged Board. We recommend that you vote FOR each nominee.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE 
Our Board oversees the CEO and other senior management in the operation of Public Storage to assure that the long-term interests of shareholders are served. To satisfy the Board's duties, we expect our trustees to take a proactive, focused approach to their positions. 
Our governance structure is designed to foster principled actions, informed and effective decision-making, and appropriate monitoring of both compliance and performance. Our key governance documents, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Conduct, Code of Ethics and committee charters are available at the "Investor Relations" section of our website, publicstorage.com, or by writing to Public Storage, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349, Attention: Corporate Secretary. We will disclose any amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics on our website and in accordance with SEC and NYSE requirements. 
PROXY ACCESS 
In February 2018, our Board amended and restated our bylaws to provide for proxy access, thereby giving our shareholders an even greater voice in trustee elections. The amendment provides that a shareholder, or a group of up to 20 shareholders, owning at least 3% of the company's outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least 3 years, may include in our proxy materials trustee nominees constituting up to the greater of two trustees or 20% of the number of trustees on the Board, provided that the shareholder and the nominees satisfy the eligibility requirements in our bylaws. Proxy access will first apply with respect to our 2019 annual meeting. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to determine the optimal leadership structure to provide effective oversight of management. As a result, the Board does not have a policy as to whether the roles of Chairman and CEO are separated and believes that Public Storage shareholders are best served when the Board has flexibility to consider the relevant facts and circumstances when a Chairman is elected, to ensure that the Board leadership structure best reflects the needs of the company at that time. 
As such, when B. Wayne Hughes, the company's former Chairman and co-founder, retired as a result of having reached the mandatory retirement age for Board members, the Board determined to combine the roles of Chairman and CEO when it elected Ronald L. Havner, Jr. as Chairman in August 2011. The Board considered that many advantages of separating the roles of Chairman and CEO could be met in significant part by the appointment of a "Lead Independent Trustee." 
Mr. Havner retired as CEO effective January 1, 2019. The Board determined that Mr. Havner will remain as Chairman of the Board and thus as of January 1, 2019 the roles of Chairman and CEO are separate. 
Our Board established the position of Lead Independent Trustee in 2011 to provide for an independent leadership role on the Board when the roles of Chairman and CEO were combined. 
We describe more fully the role of the Lead Independent Trustee in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Among other things, the Lead Independent Trustee presides at all executive sessions of the non-management trustees and the independent trustees. Our Lead Independent Trustee is Gary Pruitt, who was re-appointed in 2017 to serve in that capacity for a three-year term expiring in November 2020. Mr. Pruitt continues to serve as Lead Independent Trustee after the roles of 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 22 
Chairman and CEO were separated on January 1, 2019. 
CHAIRMAN EMERITUS 
Following his retirement as Chairman, B. Wayne Hughes has continued to serve as Chairman Emeritus and Co-Founder, which enables the Board to continue to benefit from his wisdom, judgment, and experience. Pursuant to a consulting arrangement approved by the Compensation Committee and the disinterested trustees in March 2004, Mr. Hughes (1) agreed to be available for up to 50 partial days a year for consulting services, (2) receives compensation of $60,000 per year and the use of a company car and (3) is provided with the services of an executive assistant at the company's headquarters. This consulting arrangement was extended in 2018 through December 31, 2019. 
BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our Board is responsible for overseeing our company-wide approach to major risks and our policies for assessing and managing these risks. Oversight for certain specific risks falls under the responsibilities of our Board committees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       related to compensation policies and practices applicable to all employees. Most recently, in February 2019, the Compensation Committee considered the annual report and also considered and  discussed with management management's conclusion that the company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company.  
[END TABLE]
The committees regularly advise the full Board of their oversight activities. Critical components of our risk oversight framework include regular communication among the Board and our executive management team, and our management and operations teams to identify, assess and manage risk. 
Our Board and Board committees regularly receive presentations from management on potential and perceived risks to the business. Additionally, all trustees have access to members of management if a trustee wishes to follow up on items discussed outside of the Board or committee meeting. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 23 
BOARD ORIENTATION AND EDUCATION 
Each new trustee participates in an orientation program and receives materials and briefings concerning our business, industry, management and corporate governance policies and practices. We provide continuing education for all trustees through board materials and presentations, discussions with management and the opportunity to attend external board education programs. In addition, all Board members have access to resources of the National Association of Corporate Directors through a company membership. 
TRUSTEE INDEPENDENCE 
We require that a majority of the Board be independent in accordance with NYSE rules. To determine whether a trustee is independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that there is no direct or indirect material relationship between the company and the trustee. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD 
We appreciate your input. Shareholders and interested parties can communicate with any of the trustees, individually or as a group, by writing to them in care of Corporate Secretary, Public Storage, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349. We will forward each communication intended for the Board and received by the Corporate Secretary related to the operation of the company and not otherwise commercial in nature to the specified party following its clearance through normal security procedures. 
TRUSTEE ATTENDANCE 
The Board held seven meetings in 2018, including telephonic meetings, and all of the trustees attended 90% or more of the aggregate number of Board and applicable committee meetings on which he or she served during 2018 (held during the periods they served). We do not have a policy regarding trustees' attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders, but trustees are encouraged to attend. All of our trustees attended the annual meeting last year. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 24 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
The three standing committees of the Board are Audit, Governance, and Compensation. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit, Governance, and Compensation Committees is an independent trustee in accordance with NYSE rules. 
Each committee has a charter, which generally states the purpose of the committee and outlines the committee's structure and responsibilities. The committees must review the adequacy of their charter on an annual basis. The current membership information for our Board committees is as follows:

COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEES 
Members of the Board who are not also Public Storage employees (non-management trustees) receive compensation for their service. The Board determines the form and amount of compensation for non-management trustees after consideration of the recommendation of either the Compensation Committee or the Governance Committee. The Board has approved the mix of cash and equity compensation described below. 
Cash Retainers. Retainers are paid quarterly in cash and are pro-rated when a trustee joins the Board (or in the case of the Lead Independent Trustee, when an appointment is made) other than at the beginning of a calendar year. Below are the annual retainers that non-management trustees were entitled to receive during 2018 for Board service:

[END TABLE]
Trustee Deferral Program. In October 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the Non-Management Trustee Compensation and Deferral Program (the "Trustee Program") under Public Storage's 2016 Plan. The Trustee Program became effective starting January 1, 2019, so no trustees participated during 2018. Under the Trustee Program, each non-management trustee may elect to receive all or a portion of his or her cash retainers either in cash, in shares of unrestricted stock under the 2016 Plan, or in fully-vested deferred stock units under the 2016 Plan. 
Non-management trustees must make the election in writing in advance of the calendar year to which the election relates (or, when a non-management trustee joins the Board, within 30 days of joining the Board). If chosen, the shares of unrestricted stock and/or the deferred stock units will be granted to the non-management trustee at the end of each calendar quarter based on the cash retainer earned for that quarter and converted into a number of shares or units based on the closing price for the Common Stock on the NYSE on such date. If a non-management trustee chooses to receive fully-vested deferred stock units, the trustee's election must also indicate (1) when the units will be settled, such as the trustee's separation from service (including retirement), a specified future date, or January 1st of the year following a chosen anniversary of the grant date, and (2) whether the units will be settled in a lump sum or in annual installments (not to exceed 10 years). Notwithstanding a trustee's election, the deferred stock units will be settled in a lump sum upon the trustee's earlier death or disability or upon an earlier change of control of Public Storage. In any event, the deferred stock units will be settled in shares of Common Stock. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 27 
Equity Awards. Each new non-management trustee is, upon the date of his or her initial election by the Board or the shareholders to serve as a trustee, granted a non-qualified stock option to purchase 15,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price equal to the closing price for the Common Stock on the NYSE on such date, which vests in three equal annual installments based on continued service. 
Annually, each non-management trustee receives a non-qualified stock option to acquire 5,000 shares of Common Stock, which vests in three equal annual installments based on continued service. The annual grants are made immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders at an exercise price equal to the closing price for the Common Stock on the NYSE on such date. 
Upon the retirement of a non-management trustee (which is defined in the option agreement as a termination of service for any reason at a time when the holder is retirement eligible, as determined by the Board), the vesting of any equity awards granted to the trustee for his/her service on the Board and not otherwise deferred will accelerate effective on his/her retirement date from the Board. Additional terms and conditions may be set forth in the award agreement governing the non-management trustee's equity awards. 
In addition, upon the retirement of a non-management trustee, the trustee may exercise his/her vested options during the 1-year period following his/her retirement date from the Board, or, if shorter, the period from his/her retirement date from the Board until the expiration of the original term of the options. If not exercised within such period, the vested options will automatically terminate at the end of such period. 
Upon the retirement of a non-management trustee, any deferred stock units received under the Trustee Program will be delivered as elected in the trustee's election form under the Trustee Program. 
Unvested equity awards (RSUs and options) held by non-management trustees who are former Public Storage executives will continue to vest under the terms of the company's equity incentive plan for so long as the trustee continues to provide service to the company. Those awards will qualify for accelerated vesting as described above upon the retirement of the non-management trustee. 
TRUSTEE AND EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The Board implemented stock ownership guidelines effective March 2015 and as amended October 2018. We expect each trustee to beneficially own Common Stock equal in market value to three times the amount of the annual retainer for board member service. We expect each executive officer to beneficially own Common Stock equal in market value to five times, in the case of the CEO, and three times in the case of all other executives, his or her base salary. 
Each executive officer and non-management trustee shall attain his or her ownership within five years from the date of hire, election or promotion or, in the event the target is not attained by such date or maintained after such date, shall retain shares of the Common Stock equal in value to 50% of the net after-tax shares received upon any stock option exercise until the applicable ownership target is achieved. 
Only shares of Common Stock owned by the non-management trustee or executive officer, the fair market value (as measured by the closing price on the NYSE, less the exercise price) of vested, in-the-money stock options held by the non-management trustee or executive officer, vested deferred stock units held by 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 28 
the non-management trustee, shares of Common Stock owned jointly by him/her and his/her spouse, and shares owned by his/her spouse or beneficially for his/her children or in a 401(k) plan are counted for determining compliance with these guidelines. We do not count unvested time-based restricted stock units (RSUs), unvested stock options and vested, out-of-the-money stock options for determining compliance with these guidelines. 
The Governance Committee administers these stock ownership guidelines and may modify their terms and grant hardship exceptions in its discretion. As of the date of this proxy statement, all of our non-management trustees who have served for five years or more exceeded his/her stock ownership requirement.

Proposal 2 
Advisory vote to approve executive compensation 
ADVISORY VOTE 
We provide our shareholders the opportunity to vote on the compensation program for our named executive officers (our NEOs) through a non-binding annual advisory vote (known as the "Say-on-Pay" proposal). 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, 93% of the shares voting approved our executive compensation. Our Compensation Committee believes these votes affirm shareholder support of the company's executive compensation program and accordingly made no significant changes for 2018. 
We believe our compensation program for NEOs helped drive strong performance in our business in 2018. Our total shareholder return (TSR) beat the NAREIT and S&P 500 indices for the five-year, 10-year and 15-year periods ending December 31, 2018, averaging 14.9% in total annual return since 1998. 
Although the Say-on-Pay vote is advisory and nonbinding, the Compensation Committee values the opinions of the company's shareholders and will continue to consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR approval of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (CD&A) 
This CD&A provides a detailed description of our executive compensation philosophy and objectives, the compensation decisions made, and the performance metrics and other relevant factors the Compensation Committee used in making those decisions. 
COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY 
Our compensation philosophy is designed to promote a well-governed approach to compensation, including pay practices that attract and retain exceptional executives and align the interests of management with the interests of our shareholders to create long-term shareholder value. The following key features of our compensation program reflect our philosophy:

      What We Do            What We Don't Do   
      What We Do            What We Don't Do   
         Align pay with performance by putting a substantial portion of our NEOs compensation at risk. Over 85% of 2018 NEO compensation was tied to achievement of performance  goals that are key drivers of our success.         Promote retention and increase long-term shareholder value. Equity award grants to NEOs vest over eight years.        Mitigate undue risk in our executive compensation program. Financial targets for bonuses are based on multiple metrics to avoid inordinate focus on any particular metric. We do not  establish any earnings targets for cash bonus awards and do not give earnings guidance to analysts. Bonus payments are capped at a maximum payout level.         Stock ownership guidelines for executive officers. NEOs with the company at least five years are required to meet robust stock ownership requirements. Unvested time-based RSUs, unvested  stock options, and out-of-the-money stock options are NOT counted for determining compliance with these guidelines.         Pay a high percentage of executive compensation in equity. Our NEOs receive a high percentage of their total compensation in equity, thus aligning their interests closely with our  shareholders.         Clawback of equity awards. Awards granted pursuant to our 2016 Plan are subject to mandatory repayment if the grantee is subject to any clawback requirement under applicable laws.           No employment, golden parachute or severance agreements with our NEOs.        No change to base salary or bonus in general, unless NEO is promoted or responsibilities change.        No guaranteed bonus arrangements with our NEOs except in connection with new hires as inducement to attract the best candidates.         No excessive perquisites. Except for perquisites that are available to employees generally such as contributions to the 401(k) Plan, the company does not offer perquisites to our NEOs.        No repricing of stock options.       No tax gross ups. The company does not provide gross-ups or other reimbursements of golden parachute or other taxes nor does it provide change in  control benefits to its NEOs that are not available to other employees generally.       No supplemental retirement plans. The company does not provide any nonqualified deferred compensation or supplemental retirement benefits to our NEOs, other than providing the opportunity to defer  receipt of shares that otherwise would be paid on vesting of certain RSUs.       No hedging against price fluctuations in the companys securities is permitted.

COMPENSATION PROCESS 
The Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent trustees, makes all final compensation decisions for our NEOs. The factors considered by the Compensation Committee include: 
Shareholder Advisory Votes to Approve Executive Compensation. Our shareholders vote annually on our advisory "Say-on-Pay" proposal. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, 93% of the shares voting approved our executive compensation. The Compensation Committee believes this support demonstrates a strong alignment between our shareholders, our performance, and our executive compensation program and accordingly made no significant changes for 2018. 
Compensation Surveys. Each component of compensation we pay to our NEOs — salary, cash bonuses and equity — is based on the Compensation Committee's (and, for Mr. Havner, the independent trustees', and for each NEO other than himself, Mr. Havner's) subjective assessment of each individual's role and responsibilities and consideration of market compensation. 
The Compensation Committee considers market rates by reviewing public disclosures of compensation paid to senior executive officers by other companies (especially REITs) of comparable size and market capitalization. The Compensation Committee retained an independent compensation consultant, FW Cook, to prepare a market compensation survey in 2015, updated in 2016, for our NEOs. The study included compensation information from two peer groups of companies, one consisting of 15 REITs and the other consisting of 12 retail companies, as follows:

While market rates are considered, the Compensation Committee does not "benchmark" or specifically target certain levels of compensation. 
Role of Board and Management. The Compensation Committee solicits the views of the Board on compensation of all NEOs, particularly for Mr. Havner. 
Mr. Havner attends all meetings of the Compensation Committee at which (1) compensation of the other NEOs is discussed or (2) company-wide compensation matters, such as consideration of a new equity plan, are discussed. Mr. Havner does not vote on items before the Compensation Committee and is not present during the Compensation Committee's discussion and determination of his compensation although 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 34 
 his input is considered. For NEOs other than Mr. Havner, the Compensation Committee sets their base salaries, bonus and equity compensation after consideration of the recommendations from Mr. Havner. 
2016 Plan. The Compensation Committee grants equity awards pursuant to the 2016 Plan approved by our Board and by the affirmative vote of more than 96% of votes cast by our shareholders at our 2016 Annual Meeting, with an effective date of April 25, 2016. All equity awards and incentive compensation granted on and subsequent to that date were made under the 2016 Plan and are subject to its terms and conditions. 
2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Public Storage continued to deliver strong financial performance over a sustained period of time, increasing Core FFO per share and free cash flow per share over each of the last nine years and U.S. same store revenue growth over each of the last six years. 
Successful Execution of Strategy. The company achieved solid results in 2018 with focus on (i) growing U.S. same store revenues, funds from operations and free cash flow, (ii) increasing our share of the market and improving the quality of our product by acquiring and developing new and existing properties at attractive valuations, (iii) driving the volumes and penetration of our ancillary businesses and (iv) maintaining a conservative capital structure with a focus on cost control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our U.S. self-storage business generated strong organic growth for the seventh consecutive year. Same store revenue and  self-storage net operating income (NOI) growth were 1.5% and 0.9%, respectively. In addition, our newer facilities that we acquired or developed over the past several years continued to generate strong revenue growth and occupancy gains;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Our ancillary businesses, which complement our U.S. self-storage business, continued to produce solid results due to  increased tenant reinsurance premiums, customer volumes and solid execution;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We strengthened our market position by acquiring 25 properties and developing, redeveloping and expanding 32 properties in  2018 while maintaining a development pipeline for future growth of approximately $607 million at the end of 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● We continue to maintain a fortress balance sheet. Even after issuing $1 billion in new unsecured senior  notes in 2017, our debt to EBITDA ratio is still one of the lowest in our industry and in our history at 0.61 to 1.

2018 COMPENSATION TARGETS 
Framework for CEO Compensation. The Compensation Committee approved a compensation package in 2015 for Mr. Havner in his role as Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President after considering the company's performance, a compensation survey by FW Cook, and other publicly available peer compensation information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Annual base salary continued to be set at $1 million (unchanged from base salary set in 2008);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Annual incentive award, assuming achievement of performance criteria set by the Compensation Committee, ranges from a  threshold award of $1 million in cash plus 25,000 RSUs to a maximum award of $3 million paid in cash plus 50,000 RSUs; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Annual option grant to acquire 100,000 shares of Common Stock.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee continued to use the 2015 compensation package in 2018. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 39 
Framework for NEO Compensation. The Compensation Committee designed its incentive compensation programs for 2018 to focus management on growing our business, as follows: 
Base Salaries. Consistent with the Compensation Committee's philosophy that executive officer compensation should be more heavily weighted towards performance-based, at-risk compensation, the Compensation Committee did not change base salaries for 2018. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Targets. In early 2018, the Compensation Committee agreed that the corporate performance targets threshold for 2018 cash bonus awards for the NEOs would be positive growth of Core FFO per share, as adjusted for extraordinary items, including any foreign exchange gains and losses. The Compensation Committee considered that the goal might be challenging in light of uncertain conditions in the self-storage industry. 
Core FFO is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income before depreciation expense, gains and losses on real estate assets, foreign currency gains and losses, the application of EITF D-42 to the redemption of securities and certain other items. Refer to Appendix A to this proxy statement for reconciliations and other information regarding Core FFO. 
The actual bonus amounts are subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee based on the collective business judgment of its members. The Compensation Committee has the discretion to award bonuses even if the performance targets are not met. 
The Compensation Committee historically has considered the potential impact of Section 162(m) when designing its short-term performance-based bonus awards for NEOs, and retains discretion to reduce awards even if threshold targets are achieved. See "2018 Tax and Accounting Considerations – Section 162(m)" for discussion of the potential tax impact of the amendment of Section 162(m) in 2017 tax legislation. 
The Compensation Committee approved that the annual cash incentive target for NEOs reporting to the CEO be set at an amount equal to 100% of each officer's base salary at the applicable base salary on the date such bonus award is considered and approved by the Compensation Committee, with the exception of Mr. Reyes whose bonus target is set at $800,000 – equal to 133% of his base salary. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 40 
2018 Performance-Based RSU Targets. Also in early 2018, the Compensation Committee established the 2018 performance-based RSU award program for NEOs, which requires growth in same store revenues at the following potential award levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

   Above 3%         150% of  Target 
[END TABLE]
2018 COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
Satisfaction of Performance Targets. In early 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that with respect to the 2018 annual incentive bonuses performance targets, the company had achieved a 1.5% and 2.6% year-over-year increase in same store revenues and Core FFO per share, respectively. Since Core FFO per share growth in 2018 satisfied the growth threshold approved by the Compensation Committee for annual cash incentive bonuses for our CEO and all other NEOs, annual cash bonuses were awarded to all of our NEOs. Since the company achieved 1.5% in Same Store Revenue growth, RSU awards to NEOs reporting to Mr. Havner, RSUs were awarded to those NEOs as described below. 
2018 CEO Compensation. In recognition of Mr. Havner's success in achieving our corporate goals and driving shareholder value during 2018 despite a challenging operating year, the Compensation Committee approved a cash bonus of $2,000,000 (100% of target), and an award of 25,000 RSUs (which vest in equal installments over five years starting on the first through fifth anniversaries of the grant date), but did not grant any options. 
2018 Compensation for NEOs other than our CEO 
Base Salaries. Base salaries for 2018 for Mr. Reyes, Mr. Russell, and Ms. Hughes remained unchanged from 2017 at $600,000, $600,000, and $350,000, respectively. Ms. Johnson was promoted to Senior Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer in April 2018 and received an increase in annual base salary from $300,000 to $400,000. 
Annual Cash Incentives. Since the company achieved the positive growth of Core FFO per share in 2018 for the annual incentive bonus, and after consideration of individual executive performance as assessed by Mr. Havner, the Compensation Committee awarded the following annual cash incentive bonuses to the NEOs reporting to Mr. Havner: Mr. Reyes, $2,000,000 (250% of target); Mr. Russell, $600,000 (100% of target); Ms. Hughes, $350,000 (100% of target); and Ms. Johnson, $400,000 (100% of target). 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 41 
2018 Performance-Based RSUs. The 2018 performance-based RSU award program for NEOs requires growth in year-over-year same store revenues, and RSUs are awarded based on achievement of 2018 Same Store Revenue Growth. 
Actual 2018 Same Store Growth was 1.5%, which qualified eligible NEOs for RSU awards at the 75% of target award level as follows: Mr. Reyes was awarded 9,000 RSUs; Mr. Russell was awarded 3,750 RSUs, and Ms. Hughes was awarded 1,500 RSUs. Mr. Havner was awarded the minimum level of 25,000 RSUs. These RSUs will vest in equal installments over five years starting on the first through fifth anniversaries of the grant date. 
Promotion-Based Decisions. Mr. Russell, who was promoted to CEO effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Boyle, who was promoted to CFO effective January 1, 2019, and Ms. Johnson, who was promoted to Chief Human Resources Officer on April 25, 2018, received compensation in connection with their promotion as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

2018 AT-RISK COMPENSATION FOR ALL NEOs 
The following charts depict for Mr. Havner, our former CEO (retired January 1, 2019) and for our four other NEOs, the split between (i) compensation tied to the achievement of performance goals, consisting of RSUs, options and cash incentive bonuses, and (ii) compensation not tied to performance goals, consisting of base salary and all other compensation. We believe that paying a significantly larger percentage of total compensation to our NEOs in performance-based compensation properly aligns with our compensation objectives.

Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 44 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – SECTION 162(m) 
The Compensation Committee considers the tax deductibility of compensation as one factor when considering executive compensation program alternatives. Due to its tax status as a REIT, the company must generally distribute its taxable income to shareholders. To the extent that compensation is not deductible, taxable income will be higher and so, distributions to shareholders may be higher than they would be otherwise.     
The Compensation Committee has in the past approved and has reserved the right in the future to approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility in circumstances it deems in the company's best interests. 
Prior to January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) imposed a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the company's current chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. Certain "performance-based" compensation exceeding $1,000,000 annually paid to the executives was excluded from Section 162(m)'s limitation and was deductible if certain requirements were met. The Company generally designed awards of stock options, certain restricted share units, and cash incentives to qualify as deductible "performance-based" compensation. 
Under tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"), the deductibility of executive compensation was limited further, effective January 1, 2018. Section 162(m) still imposes a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the company's current chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. But, the exclusion for "performance-based" compensation was repealed, and the group of employees subject to the limitation was expanded to include the chief financial officer and certain former executive officers.     
Compensation awarded before November 3, 2017, which otherwise qualified as "performance based," may continue to be deductible in the future as the cash compensation is paid, the restricted share units vest, and the stock options are exercised, under certain interim relief provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, due to ambiguities and uncertainties about how the revised Section 162(m) should apply, it is uncertain whether previous awards that the Compensation Committee believed to be "performance based" compensation will be deductible going forward. 
Under the 2016 Plan, the limit on the aggregate value of cash and non-cash awards, other than stock options and SARs, which may be granted to any individual in any calendar year, is $15 million.

  (3)  The values reflected in this column relate to awards subject to performance conditions. For Mr. Reyes,  Mr. Russell and Ms. Hughes, the amounts shown in 2018 relate to RSU awards that were subject to satisfaction of performance conditions assuming achievement of such conditions at the 100% target level, and reflect the fair value of such RSU  awards as of the respective grant dates in February 2018. For Ms. Johnson, the amount shown in 2018 relate to RSU awards made in March 2018. For Mr. Havner, the amount shown in 2018 relates to an RSU award pursuant to his annual incentive  plan (which is paid part in cash and part in RSUs) that was subject to performance criteria assuming achievement at the minimum level. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that 2018 performance qualified eligible NEOs for the 75%  level. The number of RSUs actually awarded on March 8, 2019, and their grant date fair values are as follows: Mr. Reyes, 9,000 RSUs ($1,928,880); Mr. Russell, 3,750 RSUs ($803,700); and Ms. Hughes, 1,500 RSUs ($321,480).

The stock awards listed in this table for 2018 for Ms. Johnson represents 2,400 RSUs awarded on March 5, 2018, prior to her promotion as Chief  Human Resources Officer. The amount shown for Mr. Russell in 2016 represents the grant date fair value of the 10,000 RSUs awarded in connection with his appointment as President in July 2016. All holders of RSUs receive payments equal to any  dividends paid on the Common Stock.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Payments Upon Termination. We do not have employment agreements with any NEO that provide for future payments upon termination of employment with the company. 
We do not have a formal severance or retirement program for payments on termination of employment, whether through voluntary or involuntary termination, other than as specifically set forth in our Performance-Based Compensation Plan, 2001 Plan, 2007 Plan, 401(k) Plan or as required by law. The following indicate our general practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● any vested stock options following a voluntary termination of employment must be exercised within 30 days following the  individuals last date of employment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● all unvested stock options, restricted shares and/or RSUs are forfeited (except in the case of death or disability); and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● accrued and unused vacation pay is paid in a lump sum.  
[END TABLE]
Payments Upon Death Or Disability. In the event of the death or permanent and total disability of a NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● all outstanding unvested stock options and unvested RSUs accelerate and vest upon the officers death or permanent and  total disability;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● all such stock options may be exercised during the one-year period following the  date of death or permanent and total disability (but before the termination date of the option); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the officer or his/her estate will receive payments under Public Storages life insurance program or disability plan,  as applicable.  
[END TABLE]
Payments Upon Change In Control. Our applicable equity plans provide that upon the occurrence of a "change of control" of Public Storage, all outstanding RSUs and restricted share grants vest immediately and all outstanding stock options vest 15 days before the effective date of a "change of control" and are exercisable during such 15-day period. 
A "change of control" is defined in the plans to include generally the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the dissolution or liquidation of Public Storage or merger in which Public Storage does not survive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the sale of substantially all Public Storage assets; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● merger in which the company is the surviving corporation but after which the companys shareholders immediately prior  to such merger cease to own their shares or other equity interest in the company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● any transaction that results in any person or entity owning 30% or more of the combined voting power of all classes of our  shares.  
[END TABLE]
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 51 
These accelerated payments do not apply if provision is made for continuation of the equity plan or substitution of new options, restricted shares and RSUs or a majority of our Board determines that the "change of control" will not trigger application of these acceleration provisions. 
The following table shows the estimated value of the acceleration of vesting of unvested equity awards pursuant to the termination events described above assuming the event occurred as of December 31, 2018 and using the value of our Common Stock on December 31, 2018 of $202.41 per share.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT TRUSTEES, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MANAGEMENT 
Anti-Hedging Policy. Our insider trading policy includes an anti-hedging provision that prohibits trustees, officers and employees from directly or indirectly engaging in hedging against future declines in the market value of any securities of the company. The objective of this policy is to enhance alignment between the interests of our trustees, officers and employees and those of our shareholders. 
Policy Regarding Pledging of Shares. Our securities trading policy discourages (but does not prohibit) the pledging of shares of Common Stock by insiders. We have considered the pledges of shares of Common Stock by Mr. Hughes, Jr., Mr. Harkham and Ms. Gustavson in light of the company's securities trading policy and the position of ISS Corporate Solutions (ISS), which is that pledges of shares of Common Stock by insiders may adversely affect shareholders if the insiders are forced to sell their shares of Common Stock. Our belief is that the existing pledge arrangements do not present a significant risk of lender foreclosure or an unexpected sale of large volumes of Common Stock on the open market. 
Our Board is of the view that these arrangements are unlikely to result in adverse effects to shareholders as Mr. Hughes, Jr. and Ms. Gustavson each owns a greater number of shares of Common Stock that are not pledged, and Mr. Harkham's pledges cover a relatively small number of shares. Additionally, Mr. Hughes, Jr.'s program of pledging shares of Common Stock generally predates the ISS anti-pledging policy, and none of Mr. Hughes, Jr.'s, Mr. Harkham's or Ms. Gustavson's pledges are part of a hedging strategy. Our Board also recognizes that maintaining these existing pledging arrangements allow Mr. Hughes, Jr. and Mr. Harkham to pursue their respective business interests without the need to sell company shares to raise additional capital. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance. Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our trustees and executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership of Public Storage's equity securities on Form 3 and reports of changes in beneficial ownership on Form 4 or Form 5. As a matter of practice, we typically assist our executive officers and trustees with these matters and file these reports on their behalf. 
Based solely on a review of reports we filed on behalf of our trustees and executive officers, and written representations from these individuals that no other reports were required, all reports on behalf of our trustees and executive officers were filed on a timely basis under Section 16(a). 
Related Party Transaction Approval Policies and Procedures. With respect to transactions involving our trustees, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for review by the Governance Committee of related party transactions that might present possible conflicts of interest. The Governance Committee reviews related party transactions involving Board members pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines. Before undertaking a related party transaction, we request that trustees submit information to the Governance Committee, who will advise the company's Chief Legal Officer. The Governance Committee considers the matters submitted to it and makes a recommendation to the Board with respect to 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 55 
 any action to be taken. The trustee with an actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest does not participate in the decision-making process related to the transaction. 
Our executive officers who are not also trustees are subject to the Code of Conduct. Under the Code of Conduct, executive officers are required to disclose to our Chief Legal Officer any potential conflicts of interest, which include, among other interests, financial relationships, or associations where an executive's personal interest may conflict with ours. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews on an ongoing basis related party transactions involving our executive officers and trustees, PS Business Parks and Shurgard Europe that may require Board pre-approval under applicable law or may be required to be disclosed in our financial statements or proxy statement. 
Relationships and Transactions with the Hughes Family. B. Wayne Hughes, our Chairman Emeritus and the company's Co-Founder, and Tamara Hughes Gustavson, a trustee on our Board, own and control 62 self-storage facilities in Canada. These facilities operate under the "Public Storage" trade name, which we license to the owners of these facilities on a royalty-free, non-exclusive basis. Our subsidiaries reinsure risks relating to loss of goods stored by customers in these facilities, and have received approximately $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our right to continue receiving these premiums may be qualified. We have a right of first refusal, subject to limitations, to acquire the stock or assets of the corporation engaged in the operation of these facilities if their owners agree to sell them. 
Management Agreement with PS Business Parks. PS Business Parks manages certain of the commercial facilities that we own pursuant to management agreements for a management fee equal to 5% of revenues. Public Storage paid a total of $407,000 in management fees with respect to PS Business Parks' property management services in 2018. In 2018, PS Business Parks allocated approximately $472,000 in operating expenses to Public Storage related to the management of the properties, including payroll and other overhead expenses.
PS Business Parks owns certain commercial facilities that include self-storage space. We manage this self-storage space for PS Business Parks for a management fee equal to 6% of revenues generated by the self-storage space. We recorded management fees with respect to these facilities of approximately $96,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018. In 2018, we allocated approximately $65,000 in operating expenses to PS Business Parks related to the management of the properties, including payroll and overhead expenses. 
Cost Sharing and Other Arrangements with PS Business Parks. Pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services arrangement, we share certain administrative services, corporate office space and certain other third party costs with PS Business Parks which are allocated based upon time, effort and other methodologies. PS Business Parks reimbursed us $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 for costs paid on their behalf, and we reimbursed PS Business Parks $38,000 in costs that PS Business Parks incurred on our behalf for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
At December 31, 2018, we owed PS Business Parks $43,000 with respect to property management costs.

Trademark Agreement and Transactions with Shurgard.

Shurgard paid us $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 for royalty fees in connection with their use of the "Shurgard" tradename. On October 18, 2018, we sold our Kensington property in West London to Shurgard for $42.1 million and recorded a gain on disposition of $31.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Pay Ratio Disclosure. As of October 1, 2018, we had 5,390 talented and dedicated employees performing the following functions:

SEC rules require us to disclose the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO, Ronald L. Havner, Jr., to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding Mr. Havner). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. We selected the median employee based on the 5,390 full-time and part-time workers employed by the company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of October 1, 2018. In identifying our median employee, we used annual gross pay based on W-2 information. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. 
Based on these calculations, our median employee is one of our 4,477 on-site property managers. This employee is paid on an hourly basis. The 2018 annual total compensation for our median employee as determined based on SEC rules was $24,909. The 2018 annual total compensation for our CEO as determined based on SEC rules was $9,182,000. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 369 to 1.

PROPOSAL 3 
RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has appointed EY as the independent registered public accounting firm for Public Storage for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee believes that the selection of EY is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders and has recommended that the Board submit the appointment of EY to the company's shareholders for ratification. 
Although we are not required to seek shareholder ratification of the appointment of EY as the independent registered public accounting firm, Public Storage is asking its shareholders to do so because it believes that shareholder ratification of the appointment is a matter of good corporate practice. Ratification of the appointment of EY requires approval by a majority of the votes cast at the meeting. For these purposes, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain EY as the independent registered public accounting firm for Public Storage, but may determine to do so. Even if the shareholders ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interest of Public Storage and its shareholders. 
A representative of EY will be present at our 2019 Annual Meeting, where the representative will be afforded an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate questions.

In 2018 and 2017, our Audit Committee pre-approved all services performed for us by EY. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities include appointing the company's independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approving audit and non-audit services provided by the firm and assisting the Board in providing oversight to the company's financial reporting process. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with the company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. 
In connection with its oversight responsibilities related to the company's consolidated financial statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee met with management and EY, the company's independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewed and discussed with them the audited consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee discussed with EY matters required to be discussed by the Public company Accounting Oversight Board (the PCAOB) Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as modified or supplemented. The discussion included, but was not limited to, the overall scope and plans for the annual audit, the results of their audit, their evaluation of the company's internal controls and the overall quality of the company's financial reporting. 
In addition to providing the required written disclosures and communications, EY also provided to the Audit Committee the letter confirming EY's independence of the company as required by the applicable rules of the PCAOB, and the Audit Committee discussed with EY their independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered whether EY's provision of non-audit services to the company and its affiliates is compatible with EY's independence. 
The Audit Committee met with representatives of management, the internal auditors, legal counsel and EY on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss the progress of management's testing and evaluation of the company's system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related SEC regulations. At the conclusion of this process, the 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 60 
 Audit Committee received from management its assessment and report on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee received from EY its assessment of and opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the results of management's assessment and EY's audit. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Trustees, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also approved the appointment of EY as the company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and recommended that the Board submit this appointment to the company's shareholders for ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING 
Purpose of Proxy Solicitation 
We are providing these materials on behalf of the Board to ask for your vote and to solicit your proxies for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
We have made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, because you were a shareholder as of March 1, 2019, the record date (the record date) fixed by the Board, and are therefore entitled to receive Notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote on matters presented at the meeting. 
Important Notice Regarding Delivery of Security Holder Documents 
We are pleased to take advantage of the SEC rules that allow us to furnish proxy materials to you on the Internet. These rules allow us to provide our shareholders with the information they need, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. 
Our Annual Report to Shareholders (the Annual Report) includes a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on February 27, 2019, excluding exhibits. On or about March 15, 2019, we mailed you a Notice containing instructions on how to access this proxy statement and our Annual Report and vote over the Internet. If you received the Notice by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. The Notice instructs you on how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. If you received the Notice by mail and would like a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting those materials included in the Notice. 
Availability of Proxy Statement and Annual Report 
All shareholders receiving this proxy statement should have also received a paper copy or access to an electronic copy of the 2018 Annual Report, which includes our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Shareholders may request a free copy of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including financial statements and schedules, by sending a written request to: Public Storage, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349, Attention: Investor Services. Alternatively, shareholders can access the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K and other financial information on Public Storage's "Investor Relations" section of its website at publicstorage.com. Public Storage will also furnish any exhibit to the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K upon written request and payment of a copying charge of 20 cents per page.

Who Can Vote

Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 62 
Quorum for the Annual Meeting 
If a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date is present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, we will have a quorum, permitting business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date of March 1, 2019, we had 174,371,289 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
We will count abstentions and shares held by brokers or nominees who have not received instructions from the beneficial owner (broker non-votes) as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. 
How Votes are Counted 
For the election of trustees, trustee nominees receiving an affirmative majority of votes cast (i.e., the number of shares cast "for" a trustee nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee) will be elected. Similarly, approval of Proposals 2 and 3 require an affirmative majority of the votes cast (i.e., the number of shares cast "for" the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that proposal). We will not count shares that abstain from voting. 
Although the advisory vote to approve executive compensation in Proposal 2 is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider and take into account the vote results in making future determinations to approve executive compensation and advisory vote frequency. 
Trustee Nominees Who Do Not Receive a Majority of the Votes Cast 
If a nominee who is currently serving as a trustee is not re-elected, Maryland law provides that the trustee would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover" trustee. 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each trustee nominee who does not receive the required majority vote for election must submit a resignation. The Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action. The Board would act on the Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days from the date the election results were certified. If the Board accepts a trustee's resignation, it may fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board as provided in our bylaws. 
How Proxies Will Be Voted 
If you hold shares through a broker or nominee and do not provide the broker or nominee with specific voting instructions, under the rules that govern brokers or nominees in such circumstances, your broker or nominee will have the discretion to vote such shares on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. As a result: 
Your broker or nominee will not have the authority to exercise discretion to vote such shares with respect to Proposals 1 and 2 because NYSE rules treat these matters as non-routine. Your broker or nominee will have the authority to exercise discretion to vote such shares with respect to Proposal 3 because that matter is treated as routine under NYSE rules. 
Broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on any of the proposals. 
Public Storage• 2019 Proxy Statement• 63 
If you are a registered shareholder and no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy card submitted by you, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted FOR (i) each of Proposals 1, 2, and 3 and (ii) in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders as to any other matter that may be properly brought before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof.

How to Vote as a Participant in the Company's 401(K) Plan 
If you hold your shares as a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as a voting instruction for the trustee of the 401(k) Plan with respect to the amount of shares of Common Stock credited to your account as of the record date. If you provide voting instructions via your proxy card or voting instruction card with respect to your shares of Common Stock held in the 401(k) Plan, the trustee will vote those shares of Common Stock in the manner specified. The trustee will vote any shares of Common Stock for which it does not receive instructions in the same proportion as the shares of Common Stock for which voting instructions have been received by the trustee, unless the trustee is required by law to exercise its discretion in voting such shares. 
To allow sufficient time for the trustee to vote your shares of Common Stock, the trustee must receive your voting instructions by 7:00 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on April 22, 2019.

Core FFO per Share and Free Cash Flow per Share 
We present "Core FFO per share," a non-GAAP measure that represents diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of (i) depreciation expense, (ii) gains on the sale of real estate facilities, (iii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses, (iv) EITF D-42 charges related to the redemption of preferred securities, (v) general and administrative expenses associated with the acquisition of self-storage facilities and (vi) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items. We review Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance, and we believe investors and REIT analysts use it in a similar manner. However, Core FFO per share is not a substitute for net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do, may not use the same terminology or may not present such a measure, Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs. 
We also present "Free Cash Flow per share," another non-GAAP measure that represents Core FFO per share, deducting the impact of capital expenditures required to maintain our facilities, and eliminating the effect of certain non-cash expenses such as stock-based compensation. We believe Free Cash Flow per share is useful as a measure of our intrinsic business value and long-term management performance. However, it is not a substitute for net income per share. 
The table below reconciles from diluted earnings per share to each of Core FFO per share and Free Cash Flow per share.

Return on Assets and Return on Equity 
We present "Return on Assets" and "Return on Equity", which are non-GAAP measures. Return on Assets represents the ratio of (i) Net Operating Income (NOI, described below) to (ii) the average undepreciated cost of our real estate facilities. Return on Equity represents the ratio of (i) NOI, less preferred share dividends and interest expense, to (ii) the average undepreciated cost of our real estate facilities less total average debt and total preferred equity. We believe that these measures are useful in evaluating our earnings relative to the associated accumulated capital investment, on a levered and unlevered basis, over time. 
NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents revenues less pre-depreciation cost of operations earned directly at our properties, and we believe it is a useful performance measure that we and the investment community use to evaluate performance and real estate values. This non-GAAP measure excludes the impact of depreciation, which is based upon historical cost and assumes that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. NOI is not a substitute for net income, net operating cash flow, or other related GAAP financial measures, in evaluating our operating results. 
The following table reconciles operating income on our income statement to NOI and NOI less preferred share dividends and interest expense, and sets forth the calculations of Return on Assets and Return on Equity (amounts in millions):

EBITDA 
Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or "EBITDA" is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income prior to the impact of depreciation and interest expense.
