    PROXY STATEMENT     
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON  DECEMBER 14, 2018 
We are providing access to our proxy materials primarily over the Internet rather than mailing paper copies of those materials to each stockholder. On or about October 26, 2018 we mailed a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice") to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The Notice tells you how to:
This Proxy Statement is provided in connection with the solicitation of proxies by and on behalf of the Board of Directors of K12 Inc., a Delaware corporation, for use at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held at the law firm of Latham & Watkins LLP, 555 Eleventh Street, N.W., Suite 1000, Washington, D.C. 20004-1304, on Friday, December 14, 2018, at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time, and any adjournments or postponements thereof ("Annual Meeting"). "K12," "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" each refer to K12 Inc. The mailing address of our principal executive offices is 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171. This Proxy Statement will be made available on or about October 26, 2018, to holders of record as of the close of business on October 19, 2018 of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("Common Stock"). 
      VOTING SECURITIES     
   Record Date; Outstanding Shares; Shares Entitled to Vote  
Our Board of Directors has fixed the close of business on October 19, 2018 as the record date ("Record Date") for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, we had 40,193,564 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
Holders of record of Common Stock on the Record Date will be entitled to one vote per share on any matter that may properly come before the Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting. 
   Quorum and Vote Required  
The presence, in person or by duly executed proxy, of stockholders representing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, we expect that the Annual Meeting will be adjourned or postponed to solicit additional proxies. 
If a quorum is present: (i) a plurality of votes present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required to elect the members of the Board of Directors; and an affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting is required for (ii) the non-binding advisory resolution approving the executive compensation of the named executive officers of the Company, (iii) the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA, LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019 ("fiscal 2019"), and (iv) such  Table of Contents other matters as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting. 
   Voting; Proxies; Revocation  
Shares of our Common Stock represented at the Annual Meeting by properly executed proxies received prior to or at the Annual Meeting, and not revoked prior to or at the Annual Meeting, will be voted at the Annual Meeting, and at any adjournments, continuations or postponements of the Annual Meeting, in accordance with the instructions on the proxies. 
If a proxy is duly executed and submitted without instructions, the shares of Common Stock represented by that proxy will be voted:
A record holder who executes a proxy may revoke it before or at the Annual Meeting by: (i) delivering to our corporate secretary a written notice of revocation of a previously delivered proxy, with such notice dated after the previously delivered proxy; (ii) duly executing, dating and delivering to our corporate secretary a subsequent proxy; or (iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, in and of itself, constitute revocation of a proxy. Any written notice revoking a proxy should be delivered to K12 Inc., Attn: General Counsel and Secretary, 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171. If your shares of Common Stock are held in a brokerage account, you must follow your broker's instructions to revoke a proxy. 
   Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes  
Broker non-votes occur when a nominee holding shares of voting securities for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power on that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions, withheld votes, and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present but are not deemed a vote cast "For" or "Against" a given proposal, and therefore, are not included in the tabulation of the voting results. As such, abstentions, withheld votes and broker non-votes do not affect the voting results with respect to the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the approval of any items requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority or greater of the outstanding Common Stock entitled to vote. 
   Proxy Solicitation  
We are soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting from our stockholders and we will bear the entire cost of soliciting proxies from our stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding Common Stock for the benefit of others so that such brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians may forward the solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding solicitation materials to those beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may  Table of Contents be supplemented by telephone or personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees of the Company. No additional compensation will be paid to our directors, officers or other regular employees for these services. 
The Company has retained D. F. King & Co. ("DF King") to assist in obtaining proxies from stockholders for the Annual Meeting. The estimated cost of such services is $17,500, plus out-of-pocket expenses. DF King may be contacted at (800) 431-9633 (banks and brokers may call (212) 269-5550) or via email at K12@dfking.com. 
   Business; Adjournments  
We do not expect that any matter other than the proposals presented in this Proxy Statement will be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting, then the proxy holders will vote in their discretion with respect to those matters. 
If a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned from time to time upon the approval of the holders of shares representing a majority of the votes present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, until a quorum is present. Any business may be transacted at the adjourned meeting which might have been transacted at the meeting originally noticed. If the adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. We do not currently intend to seek an adjournment of the Annual Meeting.  Table of Contents
    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND THESE PROXY MATERIALS     
The following addresses some questions you may have regarding the matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. These questions and answers may not address all questions that may be important to you as a stockholder of the Company. Please refer to the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this Proxy Statement and the documents referred to or incorporated by reference in this Proxy Statement for additional information.
   Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement?  
The Company is soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. You are receiving a Proxy Statement because you owned shares of Common Stock at the close of business on October 19, 2018, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, which entitles you to vote at the Annual Meeting. By use of a proxy, you can vote whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement describes the matters on which we would like you to vote and provides information on those matters so that you can make an informed decision. 
   Why is K12 calling the Annual Meeting?  
We are calling the Annual Meeting and submitting proposals to stockholders of the Company to consider and vote upon Annual Meeting matters, including the election of directors, a non-binding advisory resolution approving the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, and the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. 
   How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of the Board of Director nominees named in Proposal 1 and FOR each of Proposals 2 and 3. 
   What do I need to do now?  
After carefully reading and considering the information in this Proxy Statement, please vote electronically via the Internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided by your bank or broker or complete, date, sign and promptly mail the proxy card (if you request a paper copy) in the envelope provided, which requires no postage if mailed in the United States. 
   May I vote in person?  
Yes. If you were a stockholder of record as of the close of business on October 19, 2018, you may attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person instead of voting by Internet or telephone or returning your signed proxy card (if you request a paper copy). However, we urge you to vote in advance even if you are planning to attend the Annual Meeting. 
   How do I vote if my shares are held in "street name" by my bank, broker or agent?  
If you are a beneficial owner of shares registered in the name of your broker, bank, or other agent, you should have received voting instructions with these proxy materials from that organization rather than from us. Simply complete and mail your voting instructions as directed by your broker or bank to ensure that your vote is counted. To vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a valid proxy from  Table of Contents your broker, bank, or other agent. Follow the instructions from your broker or bank included with these proxy materials, or contact your broker or bank to request a proxy form. 
   If my shares are held in "street name" by a broker, will my broker vote my shares for me even if I do not give my broker voting instructions?  
Under the rules that govern brokers who have record ownership of shares that are held in "street name" for their clients, brokers may vote such shares on behalf of their clients with respect to "routine" matters (such as the ratification of auditors in Proposal 3), but not with respect to non-routine matters (such as Proposals 1 and 2). If the proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting include both routine and non-routine matters, the broker may turn in a proxy card for uninstructed shares that votes on the routine matters, but expressly states that the broker is not voting on non-routine matters. This is called a "broker non-vote" as to non-routine matters. Broker non-votes on non-routine matters will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence or absence of a quorum, but will not be counted for the purpose of determining the number of votes cast. We encourage you to provide specific instructions to your broker by returning your proxy card or by voting electronically via the Internet or by telephone, if permitted by the broker or other nominee that holds your shares. This ensures that your shares will be properly voted at the Annual Meeting. 
   Can I revoke my proxy and change my vote?  
Yes. You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time prior to the time your shares are voted at the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, your proxy can be revoked in several ways: by timely delivery of a written revocation to our corporate secretary, by submitting another valid proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting your shares in person, even if you have previously voted using one of the available methods. 
   When and where is the Annual Meeting?  
The Annual Meeting will be held on December 14, 2018 at 10:00 A.M., Eastern Time, at the law firm of Latham & Watkins LLP, 555 Eleventh Street, N.W., Suite 1000, Washington, DC 20004-1304.

    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS     
      Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics     
Our Board of Directors oversees the management of the Company and its business for the benefit of our stockholders in order to enhance stockholder value over the long-term and to achieve its educational mission.

      Board of Directors     
 Term of Office.    All directors of the Company serve terms of one year and until the election and qualification of their respective successors. 
 Attendance at Board and Committee Meetings and the 2017 Annual Meeting.    Our Board of Directors met ten times in person or telephonically during fiscal 2018. Each director attended at least 75% of the total Board and committee meetings to which they were assigned. Our policy with respect to director attendance at the annual meeting of stockholders is to encourage, but not require, director attendance. Two members of our Board of Directors attended our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: Messrs. Davis and Udell. Our director attendance policy is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which is available on our website at www.K12.com.  Table of Contents
 Communication with Directors.    Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate directly with our Board of Directors, individually or as a group, by sending an email to our General Counsel at OGC@K12.com, or by mailing a letter to K12 Inc., 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171, Attention: General Counsel and Secretary. Our General Counsel will monitor these communications and provide summaries of all received communications to our Board of Directors at its regularly scheduled meetings. Where the nature of a communication warrants, our General Counsel may decide to seek the more immediate attention of the appropriate committee of the Board of Directors or an individual director, or our management or independent advisors and will determine whether any response is necessary. 
      Director Independence     
Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of our non-employee directors is "independent" as defined in the currently applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Mr. Davis is not independent under either NYSE or SEC rules because he is an executive officer of the Company. If the nominees for the Board of Directors are duly elected at the Annual Meeting, then each of our directors, other than Mr. Davis, will serve as an independent director. 
      Board of Directors Leadership Structure     
Our Board of Directors is comprised of independent, accomplished and experienced directors who provide advice and oversight of management to further the interests of the Company and its stockholders. Our governance framework provides the Board of Directors with the flexibility to determine an optimal organizational structure for leadership and engagement while ensuring appropriate insight into the operations and strategic issues of the Company. The Board of Directors has evaluated its leadership structure and determined that Mr. Davis should serve as Chairman of the Board and that Dr. Barrett should serve as Lead Independent Director. 
 Chairman.    Our Board of Directors elects a chairman from among the directors and determines whether to separate or combine the roles of chairman and chief executive officer based on what it believes best serves the needs of the Company and its stockholders at any particular time. Both approaches have been taken depending on the circumstances. The determination to appoint Mr. Davis as Chairman was based on a number of factors that made him particularly well-suited for the role. These factors included his prior position as Chairman and CEO, his prior service on the Board of Directors and its Compensation Committee, and his understanding of the Company's business and day-to-day operations, growth opportunities, challenges and risk management practices. This combination of Company experience and expertise enables Mr. Davis to provide strong and effective leadership to the Board of Directors and to ensure that the Board of Directors is informed of important issues. In consultation with our Lead Independent Director, the Chairman sets the agenda for the regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors, presides at the annual meeting of stockholders and performs such other functions and responsibilities as set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, or as requested by the Board of Directors. 
 Lead Independent Director.    The role of the Lead Independent Director is to facilitate communications between the Chairman and CEO and the independent directors and the committees of the Board of Directors. In doing so, the Lead Independent Director, Dr. Barrett, serves as the liaison between the Board of Directors and the Chairman and CEO, thereby giving guidance to management in meeting the objectives set by the Board of Directors and monitoring compliance with corporate governance policies. Additionally, the Lead Independent Director serves as a liaison between the Board of Directors and stockholders. The Lead Independent Director has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors and chairs executive sessions of the Board of Directors during which no members of management are present. These meetings are intended to provide the Lead Independent Director with  Table of Contents information that he can use to assist the Chairman and CEO to function in the most effective manner. The Board of Directors believes the Lead Independent Director provides additional independent oversight of executive management and Board matters. 
 Executive Sessions of the Board.    Our Board of Directors holds executive sessions without management directors or management present at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. The independent directors may also meet without management present at other times as requested by any independent director. As Lead Independent Director, Dr. Barrett chairs the executive sessions of the Board of Directors. 
      Committees of the Board of Directors     
The standing committees of our Board of Directors are the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Academic Committee. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, membership on the Committees of the Board of Directors is as follows: 
   Audit Committee  
The Audit Committee, which was established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, consists of Mr. Fink, who serves as the Chairman, Ms. Alvarez and Mr. Bron. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Fink and Bron and Ms. Alvarez qualify as independent directors under the applicable NYSE listing requirements and SEC regulations. 
The Audit Committee met seven times during fiscal 2018. The meetings to review the Company's quarterly and annual periodic filings with the SEC each include at least two separate sessions (which together count as only one meeting).

   Compensation Committee  
The Compensation Committee consists of Mr. Engler, who serves as the Chairman, and Messrs. Fink and Knowling. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Engler, Fink and Knowling qualify as independent directors within the meaning of the applicable NYSE listing requirements and SEC regulations.

   Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Ms. McFadden, who serves as the Chairman, and Messrs. Bron and Engler. Our Board of Directors has determined that each of  Table of Contents
Ms. McFadden and Messrs. Bron and Engler qualify as independent directors within the meaning of the applicable NYSE listing requirements and SEC regulations. Our Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which are available on our website at www.K12.com. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met three times during fiscal 2018. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has a charter, available on our website at www.K12.com, setting forth its structure, powers and responsibilities. Under its charter, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to nominate persons to stand for election and to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider the following criteria, as well as any other factors it deems appropriate, in recommending candidates for election to our Board of Directors:
In fiscal 2017, the Board amended its Corporate Governance Guidelines to expressly include consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. The Board strives to nominate directors with a variety of complementary skills so that, as a group, the Board of Directors will possess a mix of the appropriate backgrounds, talent, gender, race, perspectives, skills and expertise to oversee the Company's business. Currently, our eight member Board has two Hispanic directors, two African American directors, and two female directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders, provided such recommendations are submitted in writing not later than the close of business on the 90th day, or earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of the stockholders. Such recommendations should include the name and address and other pertinent information about the candidate as is required to be included in the Company's proxy statement. Recommendations should be submitted to the corporate secretary of the Company at K12 Inc., 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171, Attention: General Counsel and Secretary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the criteria set forth above and other relevant information when evaluating director candidates recommended by stockholders. 
   Academic Committee  
The Academic Committee consists of Dr. Barrett, who serves as the Chairman, and Messrs. Davis and Engler. The primary role of the Academic Committee is to make recommendations and assist management in discharging its responsibility to ensure continuous improvement in academic outcomes for the students and schools we serve. 
The Academic Committee has a charter, available on our website at www.K12.com, setting forth the structure, powers and responsibilities of the Academic Committee. Members of the Academic Committee  Table of Contents participated in three meetings of the Company's Educational Advisory Committee during fiscal 2018. Under its charter, the responsibilities of the Academic Committee include:
      Risk Management     
Our Board of Directors believes full and open communication with management is essential for effective enterprise risk management and oversight. Members discuss strategy and risks facing the Company with our Chairman and CEO and our senior management at meetings of our Board of Directors or when members of our Board of Directors seek to focus on a particular area of risk, such as meeting state academic accountability standards at the schools we manage, ensuring the privacy of student information, compliance with state regulatory and reporting requirements, or information technology cybersecurity protections and preparedness. Because our Chairman and CEO sets the agenda for the Board of Directors' meetings, each functional division of the Company can identify risk-related topics that may require added attention, which have included evolving state curriculum standards, student engagement and retention, education technology, legal and policy matters, information security, and succession planning. Each quarter, our Chairman and CEO also presents an assessment of the strategic, financial and operational issues facing the Company, which frequently includes a review of associated risks and opportunities. 
Management is responsible for identifying, prioritizing, remediating and monitoring the day-to-day management of risks that the Company faces, while our Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, is responsible for the oversight of enterprise risk management. In fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee continued to work directly with a major independent accounting firm to support the Company's internal audit function in risk management. This combination provides us with the focus, scope, expertise and continuous attention necessary for effective risk management. 
While our Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, three of its committees concentrate on specific risk areas: Table of Contents

   Director Stock Ownership Guidelines  
The Company encourages each director to purchase shares of the Company's Common Stock and to maintain a minimum ownership level during his or her tenure to foster alignment with our investing stockholders. To reinforce this objective, in early fiscal 2017 we adopted minimum director stock ownership guidelines for all of our non-employee directors. Pursuant to those guidelines, these directors must hold shares of the Company's stock equal to the lesser of: (i) three times the annual cash retainer and (ii) 15,000 shares. Non-employee directors must be in compliance with this policy by September 28, 2021 or five years after they begin Board service, whichever date is later.  Table of Contents

    COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS     
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides information about our fiscal 2018 compensation for the following named executive officers ("NEOs"):
      Executive Summary     
We achieved solid financial and operational gains in fiscal 2018, positioning the Company to fulfill its educational mission of helping students to reach their potential through personalized learning and inspired teaching. We also continued our trend of stockholder engagement and executive compensation reforms through fiscal 2018. With the unanticipated mid-year departure of Mr. Udell as CEO in fiscal 2018, it was essential to fill the CEO role quickly by appointing a person with detailed knowledge of the Company's operations, its customers, and the public policy issues critical to our success. The Board of Directors therefore determined that Mr. Davis should resume his position as CEO (which he had previously held from 2014-2016) and entered into an 18-month extension of his employment agreement and we consolidated the CEO and Executive Chairman roles. Besides assuring the continuity of leadership and expertise, significant overall compensation savings have been realized. Our Lead Independent Director, Mr. Barrett, will remain in place to assure Board oversight distinct from management. 
From our inception in 1999, we have offered online curriculum, instructional support services, software and products designed to facilitate individualized learning for students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Our path to the gains we realized in fiscal year 2018 began three years ago when we shifted away from our early priorities for revenue and enrollment growth to focus instead on pursuing a multi-year strategic plan to establish schools of academic quality that attract and retain students. This not only required significant investments, but occurred in an environment of external challenges over which our management generally has no control, including rapidly changing education policies at both the federal and state levels, newly enacted and dissimilar state academic accountability standards and regulatory requirements, and unionization of our virtual charter school customers in one state. With the confluence of these factors, we encountered a period of slower enrollment growth, academic challenges, operational adjustments, and increased costs, resulting in total shareholder returns that, for certain periods during the transition, were negative. Moreover, to maintain an engaged executive team over the duration of the multi-year strategic plan, we adopted a long-term incentive compensation plan ("LTIP") and utilized targeted annual incentives that together were necessary to execute the plan successfully and create the building blocks for future expansion of the business and shareholder growth. 
In fiscal 2017 we saw this approach begin to yield some positive results and in fiscal 2018 our core business delivered further improvements in financial, operational and academic performance. Although our stock price has continued to face headwinds from the issues identified above, revenue growth, profitability and capital expenditures for the year met or exceeded our guidance and we saw the highest  Table of Contents student retention level in eight years. Based on these outcomes, we believe the strategy begun three years ago has worked in many respects, and during this time we formed an executive leadership team that is poised to continue the trend. To ensure the continuity of this progress, Mr. Davis was selected as the person best suited to spearhead K12's leadership team in its current phase and he re-assumed the position of CEO during fiscal 2018, a position he previously held from January 2014 to February 2016. 
We have identified the following four cornerstones on which we intend to focus our efforts to accelerate our business growth and education mission:
We believe that by actively pursuing these strategic priorities, stockholders in K12 will realize the benefits of strong revenue and profitability growth, and just as importantly, see their investment provide educational choices and exceptional learning opportunities for students and families across the nation. 
      Stockholder Engagement and Compensation Reforms and Highlights     
As we developed our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee took into account the extensive stockholder input we received and took steps to more tightly link executive pay to measurable performance results. Over the last several years, we have extensively overhauled our executive compensation programs and practices, including making the following structural changes prior to fiscal 2018 (which were continued into fiscal 2018):
Following these reforms, the annual stockholder advisory vote on our executive compensation for fiscal 2017 yielded an approval rate of 78.5%, which was a significant improvement over prior years. We view this as an endorsement of the positive changes we have made, but also recognize that it still reflects lingering concerns among a portion of our stockholder base. To understand, address and respond to those concerns consistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors, during fiscal 2018 we maintained our stockholder outreach efforts with the goal of receiving meaningful feedback. Accordingly,  Table of Contents at the beginning of fiscal 2018, we proactively reached out to our top 25 stockholders, speaking with a total of five stockholders that responded and in the aggregate held over 20% of our shares outstanding. Our Investor Relations and Human Resources leaders conducted the outreach efforts, with the Chairman of the Compensation Committee participating in some of the calls. We continued these discussions during the year through written correspondence and in-person stockholder meetings to continue our executive compensation dialogue. 
The stockholders that we spoke with recognized and commended our continued responsiveness to their feedback such as the elimination of overlapping performance metrics in short- and long-term incentive pay programs and the introduction of longer term performance metrics in our 2016 LTIP. 
These conversations centered on three key themes, which we have sought to address in a careful and deliberative manner so as to further our strategic business objectives: 
   Leadership Structure and Total Compensation Cost. 
   Annual Bonus Plan Structure and Payouts   Table of Contents stockholders also questioned why above-target bonus payouts were provided in years where our stock price performance has trailed members of our compensation peer group.  
   Long-Term Incentive Plan Structures   Table of Contents during fiscal 2018, concluding in early fiscal 2019. To complement the existing three-year LTIP, we utilized a one-year performance period for certain equity awards to our most senior executives in fiscal 2018 to incentivize disciplined focus to drive profitability and financial stability as we continued to execute against our multi-year business plan. In setting this performance period for fiscal 2018, we also took into account the fact that equity awards granted to Mr. Davis were 100% performance-based in fiscal 2018, which we believe is a far heavier burden than the compensation practices of our peer companies. For fiscal 2019, we have eliminated one-year performance periods from our long-term incentive programs for key executives. Performance based equity incentives for fiscal 2019 for Mr. Davis, Mr. Rhyu and Mr. Chavous are based entirely on a three-year performance period and will be earned only if we realize significant stock price appreciation as of the end of the three-year period. 
      2018 Performance Highlights     
While executing on our multi-year strategy as described above, fiscal 2018 saw solid financial results and key achievements in the following areas:  Table of Contents 
      Executive Compensation Principles and Practices     
 Principles.    Our executive compensation program is guided by basic principles that we seek to incorporate in our executive pay practices: 
 Practices.    We employ certain executive compensation practices to align our executives' compensation with stockholder interests. Listed below are those compensation practices we employ and certain practices we do not employ because we believe they would not serve the long-term interests of our stockholders. 
What We Do 
 Pay for Performance.    A significant portion of our NEOs' potential compensation is not guaranteed but is linked to our financial and operational performance. The target total direct compensation for our Chairman and CEO for fiscal 2018 was approximately 85% performance-based. 
 Align Compensation to Share Price.    A portion of performance-based compensation is tied to growth in our stock price which directly aligns to stockholder interests. 
 Establish Performance Goals Aligned to Strategy.    Our Executive Bonus Plan, performance-based RSAs and LTIP utilize objective performance-based goals that the Committee believes are rigorous and challenging. 
 Target Pay Competitively.    We seek to target compensation within a competitive range of the peer group and seek to deliver greater compensation only when warranted by market conditions or superior performance. 
 Use Meaningful Vesting Conditions to Promote Retention.    Performance-based RSAs begin to vest after attainment of performance criteria and most vest after two and three years depending upon the award. Time-based RSAs vest over three years.  Table of Contents
 Carefully Consider Stockholder Input.    We regularly seek and engage in dialogues with our stockholders on executive compensation matters. Recent enhancements in our executive compensation programs have been influenced by these discussions. 
 Maintain a Clawback Policy.    We can recover incentive compensation wrongly awarded to an executive officer where fraud or intentional misconduct led to a restatement of our financial statements. 
 Require Mandatory Share Ownership.    All of our executive officers, including our NEOs, and our non-employee directors are required to maintain a minimum ownership level of our Common Stock. 
 Perform Competitive Market Analysis.    The Committee reviews competitive market data provided by its independent compensation consultant for our executive officers prior to making annual executive compensation decisions. 
 Analyze Executive Compensation Risk.    We review the executive compensation program annually to ensure that it does not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. 
What We Do Not Do 
 Grant Multi-Year or Guaranteed Bonuses or Equity Awards.    We do not pay guaranteed bonuses and have no guaranteed equity-based awards. This ensures that we are able to base all compensation awards on measurable performance factors, operational results and competitive market needs. 
 Provide Generous Executive Perquisites.    We do not provide significant perquisites to our executive officers, such as club memberships, personal income tax advisory services and similar items. 
 Offer Tax Gross-Ups.    We do not provide income tax gross-ups for personal or broad-based benefits nor excise tax gross-ups for change in control payments or benefits. 
 Offer Pension or Supplemental Retirement Plans.    We do not provide costly retirement benefits to our executive officers that reward longevity rather than contributions to Company performance. 
 Reprice Options.    Our 2016 Incentive Award Plan ("2016 Plan") specifically prohibits repricing of options without stockholder approval. 
 Increase Shares without Stockholder Approval.    Our 2016 Plan does not contain an "evergreen" provision to increase the number of shares available for grants each year. Any increase to the maximum number of shares available will require stockholder approval. 
 Provide Single Trigger Change in Control Payments.    We maintain a "double trigger" vesting policy with respect to our equity awards whereby accelerated vesting in connection with a change in control of the Company also requires a qualifying termination of employment. Legacy "single-trigger" vesting stock option awards from prior years have been completely eliminated from our compensation program. 
 Allow Hedging or Pledging.    Our insider trading policy specifically prohibits short sales, hedging and margin transactions and our 2016 Plan prohibits pledging of any award granted under the plan unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator.  Table of Contents
      Tying Executive Pay to Company Performance     
Our performance assessment framework and executive compensation program are designed to link pay and performance in the following ways:  Table of Contents
      Determining Executive Compensation     
The Committee uses a performance-based framework in making compensation decisions for our executives, including our NEOs. In fiscal 2018, the Committee continued to engage Compensia, an independent compensation consultant, to evaluate the market competitiveness of compensation for our executive officers. Compensia's work for the Committee also included an assessment of peer group companies and a subsequent executive compensation market analysis. 
   Assessing Comparative Market Data and Practices  
In evaluating our compensation peer group, the Committee considered a number of factors, including revenue, market capitalization, industry and status as an existing peer. Compensia also considered companies that list us as a peer as well as our peers as identified by the major proxy advisory firms. The Committee seeks to maintain as much consistency as possible in the peer group year over year and carefully considers changes. The companies in the fiscal 2018 compensation peer group are:

At the beginning of fiscal 2018, Compensia used this peer group to prepare an analysis for the Committee that compared the compensation levels of our executive officers to comparable executive positions. 
In general, the Committee seeks to establish the range of target total direct compensation for our executive officers near the median for similar positions in our peer group, with an overemphasis on variable cash compensation versus fixed cash compensation.  Table of Contents
   Chairman and CEO Pay Mix  
Compensia assisted the Committee in designing competitive pay packages that focus heavily on variable pay components, with the intent that compensation for our Chairman and CEO should be overwhelmingly performance-based. A graphic illustration of the basic annual total target pay mix of our Chairman and CEO, which is set forth in his employment agreement, is depicted below: 
      Fiscal 2018 Compensation Decisions     
   Determination of Base Salaries  
Other than with respect to Mr. Davis, none of our NEOs received a base salary increase for fiscal 2018. The fiscal 2018 base salaries for our NEOs are set forth in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nathaniel A. Davis      $ 735,000  (1)  
 James J. Rhyu      $ 500,000    
 Kevin P. Chavous      $ 490,000  (2)  
 Howard D. Polsky      $ 385,000    
 Allison B. Cleveland      $ 415,000    
[END TABLE]
   Determination of Annual Incentive Compensation  
Our Executive Bonus Plan is designed to ensure that a meaningful portion of our NEOs' target total cash compensation is "at risk" based upon Company and individual performance. For fiscal 2018, the Committee focused on streamlining the Executive Bonus Plan by reducing the number of corporate  Table of Contents
PMOs for our Chairman and CEO and, for all our NEOs, removing performance metrics that overlap with our performance-based equity incentive awards. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we eliminated bonus payouts for achieving individual goals for our Executive Chairman and CEO and, for fiscal 2018, the Committee extended this to our CFO and did not apply individual goals to Mr. Chavous, our newly hired President, Academics, Policy and Schools. The Committee also reduced the weighting of individual PMOs for our other NEOs from 50% to 30%. 
Target bonus levels for our NEOs are reviewed by the Committee annually and set at levels that, when combined with base salary levels, are intended to provide target total cash compensation opportunities that approximate the market median. None of our NEOs received an increase in target bonus levels under our Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018. Target bonus levels for our NEOs for fiscal 2018 were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Nathaniel A. Davis     150%  
 James J. Rhyu     80%  
 Kevin P. Chavous     80%  
 Howard D. Polsky     65%  
 Allison B. Cleveland     65%  
[END TABLE]
   Goal Setting Process and Rationale  
The Committee spends considerable time evaluating the appropriate metrics to be included in our Executive Bonus Plan each fiscal year and focuses on driving stockholder value through achievement of key financial metrics, operational goals and academic performance. For fiscal 2018, the Committee eliminated the performance metric tied to quarterly guidance figures and added a performance metric tied to CTE enrollments, one of our key strategic initiatives for fiscal 2018, and which we believe is a competitive differentiator. Executive Bonus Plan goals for fiscal 2018 generally fell into three categories: 
In setting performance levels for each metric, the Committee focused on incentivizing measurable performance growth in all areas and set threshold performance at or above fiscal 2017 actual performance and target performance at levels directly tied to budgeted performance for fiscal 2018, which was well above fiscal 2017 actual performance. 
Metrics under the Executive Bonus Plan for Mr. Davis, Mr. Rhyu and Mr. Chavous were based solely on the achievement of these corporate PMOs, which the Committee determined was appropriate to focus their efforts on improving Company performance and increasing stockholder value. However, for Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland, the Executive Bonus Plan also included individual PMOs intended to motivate these executives to produce measurable legal, compliance and school improvement outcomes. For these NEOs, awards under the Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018 were based 70% on the achievement of the corporate PMOs and 30% on the achievement of individual PMOs.  Table of Contents
      Corporate PMOs     
The corporate PMOs under our Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018 are set forth in the table below. The PMOs provide our NEOs with the opportunity to earn above target awards in the event they exceed the pre-established performance levels, but also provide for no awards below minimum thresholds of performance. Achievement at the threshold level results in payout at 33% of the target level and achievement at the outperform level results in payout at 200% of the target level. Performance between two levels is extrapolated on a straight-line basis. In August 2018, the Committee reviewed our achievement against these corporate PMOs and the results are included in the following table.  Table of Contents
   Individual PMOs  
For Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland, individual PMOs accounted for 30% of the NEO's target annual bonus opportunity under the Executive Bonus Plan for fiscal 2018, although the Committee retains discretion to allow for individual adjustments based on factors and considerations it deems relevant. A general description of the individual PMOs for fiscal 2018 and the NEOs' achievements are provided below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
            Howard D. Polsky              Favorable outcomes in significant litigation, arbitration, and state regulatory matters;   Completion of teacher certification compliance database;   Implementation of share repurchase;   Student data privacy initiatives and executive FCPA and securities law training                      Mr. Polsky achieved his established goals and outperformed with respect to obtaining favorable outcomes in significant litigation and state regulatory matters; effectively managed an unplanned share repurchase transaction; and implemented a   years' long compliance project. The CEO and the Board of Directors determined that Mr. Polsky's substantial achievements warranted an outperform result for his individual goals.    156.6%        
            Allison B. Cleveland              Improve student and family satisfaction and engagement;   Renew 8 contracts and 10 charters;   Improve teacher satisfaction and implement programs to build a more effective teacher workforce;   Grow the number of Destination Career Academy schools and students enrolled in Career and Technical Education schools and courses                      Ms. Cleveland achieved her established goals and outperformed in the areas of improved family satisfaction, and engagement where a greater than 10% increase was attained in Net Promoter Score and a student retention improvement of more than 300   bps. Additionally, the number of Destination Career Academy schools more than doubled and students enrolled in CTE programs and courses outperforming against that metric.    112.4%

 Nathaniel A. Davis (1)   60.5%   11.09%   12.8%   40%   30.2%   —   154.6%   $1,704,087  
 James P. Rhyu   60.5%   11.09%   12.8%   40%   30.2%   —   154.6%   $618,263

[END TABLE]
In connection with his termination as CEO effective March 3, 2018, Mr. Udell became entitled to receive the severance amounts under his employment agreement, which included a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus he would have received for the year of termination, based upon actual performance for such year and paid at the same time annual bonuses are generally paid to the Company's senior executives. Based upon achievement of the corporate PMOs described above, and pro-rated for the portion of fiscal 2018 during which he served as CEO, Mr. Udell received an annual bonus payment for fiscal 2018 of $1,004,677. 
   Determination of Long-Term Incentive Compensation  
We believe that providing long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of equity awards promotes our philosophy of aligning executive pay with the long-term interests of our stockholders while building the value of our Company. During fiscal 2018, we granted performance-based RSAs to Mr. Davis and performance- and time-based RSAs to each of Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Chavous, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland. In a departure from prior years, none of our NEOs were granted market-based awards that would be earned based solely on attaining stock price levels. 
   Mr. Davis—Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards  
In early fiscal 2018, the Committee approved Mr. Davis' long-term incentive award in the form of performance-based restricted stock with a cash flow goal measured by Adjusted EBITDA minus Capital  Table of Contents
Expenditures ("CapEx") for fiscal 2018. Unlike many members of our peer group, in fiscal 2018 we did not grant time-vesting equity awards to our most senior executive. 
The performance-based RSAs granted to Mr. Davis for fiscal 2018 had a target award value of $2 million, as set forth in his employment agreement, and the number of shares granted was determined based upon the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant, which resulted in a target award of 110,865 shares. The restricted shares are earned based upon the attainment of Adjusted EBITDA minus CapEx performance levels for fiscal 2018 as set forth in the table below, with any earned shares subject to additional time-based vesting in equal annual installments over a period of three years. Financial achievement falling between the specified levels would result in a proportionate adjustment to the number of shares earned. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Below Threshold   Less than $57.4M   0%; entire award forfeited  
   Threshold   $57.4M   80% of award earned  
   Target   $66.5M-$76.5M   100% of award earned  
   Outperform   $84.2M   133% of award earned  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined to continue using the cash flow metric of Adjusted EBITDA minus CapEx for this award because we view this as a critical metric for driving stockholder value. 
EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that consists of net income, plus net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization minus noncontrolling interest charges. A reconciliation of EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of operating income is provided in Item 6 of our fiscal 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. EBITDA is adjusted for stock-based compensation expense and excludes any acquisition related charges (which would include amortization subsequent to an acquisition transaction) and any other unusual, non-recurring gain or loss that is separately identified in our financial statements. 
In setting the threshold, target and outperform levels for this award for 2018, the Committee took into account that 100% of the equity awards for Mr. Davis are performance-based and therefore at-risk. The Committee also considered that this is a meaningful departure from the compensation practices of our peer companies, many of which provide at least half of their annual equity incentive grants in the form of time-based awards, and set performance levels accordingly. In our continued focus to align our metrics to our approved budget and year-over-year improvement, the metrics for Mr. Davis' equity award provided that performance between prior years' results and the approved budget would result in target level attainment. Additionally, payouts at each performance level are set in a narrower band than many programs of our peer companies to ensure that executives do not receive unreasonable payouts in the event of outperformance, taking into account the challenges we face in projecting our performance levels in our current operating environment and as we execute on transitioning our business. 
In early fiscal 2019, the Committee determined that our fiscal 2018 Adjusted EBITDA minus CapEx was $82.4 million, which resulted in Mr. Davis earning an award of 138,898 shares between the Target and Outperform levels, one-third of which vested in August 2018, on the date of certification of achievement, and the remainder of which will vest in annual installments in 2019 and 2020. 
CEO Grant.    In connection with Mr. Davis' appointment as CEO, Mr. Davis was granted a one-time performance-based restricted stock award having a value of $2,205,000, resulting in a grant of 158,747 restricted shares. The award was granted in recognition of our agreement with Mr. Davis to eliminate the Company's severance payment obligations to Mr. Davis under his employment agreement upon the appointment of a successor CEO. This award converted the value associated with Mr. Davis'  Table of Contents lump sum cash severance payment of three times his base salary (which would be payable upon an involuntary termination coincident with a successor CEO appointment) into an equity incentive performance award designed to retain Mr. Davis for an indefinite period of time and to drive him to deliver a concrete strategic plan for the Company to execute into the future. The shares subject to this award vest as to 50% of the award upon the hiring and commencement of employment of a new CEO. This component of the award was designed to seek to ensure Mr. Davis' retention and commitment to the Company until such time as his ultimate successor is selected and appointed by the Board. Because no specific timeline has been established for any such succession, this requires Mr. Davis to remain with us for an indefinite period of time to attain this portion of the award. The remaining 50% of the award vests upon Mr. Davis' submission to the Board of a strategic plan for the Company and the Board's acceptance of the same. On October 17, 2018, the Board received and accepted the long-term strategic plan presented by Mr. Davis. Upon Mr. Udell's departure, Mr. Davis was re-appointed to the CEO position because we believed that he was best positioned to set our company and the students we serve on track for future success. This component of the award was designed with these efforts in mind and will vest only after Mr. Davis completes work, to the full satisfaction of the Board, to develop the concrete steps and strategies for the Company to execute on the four cornerstones that we believe will accelerate our business growth and education mission, specifically to strengthen our core business, prepare students for the future, become a trusted software services provider in our Institutional Business and to further expand globally. 
   Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland—Time- and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Awards  
Beginning in August 2016, the Committee increased the percentage of variable compensation for certain of our NEOs in order to better align the interests of these executives with those of our stockholders and redefined business strategy. For fiscal 2018, the Committee reevaluated the long-term incentive component of our executive compensation program and determined to continue placing a meaningful amount of the NEOs' regular annual equity awards "at risk" such that 20% of the annual restricted stock awards granted to each of Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland are performance-based. For fiscal 2018, a portion of their annual equity awards are subject to attaining free cash flow goals and the Committee also introduced a total stockholder return modifier on a trial-basis as an element of this program. The performance-based restricted shares are earned based upon the attainment of the following free cash flow performance levels for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Below Threshold   Less than $49.5M   0%; entire award forfeited  
   Threshold   $49.5M   50% of award earned  
   Target   $55M   100% of award earned  
   Outperform   $60.5M   125% of award earned  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of the performance-based restricted shares granted to Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland, free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less CapEx. Financial achievement falling between the levels set forth in the table above would result in a proportionate adjustment to the number of shares earned. In setting the performance levels for this award, the Committee set the target level at our budgeted level for 2018 and the threshold level at a meaningful amount above our actual 2017 results. 
After determining the initial payout level for the performance-based restricted shares based on actual free cash flow results for the year, the payout percentage of the award is then adjusted upwards or downwards  Table of Contents in a range of 75% to 125% of the initial calculated payout level depending on the Company's total stockholder return ranking as compared to companies in the Russell 2000 Index as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Threshold   25th percentile or below   25% reduction of award  
   Target   50th percentile   0% (no change to award)  
   Outperform   75th percentile or above   25% increase of award  
[END TABLE]
Performance falling between the levels set forth in the table above would be interpolated linearly between the threshold, target and outperform levels. For purposes of this modifier, total stockholder return is determined by using the average stock price over the 90 days preceding the end of the fiscal year. 
The following table sets forth the number of time and performance-based restricted stock awards granted to each of Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland for fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 James J. Rhyu   34,170   8,540  
 Howard D. Polsky   20,340   5,080  
 Allison B. Cleveland   24,410   6,100  
[END TABLE]
   Mr. Chavous—New Hire Grant  
In connection with his commencement of employment in October 2017, Mr. Chavous was granted a restricted stock award having a target award value of $1,000,000, allocated evenly between time- and performance-based restricted stock awards. The number of shares granted was determined based upon the fair market value of our Common Stock on the date of grant, which resulted in an award of 30,212 time-based restricted shares subject to our standard vesting schedule which is semi-annually over a three-year period, with 20% of the shares subject to the award vesting in the first year and 40% vesting in each of the next two years following the grant date and a target award of 30,212 performance-based restricted shares with 60% of the performance-based shares (or 18,127 shares) earned upon the attainment of certain individual performance metrics and 40% of the performance-based shares (or 12,085 shares) earned upon attainment of the free cash flow performance levels for fiscal 2018 set forth above for Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland, as modified by our total stockholder return ranking as compared to companies in the Russell 2000 Index.  Table of Contents
The following table sets forth the individual performance metrics applicable to a portion of Mr. Chavous' new hire grant and the results as determined by the Committee in August 2018. Based on its review of Mr. Chavous' performance against the individual metrics, the Committee determined that Mr. Chavous achieved 95% of his target award level for this component of his new hire grant, which resulted in Mr. Chavous earning an award of 17,220 restricted shares.

   Prior Year Long-Term Incentive Awards  
   Fiscal 2017 Market-Based Restricted Stock Awards  
In fiscal 2017, Mr. Rhyu, Mr. Polsky and Ms. Cleveland were granted market-based restricted stock awards that begin to vest based upon the Company achieving an average stock price of $14.35 per share measured during the 30 consecutive calendar days following the report of fiscal 2017 earnings. On September 8, 2017, the Committee certified the achievement of the stock price threshold and the NEOs began vesting in the restricted shares as follows:

   LTIP Performance Share Units  
In fiscal 2016 the Committee granted PSUs to our NEOs, which are earned based on academic performance, weighted at 70%, and a student lifetime value ("LTV") retention metric, weighted at 30%. Academic performance goals were measured over both a two and three year period and the student retention LTV metric was measured based on performance for the third year (fiscal 2018). The first tranche of the academic goal (i.e., the tranche for the two-year fiscal 2016-2017 period) was earned at the outperform level based on reducing the number of schools in academic jeopardy status over the performance period from 11 to three and began vesting in November 2017. The second tranche of the academic goal (i.e. the tranche for the three-year fiscal 2016-2018 period) was measured based on the percentage of schools not in academic jeopardy at the end of the performance period as follows:  Table of Contents 
For this purpose, "academic jeopardy" is defined as a school having a high probability of being closed within 12-18 months of the measurement date if academic performance does not improve. Over the three-year performance period, we reduced the number of schools in academic jeopardy from 11 to 5, resulting in the second tranche of this award being earned between the Threshold and Target levels, or 95.8% of the award being earned. The earned shares from the second tranche vested on August 15, 2018. 
The retention goal was eligible to be earned based on the achievement of a student LTV metric, which takes into account our average revenue per student enrollment multiplied by the duration of our students' total enrollment life. The percentage growth figures shown in the table below represent the amount of growth in LTV needed to be achieved by fiscal 2018 above the fiscal 2015 level. 
For fiscal 2018, we achieved an LTV growth of less than 16%, resulting in the shares subject to the retention metric being forfeited. 
The earned academic shares will vest in four quarterly installments beginning August 15, 2018. 
Awards under the LTIP are not granted on an annual basis such that additional PSUs with overlapping performance periods were not granted to our NEOs. Fiscal 2018 was the final year of our 3-year LTIP, which was implemented in fiscal 2016. 
New 2019 Long-Term Shareholder Performance Plan 
For fiscal 2019-2021, we have adopted a new long-term shareholder performance plan ("2019 SPP") that represents a meaningful portion of the total long-term incentive award opportunities provided to our most senior executives, Mr. Davis, Mr. Rhyu and Mr. Chavous. The awards are granted in the form of performance share units and will be earned only based on our market capitalization growth over a completed three-year performance period. The 2019 SPP was designed to provide these executives with a percentage of shareholder value growth. No amounts will be earned if total stock price growth over the three-year period is below 25% (7.6% annualized). A target amount of 6% of total value growth will be earned based on achieving total stock price growth of 33% (10% annualized) and a maximum of 7.5% of total value growth will be earned if total stock price growth equals or exceeds 95% (25% annualized).  Table of Contents
The total number of shares, and corresponding share of market cap growth, earned by each of Messrs. Davis, Rhyu and Chavous under the 2019 SPP at different stock price growth outcomes is illustrated in the following chart:

      Other Compensation     
   Deferred Compensation Plan  
We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan, or the Deferred Compensation Plan, under which our NEOs are eligible to elect to defer the receipt of up to 50% of their annual base salary and up to 100% of any annual incentive bonus until retirement. Earnings are credited on deferred amounts based upon a variety of investment options that may be elected by each participant. We do not make any contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Certain information with respect to amounts deferred by our NEOs under this plan is set forth below in the "Fiscal 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" table. 
   Defined Contribution Plan  
We maintain a Section 401(k) Savings/Retirement Plan, or the 401(k) Plan, in which certain of our employees, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate. All employees, including our NEOs, are automatically enrolled in the 401(k) Plan at a 3% deferral rate with the ability to opt-out. The 401(k) Plan allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation, subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. We currently provide matching contributions equal to $0.25 for each dollar of a participant's contributions on the first 4% of eligible salary that they contribute each pay period, subject to certain statutory limits. 
   Employee Benefits and Perquisites  
We provide our NEOs with certain personal benefits and perquisites, which we do not consider to be a significant component of executive compensation but recognize to be an important factor in attracting and retaining talented executives. Our NEOs participate in the same medical, dental, vision, disability and life insurance plans as our employees generally. We also pay for supplemental long-term disability and life insurance premiums for our executive officers and provide them with the opportunity to receive annual Company-paid executive physical examinations and reimburse certain executives for their relocation expenses from time to time and for temporary housing expenses they may incur in connection with their provision of services. We provide these supplemental benefits to our executive officers due to the relatively low cost of such benefits and the value they provide in assisting us in attracting and retaining talented executives. None of our executive officers receive tax gross-ups or other tax payments in connection with our provision of any perquisites or personal benefits. The value of personal benefits and  Table of Contents perquisites we provided to each of our NEOs in fiscal 2018 is set forth below in our "Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018." 
      Compensation Governance, Process And Incentive Decisions     
   Role of Compensation Committee  
The Committee is responsible for overseeing our executive compensation programs, as specified in its charter. The Committee's role includes:
In performing its responsibilities with respect to the compensation of our executive officers, the Committee uses information from a number of sources. The information utilized by the Committee includes advice from its independent compensation consultant, market data regarding the compensation practices of competitors, advice from outside counsel specializing in executive compensation, tally sheets showing prior compensation awards, the recommendations of our Chairman and CEO and an assessment of the outstanding equity holdings of our executive officers. 
   Role of Management  
Our management, under the leadership of our Chairman and CEO, plays an important role in establishing and maintaining our executive compensation programs. Management's role includes recommending plans and programs to the Committee, implementing the Committee's decisions and assisting and administering plans in support of the Committee. Our Chairman and CEO provides information on the individual performance of our other executive officers and makes annual recommendations to the Committee on compensation levels for our executive officers, including the other NEOs. Our Chairman and CEO is not present when the Committee discusses and determines matters regarding his own compensation. 
   Role of Committee's Independent Compensation Consultant  
The Committee's charter gives it the authority to retain and approve fees and other terms of engagement for compensation consultants and other advisors to assist it in performing its duties. In fiscal 2018, the Committee continued to retain Compensia as its independent compensation consultant. Compensia reports directly to the Committee, which will annually review its performance, independence and fees. 
The Committee receives a report from Compensia on an annual basis reviewing its independence in light of SEC regulations and NYSE listing standards.  Table of Contents
      Other Compensation Policies and Practices     
   Stock Ownership Policy  
We maintain a stock ownership policy that is designed to ensure that our executive officers and non-employee directors hold a significant equity stake in our Company to align their interests with those of our stockholders. The policy has expanded over the years such that it now applies to all of our executive officers and non-employee directors. The policy requires our Chairman and CEO to maintain ownership of our Common Stock having a value equal to three times his base salary, our CFO to maintain ownership of our Common Stock equal to two times his base salary and each of our other executive officers to maintain Common Stock ownership equal to one time their respective base salaries. Non-employee directors are required to maintain ownership of our Common Stock equal to the lesser of three times the annual cash retainer or 15,000 shares. Our executive officers and non-employee directors have five years from the date the policy became applicable to them to accumulate the specified level of ownership. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all of our NEOs who remain employed by the Company and non-employee directors are in compliance with this policy. 
   Compensation Clawback Policy  
Our Board of Directors has adopted a clawback policy pursuant to which the Company may recover from current or former executive officers the amount of previously paid incentive compensation (including both cash bonuses and equity awards) that it determines to be appropriate if a material error or inaccuracy resulted in whole or in part from the fraud or intentional misconduct of an executive that leads to a financial restatement. This policy is intended to provide enhanced safeguards against certain types of employee misconduct, and allows for recovery of significant compensation paid to an executive. 
   Insider Trading Policy  
We maintain a Policy Statement for the Prevention of Insider Trading that applies to all securities issued by the Company, including Common Stock, options to purchase shares of Common Stock, preferred stock, and any other type of security that the Company may issue or that relates to the Company's securities. Company employees, directors and consultants are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions, including purchasing Company stock on margin or engaging in transactions in puts, calls or other derivative securities designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's equity securities and we have not permitted the pledging of any awards. 
   Tax Deductibility of Annual Compensation  
Prior to the passage of the Tax Act, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limited tax deductions for certain annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain individuals named in the summary compensation tables of public company proxy statements. Compensation that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m) was exempt from this $1 million limitation. As part of the Tax Act, the ability to rely on this "qualified performance-based compensation" exception was eliminated and the limitation on deductibility was generally expanded to include all named executive officers. Although we maintained compensation arrangements that were intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m), following passage of the Tax Act we may no longer take a deduction for any compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1 million, subject to certain transition relief rules. Furthermore, although the Committee had previously considered tax deductibility when structuring compensation programs and may have taken action intended to limit the impact of Section 162(m), it also retained discretion to grant incentive awards to NEOs that were not fully deductible as a result of Section 162(m), as the Committee must balance the effectiveness and overall goals of our executive compensation programs with the materiality of reduced tax deductions. Accordingly, achieving the  Table of Contents desired flexibility in the design and delivery of compensation may have resulted (and may continue to result, in light of the recent changes in law) in compensation that in certain cases is not deductible for federal income tax purposes. 
   Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  
ASC Topic 718, Compensation—Stock Compensation, requires us to recognize an expense for the fair value of equity-based compensation awards. Grants of equity-based awards under our equity incentive award plans are accounted for under ASC Topic 718. The Committee considers the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. As accounting standards change, the Committee may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives. 
   Equity Award Grant Practices  
We do not have any program, plan or practice to time the grant of equity awards to our employees in coordination with the release of material non-public information. We generally grant awards at the time employment commences and annually in connection with our annual compensation review process. We do not time the grant of equity awards based on our stock price. If we are in possession of material non-public information, either favorable or unfavorable, when equity awards are made, the Committee will not take the information into consideration in determining award amounts. Our practice is to determine the stock price for annual NEO equity awards on the day that incentive awards are granted. 
   Severance and Change in Control Arrangements  
We consider severance to be an integral part of the overall compensation package for our executives. We provide severance to attract and retain individuals with superior ability and managerial talent, provide our executives with appropriate protections due to their vulnerability to terminations of employment due to a change in control, merger or acquisition and encourage our executives to focus their attention on their work duties and responsibilities in all situations. 
We believe that providing the NEOs with severance payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment are key retention tools that help us remain competitive with the companies in our peer group, provide our executive officers with incentives to focus on the best interests of our stockholders in the context of a potential change in control, and appropriately protect our executive officers in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without creating a windfall due solely to a change in control. 
 Severance.    We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Davis and Mr. Polsky and a letter agreement with Mr. Rhyu that provide for severance payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment as further described below under the section "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Employment Agreements." Our other NEOs are generally entitled to receive severance pay upon a qualifying termination of employment under the Company's severance guidelines in an amount between six and twelve months of base salary, which amount is determined based on their position and tenure with the Company. In addition, upon a termination without cause or resignation for good reason, the NEOs may be eligible to receive, subject entirely to the Committee's discretion and contingent upon signing a release of claims: (i) accelerated vesting of outstanding and unvested stock options that otherwise would have vested in the one year period following the date of termination (all other options to be forfeited), and (ii) accelerated vesting of outstanding and unvested restricted stock awards. 
In connection with Mr. Udell's resignation as CEO in March 2018, he became entitled to receive the severance amounts provided for in his employment agreement as further described below under the  Table of Contents section "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control—Severance Arrangement With Mr. Udell." 
 Change in Control.    The NEOs are generally not entitled to receive cash payments or accelerated vesting of equity awards solely as a result of a change in control of the Company. 
We have entered into change in control agreements with our NEOs, other than Mr. Davis, whose entitlements to payments or benefits upon a change in control is set forth in his employment agreement, pursuant to which, in the event the NEO is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason within 24 months following a change in control, the executive would be entitled to receive 1.5 times the cash severance amount available under the Company's standard severance guidelines as described above and reimbursement for COBRA premiums for up to 12 months following termination. In addition, all unvested equity awards would become fully vested, provided that any awards subject to performance-based vesting would generally only vest subject to the attainment of the applicable performance conditions. 
   Risk Assessment in Compensation Programs  
Consistent with SEC disclosure requirements, we periodically evaluate the risk profile associated with the Company's executive and other compensation programs. In fiscal 2018, the Committee engaged Compensia to review the existing programs and assess whether they create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Among other factors, this assessment considered the program structure, design characteristics and performance-based measures associated with our executive compensation programs and concluded that our executive compensation programs contain a number of safeguards that are expected to minimize excessive risk taking, including a reasonable mix of cash and equity compensation opportunities, a compensation claw back policy, a balanced annual incentive plan design that emphasizes top and bottom line performance, formal policies for the administration of our equity program, a succession plan for key executives and a stock ownership policy for our executive officers. 
Based on the foregoing, we believe that our compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole. We also believe that our incentive compensation arrangements provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the Company's ability to effectively identify and manage significant risks, are compatible with effective internal controls and the risk management practices of our Company, and are supported by the oversight and administration of the Committee with regard to our executive compensation programs.

      Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control     
We have entered into employment agreements with Mr. Davis and Mr. Polsky and a letter agreement with Mr. Rhyu that provide for severance payments and benefits upon certain terminations of employment. Our NEOs are also entitled to certain payments and benefits upon a change in control of the Company. The terms and conditions of such payments and benefits, and the circumstances in which they will be paid or provided to our NEOs, are described in more detail below. 
   Employment Agreements  
   Summary of Employment Agreement with Mr. Davis  
In connection with Mr. Davis' appointment as our CEO effective March 3, 2018, we entered into an amendment to the second amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Davis, pursuant to which Mr. Davis serves as our Chairman and CEO. The amendment extended the term of the  Table of Contents employment agreement to September 30, 2019, which term automatically renews for successive one year periods unless notice of non-renewal is delivered by either party at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. 
Under the terms of the employment agreement, as amended, Mr. Davis is entitled to receive an annual base salary of $735,000 and is eligible for annual performance-based bonuses with a target award amount equal to 150% of his base salary and a maximum award opportunity of 300% of his base salary. Mr. Davis is also entitled to annual awards under the Company's equity incentive awards plans and programs as in effect from time to time with a target award level in fiscal 2018 of $2,000,000, subject to Committee and Board approval. Beginning with fiscal 2019, Mr. Davis' employment agreement provides that his target award level under our annual equity incentive award plans will be in the range of $2,700,000 to $3,300,000, subject to performance and other vesting criteria to be determined by the Board of Directors and Mr. Davis at the time of the grant. 
To maintain flexibility and ensure that stockholders are not overly burdened with excessive severance costs as we continue to evaluate our leadership needs, in connection with his re-appointment as CEO, we negotiated an arrangement with Mr. Davis that would eliminate our cash severance obligations to Mr. Davis in the event Mr. Davis is replaced by a new chief executive officer. Specifically, if we (i) hire a replacement CEO and Mr. Davis' employment is terminated prior to September 30, 2019 or (ii) elect not to renew the employment agreement, no severance payments will be made; however, Mr. Davis' outstanding equity awards will continue to vest while he continues to serve as a member of the Board and if Mr. Davis is asked to leave the Board, Mr. Davis will be entitled to accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity awards, provided that performance-based awards will only be payable subject to the attainment of the applicable performance measures, and an extended option exercise period of one year. 
If the foregoing circumstances do not apply and we terminate Mr. Davis' employment without cause or he resigns for good reason, Mr. Davis will be entitled to receive (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to three times his base salary, (ii) a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus he would have received for the year of termination, based upon actual performance for such year and generally paid at the same time annual bonuses are paid to the Company's executives, and (iii) one year of continued health, medical, dental and vision benefits (or a payment in lieu thereof). Mr. Davis would also be entitled to accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity awards to the extent such awards would have vested during the 24 month period following his termination of employment; provided that performance-based equity awards will only be payable subject to the attainment of the applicable performance measures. If Mr. Davis' termination without cause or resignation for good reason occurs within 24 months following a change in control, Mr. Davis will be entitled to receive the severance payments and benefits described above, except that, all of Mr. Davis' outstanding equity awards would become 100% vested and any performance-based equity awards will remain subject to the attainment of applicable performance measures as such measures apply in connection with the change in control. 
Mr. Davis' receipt of any severance payments or benefits is generally contingent upon his entering into a customary separation agreement with the Company. The employment agreement also contains a three year confidentiality covenant and additional restrictive covenants pursuant to which Mr. Davis has agreed not to compete with us or solicit our customers or employees for 12 months following termination. If Mr. Davis is terminated without cause or resigns for good reason, in either case, within 24 months following a change in control and the Company or the successor entity elects to continue Mr. Davis' compliance with the non-compete provision, then Mr. Davis will be entitled to an additional payment equal to one time his then-current base salary.  Table of Contents

   Severance Arrangement with Former NEOs  
   Mr. Udell  
In connection with Mr. Udell's resignation as CEO in March 2018, he became entitled to receive the severance amounts provided for in his employment agreement, which included (i) a cash lump sum payment of $1,950,000, (ii) $1,004,677, which represents a pro-rated portion of the annual bonus for the year of termination, based upon actual performance for such year, (iii) an estimated $12,591 in COBRA premiums, and (iv) accelerated vesting of his outstanding equity awards that would have vested during the 12 month period following his termination of employment, which was valued at $5,599,809. 
   Ms. Cleveland  
Ms. Cleveland's employment with the Company terminated effective September 1, 2018 and she received the following severance payments and benefits: (i) a cash lump sum payment of $415,000; (ii) $382,859, which represents the annual bonus for the year of termination, based upon actual performance for such year; (iii) $10,401 in COBRA premiums, (iv) outplacement assistance valued at $5,000, and (v) accelerated vesting of her outstanding equity awards that would have vested during the 12 month period following her termination of employment, which was valued at $781,716. 
   Change in Control Arrangements  
None of our NEOs are entitled to any payments or benefits upon a change in control of the Company absent a qualifying termination in connection with the change in control. In fiscal 2016, the Committee approved limited change in control benefits for our executives, other than Mr. Davis, and we subsequently entered into change in control agreements with these executives, pursuant to which they are entitled to certain additional benefits in the event they incur a qualifying termination within the 24 month period following a change in control of the Company. These agreements are described in more detail above under the heading "Severance and Change in Control Arrangements—Change in Control." Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Davis is entitled to certain additional benefits in the event he incurs a qualifying termination within 24 months following a change in control as described above.  Table of Contents 
   Potential Value of Termination and Change-in-Control Benefits  
The following table provides the dollar value of the potential payments and benefits that each NEO would be eligible to receive upon certain terminations of employment (including in connection with a change in control of the Company), assuming that the termination or change in control, as applicable, occurred on June 30, 2018, and the price per share of our Common Stock equaled $16.37, the value of one share of our Common Stock on the last trading day of fiscal 2018.

Pay Ratio Disclosure  
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our Chairman and CEO, Mr. Davis. We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate, calculated in a manner intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
We identified the median employee from among those employees who were employed by us on April 30, 2018, excluding our CEO, based on annual base salaries for fiscal 2018, which we believe is reasonably representative of our employees' total compensation for the year. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, which yielded a total employee population of 4,757. We did not make any cost-of-living or other adjustments to employee compensation. 
After identifying the median employee, we calculated the annual total compensation for fiscal 2018 for such employee using the same methodology we used for our NEOs as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for Fiscal 2018. 
For fiscal 2018, the annual total compensation for our median employee was $51,577 and the annual total compensation for our Chairman and CEO was $6,435,889, resulting in an estimated pay ratio of 125 to 1. 
We have considered the results of this analysis and believe that our pay ratio is impacted by the fact that many of our teachers are employed on a part-time basis and their total cash compensation reflects their part-time status. Additionally, we do not have full discretion in establishing the compensation arrangements for a large segment of our employee population, namely teachers serving in our Managed Public School programs. Because compensation costs for this group of employees are passed through to the school districts in which the teachers serve, the compensation arrangements for these teachers are not determined solely by us, but are subject to review and approval by the respective school boards.

    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS     
      Policies and Procedures for Related-Party Transactions     
We recognize that related-party transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest and have adopted a written policy to which all related-party transactions shall be subject. Pursuant to the policy, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, or in the case of a transaction in which the aggregate amount is, or is expected to be, in excess of $250,000, the Board of Directors will review the relevant facts and circumstances of all related-party transactions, including, but not limited to: (i) whether the transaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm's length dealings with an unrelated third party; and (ii) the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. Pursuant to the policy, no director, including the Chairman of the Audit Committee, may participate in any approval of a related-party transaction to which he or she is a related party. The Board of Directors or Audit Committee, as applicable, will then, in its sole discretion, either approve or disapprove the transaction. 
Certain types of transactions, which would otherwise require individual review, have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. These types of transactions include, for example: (i) compensation to an officer or director where such compensation is required to be disclosed in our proxy statement; (ii) transactions where the interest of the related party arises only by way of a directorship or minority stake in another organization that is a party to the transaction; and (iii) transactions involving competitive bids or fixed rates. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of our related-party transaction policy, all related-party transactions are required to be disclosed in our applicable filings as required by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and the Exchange Act and related rules. Furthermore, any material related-party transactions are required to be disclosed to the full Board of Directors. We have established internal policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures, which include policies relating to the reporting of related-party transactions that must be pre-approved under our related-party transactions policy. 
      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation     
During fiscal 2018, Messrs. Engler, Fink, Knowling and Tisch served on our Compensation Committee. During fiscal 2018, there were no interlocking relationships existing between members of our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee and members of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other company. During fiscal 2018, no members of the Compensation Committee were current or former officers of the Company or were employees of the Company and no members of the Compensation Committee had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company under Item 404 of Regulation S-K.

    PROPOSAL 2:   ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE   COMPENSATION     
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank") and Section 14 of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to cast a non-binding advisory vote to approve the fiscal 2018 compensation of our NEOs, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This Proposal, commonly known as "Say on Pay," gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the design and effectiveness of our executive compensation programs. 
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate, and retain our NEOs, who are critical to our success. Under these programs, our NEOs are rewarded for the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals, corporate goals, and the realization of increased stockholder value. Please read the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the compensation tables that follow, included in this Proxy Statement, for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the fiscal 2018 compensation of our NEOs. 
      Prior Year Vote and Fiscal 2018 Compensation Highlights   
As we developed our executive compensation program for fiscal 2018, our Compensation Committee took into account the extensive stockholder input we received and took steps to more tightly link executive pay to measurable performance results. Over the last several years, we have extensively overhauled our executive compensation programs and practices, including making the following structural changes prior to fiscal 2018 (which were continued into fiscal 2018):
Following these reforms, the annual shareholder advisory vote on our executive compensation for fiscal 2017 yielded an approval rate of 78.5%, which was a significant improvement over prior years. 
While executing on our multi-year strategy as described above, fiscal 2018 saw solid financial results and key achievements in the following areas:  Table of Contents
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our NEOs as described in this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote  FOR the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
The Say on Pay vote is advisory and, therefore, not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, or our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders, and to the extent there is a significant vote against the NEO compensation, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and will evaluate what, if any, further actions are necessary to address those concerns. We expect to hold another Say on Pay vote at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION APPROVING THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SEC. Table of Contents 
    PROPOSAL 3:   RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF   INDEPENDENT AUDITOR     
Subject to stockholder ratification, the Audit Committee has appointed the firm of BDO USA, LLP ("BDO USA"), as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. Although ratification is not required by law, our Board of Directors believes that stockholders should be given the opportunity to express their view on the subject. While not binding on the Audit Committee, if the stockholders do not ratify this appointment, the appointment will be reconsidered by the Audit Committee. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. A representative of BDO USA is expected to attend the Annual Meeting and this representative will be provided with an opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions of stockholders, if any. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the appointment of BDO USA as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF BDO USA AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2019.
      Fees Paid to Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm     
The following table sets forth the aggregate fees and expenses billed to us by BDO USA for fiscal years 2017 and 2018:

Audit-related fees in fiscal 2017 and 2018 were for professional services associated with audits of certain managed schools and other minor matters. 
The Audit Committee maintains policies and procedures for the pre-approval of work performed by the independent auditors in that, under the Audit Committee charter, all auditor engagements must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. All of the services provided to the Company by BDO USA during fiscal 2017 and 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.  Table of Contents 
    AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT     
In accordance with a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, the Audit Committee, or the "Committee", assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company's financial reporting processes and its internal audit function. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls and for assessing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and for issuing reports thereon. 
In this context, the Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent auditors, as well as legal counsel. Management represented to the Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent auditors. The Committee discussed with the independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees), as currently in effect and as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 
In addition, the Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Committee concerning independence and has discussed with the independent auditors the auditors' independence from the Company and its management. 
The Committee discussed with the Company's internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls and the overall quality of the Company's accounting principles. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on August 8, 2018. The Committee also recommended to the Board of Directors, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of BDO USA as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, and the Board of Directors accepted its recommendation.

    SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP   REPORTING COMPLIANCE     
Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires directors and executive officers and persons, if any, owning more than 10% of a class of the Company's equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of the Company's equity and equity-derivative securities. Based solely upon a review of the copies of such reports and written representations from reporting persons, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders were complied with on a timely basis during fiscal 2018. 
    INTEREST OF CERTAIN PERSONS IN   MATTERS TO BE ACTED ON     
No director or executive officer of K12 who has served in such capacity since July 1, 2017, or any associate of any such director or officer, to the knowledge of the executive officers of K12, has any material interest, direct or indirect, through security holdings or otherwise, in any matter proposed to be acted on at the Annual Meeting, which is not shared by all other stockholders or as is otherwise described in this Proxy Statement. 
    DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS TO SECURITY HOLDERS SHARING AN ADDRESS     
The SEC's rules permit the Company to deliver a single set of Annual Meeting materials to one address shared by two or more of the Company's stockholders. The Company has delivered only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or Proxy Statement and Annual Report (where paper copies were previously requested) to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless the Company received contrary instructions from the affected stockholders prior to the mailing date. The Company will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or separate paper copies of all Annual Meeting materials, as requested, to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. If you prefer to receive separate copies of the Proxy Statement or Annual Report, contact K12 Inc., 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171, Attention: Investor Relations, or call us at (703) 483-7000. 
Stockholders sharing an address can request delivery of a single copy of the Annual Meeting materials, if they are currently receiving multiple copies of the Annual Meeting materials, by writing to K12 Inc., 2300 Corporate Park Drive, Herndon, VA 20171, Attention: Investor Relations, or call us at (703) 483-7000. 
    PROPOSALS BY OUR STOCKHOLDERS     
Stockholder proposals intended for inclusion in next year's proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act should be sent to our principal executive offices and must be received not less than 120 calendar days prior to October 26, 2019. Accordingly, stockholder proposals must be received no later  Table of Contents than June 28, 2019. As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included in the Proxy Statement. 
Additionally, our Bylaws provide that stockholders desiring to nominate a director or bring any other business before the stockholders at an annual meeting must notify our Secretary of this proposal in writing not later than 90 days nor earlier than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. Accordingly, for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, any notification must be made no earlier than August 16, 2019 and no later than September 15, 2019. If during the prior year we did not hold an annual meeting, or if the date of the meeting has changed more than 30 days from the prior year, then notice must be received a reasonable time before we mail our proxy materials for the current year. The stockholder must be a stockholder of record both at the time of giving notice and at the time of the annual meeting. The fact that the Company may not insist upon compliance with these requirements should not be construed as a waiver of our right to do so at any time in the future. 
    WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION     
We are subject to the information filing requirements of the Exchange Act and, in accordance with the Exchange Act, file certain reports and other information with the SEC relating to our business, financial condition and other matters. 
Copies of these materials can be obtained, upon payment of the SEC's customary charges, by writing to the SEC's principal office at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The SEC also maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and other information.
