ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING
General: Date, Time and Place 
We are providing this proxy statement to you in connection with the solicitation, on behalf of our Board, of proxies to be voted at our Annual Meeting or any postponement or adjournment of that meeting. The Annual Meeting will be held on December 31, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. local time (8:00 p.m. E.T., December 30, 2018) at our executive office, located at Flat/RM 03-04 20/F Hutchison House 10 Harcourt Road, Central, Hong Kong.
Matters to be Considered and Voted Upon 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will be asked to consider and vote to elect the nominees named herein as directors to serve until the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, to ratify the appointment of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and to conduct an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. The Board does not know of any matters to be brought before the meeting other than as set forth in the notice of meeting. If any other matters properly come before the meeting, the persons named in the form of proxy or their substitutes will vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matters.
Record Date; Stock Outstanding and Entitled to Vote 
Our Board established November 12, 2018 as the record date. Only holders of shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.001 per share, as of the record date, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. Each share of common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote per share on each matter presented to our stockholders for approval at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on the record date, we had 11,226,025 shares of our common stock outstanding.
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and Annual Report 
These proxy solicitation materials are available at https://www.iproxydirect.com/TKAT on or about November 21, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. A copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 will be made available at https://www.iproxydirect.com/TKAT concurrently with these proxy solicitation materials.
The Company is furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via the Internet, rather than mailing printed copies of these materials to each stockholder. We believe that this process should expedite stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs incurred by us for the Annual Meeting and help to conserve natural resources. On or about November 21, 2018, we will mail to each stockholder of record and beneficial owners (other than those who previously requested electronic or paper delivery) a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, in the form of a mailing titled "Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials", that contains instructions on how to access and review the proxy materials, including this proxy statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, on a website referred to in such notice and how to access a proxy card to vote on the Internet or by telephone. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions on how to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials. If you receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you should not expect to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request one. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, currently or on an ongoing basis, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
Quorum; Required Vote 	
A quorum of stockholders is required for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. The presence of at least a majority of all of our shares of common stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, will constitute a quorum at the meeting. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by an election inspector appointed for the meeting and will be taken into account in determining whether or not a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which occur when a broker has not received customer instructions and indicates that it does not have the discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter on the proxy card, will be included in determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting.
Assuming that a quorum is present, our stockholders may take action at the annual meeting with the votes described below.
Election of Directors. Under Delaware law and the Bylaws of the Company ("Bylaws"), the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of our shares of common stock is required to elect each director. Consequently, only shares that are voted in favor of a particular nominee will be counted toward such nominee's achievement of a plurality. Stockholders do not have any rights to cumulate their votes in the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted toward a nominee's total.
Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Auditor. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to ratify the appointment of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP as the Company's independent auditor for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
Non-binding advisory vote regarding the compensation of our named executive officers. The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes approving the compensation of our named executive officers.
Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
Under applicable regulations, if a broker holds shares on your behalf, and you do not instruct your broker how to vote those shares on a matter considered "routine", the broker may generally vote your shares for you. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker has not received voting instructions from you on a "non-routine" matter, in which case the broker does not have authority to vote your shares with respect to such matter. Rules that govern how brokers vote your shares have recently changed. Unless you provide voting instructions to a broker holding shares on your behalf, your broker may no longer use discretionary authority to vote your shares on any of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. Please vote your proxy so your vote can be counted.
Voting Procedure; Voting of Proxies; Revocation of Proxies 
Stockholders of Record 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, VStock Transfer, LLC, you are considered the "stockholder of record" with respect to those shares. As the stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or, most conveniently, vote by telephone, Internet or mail. Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. You may still attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person even if you have already voted by proxy.
By Internet â stockholders may vote on the internet by logging on to https://www.iproxydirect.com/TKAT  and following the instructions given.
By Telephone â stockholders may vote by calling (866) 752-VOTE(8683) (toll-free) with a touch tone telephone and following the recorded instructions.
By Mail â stockholders must request a paper copy of the proxy materials to receive a proxy card and follow the instructions given for mailing. A paper copy of the proxy materials may be obtained by logging to https://www.iproxydirect.com/TKAT and following the instructions given. To vote using the proxy card, simply print the proxy card, complete, sign and date it and return it promptly to the address as instructed thereon. In the alternative, the proxy card can be mailed directly to the Company: Chun Hin Leslie Chow, our acting Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, located Flat/RM 03-04 20/F Hutchison House 10 Harcourt Road, Central, Hong Kong. Our Board has selected Chun Hin Leslie Chow to serve as proxy.
If you vote by telephone or via the Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card. Telephone and Internet voting are available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on December 29, 2018.
In Person - stockholders may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. To vote in person, come to the Annual Meeting and we will give you a ballot when you arrive.
Shares of our common stock represented by proxies properly voted that are received by us and are not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If instructions are not given, such proxies will be voted FOR election of each nominee for director named herein, FOR verification of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP as independent auditor, and FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers described in this Proxy Statement. In addition, we reserve the right to exercise discretionary authority to vote proxies, in the manner determined by us, in our sole discretion, on any matters brought before the Annual Meeting for which we did not receive adequate notice under the proxy rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
Street Name Stockholders 
If you hold your shares in "street name" through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in your own name, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of such shares. Because a beneficial owner is not a stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from the broker, bank or nominee that holds your shares, giving you the right to vote those shares at the meeting. The Board recommends that you vote using one of the other voting methods, since it is not practical for most stockholders to attend the Annual Meeting.
If you hold your shares in "street name" through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in your own name, you can most conveniently vote by telephone, Internet or mail. Please review the voting instructions on your voting instruction form.
Your proxy is revocable at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting in any of the following three ways:
Dissenters' Right of Appraisal
Under Delaware General Corporation Law and the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, stockholders are not entitled to any appraisal or similar rights of dissenters with respect to any of the proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting.
Proxy Solicitation 
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies. In addition to these proxy materials, our directors and employees may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means of communication. Directors and employees will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners.
Householding 
SEC rules permit us to deliver a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if applicable, a paper copy of our annual report and proxy statement, to one address shared by two or more of our stockholders. This delivery method is referred to as "householding" and can result in significant cost savings. To take advantage of this opportunity, we have delivered only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if applicable, a paper copy of the annual report and proxy statement, to multiple stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions from the impacted stockholders prior to the mailing date. If you received a householded mailing this year and you would like to have additional copies of our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or, if applicable, additional copies of our annual report and proxy statement mailed to you or you would like to opt out of this practice for future mailings, contact Chun Hin Leslie Chow, our acting Chief Executive Officer, located Flat/RM 03-04 20/F Hutchison House 10 Harcourt Road, Central, Hong Kong. We agree to deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of this proxy statement and annual report to any stockholder at the shared address to which a single copy of those documents were delivered.
Stockholder List
For at least ten days prior to the meeting, a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, will be open for examination by any stockholder, for any purpose related to the Annual Meeting, during ordinary business hours at our principal executive office. The list will also be available for examination at the Annual Meeting.
Other Business
The Board is not aware of any other matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those mentioned in this proxy statement and our accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If, however, any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote in accordance with their best judgment.

Proposals and notices of intention to present proposals at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 should be addressed to Chun Hin Leslie Chow, our acting Chief Executive Officer, located Flat/RM 03-04 20/F Hutchison House 10 Harcourt Road, Central, Hong Kong.

The shareholders are being asked to ratify this appointment so that the Audit Committee will know the opinion of the shareholders.

Representatives of Marcum are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by teleconference.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of Marcum as our independent registered public accounting firm.

PROPOSAL NO. 3
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION(Say-On-Pay)
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires that we provide our stockholders a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. This vote is sometimes referred to as a "say-on-pay vote." Although this advisory vote is nonbinding, the Compensation Committee of our Board will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our named executive officer compensation and related executive compensation programs.
As described in more detail below and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our executive compensation program is comprised principally of salary, equity and performance-based cash compensation, designed to: (i) attract, motivate and retain key executives who are critical to our success, (ii) align the interests of our executives with stockholder value and our financial performance and (iii) achieve a balanced package that would attract and retain highly qualified senior officers and appropriately reflect each such officer's individual performance and contributions. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its compensation program and the overall compensation package paid to each of its senior executives to assess risk and to confirm that the structure is still aligned with the Company's long-term strategic goals.
Before you vote on the resolution below, please read the entire "Executive Compensation" section, including the tables, together with the related narrative disclosure and footnotes of this Proxy Statement as well as the disclosures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Note, as a "smaller reporting company," we are obligated to provide compensation disclosures pursuant to Item 402 (m) through (q) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Security Exchange Act of 1934 ("Regulation S-K"). Even though, as a smaller reporting company, we are exempt from compensation discussion and analysis by the executive compensation requirements of Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K, we continue to elect to provide information regarding our objectives and practices regarding executive compensation in order to give our stockholders transparency into our compensation philosophy and practices.
For the reasons provided, the Board is asking stockholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote FOR the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that stockholders approve the compensation paid to our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to Item 402 (m) through (q) of Regulation S-K (which includes the compensation tables and related narrative discussion)."
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The Board believes that Ms. Xiaoyu Zhang is best situated to serve as Chair person of the Board because of her financial background, business administration ability and leadership skills. In addition, having a single leader eliminates the potential for confusion and provides clear leadership for the Company. We believe that this leadership structure has served the Company well.
Our Board is responsible for oversight of the Company's risk management practices while management is responsible for the day-to-day risk management processes. In the Board's opinion, this division of responsibilities is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company. The Board receives periodic reports from management regarding the most significant risks facing the Company. In addition, the Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of our risk assessment and risk management policies. Our Audit Committee is empowered to appoint and oversee our independent registered public accounting firm, monitor the integrity of our financial reporting processes and systems of internal controls and provide an avenue of communication among our independent auditors, management, our internal auditing department and our Board.
The Board has not named a lead independent director.
Diversity 
The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to Board nominee diversity. However, in recommending proposed nominees to the full Board, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers diversity in the context of the Board as a whole and considers personal characteristics (gender, ethnicity and age), skills and experiences, qualifications and the background of current and prospective directors as important factors in identifying and evaluating potential director nominees, so that the Board, as a whole, will possess what the Board believes are the appropriate skills, talent, expertise and backgrounds necessary to meet the long-term interests of our stockholders and the goals and objectives of the Company.
Director Independence 
Our Board has determined that Mr. Joseph Levinson, Mr. John Levy and Mr. William Kwok Keung Tsui satisfy the criteria for independence under NYSE American and SEC rules for independence of directors and of committee members.
Board Meetings and Committee Meeting; Annual Meeting Attendance 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Board held 3 meetings, not including actions taken by unanimous written consent. In addition, the Audit Committee held 7 meetings; the Governance and Nominating Committee held 1 meeting; and the Compensation Committee held 1 meeting. During the year ended December 31, 2017, each of the directors attended, in person or by telephone, at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served. We encourage our Board members to attend our Annual Meetings, but we do not have a formal policy requiring attendance.
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee currently consists of Joseph Levinson, William Kwok Keung Tsui and John Levy, with Mr. Levinson serving as Chairman. Each of Mr. Levinson, Mr. Tsui, and Mr. Levy is independent under NYSE American listing standards. The Board has determined that Mr. Levinson and Mr. Levy qualify as audit committee financial experts and have the accounting or financial management expertise as required under Section 803(B)(2)(a)(iii) of NYSE American rules. In reaching this determination, the Board made a qualitative assessment of Mr. Levinson's and Mr. Levy's level of knowledge and experience based on a number of factors, including formal education and business experience.
The Audit Committee has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to: (i) the financial reports and other financial information provided by us to the public or any governmental body; (ii) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) our systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting and legal compliance that have been established by management and the Board; and (iv) our auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes generally. In addition, the Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, retention, compensation and oversight of the work of any registered public accounting firm employed by the Company (including resolution of disagreements between management and the accounting firm regarding financial reporting) for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work or performing other audit, review or other services. Any such registered public accounting firm must report directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has the ultimate authority and responsibility to evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services by category, including audit-related services, tax services, and other permitted non-audit services. In accordance with the policy, the Audit Committee regularly reviews and receives updates on specific services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. All services rendered by Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP ("Marcum"), our current independent auditor, to the Company are permissible under applicable laws and regulations. During fiscal year 2017, all services requiring pre-approval and performed by Marcum were approved in advance by the Audit Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policy. The Audit Committee operates under a written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at: http://www.takungart.com/investors/corporate-governance/governance-docs.
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Joseph Levinson, William Kwok Keung Tsui and John Levy, with Mr. Tsui serving as Chairman. Each of Mr. Levinson, Mr. Tsui, and Mr. Levy is independent under NYSE American listing standards. The Compensation Committee is responsible for the administration of all salary, bonus and incentive compensation plans for our officers and key employees. The Compensation Committee reviews and, as it deems appropriate, recommends to the Board policies, practices and procedures relating to the compensation of the officers and other managerial employees and the establishment and administration of employee benefit plans. It advises and consults with the officers of the Company as may be requested regarding managerial personnel policies. The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage independent advisors to assist it in carrying out its duties. During fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee did not engage the services of any independent advisors, experts or other third parties. We believe that the functioning of our Compensation Committee complies with, any applicable requirements of the NYSE American and SEC rules and regulations. The Compensation Committee operates under a written charter, which is available on our website at: http://www.takungart.com/investors/corporate-governance/governance-docs.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation in Compensation Decisions
All members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors. No member of our Compensation Committee is a current or former officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, and no director or executive officer of the Company is a director or executive officer of any other corporation that has a director or executive officer who is also a director of the Company.
Governance and Nominating Committee 
The Governance and Nominating Committee (the "Nominating Committee") currently consists of Joseph Levinson, William Kwok Keung Tsui and John Levy, with Mr. Levy serving as Chairman. Each of Mr. Levinson, Mr. Tsui and Mr. Levy is independent under NYSE American listing standards. The responsibilities of the Nominating Committee include: (i) identifying individuals qualified to serve as directors or fill any acting vacancies; (ii) recommending to the Board the selection of director nominees for each meeting of the stockholders at which directors are elected; (iii) advising the Board with respect to the composition, procedures and committees of the Board; and (iv) considering any other corporate governance issues that may arise from time to time, and developing appropriate recommendations for the Board. In recommending nominees to the Board, the Nominating Committee considers various criteria, including the ability of the individual to meet the NYSE American "independence" requirements, general business experience, general financial experience, knowledge of the Company's industry (including past industry experience), education, and demonstrated character and judgment. The Nominating Committee uses its, as well as the entire Board's, network of contacts when compiling a list of potential director candidates and has the authority to engage outside consultants. The Nominating Committee will consider director nominees recommended by a stockholder if the stockholder mails timely notice to the Secretary of the Company at its principal offices, which notice includes (i) the name, age and business address of such nominee, (ii) the principal occupation of such nominee, (iii) a brief statement as to such nominee's qualifications, (iv) a statement that such nominee consents to his or her nomination and will serve as a director if elected, (v) whether such nominee meets the definition of an "independent" director under the NYSE listing standards and (vi) the name, address, class and number of shares of capital stock of the Company held by the nominating stockholder. Any person nominated by a stockholder for election to the Board will be evaluated based on the same criteria as all other nominees. The Nominating Committee operates under a written charter, which is available on our website at http://www.takungart.com/investors/corporate-governance/governance-docs.
Director Nomination Procedures 
The Nominating Committee is generally responsible for soliciting recommendations for candidates for the Board, developing and reviewing background information for such candidates, and making recommendations to the Board with respect to candidates for directors proposed by stockholders. The nomination process involves a careful examination of the performance and qualifications of each incumbent director and potential nominees before deciding whether such person should be recommended for nomination by the Nominating Committee and nominated by the Board. The Board believes that the business experience of its directors has been, and continues to be, critical to the Company's success. Directors should possess integrity, independence, energy, forthrightness, analytical skills and commitment to devote the necessary time and attention to the Company's affairs. Directors must possess a willingness to challenge and stimulate management and the ability to work as part of a team in an environment of trust.
In selecting candidates for appointment or re-election to the Board, the Nominating Committee considers the following criteria: (i) personal and professional ethics and integrity, including a reputation for integrity and honesty in the business community; (ii) experience as an executive officer of companies or as a senior leader of complex organizations, including scientific, government, financial or technological organizations; (iii) financial knowledge, including an understanding of finance, accounting, the financial reporting process, and company measures for operating and strategic performance; (iv) ability to critically and independently evaluate business issues, contributing a diverse perspectives or viewpoints, and making practical and mature judgments; (v) a genuine interest in the Company, and the ability to spend the time required to make substantial contributions as a director; and (vi) no conflict of interest or legal impediment that would interfere with the duty of loyalty to the Company and its stockholders. In addition, the Nominating Committee reviews the qualifications of the directors to be appointed to serve as members of the Audit Committee to ensure that they meet the financial literacy and sophistication requirements under the NYSE American rules and that at least one of them qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules of the SEC.
The Board will generally consider all relevant factors, including, among others, each nominee's applicable expertise and demonstrated excellence in his or her field, the usefulness of such expertise to the Company, the availability of the nominee to devote sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company, the nominee's reputation for personal integrity and ethics, and the nominee's ability to exercise sound business judgment. Director nominees are reviewed in the context of the existing membership of the Board (including the qualities and skills of the existing directors), the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of its stockholders.
There were no arrangements or understandings between any of our directors and any other person pursuant to which any director was to be selected as a director or selected as a nominee.
Family Relationships 
No family relationships exist among any of our current director nominees or executive officers.
Involvement in Certain Legal Proceedings
To our knowledge, our directors and executive officers were not involved in any legal proceedings as described in Item 401(f) of Regulation S-K in the past ten (10) years, other than Mr. John Levy.

Narrative to Summary Compensation Table 
In fiscal year 2017, the primary components of our executive compensation programs were base salary and equity compensation. We use base salary to fairly and competitively compensate our executives, including the named executive officers, for the jobs we ask them to perform. We view base salary as the most stable component of our executive compensation program, as this amount is not at risk. We believe that the base salaries of our executives should be targeted at or above the median of base salaries for executives in similar positions with similar responsibilities at comparable companies, consistent with our compensation philosophy. We have formed a compensation committee to oversee the compensation of our named executive officers. All the members of the compensation committee are independent directors. The committee has the discretion to review and approve each employee's bonus.

PROCEDURES FOR APPROVAL OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the SEC initial statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership and annual reports concerning their ownership of our common stock and other equity securities, on Form 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by the SEC regulations to furnish our Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file.
Based solely on our review of the copies of such reports received by us and on written representations by our officers and directors regarding their compliance with the applicable reporting requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, we believe that, with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our officers and directors, and all of the persons known to us to own more than 10% of our Common Stock, filed all required reports on a timely basis.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee has furnished the following report on its activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The report is not deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" with the SEC or subject to the SEC's proxy rules or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and the report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any prior or subsequent filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into any such filing. The Audit Committee charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. A copy of the Audit Committee charter is available on our website at http://www.takungart.com/investors/corporate-governance/governance-docs.
The primary function of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight and monitoring of our financial reporting and auditing process. Management has primary responsibility for our financial statements and the overall reporting process, including maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and assessing the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm audits the annual financial statements prepared by management, expresses an opinion as to whether those financial statements fairly present our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and discusses with the Audit Committee any issues they believe should be raised with the Audit Committee. These discussions include a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements. The Audit Committee monitors our processes, relying, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with our management and representatives of Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP ("Marcum"), our independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has discussed Marcum's judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114 (which superseded Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61), other standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), rules of the SEC, and other applicable regulations. The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from Marcum required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the firm's independence from our management and has discussed with Marcum its independence. The members of the Audit Committee considered whether the services provided by Marcum, for the year ended December 31, 2017, are compatible with maintaining its independence. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the authority to approve the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm.
Based upon its reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 for filing with the SEC and the Board approved that recommendation.
