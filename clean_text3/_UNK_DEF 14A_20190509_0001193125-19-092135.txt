PROXY STATEMENT 
Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. 
214 West First Street 
Oswego, New York 13126 
(315) 343-0057 
[BEGIN TABLE]
I.  INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROXY STATEMENT AND THE ANNUAL MEETING  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  DATE, TIME AND PLACE  
[END TABLE]
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors of Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") to be used at our Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting"), which will be held at The Lake Ontario Conference and Events Center, 25 East First Street, Oswego, NY 13126 on May 9, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, and all adjournments of the Annual Meeting. The accompanying notice of Annual Meeting and this proxy statement are first being mailed to shareholders on or about April 9, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  B.  VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF  
[END TABLE]
Holders of record of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, as of the close of business on March 26, 2019, (the "Record Date"), are entitled to one vote for each share they own. As of the Record Date, we had 4,530,644 shares of common stock outstanding. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. If a shareholder holds shares in street name (i.e., the shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank, trust, or other institution) and does not provide voting instructions to the holder of the account for non-discretionary voting items such as the election of directors, such shares will be considered "Broker non-votes." Broker non-votes and proxies marked "abstain" will be counted for purposes of determining that a quorum is present, but will not be considered as votes cast as to the matters to be considered. 
As to the election of directors, shareholders may cast their votes "For" or "Withhold." As to the ratification of our independent registered public-accounting firm, shareholders may cast their votes "For," "Against" or "Abstain." 
Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes, or proxies as to which the authority to vote for the nominees being proposed is withheld. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the total votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy, without regard to broker non-votes or proxies as to which shareholders abstain, is required for ratification of Bonadio & Co., LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (the "Auditors") for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
At our 2015 Annual Meeting, shareholders adopted a resolution approving "Say-on-Pay" and a separate resolution authorizing that future "Say-on-Pay" votes be conducted every three years. Our last "Say-on-Pay" vote was conducted in 2018, so we will not be having a "Say-on-Pay" vote this year. 
In accordance with the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation, record holders of common stock who beneficially own in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock (the "Limit") are not entitled to any vote with respect to the shares held in excess of the Limit ("over the limit Company stock"). Our Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors (i) to make all determinations necessary to implement and apply the Limit, including determining whether persons or entities are acting in concert, and (ii) to demand that any person who is reasonably believed to beneficially own stock in excess of the Limit supply information to us to enable the Board of Directors to implement and apply the Limit. However, pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, our employee stock ownership plan shall not be deemed to beneficially own any "over the limit Company stock" held under such plan.  If you participate in the Pathfinder Bank ("Pathfinder Bank" or the "Bank") Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the "ESOP"), you will receive a voting instruction card so that you may direct the trustee to vote on your behalf under the plan. Under the terms of the ESOP, the ESOP trustee votes all shares held by the ESOP, but each ESOP participant may direct the trustee how to vote the shares of common stock allocated to his or her account. The ESOP trustee, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary responsibilities, will vote all unallocated shares of Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. common stock held by the ESOP and allocated shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same proportion as shares for which it has received timely voting instructions. The deadline for returning your ESOP voting instructions is April 29, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  C.  REVOCATION OF PROXIES  
[END TABLE]
Shareholders who sign the proxies we are soliciting will retain the right to revoke them in the manner described below. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting and all adjournments thereof. Proxies solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors will be voted in accordance with the directions given thereon. Where no instructions are indicated, validly executed proxies will be voted "For" the proposals set forth in this proxy statement or hereafter. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote the shares as directed by a majority of the Board of Directors in attendance at the Annual Meeting. We know of no additional matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
Proxies may be revoked by sending written notice of revocation to our Secretary, at the address shown above, by delivering to us a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. The presence at the Annual Meeting of any shareholder who had returned a proxy will not revoke the proxy unless the shareholder delivers his or her ballot in person at the Annual Meeting or delivers a written revocation to our Secretary prior to the voting of the proxy. If you are a shareholder whose shares are not registered in your name, you will need appropriate documentation from your record holder to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  D.  CONDUCT OF MEETING  
[END TABLE]
In accordance with our bylaws, and by action of the Board of Directors, the Chair of the Board will preside over the Annual Meeting. The Chair of the Board has broad authority to ensure the orderly conduct of the meeting. This includes discretion to recognize shareholders who wish to speak, and the right to determine the extent of discussion on each item of business. Rules governing the conduct of the meeting have been established and will be available at the meeting along with the agenda of the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  E.  ATTENDANCE OF DIRECTORS AT THE ANNUAL MEETING  
[END TABLE]
The Company does not have a policy regarding the attendance of Board members at the Annual Meeting, although all are encouraged to attend. Eight of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  F.  OTHER MATTERS  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors is not aware of any business to come before the Annual Meeting other than the matters described above in this Proxy Statement. However, if any matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that holders of the proxies will act as directed by a majority of the Board of Directors, except for matters related to the conduct of the Annual Meeting, as to which they shall act in accordance with their best judgment. The Board of Directors intends to exercise its discretionary authority to the fullest extent permitted under Maryland Law and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  G.  SMALLER REPORTING COMPANY  
[END TABLE]
The Company has elected to prepare this Proxy Statement and other annual and periodic reports as a "Smaller Reporting Company" consistent with rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
II.  OUR GOVERNANCE AND BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND RISK OVERSIGHT ROLE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
[END TABLE]
Our Board has a separate person serve as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chair of the Board and has functioned in that manner since the year 2000. Mr. Burritt, our Chair, is an independent director as defined by NASDAQ's listing requirements. The Company has spent significant time evaluating its leadership structure and has determined that, under the present circumstances, separating the Chair and CEO positions is appropriate. We believe this separation allows our Board to concentrate on policy and strategy and our CEO the time to concentrate on executing such strategy. Additionally, we believe this structure is most appropriate given the Board's role in monitoring the Company's execution of its business plan and the risk elements associated with such execution. 
The primary risks facing the Bank, as the operating subsidiary of the Company, are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, investment risk, credit risk, risks associated with inadequate allowance for loan losses, cyber security risks, competitive risks and regulatory risks. While the full Board is actively engaged in monitoring all of the noted risks, we have further assigned specific responsibilities to Board Committees for detailed review. The Asset/Liability Committee, with the assistance of professional consultants, monitors interest rate risk, investment risk and liquidity risk. The Executive/Loan Committee, with the assistance of a professional loan review consultant, monitors the credit risks and risks associated with allowance for loan losses. The Technology Steering Committee, with the assistance of professional experts, monitors and responds to cyber risks. In addition, we purchase internet liability and other insurance to protect us against cyber security risks. The Audit/Compliance Committee monitors regulatory risks. Every member of our Board engages in continuing education in an effort to monitor Enterprise Risk Management issues so that they can effectively engage in their oversight role. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  B.  INDEPENDENCE AND DIVERSITY OF DIRECTORS  
[END TABLE]
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market. The Board of Directors has determined that all of its directors, with the exception of Mr. Schneider, are "independent" pursuant to NASDAQ's listing requirements. In evaluating the independence of our independent directors, we considered the following transactions between us and our independent directors that are not required to be disclosed under "Transactions with Certain Related Persons:" 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We paid $13,950 for parking in a garage in downtown Syracuse for our Pike Block Branch owned by Director, John  Funiciello; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The law firm of which our Director William A. Barclay is a partner, was paid for real estate loan closings by  borrowers. We also paid the firm $12,349 for closing services not paid by borrowers.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors has determined that these transactions did not impair the independence of the named directors. Our independent directors hold executive sessions no less than twice a year. 
Although the Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying a director nominee, the Nominating Committee hopes to continue to diversify our Board membership.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  C.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  
[END TABLE]
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of 5% of the Company's common stock are required to file Schedule 13G or Schedule 13D reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regarding such ownership. The following table sets forth, as of the date of the most recent 13G reports, the shares of common stock beneficially owned by each person or entity that was the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock. None of the shares beneficially owned by directors, executive officers or nominees to the board of directors have been pledged as security or collateral for any loans. 
The following table represents the ownership of our Schedule 13G filers:

  D.  SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE  
[END TABLE]
Our common stock is registered with the SEC pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). Our officers and directors and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our common stock ("10% beneficial owners") are required to file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership of the common stock. SEC rules require disclosure in our Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K of the failure of an officer, director or 10% beneficial owner of our common stock to file a Form 3, 4, or 5 on a timely basis. All such forms were filed on time in 2018.

  E.  TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN RELATED PERSONS  
[END TABLE]
There were no transactions or series of transactions since the beginning of the Company's fiscal year or any currently proposed transaction where the Company was or is a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits an issuer from (i) extending or maintaining credit; (ii) arranging for the extension of credit; or (iii) renewing an extension of credit in the form of a personal loan for an officer or director. There are several exceptions to this general prohibition, however, one of which is applicable to us. This prohibition does not apply to loans made by a depository institution that is insured by the FDIC and is subject to the insider lending restrictions of the Federal Reserve Act. Regulations permit executive officers and directors to receive the same loan terms through programs that are widely available to other employees, as long as the executive officer or director is not given preferential treatment compared to the other participating employees. The Bank has made loans to each of the following officers and/or directors or their immediate families: Chris Burritt, James Dowd, John Funiciello, George Joyce, Daniel Phillips, Thomas Schneider, John Sharkey, III, Lloyd Stemple, Calvin Corriders, Walter Rusnak and Ronald Tascarella. 
After one year of service at the Bank, full-time employees and directors are entitled to receive a primary residence mortgage loan at an interest rate of 0.50% below market, consistent with applicable laws and regulations.  The chart below lists the executive officers and directors who participated in the employee mortgage loan program during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and certain information with respect to their loans. No other directors or executive officers participated in the employee mortgage loan program during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The Board of Directors has established a process for shareholders to send communications to a director by either United States mail or electronic mail. Any shareholder who desires to communicate directly with our directors should send their communication to Board of Directors, Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc., 214 West First Street, Oswego, New York 13126 or by email to directors@pathfinderbank.com. The communication should indicate that the author is a shareholder and if shares are not held of record, should include appropriate evidence of stock ownership. Depending on the subject matter, management will: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Forward the communication to the director or directors to whom it is addressed;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attempt to handle the inquiry directly, for example where it is a request for information about us or it is a  stock-related matter; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Not forward the communication if it is primarily commercial in nature, relates to an improper or irrelevant  topic, or is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or otherwise inappropriate.  
[END TABLE]
At each Board meeting, management shall present a summary of all communications received since the last meeting that were not forwarded and make those communications available to the directors.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
III.  MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  
[END TABLE]
The business of the Board of Directors is conducted through meetings and activities of the Board and its committees.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, no director attended fewer than 75 percent of the total meetings of the Board of Directors and committees on which such director served. Much of our work is performed in Committees which is then reported to the full Board. Members in committees are described in the following table:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  NOMINATING/GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating/Governance Committee met three times in the year ended December 31, 2018 to address issues concerning corporate governance, succession planning, and to nominate directors to fulfill the terms of the upcoming year. In the year ended December 31, 2018, the Nominating/Governance Committee was comprised of Directors, Barclay, Burritt, Littlejohn, Sharkey and Stemple, each of whom are "independent" pursuant to the NASDAQ listing requirements. The Nominating/Governance Committee has a charter which is available at our website at http://www.pathfinderbank.com/investor-relations. 
Among other things, the functions of the Nominating/Governance Committee include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to lead the search for individuals qualified to become members of the Board and to select director nominees to be  presented for shareholder approval;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to review and monitor compliance with the requirements for board independence; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• to review the committee structure and make recommendations to the Board regarding committee membership.   
[END TABLE]
The Nominating/Governance Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board of Directors willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are first considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service, or if the Nominating/Governance Committee or the Board decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, or if the size of the Board is increased, the Nominating/Governance Committee would solicit suggestions for director candidates from all Board members. In addition, the Nominating/Governance Committee is authorized by its charter to engage a third party to assist in the identification of director nominees.  The Nominating/Governance Committee would seek to identify a candidate who, at a minimum, satisfies the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has personal and professional ethics and integrity and whose values are compatible with ours;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has had experiences and achievements that have given him or her the ability to exercise and develop good business  judgment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is willing to devote the necessary time to the work of the Board and its committees, which includes being  available for Board and committee meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is familiar with the communities in which we operate and/or is actively engaged in community activities;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is involved in other activities or interests that do not create a conflict with his or her responsibilities to us  and our shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has the capacity and desire to represent the balanced, best interest of our shareholders as a group, and not  primarily a special interest group or constituency; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has had a principal residence for two years on a continuous basis within the following counties in New York  – Oswego, Jefferson, Lewis, Oneida, Onondaga or Cayuga. Our Bylaws provide that this provision may be overridden by two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating/Governance Committee will also take into account whether a candidate satisfies the criteria for "independence" under the NASDAQ corporate governance listing standards and, if a nominee is sought for service on the Audit Committee, the financial and accounting expertise of a candidate, including whether an individual qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert. Diversifying our board membership is also an important consideration. 
The Nominating/Governance Committee will consider candidates for the Board of Directors recommended by shareholders. In order to make a recommendation to the Board of Directors, a shareholder must own no less than 500 shares of the Company. Shareholders who are so qualified may send their recommendations to our Corporate Secretary for forwarding to the Nominating/Governance Committee. In light of the due diligence required to evaluate recommendations, said recommendations for candidates for the 2020 annual meeting must be received by the Nominating/Governance Committee by September 30, 2019. 
Shareholders may submit the names of candidates to be considered in writing to our Corporate Secretary, at 214 West First Street, Oswego, New York 13126. The submission must include the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name and address of the shareholder as it appears on our books, and number of shares of our common stock that  are owned beneficially by such shareholder (if the shareholder is not a holder of record, appropriate evidence of the shareholder's ownership will be required);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the name, address and contact information for the candidate, and the number of shares of our common stock that  are owned by the candidate (if the candidate is not a holder of record, appropriate evidence of the shareholder's ownership should be provided);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement of the candidate's business and educational experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such other information regarding the candidate as would be required to be included in the proxy statement  pursuant to SEC Regulation 14A;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement detailing any relationship between us and the candidate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement detailing any relationship between the candidate and any of our customers, suppliers or competitors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• detailed information about any relationship or understanding between the proposing shareholder and the candidate;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement that the candidate is willing to be considered and willing to serve as a director if nominated and  elected.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating/Governance Committee will consider shareholder recommendations made in accordance with the above similarly to any other nominee proposed by any other source. We have not paid a fee to any third party to identify or evaluate any potential nominees. Moreover, the Nominating/Governance Committee has not received within the last year a recommended nominee from any shareholder.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  B.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Audit Committee consisted of Directors Ayoub, Barclay, Burritt, Littlejohn and Sharkey. The Audit Committee meets on a periodic basis with the internal auditor to review audit programs and the results of audits of specific areas, on regulatory compliance issues, as well as to review information to further their financial literacy skills. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm to review quarterly and annual filings, the results of the annual audit and other related matters. The Chairman of the Audit Committee may meet with the Auditors on quarterly filing issues in lieu of the entire committee. The Audit Committee met five times in 2018. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined in the listing standards of NASDAQ and SEC Rule 10A(m)-3 other than Mr. Barclay, who resigned from the Audit Committee on March 26, 2019 when it was determined that he did not meet the more heightened SEC and NASDAQ rules for Audit Committee independence. Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee which is available on our website at http://www.pathfinderbank.com/investor-relations. 
The Audit Committee maintains an understanding of our key areas of risk and assesses the steps management takes to minimize and manage such risks and: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selects and evaluates the qualifications and performance of the Auditors;  
[END TABLE]

The Audit Committee has established procedures for the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of concerns regarding accounting or auditing matters. 
The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Ayoub qualifies as an Audit Committee financial expert serving on the committee. Mr. Ayoub meets the criteria established by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  D.  ASSET/LIABILITY COMMITTEE (ALCO)  
[END TABLE]
Pathfinder Bank, the operating subsidiary of the Company has an Asset/Liability Committee.

The committee met four times in 2018, each time being assisted by a professional consultant in ALCO matters.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
  E.  EXECUTIVE/LOAN COMMITTEE  
[END TABLE]
Pathfinder Bank's most significant asset is its loan portfolio. The loan portfolio produces most of the bank's revenue but also exposes the bank to credit and interest rate risk. The Executive/Loan Committee is primarily responsible for monitoring this asset. All of the board of directors are members of the committee. The committee meets generally every other week to respond to customer demands. In addition, the Executive Loan Committee has the authority to make some decisions on behalf of the whole Board when expediency is required. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  F.  OTHER COMMITTEES  
[END TABLE]
Pathfinder Bank and the Company have a number of other standing and adhoc committees such as Strategic Planning, Facilities and Technology Steering, etc. Board members are encouraged to, and do, attend various committee meetings even if they are not official members in order to get a broader understanding of bank operations and to give bank management the benefit of their experience. 
IV. COMPENSATION DISCLOSURES 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
[END TABLE]
As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to include a Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") under Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Nevertheless, we do want our shareholders to understand our compensation policies and procedures so we incorporate many, but not all, of the required disclosures of a full CD&A. 
Our Compensation Philosophy. The Company's ability to attract and retain talented employees and executives with skills and experience is essential to providing value to its shareholders. The Company seeks to provide fair and competitive compensation to its employees (including the Named Executive Officers described below) by providing the type and amount of compensation consistent with our peers. We also seek to drive performance through short-term incentive compensation and to align our executives' interest with shareholders with appropriate equity awards. 
Compensation Best Practices. Our compensation program is designed to retain each named executive and align their compensation with short-term and long-term performance. Toward that end, we use the following compensation best practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our cash based bonus payments are tied to both financial and  non-financial performance measures and are subject to a "clawback" policy, providing for the partial or total return of the cash bonus in the event of a restatement of our financial statements which  makes the performance measures no longer valid;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No tax "gross ups" are included in any employment related agreement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our perquisites and personal benefits are limited to those that support a documented business purpose;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our change in control provisions in the Company's employment and other agreements with its Named Executive  Officers provide for payment only upon termination of employment or job diminishment with a change in control (also called "double trigger" event);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We use appropriate peer groups when establishing compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We balance short and long-term incentives.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Program Elements. The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of our consultants when engaged, has incorporated the following elements into the corporate program to meet the documented corporation philosophy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash based salary and employment benefits that are competitive with our peers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash based bonus, directly linking pay to both Company and individual performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An equity plan designed to align the executives' interest with the company's shareholders in achieving  long-term performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A qualified 401(k) plan allowing executives to defer "pre-tax"  earnings toward retirement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Employee Stock Ownership Plan rewarding long-term service to the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A defined contribution supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") rewarding long-term service to  the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive non-qualified deferred compensation plan allowing executives to  defer income for retirement purposes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Insurance programs designed to replace income in the event of sickness, accident or death; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limited perquisites based on demonstrated business purpose.  
[END TABLE]
Role of the Compensation Committee and Consultants. The Committee annually reviews the performance of the CEO and other executive officers and recommends to the Board of Directors changes to base compensation, as well as the amount of any bonus to be awarded. In determining the compensation of an officer, the Committee and the Board of Directors take into account individual performance, performance of the Company and information regarding compensation paid to executives of peer group institutions performing similar duties. The CEO recommends to the Compensation Committee, compensation arrangements for the Executive and Senior Vice Presidents. He does not recommend compensation arrangements for himself or Board members. 
While the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors do not use strict numerical formulas to determine changes in compensation for the CEO, Executive and Senior Vice Presidents, and while they weigh a variety of different factors in their deliberations, both company-wide and individually-based performance objectives are used in determining the compensation of the CEO, Executive and Senior Vice Presidents. Company-wide performance objectives emphasize earnings, profitability, earnings contribution to capital, capital strength, asset quality, and return on equity which are customarily used by similarly-situated financial institutions in measuring performance. Individually-based performance objectives include non-quantitative factors considered by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors such as general management oversight of the Company, the quality of communication with the Board of Directors, the productivity of employees and execution of the Bank's Strategic Plan. Finally, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors considers the standing of the Company with customers and the community, as evidenced by customer and community complaints, compliments and a customer survey completed in 2013. This survey has been supplemented by monthly surveys of new customers. 
Generally, the Company retains a compensation consultant triannually coincident with our "Say-on-Pay" vote. Accordingly, in late 2017, the Compensation Committee retained the services of Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian) as its independent compensation advisor. Meridian's report benchmarked senior executives, including our Named Executive Officers, against the same officers of our peers in the following areas: base salary; annual short-term incentives and long-term incentive compensation. Survey data was also available to supplement the public disclosures of our peers. Among other things, the report concluded: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pathfinder Bank executive base salaries are within market range;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• While Pathfinder Bank annual short-term incentives are on the lower range, total cash compensation is within  market range;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pathfinder Bank cash compensation appears aligned with bank performance; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pathfinder Bank's long-term equity incentives have a longer vesting period than market (by design)   
[END TABLE]

Employment Agreement. The Company and its operating subsidiary, Pathfinder Bank, entered into an employment agreement with Thomas W. Schneider. The agreement has an initial term of three years. Unless notice of non-renewal is provided, the agreement renews annually. The agreement provides for the payment of a base salary, which will be reviewed at least annually, and which may be increased. Under the agreement, the 2019 base salary for Mr. Schneider is $360,000. In addition to the base salary, the agreement provides for, among other things, participation in employee and welfare benefit plans and incentive compensation and bonus plans applicable to senior executive employees, and reimbursement of business expenses.  Mr. Schneider is entitled to severance payments and benefits in the event of termination of employment under specified circumstances. In the event his employment is terminated for reasons other than for cause, disability or retirement, or in the event he resigns during the term of the agreement following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the failure to elect or re-elect or to appoint or re-appoint him to his executive position;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the failure to nominate him to be elected or re-elected as a director of  the Bank or the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material change in his functions, duties, or responsibilities, which change would cause his position to become  one of lesser responsibility, importance or scope;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the Bank, other than liquidations or dissolutions that are  caused by reorganizations that do not affect his status;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 30 miles from its location as of the date of the  agreements or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach of the agreements by the Company or the Bank  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Schneider will be entitled to a severance payment equal to three times the sum of his base salary and the highest rate of bonus awarded to him during the prior three years, payable as a single cash lump sum distribution within 30 days following his date of termination. In addition, the Company or the Bank will continue to provide him with continued life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental coverage for 36 months. 
If he voluntarily resigns from his employment with the Company and the Bank, (without the occurrence of the specified circumstances listed above) the Board will have the discretion to provide severance pay to him, provided, however, that such amount does not exceed three times the average of the executive's three preceding years' base salary, including bonuses, any other cash compensation paid during such years, and the amount of contributions made on behalf of him to any employee benefit plans maintained by the Company or the Bank during such years. 
Upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company or the Bank followed by the Mr. Schneider's termination of employment for any reason, other than for cause, he will be entitled to receive a single cash lump distribution equal to 2.99 times his average base salary over the previous five years, including bonuses, any other cash compensation paid to him during such years, and the amount of contributions made on behalf of him to any employee benefit plans maintained by the Company or the Bank during such years. In addition, the Company or the Bank will continue to provide him with continued life insurance and non-taxable medical and dental coverage for 36 months. In the event payments made to him include an "excess parachute payment," as defined in Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, the payment will be reduced by the minimum dollar amount necessary to avoid this result. Should he become disabled, he would be entitled to receive his base salary for one year, where the payment of base salary will commence within 30 days from the date he is determined to be disabled, and will be payable in equal monthly installments. 
Upon his voluntary resignation from employment (without the occurrence of the specified circumstances listed above) he agrees not to compete with the Company or the Bank for one year following his resignation. 
Change of Control Agreements. The Company and Pathfinder Bank have entered into Change of Control Agreements with James A. Dowd and Ronald Tascarella which provide certain benefits to them should they be "dismissed" from employment within a twelve month period following a change of control of the Company or the Bank. Although "dismissal" does not include a termination for cause or voluntary termination, it does include the executive's resignation as a result of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material change in the executive's functional duties or responsibilities which would cause the  executive's position to become one of lesser responsibility, importance of scope;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a relocation of the executive's principal place of employment by more than 30 miles from its location as of  the date of the agreement, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction in the benefits to the executive as of the date of the agreement.  
[END TABLE]
 In the event of such dismissal, the executive, or his beneficiary should he die subsequent to the dismissal, is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to two times the executive's most recent annual base salary plus bonuses and any other cash compensation paid to the executive within the most recent twelve (12) month period. The executive is also entitled to continued life, medical and dental coverage for a period of twenty four (24) months subsequent to the dismissal, and will become fully vested in any stock option plans, deferred compensation plans, or restricted stock plans in which he participates. 
Defined Contribution Supplemental Retirement Income Agreements. The Bank adopted a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), effective January 1, 2014. The SERP benefits certain key senior executives of the Bank who are selected by the Board to participate, including our Named Executive Officers, Thomas W. Schneider, Ronald Tascarella and James A. Dowd. The SERP is intended to provide a benefit from the Bank upon retirement, death, disability or voluntary or involuntary termination of service (other than "for cause"), subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the SERP obligates the Bank to make a contribution to each executive's account on the last business day of each calendar year. In addition, the Bank may, but is not required to, make additional discretionary contributions to the executive's accounts from time to time. All executives currently participating in the SERP, including the Named Executive Officers, are fully vested in the Bank's contribution to the plan. In the event the executive is terminated involuntarily or resigns for good reason within 24 months following a change in control, the Bank is required to make additional annual contributions the lesser of: (1) three years or (2) the number of years remaining until the executive's benefit age, subject to potential reduction to avoid an excess parachute payment under Code Section 280G. In the event of the executive's death, disability or termination within 24 months after a change in control, the executive's account will be paid in a lump sum to the executive or his beneficiary, as applicable. In the event the executive is entitled to a benefit from the SERP due to retirement or other termination of employment, the benefit will be paid either in a lump sum or in monthly installments for 10 years as detailed in the executive's participant agreement. 
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Pathfinder Bank maintains an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for a select group of management employees, including our Named Executive Officers. A participant in the plan is eligible to defer, on a monthly basis, a percentage of compensation received from the Bank, up to $750. The participant's deferred compensation will be held by the Bank subject to the claims of the Bank's creditors in the event of the Bank's insolvency. 
Upon the earlier of the date on which the participant terminates employment with the Bank or attains his or her benefit age (as designated by the participant upon joining the plan), the participant will be entitled to his or her deferred compensation benefit, which will commence on the date the participant attains his or her elected benefit age and will be payable in monthly installments for 10 years. In the event of a change in control of the Company or the Bank followed by the participant's termination of employment within 36 months thereafter, the participant will receive a deferred compensation benefit calculated as if the participant had made elective deferrals through his or her benefit age. Such benefit will commence on the date the participant attains his or her benefit age and will be payable in monthly installments for 10 years. If the participant dies after commencement of payment of the deferred compensation benefit, the Bank will pay the participant's beneficiary the remaining payments that were due. 
In the event the participant becomes disabled, the participant will be entitled to receive the deferred compensation benefit as of the participant's date of disability. Such benefit will commence within 30 days following the date on which the participant is disabled and will be payable in monthly installments for 10 years. If the participant dies prior to the commencement of payment of the deferred compensation benefit, the participant's beneficiary will be entitled to receive a survivor benefit. 
2010 Stock Option Plan. The Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. 2010 Stock Option Plan (the "2010 Stock Option Plan") was approved at our 2010 Annual Meeting. The 2010 Stock Option Plan authorized the issuance of up to 150,000 shares of common stock pursuant to grants of stock option awards to our senior executive officers and outside directors. The options that were granted vest over 5 years (20% per year for each year of the participant's service), had an exercise price of $9.00, (the market price on the date of the grant) and have an exercise period of 10 years from the date of the grant, June 23, 2011. As a result of the second step conversion of Pathfinder Bancorp, MHC into a fully-converted stock holding company as Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc., both the number of options and the exercise price were adjusted by the exchange ratio of 1.6472. All of the options authorized under this plan have been granted.  2016 Equity Incentive Plan. The Pathfinder Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 Equity Incentive Plan") was approved at our 2016 Annual Meeting. The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan authorized the issuance of up to 263,605 shares of common stock pursuant to grants of stock option awards to our senior executive officers and outside directors. The options that were granted to executives vest over seven years (14.3% per year for each year of the participant's service), had an exercise price of $11.35, (the market price on the date of the grant) and have an exercise period of 10 years from the date of the grant, May 6, 2016. 
The 2016 Equity Incentive Plan also authorized the issuance of 105,442 shares of common stock pursuant to grants of restricted stock units to our senior executive officers and outside directors. The restricted stock units granted to executives vest over seven years (14.3% per year for each year of the participant's service). The following table sets forth information with respect to outstanding equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers under our 2010 Stock Option Plan and 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.

Defined Benefit Plan. Pathfinder Bank maintains a tax-qualified noncontributory defined benefit plan ("Retirement Plan"). The Company "froze" the Retirement Plan effective June 30, 2012 ("Plan Freeze Date"). After the Plan Freeze Date, no employee is permitted to commence or recommence participation in the Plan and no further benefits accrue to any plan participants. Employment service after the Plan Freeze Date does continue to be recognized for vesting purposes, however. Prior to the Plan Freeze Date, all salaried employees age 21 or older who worked for the Bank for at least one year and were credited with 1,000 or more hours of employment during the year were eligible to accrue benefits under the Retirement Plan. 
At the normal retirement age of 65, the Retirement Plan is designed to provide a life annuity. The retirement benefit provided is equal to 1.5% of a participant's average monthly compensation for periods after May 1, 2004, through the plan freeze date described above and 2.0% of the participant's average monthly compensation for credited service prior to May 1, 2004 based on the average of the three consecutive years during the last 10 years of employment which provides the highest monthly average compensation multiplied by the participant's years of credited service (not to exceed 30 years) to the normal retirement date. Retirement benefits also are payable upon retirement due to early and late retirement. Benefits also are paid from the Retirement Plan upon a Participant's disability or death. A reduced benefit is payable upon early retirement at or after age 60. Upon termination of   employment other than as specified above, a participant who was employed by the Bank for a minimum of five years is eligible to receive his or her accrued benefit reduced for early retirement or a deferred retirement benefit commencing on such participant's normal retirement date. Benefits are payable in various annuity forms. On December 31, 2018, the market value of the Retirement Plan trust fund was approximately $14.5 million. The Company made a contribution in the amount of $825,000 to the defined benefit pension plan during the second quarter of 2018. 
Employee Savings Plan. Pathfinder Bank maintains an Employee Savings Plan which is a profit sharing plan with a "cash or deferred" feature that is tax-qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "401(k) Plan"). All employees who have attained age 21 and have completed 90 days of employment during which they worked at least 1,000 hours are eligible to participate. 
Participants may elect to defer a percentage of their compensation each year instead of receiving that amount in cash, in an amount up to 75% of their compensation to the 401(k) Plan, provided that the amount deferred does not exceed $18,500 for 2018. In addition, for participants who are age 50 or older by the end of any taxable year, the participant may elect to defer additional amounts (called "catch-up contributions") to the 401(k) Plan. The "catch-up contributions" may be made regardless of any other limitations on the amount that a participant may defer to the 401(k) Plan. The maximum "catch-up contribution" that a participant can make in 2018 is $6,000. For these purposes, "compensation" includes total compensation (including salary reduction contributions made under the 401(k) Plan or the flexible benefits plan sponsored by the Bank), but does not include compensation in excess of $275,000 for 2018. The Bank generally provides a match of 100% of the first 3% of the participating employees salary, plus 50% of the next 3% of the participating employees salary. All employee contributions and earnings thereon are fully and immediately vested. Employer matching contributions vest at the rate of 20% per year beginning at the end of a participant's first year of service with the Bank until a participant is 100% vested after five years of service. Participants also will vest in employer matching contributions when they reach the normal retirement age of 65 or later, or upon death or disability regardless of years of service. To partially offset the impact on employees due to the Retirement Plan freeze discussed above, the Company, on January 1, 2013, began making a 3% safe harbor contribution to all eligible participants in addition to the match contributions described above. The employer safe harbor contribution is fully vested at all times. 
For the plan year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank made a matching contribution in the amount of $371,000 to the 401(k) Plan. In addition, the Company made a $273,000 safe harbor contribution to the plan in 2018. 
Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Pathfinder Bank maintains an Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"). Employees who are at least 21 years old with at least one year of employment with the Bank are eligible to participate. On April 6, 2011, the ESOP acquired 125,000 shares of common stock to replenish its ability to make stock contributions to participants' accounts. The shares were acquired pursuant to a loan obtained from a third party lender. In connection with the second step conversion and offering, the ESOP purchased an additional 105,442 shares, which equaled 4% of the shares issued in the offering. In connection with such purchase, the ESOP borrowed sufficient funds from the Company to both refinance the remaining outstanding balance on the third-party loan and purchase the additional shares. The Bank makes annual contributions to the ESOP which contributions are used by the ESOP to repay the ESOP loan. 
Benefits under the ESOP become vested in an ESOP participant at the rate of 20% per year, starting upon an employee's completion of one year of credited service, and will be fully vested upon completion of five years of credited service. Participants' interest in their account under the ESOP will also fully vest in the event of termination of service due to their normal retirement, death, disability, or upon a change in control (as defined in the plan). Vested benefits will be payable generally upon the participants' termination of employment with the Bank, and will be paid in the form of common stock, or to the extent participants' accounts contain cash, benefits will be paid in cash. However, participants have the right to elect to receive their benefits entirely in the form of cash or common stock, or a combination of both.

Director fees are reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee for recommendation to the Board of Directors. The committee reviews relevant peer group data similar to that used in the executive compensation review. The Committee believes that an appropriate compensation is critical to attracting, retaining and motivating directors who have the qualities necessary to direct the Company. 
Trustee (Director) Deferred Fee Plan. Pathfinder Bank maintains the Trustee Deferred Fee Plan for members of the Boards of Directors of Pathfinder Bank and the Company. A participant in the plan is eligible to defer, on a monthly basis, up to the lesser of (i) $2,000 or (ii) 100% of the monthly fees the participant would be entitled to receive each month. The participant's deferred fees will be held by the Bank subject to the claims of the Bank's creditors in the event of the Bank's insolvency. 
Upon the earlier of the date on which the participant's services are terminated or the participant attains his or her benefit age (as designated by the participant upon joining the plan), the participant will be entitled his or her deferred compensation benefit, which will commence on the date the participant attains his or her elected benefit age and will be payable in monthly installments for 10 years. In the event of a change in control of the Company or the Bank followed by the participant's termination of services within 36 months thereafter, the participant will receive a deferred compensation benefit calculated as if the participant had made elective deferrals through his or her benefit age. Such benefit will commence on the date the participant attains his or her benefit age and will be payable in monthly installments for 10 years. If the participant dies after commencement of payment of the deferred compensation benefit, the Bank will pay the participant's beneficiary the remaining payments that were due.

V. PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our bylaws presently allow the Company to fix the number of directors. The number is currently fixed at ten directors. Our bylaws provide that the number of directors be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible, and for approximately one third to be elected each year. Directors are generally elected to serve for a three-year period and until their respective successors shall have been elected and qualify. We are nominating the following persons, each for a three-year term: David A. Ayoub, Adam C. Gagas, Melanie Littlejohn and John F. Sharkey, III.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  A.  AUDIT AND RELATED FEES FOR 2018  
[END TABLE]
Our Auditors for 2018 and 2017 were Bonadio & Co., LLP. 
Audit Fees 
Bonadio & Co., LLP billed us a total of $120,904 and $135,528 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, for the audit of our 2018 and 2017 annual consolidated financial statements, review of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, review of consolidated financial statements included in Forms 10-Q, and services normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings, including out-of-pocket expenses. 
Audit-related fees 
Bonadio & Co., LLP billed us a total of $32,340 and $40,426 for 2018 and 2017, respectively, for audit-related fees, which included professional services rendered for the three annual audits of the Company's employee benefit plans. 
Recurring and non-recurring tax services 
Bonadio & Co., LLP billed us a total of $38,525 and $30,550 in 2018 and 2017, respectively, for tax fees which included the preparation of state and federal tax returns, calculation of the quarterly tax estimates, and other tax-related consulting.

Policy On Audit Committee Pre-Approval Of Audit And Non-Audit Services Of The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the Auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year and any pre-approval is detailed as to particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chairman when expedition of services is necessary. The Auditors and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the Auditors in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. All of the non-audit fees incurred in 2018 and 2017 were preapproved pursuant to our policy.  The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services was compatible with maintaining the independence of its Auditors. The Audit Committee concluded that performing such services in 2018 did not affect the auditors' independence in performing their function as independent registered public accounting firm. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
