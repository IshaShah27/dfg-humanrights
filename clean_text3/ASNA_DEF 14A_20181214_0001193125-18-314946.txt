PROXY STATEMENT 
In this proxy statement, the terms "we," "us" and "our" refer to Ascena Retail Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Ascena" or the "Company"), and its consolidated subsidiaries, ANN INC., referred to as "ANN", Tween Brands, Inc., referred to as "Justice", Lane Bryant, Inc., referred to as "Lane Bryant", Maurices Incorporated, referred to as "maurices", The Dress Barn, Inc., referred to as "dressbarn", and Catherines Stores Corporation, referred to as "Catherines". 
GENERAL 
The enclosed proxy is solicited by the board of directors (the "Board") of Ascena for use at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at 3:00 p.m. local time, on Friday, December 14, 2018 at dressbarn's Corporate Headquarters, Stage Street Café, 933 MacArthur Boulevard, Mahwah, New Jersey 07430, and any and all adjournments or postponements thereof. This proxy statement and form of proxy, along with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018, are being made available to our stockholders on or about November 1, 2018. The proxy statement and proxy card are being made available to you because our records indicate that you owned shares of our common stock on October 17, 2018, the record date for the Annual Meeting. 
Our Board is soliciting your proxy to be used at the Annual Meeting. When you sign the proxy card, you appoint two of our directors, Kate Buggeln and Carl Rubin, as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. One or both of these individuals, or a substitute if necessary, will vote your shares at the Annual Meeting as you have instructed them on the proxy card. If you sign and deliver your proxy card, but you do not provide voting instructions, your proxy representative will vote in favor of the three nominees for director (Proposal One), in favor of Proposals Two, Three, Four and Five, and with respect to any other matter that may be presented at the Annual Meeting, in the discretion of the proxy representative. This way, your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you complete, sign and return your proxy card in advance of the Annual Meeting as your plans may change. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE 2018 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 14, 2018 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted rules that allow us to change the way we make our proxy statement and other Annual Meeting materials available to you. On or about November 1, 2018, we will begin mailing a notice, called the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice of Internet Availability"), to our stockholders advising them that our proxy statement, Annual Report on Form 10-K and voting instructions can be accessed via the Internet at https://proxyvote.com. You may then access these materials and vote your shares over the Internet or you may request that a printed copy of the proxy materials be sent to you. You will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request one in the manner set forth in the Notice of Internet Availability. This allows us to conserve natural resources and reduces the cost of printing and distributing the proxy materials, while providing our stockholders with access to the proxy materials in a fast and efficient manner via the Internet. Copies of this proxy statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018 are also available online at https://proxyvote.com.

[END TABLE]
What are the Board's voting recommendations? 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF THE THREE NOMINATED DIRECTORS, FOR THE APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED, FOR THE SAY-ON-PAY PROPOSAL, FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED, AND FOR THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. 
Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the persons referred to as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board or, with respect to any other matter that may be presented at the Annual Meeting for which no recommendation is given, in their own discretion. 
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting? 
Our by-laws require prior notification of a stockholder's intent to request a vote on other matters at the Annual Meeting. The deadline for notification has passed, and we are not aware of any other matters that could be brought before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other business is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, your vote by proxy gives authority to Kate Buggeln and Carl Rubin, the persons referred to as proxy holders on the proxy card (or a substitute, if necessary), to vote your shares on such matters at their discretion. 
Who is entitled to attend the Annual Meeting? 
All stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on October 17, 2018 (the "Record Date"), or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting or any adjournments or postponements thereof. Registration begins at 2:45 p.m. on the date of the Annual Meeting. If you attend, please note that you may be asked to present valid photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. Please note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, through a broker, bank or other nominee), you must obtain a signed and properly executed proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee to vote your shares held in street name at the Annual Meeting, and such proxy, together with a broker statement evidencing your ownership, must be presented at the Annual Meeting. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Subject to the foregoing, all stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to attend and vote at the Annual Meeting or at any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING 
How many votes do I have? 
You have one vote for each share of our common stock that you owned on the Record Date. 
How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Once a share of the Company's common stock is represented for any purpose at the Annual Meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the Annual Meeting and for any adjournment of the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker "non-votes" are counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the transaction of business. A broker "non-vote" occurs when a broker or nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a proposal because the broker or nominee does not have the necessary voting power for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. In order for us to determine that enough votes will be present to hold the Annual Meeting, we urge you to vote in advance by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Assuming a quorum is present, how many votes will be required to approve each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting will elect the three nominees to serve as directors. A "majority of  the votes cast" means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a nominee for director exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" such nominee;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The proposal to approve amendment Number Two of the Ascena Retail Group, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended, will  be approved if the votes cast in favor of the proposal at the Annual Meeting exceed the votes cast in opposition to the proposal;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The say-on-pay proposal will be approved, by  non-binding advisory vote, if the votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast in opposition to the proposal;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The proposal to approve the amendment and restatement of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of  Incorporation, as amended, will be approved if the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting vote in favor of the proposal; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The proposal to ratify the appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm will be approved if the votes  cast in favor of the proposal at the Annual Meeting exceed the votes cast in opposition to the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
A note about broker non-votes: Under NYSE rules, brokers are not permitted to vote uninstructed shares for non-routine matters, which include director elections and executive compensation matters. As a result, if your shares are held by a brokerage firm for you as beneficial owner and you do not instruct your broker how to vote your shares on Proposal One (election of directors), Proposal Two (approval of amendment Number Two to the Ascena Retail Group, Inc. 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended), Proposal Three (the say-on-pay proposal) or Proposal Four (approval of the amendment and restatement of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended), your brokerage firm cannot vote them for you. Please make sure that you provide instructions to your broker regarding Proposals One, Two, Three and Four. The ratification of the appointment of independent accountants is a routine item under NYSE rules. As a result, brokers who do not receive instructions as to how to vote on Proposal Five may vote on that matter in their discretion. 
What is the effect of a "broker non-vote" or abstention on the proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
Abstentions and broker non-votes will be considered as present for quorum purposes, but will have no impact on the vote on Proposal One, Two, Three or Five. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" Proposal Four. 
How many votes may be cast by all stockholders? 
A total of 197,382,906 votes may be cast at the Annual Meeting, consisting of one vote for each share of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date. 
How do I vote? 
You can vote your shares in one of two ways: either by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting by written ballot. If you choose to vote by proxy you may do so via the Internet or by telephone, or by requesting a printed copy of the proxy materials, and signing and returning the proxy card enclosed therein. Each of these procedures is explained below. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, the Board recommends that you vote by proxy so your shares of common stock will be voted as directed by you if you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING 
Because many stockholders cannot attend the Annual Meeting in person, it is necessary that a large number of stockholders be represented by proxy. By following the procedures for voting via the Internet or by telephone, or by requesting a printed copy of the proxy materials and signing and returning the proxy card enclosed therein, you will enable Ms. Buggeln and/or Mr. Rubin, each of whom is named on the proxy card as a "proxy holder," to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner indicated. If you sign and return your proxy card, but do not specify how you want your shares to be voted, they will be voted, in accordance with the Board's recommendation, "FOR" the three director nominees named in Proposal One, in favor of Proposals Two, Three, Four and Five, and with respect to any other matter that may be presented at the Annual Meeting, in the discretion of the proxy holders named in your proxy card. 
Voting via the Internet 
You can vote your shares via the Internet by following the instructions in the Notice of Internet Availability or by accessing www.proxyvote.com and following the instructions contained on that website. The Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate your identity and to allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote via the Internet, you do not need to mail a proxy card. 
Voting by Telephone 
You can vote your shares by telephone by calling the number provided on the voting website (www.proxyvote.com) and on the proxy card. The telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate your identity and to allow you to vote your shares and confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote via the telephone, you do not need to mail a proxy card. 
Voting by Mail 
You can vote by mail by requesting that a printed copy of the proxy materials be sent to your home address. Upon receipt of the materials, you may fill out the proxy card enclosed therein and return it per the instructions on the card. 
May I change or revoke my vote after I submit my proxy? 
Yes. To change your vote previously submitted by proxy, you may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cast a new vote by mailing a new proxy card with a later date or by voting via the Internet or telephone on a later date; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you hold shares in your name, attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you wish to revoke rather than change your vote, written revocation must be received by our Corporate Secretary prior to the Annual Meeting. 
What if I participate in the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan? 
If you are a participant in the Company's 401(k) Savings Plan (the "401(k) plan") and own shares of the Company's common stock in your 401(k) plan account as of the Record Date, you will receive, with respect to the number of shares held for your account under the 401(k) plan as of the Record Date, a proxy card that will serve as a voting instruction to the trustee of the 401(k) plan with respect to shares held for your account. Unless the proxy card is signed and returned, shares held in your account under the 401(k) plan will not be voted. 
How can I attend the Annual Meeting? 
Stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date may attend the Annual Meeting. You may obtain directions to the location of the Annual Meeting by contacting Ascena's Investor Relations Department at (551) 777-6895 or via email at asc-ascenainvestorrelations@ascenaretail.com. 
What happens if the Annual Meeting is postponed or adjourned? 
If the Annual Meeting is postponed or adjourned and no new record date is set, your proxy will remain valid and may be voted when the Annual Meeting is convened or reconvened. You may change or revoke your proxy until it is voted. 
Will your independent registered public accounting firm participate in the Annual Meeting? 
Yes. Our independent registered public accounting firm is Deloitte & Touche LLP. A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and make any statements he or she deem necessary and to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR ANNUAL MEETING 
Are members of the Board required to attend the Annual Meeting? 
Directors are encouraged, but not required, to attend the Annual Meeting. All of the Company's then current directors attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Who will pay the expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of my vote? 
We pay all costs and expenses related to preparation of these proxy materials and solicitation of your vote and all Annual Meeting expenses. None of our directors, officers or employees will be specially compensated for these activities. We reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of our common stock, but we will not pay any compensation for their services. 
Why did I receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability? 
You may receive multiple Notices of Internet Availability if you hold your shares of our common stock in multiple accounts (such as through a brokerage account and an employee benefit plan, such as the 401(k) plan). To ensure all your shares are represented at the Annual Meeting, please vote your shares as instructed in each Notice of Internet Availability you receive. 
If your household is receiving multiple Notices of Internet Availability and you wish to request delivery of a single copy or wish to enroll in electronic (email) delivery of the proxy materials, you may send a written request to Ascena Retail Group, Inc., 933 MacArthur Boulevard, Mahwah, New Jersey 07430, Attention: Investor Relations or via email at asc-ascenainvestorrelations@ascenaretail.com. 
How do I obtain a separate Notice of Internet Availability if I share an address with other stockholders? 
In order to reduce printing and postage costs, only one Notice of Internet Availability is being delivered to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless we received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders sharing that address. If your household has received only one Notice of Internet Availability, we will promptly deliver an additional Notice of Internet Availability to any stockholder (as of the Record Date) who sends a written request to: Ascena Retail Group, Inc., 933 MacArthur Boulevard, Mahwah, New Jersey 07430, Attention: Investor Relations or via email at asc-ascenainvestorrelations@ascenaretail.com. If you wish to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability in the future, you can notify us by mailing a written request to the address above by calling our Investor Relations Department at (551) 777-6895 or via email at asc-ascenainvestorrelations@ascenaretail.com. 
Can I view these proxy materials electronically? 
Yes. You may access the proxy statement and our annual report at https://proxyvote.com. In addition to the fiscal 2018 proxy statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K, you can view all of our other filings with the SEC on our website at the "investors" page at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." 
How can I receive copies of the Company's year-end SEC filings? 
We will furnish without charge to any stockholder who requests, in writing, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, including financial statements and related schedules, for the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018, as filed with the SEC. Any such request should be directed to Ascena Retail Group, Inc., 933 MacArthur Boulevard, Mahwah, New Jersey 07430, Attention: Investor Relations or via email at asc-ascenainvestorrelations@ascenaretail.com. 
How do stockholders submit proposals for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders? 
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and desired to be included in our proxy statement for that meeting must be received by our Corporate Secretary and General Counsel, c/o Ascena Retail Group, Inc., 933 MacArthur Boulevard, Mahwah, New Jersey 07430 by no later than July 4, 2019 in order to be included in such proxy statement. Any such proposal must also meet the other requirements of the rules of the SEC relating to stockholder proposals. Generally, if written notice of any stockholder proposal intended to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and not included in our proxy statement for that meeting, is not delivered to the Corporate Secretary and General Counsel at the above address between July 4, 2019 and August 3, 2019, or if such notice does not contain the information required by Section 7 of Article II of our by-laws, the chair of the meeting may declare that such stockholder proposal be disregarded. 
Can I see a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is available for inspection at the principal office of the Company upon written request to the Company by a stockholder, and at all times during the Annual Meeting at the place of the Annual Meeting. 
PROPOSAL ONE — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides for a classified Board divided into three classes, each with a staggered three-year term of office and each class of directors as nearly equal in number as possible. At the Annual Meeting, three directors are to be elected for three-year terms. On the recommendation of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Steven L. Kirshenbaum, Carrie W. Teffner and Linda Yaccarino, current directors whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting, for election for three-year terms expiring at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Each nominee has indicated that he/she will serve if elected. We do not anticipate that any Board nominee will be unable or unwilling to stand for election, but should any such nominee be unavailable for election for any reason, your proxy, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may be voted with discretionary authority in connection with the nomination by the Board and the election of any substitute nominee. On July 12, 2018, Mr. Randy L. Pearce notified the Company of his intention to retire from the Board with an effective date on or about October 4, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Board appointed Carrie W. Teffner to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Pearce's retirement, as a member of the class of directors whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting. 
The charts below provide summary information about the composition of our Board, followed by the biographies of the director nominees and our current Board members. Please see the section below entitled "Questions and Answers About our Board and Corporate Governance Matters" for additional information about our Board and the committees of the Board. 
BOARD COMPOSITION (as of November 1, 2018) 
Gender Diversity: 
Gender 
Through its unique portfolio of fashion brands, at Ascena we provide all women and girls with fashion and inspiration for living confidently every day. We are honored that more than half of our Board is comprised of women, and by the recent appointment of Kate Buggeln as our Lead Independent Director. According to the U.S. Board Study (Board Diversity Review) published by Institutional Shareholder Services ("ISS") in April 2018, the number of women in leadership positions – board chairs, lead directors, or committee chairs – remains very low. 
Board Refreshment: 
Age Board Tenure in Years 
The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board also believe that it is important for the Board to be "refreshed" by adding new directors with fresh perspectives from time to time. In that regard, since 2015 we have added nine new directors, resulting in an average director tenure of less than five years, with an average director age of 56. 
PROPOSAL ONE — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF THE NOMINEES LISTED BELOW TO SERVE AS DIRECTORS.

Compensation and Stock Incentive Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During fiscal 2018, Carl Rubin, Randy L. Pearce, Marc Lasry and Linda Yaccarino served as members of our Compensation and Stock Incentive Committee (referred to as our "Compensation Committee"). No member of the Compensation Committee was an officer or employee of the Company during fiscal 2018 or was formerly an officer or employee of the Company. No executive officer of the Company served during fiscal 2018 as a director or member of a compensation committee of any entity at which any of its executive officers served on the Board or the Compensation Committee of the Company. Late in calendar 2017, Mr. Lasry stepped-down as a member of the Compensation Committee, but continues to serve as a member of the Board. Additionally, as noted above, on July 12, 2018, Mr. Randy L. Pearce notified the Company of his intention to retire from the Board with an effective date on or about October 4, 2018. On October 4, 2018, the Board appointed Carrie W. Teffner to fill the vacancy created by Mr. Pearce's retirement, as a member of the class of directors whose terms of office expire at the Annual Meeting. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
What is the makeup of the Board and how often are members elected? 
Our Board currently has eleven members, divided into three classes, each with a staggered three-year term of office. Three directors, Steven L. Kirshenbaum, Carrie W. Teffner and Linda Yaccarino, whose terms are expiring as of the date of the Annual Meeting, shall stand for election this year. 
How often did the Board meet in fiscal 2018? 
The Board met four times during fiscal 2018 and otherwise accomplished its business through the work of the committees described below. During fiscal 2018, each incumbent director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the standing committees of which he or she was a member during his or her tenure. 
Do the non-management directors meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions? 
Yes. The non-management members of our Board meet in regularly scheduled executive sessions without any members of management present. 
Does the Company have any formal policies or requirements concerning Board Leadership? 
We do not have a formal policy regarding the separation of our Chairman of the Board ("Chairman") and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") positions. Following Elliot S. Jaffe's retirement as Non-Executive Chairman, member of the Board and as an officer of the Company, on December 8, 2016 the Board appointed David Jaffe, our Chief Executive Officer, as Chairman. We believe this leadership structure benefits our Company, as a combined Chairman/CEO role helps provide strong, unified leadership for our management team and Board. 
The Company also believes that strong, independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance. In March 2015, the Board appointed Mr. Pearce to serve as the Company's Lead Independent Director. In light of Mr. Pearce's retirement as a member of the Board, on September 28, 2018 Ms. Buggeln was appointed to serve as the Company's Lead Independent Director. As specified in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consult with the Chairman as to an appropriate schedule of Board meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• consult with the Chairman regarding and approve the information, agenda and schedules of the meetings of the Board;

• chair the meetings of the Board when the Chairman is not present;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommend to the Board the retention of advisors and consultants who report directly to the Board; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• respond to questions and comments from major stockholders that are directed to the Lead Independent Director or to the  independent directors as a group, with such consultation with the Chairman and other directors, as may be appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that a single leader serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with a Lead Independent Director, is the best governance model for our Company and our stockholders at this time. 
How does the Board determine which directors are independent? 
Our Board determines whether an individual director satisfies all of the independence standards of the SEC and the Nasdaq Global Select Market, as such standards may be amended from time to time, and also that the director has no material relationship with us (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of any entity) that would be inconsistent with a finding of independence. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Which directors have been designated as independent? 
The Board affirmatively determined that Katie J. Bayne, Kate Buggeln, Marc Lasry, Randy L. Pearce, Carl Rubin, Stacey Rauch, Carrie W. Teffner, John L. Welborn, Jr. and Linda Yaccarino are "independent," as defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
What are the standing committees of the Board? 
Our Board has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee.

Are all of the members of the standing committees independent? 
Yes. The Board has determined that the members of each of the standing committees are independent pursuant to applicable SEC and Nasdaq Stock Market rules. 
Do all of the standing committees operate under a written charter? 
Yes. The charters of each of the standing committees are posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." 
What are the functions of the standing committees? 
Audit Committee 
It is the responsibility of the Audit Committee to assist the Board in its oversight of our financial accounting and reporting practices. The duties of the Audit Committee include: (i) monitoring our financial reporting process and system of internal controls; (ii) selecting our independent registered public accounting firm; (iii) monitoring the independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditing function; and (iv) providing an avenue of communication among the independent registered public accounting firm, management, the internal auditing functions and the Board. The Audit Committee has the authority to conduct any investigation appropriate to fulfilling its 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
 responsibilities, and it has direct access to our independent registered public accounting firm as well as our internal auditors. The Audit Committee has the ability to retain, at our expense, special legal, accounting or other consultants or experts it deems necessary in the performance of its duties. The Audit Committee also prepared the Audit Committee Report for inclusion in the proxy statement. See "Audit Committee Report." The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are "independent," as required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market and meet the "financial sophistication" requirement within the meanings of The Nasdaq Stock Market rules, and has also determined that Ms. Teffner qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee 
The function of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee is to assist the Board by (i) identifying qualified individuals to become Board members, and recommending for selection by the Board the director nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of the Company's stockholders, (ii) recommending the composition of the Board and its committees, (iii) reviewing and recommending changes to the Board, as may be required, with respect to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the corporate governance policies and practices of the Company, (iv) leading the Board in its annual review of the Board's performance, (v) reviewing the succession planning recommendations for certain of the Company's senior officers, and (vi) advising the Board regarding diversity and inclusion matters. 
The responsibilities and duties of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee also include advising the Board with respect to the charters, structure and operations of the various committees of the Board and qualifications for membership thereon, including any independence standards for committee membership. The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee also makes recommendations to the Board regarding which directors should serve on the various committees of the Board. 
The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating director candidates. Candidates may come to the attention of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee through current directors, members of management, stockholders or other persons. From time to time, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee may also engage a search firm to assist in identifying potential Board candidates, although no such firm was used to identify any of the director nominees proposed for election at the Annual Meeting. Once the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee has identified a prospective nominee, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the prospective nominee against the standards and qualifications set out in the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee's charter and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, including the individual's potential contributions in providing advice and guidance to the Board and management. The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee seeks to identify nominees who possess a wide range of experience, skills, areas of expertise, knowledge and business judgment. The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all candidates for director, regardless of the person or firm recommending such candidate. In considering director nominees to stand for election or to fill any vacancy, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board take into account, in addition to such other factors as they deem relevant, such factors as the desirability of selecting directors who are accomplished in their respective fields, with superior credentials and reputation, are believed to have (i) relevant expertise and experience upon the basis of which such person could offer advice and guidance to management and (ii) sufficient time available to devote to the affairs of the Company, are believed to be able to work with the other members of the Board, are believed to be able to represent the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders as a whole, and are selected with a view to the Board being diverse and representing a range of backgrounds and experience. The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board also consider all applicable legal and regulatory requirements, as well as any requirements under the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, and by-laws that govern the composition of the Board as from time to time in effect. 
The Board, with the advice and recommendation of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee, determines the total number of directors and selects nominees with a view to maintaining a Board that is strong in its collective knowledge and has a diversity of not only skills and experience, but also diversity in gender, culture and geography. The Board and Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee assess the effectiveness of the Company's diversity policies by reviewing the nominees for director to determine if such nominees satisfy the Company's then-current needs. 
The Board, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee and the Company are committed to diversity and inclusion and recognize the benefits diversity and inclusion can contribute to achieving the Company's goals. Accordingly, the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for advising the Board regarding diversity and inclusion matters in an effort to promote, foster and nurture a diverse and inclusive workforce, culture and provision of services at the Company. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, a copy of which is posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in carrying out the Corporate Governance Guidelines, monitors the compliance by the Board and its committees with the Corporate Governance Guidelines, and, from time to time as it deems appropriate, reviews and reassesses the adequacy of the Corporate Governance Guidelines and recommends any proposed revisions to the Corporate Governance Guidelines to the Board for approval. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address topics such as (i) Board size, (ii) Board meetings and agendas, (iii) committees, (iv) Board leadership structure, (v) lead independent director, (vi) executive sessions of independent directors, (vii) director qualifications and attributes, (viii) director independence, (ix) director selection, (x) majority approval vote in uncontested director elections, (xi) director orientation, (xii) director access to officers and employees, (xiii) director responsibilities, (xiv) changes in directors' principal occupation, position or responsibility, (xv) outside directorships, (xvi) stockholder communications with the Board, (xvii) consideration of director candidates nominated by stockholders, (xviii) director compensation, (xix) restrictions on hedging and pledging transactions, (xx) annual evaluation of the Company's chief executive officer and succession planning, and (xxi) annual evaluation of the Board. 
Compensation Committee 
The function of the Compensation Committee is to assist the Board by: (i) evaluating and determining all matters relating to the compensation (including base salary, incentive compensation and equity-based awards) of our Chairman and CEO, our other executive officers (including the named executive officers) and certain other key executives and employees; (ii) administering and functioning as the committee that is authorized to grant stock options, restricted stock and/or restricted stock units ("RSUs") and other equity-based and incentive awards to executive officers and such other key executives and employees as the Compensation Committee shall determine under our stock and cash incentive plans, including the Company's 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Omnibus Incentive Plan") and as the committee authorized to grant awards under other incentive plans applicable to the executive officers of the Company as in effect from time to time; and (iii) reviewing and reporting to the Board on such other matters as may be appropriately delegated by the Board for the Compensation Committee's consideration. 
The Compensation Committee has sole authority to retain and obtain the advice of compensation consultants, outside legal counsel and other advisers, each referred to herein as an "Adviser," to assist it with the execution of its duties and responsibilities. The Compensation Committee has the authority to set the compensation and other terms and conditions and oversee the work of the Advisers, to receive appropriate funding from the Company for the payment of compensation to the Advisers and to terminate the services of an Adviser. In selecting Advisers, the Committee will take into account factors it considers appropriate or as may be required by law, regulation or under the Nasdaq listing standards. 
In fiscal 2018, following an extensive search process, the Compensation Committee selected and engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("SBCG") as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. In selecting SBCG, the Compensation Committee considered the independence standards prescribed by the SEC and Nasdaq, and concluded that SBCG was independent and that its work would not raise any conflict of interest. Previously, and through three quarters of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Radford Consulting, a separate business unit of Aon Consulting and a separate division of Aon Hewitt Corporation ("Radford"), as its independent compensation consultant. However, this engagement was discontinued when the Compensation Committee retained SBCG. 
Between 2010 and the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Radford met regularly with the Compensation Committee and provided it with advice regarding the design and implementation of our executive compensation program. Radford's support during fiscal 2018 included a number of topics, including pay levels and design as well as our ongoing alignment with our compensation philosophy. Management did not specifically recommend Radford, and Radford and its affiliates did not provide any services other than executive compensation consulting services to the Company. The Compensation Committee determined that Radford did not have any conflict of interest in its dealings with the Compensation Committee (or the Company). The Compensation Committee made this determination, in part, by reviewing and considering the factors set out by the applicable SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards addressing compensation advisor conflicts of interest. 
In providing its services to the Compensation Committee, with the Compensation Committee's knowledge, Radford contacted the Company's management from time to time to obtain data and other information from the Company and worked together with management and its advisor in the development of proposals and alternatives for the Compensation Committee to review and consider. 
The Compensation Committee expects to regularly evaluate the nature and scope of the services provided by SBCG. In order to ensure that SBCG is independent, SBCG is only engaged by, takes direction from, and reports to the Compensation Committee and, accordingly, only the Compensation Committee has the right to terminate or replace SBCG at any time. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
In fiscal 2018, following an extensive search, management retained Willis Towers Watson ("WTW") to replace Korn Ferry Hay Group, Inc. ("Hay Group") as their compensation consultant. Hay Group and its affiliates did not provide services other than compensation consulting services to the Company. Hay Group participated in Compensation Committee meetings during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 and provided retail executive compensation knowledge and expertise and participated in discussions regarding executive compensation, the peer group selection process and executive compensation trends, among other activities. Management expects WTW to provide services similar to those provided by Hay Group. The Compensation Committee has determined that neither WTW nor Hay Group have any conflict of interest in their dealings with management, the Compensation Committee or the Company. This determination was made, in part, by reviewing and considering the factors set out by the applicable SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards addressing compensation advisor conflicts of interest. In connection with the retention of WTW, the engagement of the Hay Group was discontinued. 
How many times did each standing committee meet in fiscal 2018? 
During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee met eight times, the Compensation Committee met seven times and the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee met five times. 
What is the Board's role in the risk oversight process? 
It is management's responsibility to manage risk and bring to the Board's attention risks that are material to the Company. The Board exercises its oversight of the Company's risks through regular reports to the Board from David Jaffe, in his role as Chairman and CEO, and other members of senior management on areas of material risk, actions and strategies to mitigate those risks and the effectiveness of those actions and strategies. The Board also administers its risk oversight function through its Audit and Compensation Committees. 
The Audit Committee discusses with management the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control those risks. Members of senior management with responsibility for oversight of particular risks report to the Audit Committee periodically throughout the year. The Company's chief internal audit executive annually prepares a comprehensive risk assessment report which identifies the material business risks (including strategic, operational, financial reporting and compliance risks) for the Company as a whole, as well as for each business unit, and identifies the controls that address and mitigate those risks. The chief internal audit executive reviews that report with the Audit Committee each year. The Audit Committee reports to the full Board annually, or more frequently as required, on its review of the Company's risk management. 
The Compensation Committee establishes our executive compensation programs in a balanced and diversified manner while also creating significant, yet appropriate, incentives for strong performance based on our business and strategic plan. In most cases, each component of our performance-based compensation program is subject to a limit on the cash paid or the number of shares delivered. We believe that our compensation programs reflect a balance of short-term, long-term, guaranteed and performance-based compensation in order not to encourage excessive risk-taking. A significant portion of our compensation program includes performance-based compensation with multi-year performance targets and vesting. We believe that this helps to ensure that our NEOs and other employees focus on the health of our business and the success of broad performance metrics that will deliver stockholder value over time and discourages excess risk-taking by our NEOs and other employees. The Compensation Committee also evaluates on a regular basis our overall mix of equity-based incentive awards relative to cash-based incentive awards to align our executives' incentives with stockholder interests and long-term value. 
How does the Board evaluate director candidates recommended by stockholders? 
The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee does not evaluate stockholder nominees differently than any other nominee. Pursuant to policies set forth in our Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholder nominations for directors if we receive timely written notice, in proper form, of the intent to make a nomination at a meeting of stockholders. To be timely for the 2019 Annual Meeting, the notice must be received within the time frame discussed above under the heading "How do stockholders submit proposals for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders?" To be in proper form, the notice must, among other things, include each nominee's written consent to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected, the number of shares held of record and beneficially owned by the nominee, and any other information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for the election of directors, or is otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT OUR BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
How are directors compensated? 
General Philosophy 
For fiscal 2018, total compensation for our non-employee Board members was within a competitive range of the peer group median. The peer group is identified under "Peer Group" in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Directors are provided an annual cash retainer, committee fees, and an annual equity retainer. 
The Board, in consultation with the Company's compensation consultant, analyzes the Company's Board compensation in comparison to its peer group, and determines on an annual basis whether to adjust Board compensation. No changes were made to the structure or design of the Company's Board compensation for fiscal 2018. 
David Jaffe, our Chairman and CEO, does not receive any additional cash or equity compensation for his service as a director. Compensation paid to Mr. Jaffe for his service as an executive officer during fiscal 2018 is reflected in the Summary Compensation Table in the Compensation and Discussion Analysis.

Equity Compensation 
The Company generally makes equity grants of RSUs on an annual cycle in September, which vest on the one-year anniversary of the grant date. We generally provide an annual equity retainer of $130,000 for service on our Board; however, in fiscal 2018, the value of RSU awards to directors were reduced by 30% to align with actions taken for certain of our NEOs who also received a 30% reduction to their LTI awards (as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below). The following RSU grants were made to our non-employee directors in fiscal 2018:

Are directors and executive officers required to own a minimum amount of the Company shares of common stock? 
Our Board believes it is important that our non-employee directors and executive officers have, and are recognized both internally and externally as having, long-term financial interests that are aligned with those of our stockholders. In fiscal 2012, pursuant to the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for our CEO and non-employee directors (the "Ownership 
FISCAL 2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE 
 Guidelines"). In June 2016, the Ownership Guidelines were amended and restated to, among other things, expand the group of persons subject to the Ownership Guidelines to include all members of our leadership team, including each of the Company's executive officers and presidents of each of the Company's brands. The Ownership Guidelines with respect to our CEO became effective in September 2011, with respect to our non-employee directors, became effective on December 7, 2011, and with respect to all such other members of Company leadership, became effective on June 2, 2016. See "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers" below for a discussion of the Ownership Guidelines as amended and restated, with regard to our CEO and all such other members of Company leadership. 
Under the Ownership Guidelines, non-employee directors are required to hold (determined annually as of the last day of the prior fiscal year) three times their annual cash retainer (currently $80,000 per annum, for a total of $240,000). 
The Ownership Guidelines authorize a transition period for non-employee directors to achieve the three-time ownership level of five years from the later of December 7, 2011 and the date the director commences service on our Board. As of August 4, 2018, Ms. Bayne, Ms. Buggeln, Mr. Kirshenbaum and Ms. Krill satisfied the Ownership Guidelines. The remaining non-employee directors are still within the transition period to satisfy the Ownership Guidelines. 
Ownership includes: (i) shares of our stock acquired on the open market or purchased through the exercise of stock options or settlement of any other type of equity award (such as restricted stock, RSUs, deferred stock or a deferred stock unit); (ii) vested equity awards (other than stock options or stock appreciation awards); (iii) vested shares of our stock allocated under any tax-qualified plan (although non-employee directors may not participate in the 401(k) plans, if a director previously was an employee and participated in the plan, such shares would count as "owned"); and (iv) unvested RSUs (but excluding unvested performance-based equity awards). Shares held individually or jointly or by a "family member" (as defined in the securities laws which would include certain trusts, family partnerships and foundations) would count as "owned" by the non-employee director. Stock option awards do not count towards the stock ownership requirement. The Ownership Guidelines, as amended and restated, are posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." 
Does the Company maintain Indemnification Agreements with the members of the Board and Executive Officers? 
Yes, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements (collectively, the "Indemnification Agreements") with each of the members of the Board. Ascena also entered into Indemnification Agreements with Brian Lynch, President and Chief Operating Officer, Gary Muto, President and Chief Executive Officer, ascena Brands, Robb Giammatteo, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and John Pershing, Executive Vice President, Chief Human Resources Officer. The Indemnification Agreements supplement the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the Company's by-laws and Delaware law in providing certain indemnification rights to these individuals. The Indemnification Agreements provide, among other things, that we will indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law and to any greater extent that Delaware law may in the future permit, including the advancement of attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, legislative or investigative nature, relating to any occurrence or event before or after the date of the Indemnification Agreements, by reason of the fact that such individuals are or were our directors or officers, subject to certain exclusions and procedures set forth in the Indemnification Agreements. 
Do you have a written Code of Ethics? 
Yes, our "Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers" is posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." This code of ethics complies with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 pertaining to codes of ethics for chief executives and senior financial and accounting officers. If we amend or waive a provision of our "Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers" that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, we will post such information at this location on our website. A copy of the code of ethics will be provided to any stockholder upon request. 
Do you have a Whistleblower Policy? 
Yes, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have established a confidential hotline for employees to call with any information regarding concerns about accounting or auditing matters. All calls are referred to the Chair of the Audit Committee. Our "Whistleblower Policy" is posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu."

You may contact any member of the Board by writing to our Board at: 
Ascena's Board of Directors c/o Chair of the Audit Committee

To the extent reasonably practical under the circumstances, all such communications are treated confidentially and you can remain anonymous when communicating your concerns. 
When does your fiscal year end? 
Historically, our fiscal years have ended on the last Saturday in July. However, in June 2018, the Board approved a change in the Company's fiscal 2018 year end to August 4, 2018, and for each year thereafter, to the Saturday closest to July 31. References in this proxy statement to a "fiscal year" are to the calendar year in which the fiscal year ends. For example, the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018 is referred to as "fiscal 2018" and the fiscal year ended August 3, 2019 is referred to as "fiscal 2019."

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Fiscal 2018 Company Performance and Transformation Initiatives 
On August 1, 2017 and effective for fiscal 2018, the Company announced changes to its leadership structure which included the expansion of the role of Brian Lynch as the Company's President and COO, and the promotion of Gary Muto to a newly created role of President and Chief Executive Officer of ascena Brands. In connection with these changes, David Jaffe continued in his role as the Company's Chairman and CEO, though he no longer serves as President. The current leadership structure is intended to build upon the successes of the "Change for Growth" program in the past two fiscal years by positioning our leadership team to develop and execute strategic and operational initiatives in a changing business environment. 
Fiscal 2018 represented another challenging year for the retail industry. We, along with many of our peers, were impacted by declining store traffic and an increasingly promotional selling environment. Key operating results in fiscal 2018 included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net sales decreased by 1.1%; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating income improved to $39.7 million compared to an operating loss of $1.3 billion for fiscal 2017 which was  primarily attributed to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets.  
[END TABLE]
Despite these challenges facing the Company and our industry, we have made great strides implementing our "Change for Growth" program over the last two fiscal years. The Change for Growth program is a substantial transformation initiative with the objective of supporting sustainable long-term growth and increasing stockholder value. In connection with the Change for Growth program, we have: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Implemented a number of initiatives to reduce our overhead costs, by transitioning certain functions to an independent  third-party managed-service provider;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued a review of our store fleet with the goal of reducing the number of underperforming stores (through either rent  reductions or store closures), in an effort to increase the overall profitability of the remaining store footprint and convert sales from these stores into direct channel sales or to nearby store locations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Begun to develop new capabilities such as markdown optimization, size pack optimization and localized inventory planning;  and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhanced our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions.  
[END TABLE]
From these activities, we realized approximately $135 million in cost savings during fiscal 2018 and expect to realize a total of approximately $300 million in cost savings through fiscal 2020. 
Also in fiscal 2018, we invested $186 million in capital expenditures, which included spending for non-routine capital investments such as our omnichannel platform and initiatives identified as part of the Change for Growth program to improve operational efficiencies and enhance our customer-facing capabilities, as well as routine spending in connection with our digital initiatives, digital infrastructure improvement, and our retail store network. Together, these investments will allow our brands to (i) provide customers a seamless experience in-store and online, (ii) integrate our marketing efforts to increase in-store and online traffic, (iii) improve product availability and fulfillment efficiency, and (iv) enhance our capability to analyze transaction data to support strategic decisions. 
Lastly, during fiscal 2018, we completed the expansion of our Riverside, California distribution facility to now include direct channel, as well as brick-and-mortar distribution. 
We believe that ongoing challenges in the retail industry underscore the importance for the Company to continue to execute against these strategic growth initiatives, and our executive team is committed to the ongoing success of our business transformation. 
Key Fiscal 2018 Executive Compensation Outcomes 
We believe the executive compensation-related decisions made for fiscal 2018, and the associated outcomes of our programs highlight our ongoing focus on aligning our executives' interests and pay opportunities with those of our stockholders. In fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the second year in a row, our CEO, CFO, and CHRO did not receive increases to their base salaries. Increases were  provided to our President and COO in recognition of the increased scope of his role and responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our NEOs did not receive a seasonal cash incentive payout during the fall 2018 season. We had a stronger spring 2018 season,  in which operating performance was achieved between threshold and target goals previously established by the Compensation Committee. As a result, our NEOs received a 51.6% payout for the spring 2018 season;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee reduced the target value of long-term incentive awards to Messrs. Jaffe, Giammatteo, and Pershing  by 30% in fiscal 2018 to better align pay opportunities with recent Company performance and to conserve shares. As such, three of our NEOs, including our CEO, were granted only 70% of their typical long-term incentive award target (Messrs. Lynch and  Muto did not receive reduced LTI awards in fiscal 2018 given their recent promotions as described above). This resulted in a fiscal 2018 target pay opportunity for our CEO that is positioned below the  25th percentile of our peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive opportunities in fiscal 2018 were granted in the form of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-based LTIP which vests after 3 years based on our Net Income and relative Total Stockholder Return performance  (60% of "steady-state" target weighting; 86% of actual awards for fiscal 2018) and encourages growth to fund our business and increase stockholder returns; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Time-vesting stock options which vest over a 2-year period (20% of  "steady-state" weighting; 14% of actual annual awards to all NEOs in fiscal 2018) and encourages a long-term focus on value creation given their 7-year exercise term;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In conjunction with the 30% reduction in long-term incentive opportunities for certain NEOs in fiscal 2018, time-based  restricted stock units were not granted to any of our NEOs during the annual grant cycle to further the link between long-term pay opportunities and stockholder value creation (time-based restricted stock units otherwise represent 20% of the  "steady-state" weighting); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The first measurement period of the Transformation Bonus, which was granted to our NEOs (other than our CEO) in March 2017  in connection with our Change for Growth program, was triggered at the end of fiscal 2018. The delivered cost savings performance would have resulted in fiscal 2018 payouts equal to 1.56x each participant's salary (as in effect in March 2017).  However, the final earned payout multiples were reduced by half to 0.78x since the Company did not achieve its threshold annual Operating Income level under the seasonal incentive compensation ("IC") plan for fiscal 2018 (per the terms of  the Transformation Bonus program).

COMPENSATION PROGRAM OBJECTIVES AND PHILOSOPHY 
We design our executive compensation program to attract and retain highly skilled, performance-oriented executives. In doing so, we structure incentives to motivate strong financial performance and align with stockholder interests. The following core principles guide the achievement of our stated objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
With respect to the total direct compensation paid to our NEOs, the Compensation Committee, with the recommendations and advice of its independent compensation consultant, utilizes and reviews data from peer companies and survey data provided by Hay Group, Mercer and Equilar for the purposes of analyzing the pay positioning of key roles within the organization. Industry-based compensation studies and data inform our general understanding of current compensation practices and serve as one input into our compensation decision-making process. Additional points of reference for the Compensation Committee include: a role's scope of responsibilities, the criticality of an individual to the organization, and an individual's potential to influence and drive future business results. 
KEY FEATURES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
The Compensation Committee reviews on an ongoing basis our executive compensation and benefits programs to evaluate whether these programs support the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives and serve the interests of our stockholders. The Company's practices include the following, each of which the Compensation Committee believes reinforces our executive compensation philosophy and objectives:

Our compensation program includes significant performance-based elements which creates a meaningful incentive for outstanding performance and serves as an effective retention tool. Our annual executive compensation program generally consists of the following elements:

FISCAL 2018 PAY MIX & PERFORMANCE FOCUS 
The following features of our compensation program for executive officers underscore our performance-based compensation philosophy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓    100% of seasonal IC under our fiscal 2018 Annual Cash Incentive Plan was tied to performance against pre-established, seasonal operating income goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓    86% of the actual fiscal 2018 long-term incentive grants to our NEOs were in the form of a three-year performance award  (LTIP) with payout contingent on achieving pre-established net income and relative TSR goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓    Nonqualified stock option awards comprised 14% of the fiscal 2018 LTI grants to our NEOs. NEOs only realize  value from options to the extent that our share price increases above the exercise price.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓    Approximately 86% of our CEOs total target compensation was tied to the achievement of corporate performance  objectives and share price performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓    We did not grant time-based restricted stock units to our NEOs as part of our ongoing pay program in fiscal 2018.   
[END TABLE]
We allocate compensation between short-term and long-term components and between cash and equity in order to maximize executive performance and retention. Long-term compensation and equity awards comprise an increasingly larger proportion of total compensation for our executives as position level increases based on our belief that these elements of compensation more closely align management's interests with our financial performance and with our stockholders' interests. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
For fiscal year 2018, the targeted mix of base salary, annual cash incentive bonuses, and long-term incentives for our Chairman and CEO and other NEOs as a group (on average) was: 
CEO 
Other NEOs 
OPPORTUNITY FOR STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK 
Each year the compensation of our NEOs, as disclosed in our annual proxy statement, is submitted to our stockholders for a non-binding advisory vote (commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal). In response to a significant decline in stockholder support for our say-on-pay vote at our 2015 annual meeting, we initiated significant stockholder outreach in order to obtain input from our stockholders regarding the Company's executive compensation program. Following this robust engagement process, we made several significant changes to our compensation programs (including directly measuring relative total stockholder return in our long-term incentive plan) that have resulted in two consecutive say-on-pay results with above 90% support.

FREQUENCY OF SAY-ON-PAY VOTE 
Consistent with the preference expressed by our stockholders at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in our frequency of say-on-pay vote, we currently hold our say-on-pay vote on an annual basis. 
DETERMINATION OF COMPENSATION 
When reviewing and evaluating our executive compensation for fiscal year 2018, we relied on the significant prior experience of our Compensation Committee in establishing compensation programs and levels across many companies in multiple industries, the input of our Chairman and CEO (except with regard to his own compensation) and the Compensation Committee' independent consultant. The following is an overview of the roles of the various participants in our executive compensation process:

Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews and confirms the appropriateness of our compensation peer group in light of any changes to the Company's size, business director, or strategic vision. The peer group generally serves as the primary reference in reviewing competitive pay practices and compensation levels for our NEOs. The peer group reflects our status as a multi-brand retailer and includes companies with annual revenues generally between one-half and two times the Company's. 
The Company uses the proxy peer group for:

This peer group is consistent with the group used in fiscal 2017. Following a review of the group in late fiscal 2018, the Committee determined that no changes would be made to this group for fiscal 2019. 
ESTABLISHING THE COMPENSATION FOR THE CEO 
The Compensation Committee sets the compensation of our CEO based on the objectives, philosophy and methodology described throughout this document. Each year, the Compensation Committee makes a determination on CEO compensation in consideration of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Overall Company performance during the year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Jaffe's performance during the year and ongoing contributions to the Company's success; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive pay levels within the Company's peer group.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews Mr. Jaffe's compensation opportunity annually within the context of Company and individual performance, market pay trends, internal pay equity, and the Company's compensation philosophy. As in prior years, the Compensation Committee placed significant emphasis on "at risk" compensation elements in fiscal 2018. Additionally, Mr. Jaffe's target and realized compensation during the year was reflective of the challenges the Company faced and is aligned with our strong pay-for-performance focus. Key elements of his fiscal 2018 compensation include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary was maintained at $1,000,000; Mr. Jaffe's base salary has not increased since fiscal 2013 and is  positioned near the 25th percentile of our peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Jaffe's target seasonal bonus opportunities did not change in fiscal 2018. Additionally, OI achievement below  threshold for the fall season and between threshold and target for the spring season resulted in a below target payout equivalent to approximately 26% of his annual target for fiscal 2018. Further, he did not realize any value from the vesting of  performance-based long-term incentives after the Compensation Committee applied discretion to reduce the payout of the FY18 LTIP; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As with two of our other NEOs, Mr. Jaffe's long-term incentive opportunity was reduced by 30%. As a result, 86% of  Mr. Jaffe's fiscal 2018 long-term incentive opportunity was a multi-year, performance-based award tied to net income and total stockholder return goals, and his target pay opportunity was positioned below the 25th percentile of our peers.

BASE SALARY 
The base salaries of our NEOs are an important element of their total compensation packages, and are intended to reflect their respective positions, duties and responsibilities. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews NEO salaries and approves merit-based increases, if appropriate, based on a number of factors including:

ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE PROGRAM 
The Compensation Committee believes that a substantial percentage of each executive officer's annual compensation should be tied directly to the financial performance of the Company. Our annual cash incentive program is a critical element of our compensation package, because it is 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 entirely "at-risk" and any earned payouts are solely dependent on Company performance. We structure the Company's incentive bonus plans to encourage the achievement of seasonal performance that exceeds goals established by the Compensation Committee. The incentive bonus plans help to focus our NEOs on key financial objectives and business drivers, which we believe will support our financial performance, improve our overall operations and increase in stockholder value. Each of our NEOs participated in the program in fiscal 2018. 
We establish the target amount of an NEO's incentive bonus as a percentage of base salary for the performance period based on the NEO's position and level within the organization. The seasonal bonus payable is equal to their seasonal target bonus modified based on the assessment of performance (adjusted to reflect extraordinary and other special items, including exclusion of the financial effects of any unbudgeted disposal of a business or acquisition, start-up, new joint venture or disposition of an asset) relative to the pre-determined targeted levels. 
Key mechanics of the program include: 
Individual Targets Individual Base Salary Individual Target Percentage Individual Target measurement and Payout 50% Fall Season 50% Spring Season Operating Income Achievement Operating Income Achievement Final Payout Factor Up to 200% Up to 200% Up to 200% 
Operating Income serves as the sole metric in the plan because the Compensation Committee believes it is the core driver and leading indicator of stockholder value creation. Additionally, the plan's seasonal structure allows for mid-year development of performance targets and provides an incentive for our NEOs to focus on meeting goals in the second half of the fiscal year in circumstances when business performance and macro-economic conditions change relative to our budgeted plan. 
The Compensation Committee sets the applicable performance goals for our semi-annual cash incentive bonus program at the beginning of the fall and spring seasons after considering historical operating trends (particularly prior year results), the external market environment, and the Company's financial plans approved by our Board. Despite the significant headwinds in our business, target Operating Income goals for each 2018 season were set above actual 2017 performance. The Compensation Committee believes that the 2018 goals were sufficiently rigorous and motivational. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
As shown in the tables below, threshold level of performance would have resulted in a payout equal to 50% of the seasonal incentive targets for each season. Additionally, in both seasons, a maximum level of performance would yield an incentive payout equal to 200% of their target annual incentives, with interpolation between the threshold and target levels and target and maximum levels.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
We endeavor to align executive compensation with the achievement of operational and financial results and increases in stockholder value. As discussed above, our long-term incentive compensation directly links payout opportunities with stock and financial performance. This design is intended to ensure that, in combination with the bonus opportunity described above, a majority of each NEO's total compensation is "at risk" based on Company financial or stock performance. However, as described in greater detail below under "Risk Mitigation," these incentives are designed in a manner that the Compensation Committee believes does not encourage excessive risk taking. 
Award Determination for Messrs. Jaffe, Giammatteo, and Pershing 
Our "steady-state" long-term incentive program contains three primary vehicles, which are each described in greater detail below. However, as described above, we reduced long-term incentive awards to certain of our NEOs (other than Messrs. Lynch and Muto given their promotions) by 30% in fiscal 2018 by: (i) halving the target value of options and (ii) eliminating restricted stock units. The resulting long-term incentive mix was formulated to: explicitly link all long-term pay opportunities with our stock price and financial performance; and, conserve shares during a period in which our share price was depressed.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Award Determination for Messrs. Lynch and Muto 
In recognition of their promotions effective August 1, 2017, the Committee determined that the fiscal 2018 long-term incentive awards granted to Messrs. Lynch and Muto in fiscal 2018 would not be reduced. However, to align with the mix of awards delivered to other NEOs, the awards to Messrs. Lynch and Muto were delivered 86% in the form of performance-based awards tied to net income and total shareholder return goals and 14% in the form of stock options. 
Further, in recognition of their criticality to the organization to reinvigorate top-line growth, enhance the Company's culture of performance and accountability, and focus on the creation of sustainable stockholder value, as well as the increased scope of their roles, the Compensation Committee elected to make one-time, promotional grants of 1,000,000 RSUs to each of Messrs. Lynch and Muto on September 27, 2017 (the same day as our annual equity grants). These promotional grants feature 3-year, back-loaded vesting (vesting 50% on June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020) intended to retain Messrs. Lynch and Muto and to ensure they continue to lead the Company through its ongoing transformational phase. 
EQUITY AWARDS UNDER THE COMPANY'S OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
NEOs generally receive annual grants of equity awards under our Omnibus Incentive Plan as set forth below. In fiscal 2018, stock options comprised 14% of the total long-term incentive grant value, with the remaining 86% made in performance-based LTIP. No restricted stock units were granted to our NEOs during our "steady-state" fiscal 2018 award cycle. 
The Compensation Committee generally determines the value of each grant in accordance with pre-established grant guidelines (which are primarily based on level of responsibility with the Company or respective brand). Our Chairman and CEO may exercise discretion in his recommendations to the Compensation Committee for grants of long term incentives for all executives (excluding himself) based on individual performance. All grants are made by the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee has a practice of not granting any stock options until at least one business day after the Company has issued its quarterly and/or annual earnings release, as well as the public release of any other pending material non-public information. 
If an employee ceases to be an employee of the Company for any reason (other than for Cause, as defined under the Omnibus Incentive Plan) and the employee has achieved the "Total Years" Test (as described in further detail below) as of his or her last day of employment, then all of such employee's unvested stock options will continue to vest and remain exercisable after the date of termination through the one year anniversary of the vesting date of the last unvested option under the applicable stock option award, but not longer than the original term of each option. 
In addition, all of an employee's unvested restricted stock will become fully vested upon achievement of the Total Years Test. Any shares of restricted stock granted to the employee who has achieved the Total Years Test will be fully vested upon grant, and the employee's RSUs will become fully vested upon the employee's death, disability, termination (other than for Cause) or upon a change in control of the Company on or after achievement of the Total Years Test. 
The "Total Years Test" means 75 years, based on the sum of (i) the total number of years of employment with the Company or an affiliate, plus (ii) the employee's age, which must be at least age 60. The Company believes that the Total Years Test encourages retention as our executive officers approach retirement age, while also incentivizing our executive officers to drive stockholder value. As of the end of fiscal 2018, none of our NEOs satisfied the Total Years Test. 
The Compensation Committee may also make other equity grants from time to time during the year ("special equity grants"), such as when a new employee is hired, a current employee is promoted (as was the case with the promotional grants made to Messrs. Lynch and Muto) or in recognition of special achievement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
3   Messrs. Lynch and Muto each received a special equity grant in fiscal 2018 in connection with their promotions  effective August 1, 2017. Their grants consist of 1,000,000 RSUs, that have three-year, back-loaded vesting schedules (vesting 50% on each of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2020).  
[END TABLE]
PERFORMANCE-BASED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS 
In fiscal 2018, the Company granted the NEOs cash-settled performance-based awards to be paid following the end of the three-year performance period and the Compensation Committee's certification of the achievement of pre-established performance goals. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) performance goals are established annually. The performance goals consist of financial measures and a relative TSR measure. The LTIPs are intended to tie NEO pay opportunities to our long-term financial and stock price performance. 
The following section summarizes LTIP grants made in fiscal 2018 as well as the results of the LTIPs vesting following the conclusion of fiscal 2018. Please see prior years' proxies for descriptions of other outstanding LTIP grants. 
Grants made in Fiscal 2018: 2020 LTIP 
In fiscal 2018, each NEO received a long-term incentive plan grant under the Omnibus Plan (the "2020 LTIP"). The performance period for the 2020 LTIP is fiscal years 2018 through 2020. Vesting of the 2020 LTIP grants is contingent on our achievement of a 2018 Net Income target (50% weighted) and three-year TSR relative to a broader index of companies in the "Specialty Stores" Global Industry Classification Standard group with market capitalization greater than $500 million (50% weighted). The Compensation Committee established the 2020 LTIP goals after considering the macro-economic environment, prior year actual performance, and our long-range plan. In particular, the Compensation Committee believes that the one-year Net Income goal further tied our executives' incentive opportunities to the Company's near-term stabilization, while the longer-term relative TSR goal ensures alignment with our stockholders' realization of value. 
2020 LTIP grants will vest at 50% of target for performance at threshold, 100% at target performance level, and 200% of target for performance achieving or exceeding maximum level; performance between these levels will be calculated using linear interpolation. If performance targets are achieved, any payouts under the 2020 LTIP will be made following the end of fiscal 2020. Subject to achievement of performance conditions, the 2020 LTIP awards will be settled in cash. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Due to the challenges with setting three-year financial goals in this volatile industry and during our ongoing business transformation, Net Income for the 2020 LTIP was calculated based on fiscal 2018 performance. Based on our performance during the fiscal year, we achieved a payout of 85% under this portion of the 2020 LTIP. However, the final payout for the award is still dependent upon achieving strong relative TSR over the three-year performance period.

The FY18 LTIP award was designed by the Compensation Committee to give eligible executives, including each of our NEOs, a substantial incentive to maximize our long-term financial performance following the acquisition of ANN. Grants were scheduled to vest after the completion of fiscal 2018, subject to performance at or above threshold levels. The target payout opportunities for the FY18 LTIP are shown below:

Given the many uncertainties in the retail industry, the Compensation Committee set FY18 LTIP targets it considered challenging but still achievable in an industry where competition for experienced, proven executives is significant. In particular, the cumulative EBITDA target was established by adding the goals for each year in the 3-year performance period, which in turn were established by placing a 10% premium on the prior year's actual results (e.g., the year 2 goal was positioned 10% above year 1 actual EBITDA achievement). As shown in the charts below, the Company did not achieve the threshold cumulative EBITDA goal and was below the threshold level for relative TSR. In relation to the ROI goal, the Compensation Committee determined, as it did for fiscal 2017, that the formulaic payout calculated was not truly representative of our performance during the relevant period. As a result, the Compensation Committee exercised negative discretion and reduced the payout for the ROI under the F18 LTIP to zero for all participants.

In March 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the adoption of a Transformation Bonus Program under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. This program was introduced to enhance the performance of the Company and create long-term stockholder value by motivating key executives to deliver significant cost savings consistent with the Change for Growth program and by encouraging retention of key executives in light of the competitive market for talent. All NEOs are eligible to participant in this program with the exception of our CEO. 
Under the Transformation Bonus Program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executives (other than the CEO) are eligible to earn bonus awards payable in cash upon the achievement of cost reduction  targets ("Realized Savings") from January 1, 2017 to the end of fiscal 2021;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The achievement of Realized Savings will be calculated at the end of fiscal years 2018 through 2021, ensuring a multi-year  performance period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payouts are calculated based on a multiple of the eligible executive's base salary in effect on January 1, 2017,  which vary by participant from 0.5x to a maximum cumulative multiple of 5.5x over the full performance period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No bonuses will be paid if Realized Savings do not equal $150 million, nor will any incremental bonuses be paid for  Realized Savings in excess of $450 million over the entire performance period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount payable to a participant in any fiscal year is subject to an annual maximum bonus cap which considers both IC  payouts and transformation bonus opportunity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payouts in any fiscal year will be reduced by 50% if the Company does not achieve threshold annual Operating Income levels  under the IC plan for the relevant fiscal year (fall and spring goals combined).  
[END TABLE]
This one-time opportunity with a multi-year performance period was introduced to ensure our key executive talent is continuously motivated to lead our organization toward the realization of significant cost savings in connection with the Change for Growth program. 
Following the conclusion of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company had met 100% of its tranche 1 goal of $150 million in cumulative Realized Savings and 45% of its tranche 2 goal of $250 million in cumulative Realized Savings. This level of performance resulted in a preliminary earned value equal to 1.56x each participant's salary in effect as of January 1, 2017. 
However, the 2018 earned values were reduced by 50% to equal 0.78x each participant's salary as in effect as of January 1, 2017 since the Company did not hit its threshold annual Operating Income level under the IC plan for fiscal 2018. These earned values are payable within 60 days following the end of fiscal 2019. 
EXECUTIVE PERQUISITES 
We generally do not offer significant perquisites to our NEOs and they represent a relatively small portion of the NEOs' total compensation. The cost of perquisites for our NEOs is included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table. Our NEOs participate in the Company's broad-based health and welfare programs that are available to our full-time employees generally. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
KEY NEO COMPENSATION PROGRAM CHANGES FOR FISCAL 2019 
Recognizing the impact of industry changes and financial performance on our stock price, management proactively recommended — and the Compensation Committee approved — several significant compensation changes for fiscal 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Measuring our NEOs' seasonal incentive program against corporate- and segment-specific awards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintaining the 30% reduction to long-term incentive targets for our NEOs (with performance-based awards comprising 86% of  the target long-term incentive value)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transitioning the full 2021 LTIP to 3-year goals based upon comparable sales growth  and EBITDA growth with a relative TSR modifier  
[END TABLE]
We believe that the decisions for fiscal 2019 will continue to: (i) reduce stockholder dilution; and (ii) align our NEOs' payout opportunities with the performance of our stock and our stockholder's ability to realize value. 
MANAGEMENT OF COMPENSATION-RELATED RISK 
Management and the Compensation Committee utilize various procedures to mitigate the probability of our compensation programs resulting in excessive risk-taking: 
Risk Assessment — Each year, our compensation consultants conduct a risk-assessment of our incentive programs. The assessment is presented to and reviewed by the Compensation Committee. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board has reviewed and considered whether our compensation programs and policies create risks that are reasonably likely  to have a material adverse effect on us. In that regard, we design our programs in a balanced and diversified manner while also creating significant, yet appropriate, incentives for strong performance based on our business and strategic plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In most cases, each component of our performance-based compensation program is subject to a limit on the cash paid or the  number of shares delivered.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe that our compensation programs reflect a balance of short-term, long-term, guaranteed and performance based  compensation in order not to encourage excessive risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A significant portion of our compensation program includes performance-based compensation with multi-year performance  targets and vesting. We believe that this helps to ensure that our NEOs and other employees focus on the health of our business and the success of broad performance metrics that will deliver stockholder value over time and discourages excess  risk-taking by our NEOs and other employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee also evaluates on a regular basis our overall mix of equity-based incentive awards relative to  cash-based incentive awards to align our executives' incentives with stockholder interests and long-term value.  
[END TABLE]
Clawback Policy — Pursuant to the executive compensation clawback policy approved by the Compensation Committee in fiscal 2016, if the Board determines that any cash or non-cash incentive compensation (excluding time-based stock options) awarded to, or received by, an executive officer (each a "covered person") was based on any financial results or operating metrics that were misstated, we will seek to recover from the covered person such compensation (in whole or in part) as the Board deems appropriate under the circumstances and as permitted by law. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If a restatement occurs, the Board will look at the incentive compensation paid or awarded in each fiscal year in the  three-year period prior to the date the Company is required to prepare the restatement (any year in such three-year period, a "Look-Back Year").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the Board determines that incentive compensation has been paid or awarded to a covered person in a Look-Back Year, the  Board may, in its sole discretion, regardless of fault, cancel or require repayment of all or a portion of any excess incentive compensation (i.e., the excess of the amount that would have been paid or awarded had such incentive compensation been  calculated based on the restatement results).

Our Board believes it is important that our executive officers and other members of our leadership team have, and are recognized both internally and externally as having, long-term financial interests that are aligned with those of our stockholders. In fiscal 2012, pursuant to the 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION — COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 recommendation of the Compensation Committee, the Board adopted stock ownership guidelines for our CEO (the "Ownership Guidelines"). In June 2016, the Ownership Guidelines were amended and restated to, among other things, expand the group of persons subject to the Ownership Guidelines to include all members of our leadership team, including each of the Company's executive officers and presidents of each of the Company's brands. The Ownership Guidelines with respect to our CEO became effective in September 2011, and with respect to all other members of our leadership, became effective in June 2016.

[END TABLE]
Our CEO has satisfied the target ownership requirement under the Ownership Guidelines. The other members of our leadership team have five years to satisfy these requirements. Ownership for purposes of the Ownership Guidelines includes: (i) shares of our stock acquired on the open market or purchased through the exercise of stock options or settlement of any other type of equity award (such as restricted stock, RSUs, deferred stock or a deferred stock unit); (ii) vested equity awards (other than stock options or stock appreciation awards); (iii) vested shares of our stock allocated under any tax-qualified plan; and (iv) unvested RSUs (but excluding unvested performance-based equity awards). Shares held individually or jointly or by a "family member" (as defined in the securities laws which would include certain trusts, family partnerships and foundations) would count as "owned" by the individual. Stock options awards do not count towards the stock ownership requirement. The Ownership Guidelines are posted on the "investors" page of the Company's website at www.ascenaretail.com, accessible through the "Investor Relations Menu." 
PROHIBITION ON HEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY STOCK 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our directors and executive officers are prohibited from engaging in hedging or monetization transactions with respect to our stock, including through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, puts, calls, collars, forwards and other derivative instruments, or through the establishment of a short position in our securities. Additionally, our non-employee directors and executive officers are prohibited from holding our stock in a margin account or otherwise pledging our stock as collateral for a loan. 
TAX DEDUCTIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS 
As a general matter, the Compensation Committee reviews and considers the various tax and accounting implications of compensation vehicles that we utilize. With respect to accounting matters, the Compensation Committee examines the accounting cost associated with equity compensation in light of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718. 
The Compensation Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA"), Section 162(m) denied a corporate tax deduction for annual compensation exceeding $1,000,000 paid to the chief executive officer and the three other most highly compensated executive officers of a public company (for purposes of this section only "Covered Employees"), other than the chief financial officer, subject to an exception for compensation payable based on achievement of pre-established objective performance goals if certain requirements are met. Prior to the effective date of the TCJA, we generally endeavored to structure our performance-based incentive compensation for our NEOs to qualify as performance-based under Section 162(m) of the Code where it was reasonable to do so while meeting our compensation objectives, although the Board and the Compensation Committee reserved the authority to award non-deductible compensation in circumstances where doing so was deemed appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. In addition, it is possible that some compensation paid pursuant to certain equity awards may be non-deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. 
TCJA eliminated the ability to rely on the performance-based compensation exception for amounts deductible effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. In addition, under the legislation, the definition of "Covered Employees" was expanded to include any person who served as the chief (principal) financial officer. An employee who is a Covered Employee for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, and any time during the fiscal year, will remain a Covered Employee for all future years. As a result, beginning in fiscal 2019, the Company may no longer take a deduction for any compensation paid to Covered Employees (i.e., our NEOs) in excess of $1,000,000, except to the extent that it is subject to a "written binding contract" in effect as of November 2, 2017 ("transition relief") that is not later modified in any material respect. However, because the guidance requires further clarification, the application of this transition relief to any of the Company's compensation arrangements is not certain. Therefore, no assurance can be given that any compensation otherwise subject to a deduction limit will qualify for an exception under this transition rule.

CEO PAY RATIO 
This year, new rules enacted by the SEC require us to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, David Jaffe, to the annual total compensation of our median employee (the "CEO Pay Ratio"). For Fiscal 2018, our median employee's annual total compensation was $7,750. As set forth in the Summary Compensation Table, Mr. Jaffe's annual total compensation for Fiscal 2018 was $3,956,351. Accordingly, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Jaffe to our median employee was 510:1. 
In calculating the CEO Pay Ratio, we began by determining that we had (59,439 total) employees as of June 1, 2018 determination date. As is permitted under SEC rules, we eliminated 446 employees from the calculation located in countries in the table below (approximately 0.75% of our total employee population).

To identify our median employee, we used total taxable compensation for the period January 1, 2018 through and including June 1, 2018 and annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who worked for us for less than a full calendar year. We then selected an employee we believe to be statistically most representative of the median and calculated Fiscal 2018 compensation for the median employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table. 
Pay ratios that are reported by our peers may not be directly comparable to ours because of differences in the composition of each company's workforce, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used in calculating the pay ratio, as permitted by SEC rules. 
EMPLOYMENT LETTERS AND RETIREMENT AGREEMENTS 
We have entered into employment letters with all our NEOs. Effective August 1, 2017, as further discussed below, our employment agreement with David Jaffe terminated and was replaced with an employment letter. We also entered into new employment letters with Messrs. Lynch and Muto effective August 1, 2017. 
An employment agreement provides an executive with a time period (or "term") during which he will be employed by the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  An employment letter does not have a term of employment. Rather, the letter sets forth the minimum  compensation and benefits that the executive will receive during his or her employment.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  An executive with an employment letter is an employee at-will (i.e.,  the Company may terminate such executive at any time with or without cause, subject to any applicable severance provisions, including the Executive Severance Plan).  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that these employment arrangements are important to our executives and to the Company. Each executive benefits from clarity of the terms of his or her employment. The Company enhances its ability to retain the services of its executives. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the terms of the employment arrangements and amends them as necessary to remain competitive and to carry out its objectives. Details of the terms of the specific employment arrangements are discussed below. 
EMPLOYMENT LETTERS 
David Jaffe 
Effective August 1, 2017, the Company entered into an employment letter with David Jaffe, its Chief Executive Officer (the "Employment Letter"). The Employment Letter superseded and replaced the terms of the employment agreement dated March 5, 2014 previously in place between Mr. Jaffe and the Company. The Employment Letter provides that Mr. Jaffe is an "employee at-will" (i.e., the Company may terminate his employment at any time with or without cause, subject to any applicable severance provisions). 
The Employment Letter provides for an annual salary of $1,000,000 per year or such higher salary as may be determined by the Company's board of directors or the Compensation Committee. The Employment Letter entitles Mr. Jaffe to participate in all the Company's retirement, insurance, and bonus, incentive and other benefit plans, including the Omnibus Incentive Plan, to the use of a car service at the Company's expense as necessary for him to perform his duties and responsibilities, including for transportation to and from his home. 
In the event that Mr. Jaffe's employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Jaffe for good reason (a "Qualifying Termination"), other than upon, within the 90 days prior to, or during the 24 months following, in each case, a change in control, under the Employment Letter, Mr. Jaffe is entitled to receive, subject to his execution of a release, an amount equal to two times his base salary payable in installments for a period of 24 months following the date of termination. 
In the event that Mr. Jaffe incurred a Qualifying Termination upon, within the 90 days prior to, or during the 24 months following, in each case, a change in control, under the Employment Letter, Mr. Jaffe is entitled to receive, subject to his execution of a release, an amount equal to two times the sum of his base salary and the greater of a) annual target bonus for the year in which the change in control occurs; or b) average three-year aggregate annual bonus equaling the sum of the two seasonal bonuses paid in each such fiscal year, payable in installments for a period of 24 months following the date of termination. In addition, upon such Qualifying Termination, any stock-based awards not vested immediately prior to the change in control that are outstanding on the change in control date (or outstanding immediately prior to the change in control date for awards not assumed or replaced by the successor) will be deemed vested on the termination date. If the Qualifying Termination occurs during the 90-day period before the change in control, any unvested awards that expired on the date of the termination will be deemed vested and entitled to payment at fair market value. 
In the event that Mr. Jaffe incurred a Qualifying Termination (whether prior to, upon or during the 24 months following a change in control or in the absence of a change in control), under the Employment Letter, Mr. Jaffe and his covered dependents are entitled to receive, subject to his timely election of COBRA, continued participation in the Company's health and medical insurance plans at the active employee premium rate through the earlier of the period of Mr. Jaffe's and/or his covered dependents eligibility for COBRA and Mr. Jaffe becoming eligible under the health and medical insurance coverage of a subsequent employer. 
In the event that Mr. Jaffe incurred a Qualifying Termination, or his employment terminated by reason of his death or total disability at any time (whether prior to, upon or during the 24 months following a change in control or in the absence of a change in control), under the Employment 
EMPLOYMENT LETTERS AND RETIREMENT AGREEMENTS 
 Letter, Mr. Jaffe (or his designated beneficiary or his estate, as applicable) is entitled to receive a pro rata portion of his incentive compensation for the season in which his employment is terminated based on actual results. 
The Employment Letter provided that for a period of one year following his death, Mr. Jaffe's base salary would continue to be paid to his designated beneficiary or his estate and his covered dependents will be eligible to continued health and medical coverage under COBRA at the active employee rate. The Employment Letter further provided that in the event of Mr. Jaffe's termination by reason of his total disability, he would receive continued payment of his base salary for one year from the date of termination, and he and his covered dependents would receive continued health and medical coverage under COBRA at the active employee rate through the earlier of such period, the period of Mr. Jaffe's and/or his covered dependents eligibility for COBRA and Mr. Jaffe becoming eligible under the health and medical insurance coverage of a subsequent employer. 
The terms "cause", "good reason", "change in control" and "total disability" are defined in the Employment Letter and below. Severance amounts payable under the Employment Letter, except for amounts payable upon Mr. Jaffe's death, would be subject to a possible six-month delay pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. For further information regarding Mr. Jaffe's employment arrangements and the payments to which he may be entitled thereunder, see below under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control — David Jaffe." 
The Employment Letter provides that if Mr. Jaffe receives parachute payments that exceed his threshold amount under Section 280G of the Code, the amount will be cut-back to below the 280G threshold amount unless he would be better off receiving the full amount and paying the excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code. The Employment Letter also contains non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions effective during the employment term and for one year thereafter as well as a perpetual non-disparagement restriction. 
"Cause" is generally defined in the Employment Letter to include conviction of a crime, intentional and willful failure to satisfactorily perform employment duties reasonably requested by our Board, fraud or embezzlement, gross misconduct or gross negligence that has a substantial adverse effect on the Company or its affiliates, an intentional and willful act or omission which is materially detrimental to our business or reputation, or Mr. Jaffe's willful breach of the covenants set forth in the Employment Letter (which include covenants not to compete, not to solicit our employees and not to disparage the Company). 
"Good Reason" is generally defined in the Employment Letter as the occurrence, without Mr. Jaffe's consent, of any of the following: a material demotion in his position, job duties or responsibilities; our failure to pay him his compensation or benefits; the relocation of Mr. Jaffe's principal place of work at least 35 miles from its current location; or any material breach of any of our obligations under his agreement. Mr. Jaffe may terminate his employment for "Good Reason" only if he provides notice to the Company setting forth in reasonable detail the alleged "Good Reason" circumstances or event within 30 days after the occurrence of such event or circumstances and the Company fails to cure such event or circumstances within 60 days after receipt of such notice. 
"Change in Control" is generally defined in the Employment Letter as: (a) any "person" (as defined in the Exchange Act) becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the outstanding common stock of the Company (excluding a person that is an affiliate of the Company); (b) a change of a majority of the Board after July 29, 2017 (the "Incumbent Directors"), unless the election of a new director was supported by two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors (which includes any new director whose election was supported by two-thirds of the Incumbent Directors); (c) the Company adopts a plan of liquidation of all or substantially all of its assets; (d) the Company disposes of all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company pursuant to a merger, consolidation or other transaction; or (e) the Company combines with another company and is the surviving corporation, but, immediately after the combination, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the combination hold, directly or indirectly, 50% or less of the common stock or other ownership interests of the combined company. 
"Total Disability" is generally defined in the Employment Letter as Mr. Jaffe being physically or mentally incapacitated such that Mr. Jaffe is incapable of performing his material duties under the Employment Letter for a period of ninety (90) consecutive days or 120 non-consecutive days in any 12-month period. Receipt of disability benefits under the Company's long-term disability plan or receipt of Social Security disability benefits is conclusive evidence of Total Disability, or, in the absence of receipt of such benefits, a determination of Total Disability by an impartial physician. 
Robb Giammatteo 
Mr. Giammatteo has an employment letter with the Company that was entered into on July 25, 2015, which provides that he is entitled to a base salary of at least $500,000 per year, as well as standard Company benefits.

Effective at the end of the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders Mr. Elliot S. Jaffe retired as an officer of the Company and from the Board.

EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN 
We maintain the Executive Severance Plan, as amended and restated as of June 12, 2018, in order to provide severance benefits to certain key employees, which for fiscal 2018, included all our NEOs (other than our CEO). The following summary describes the key provisions of the Executive Severance Plan as they would have applied to our NEOs (other than our CEO) at the end of fiscal 2018. 
The Executive Severance Plan provides participants with the following severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment by the Company without "cause" (as defined in the plan), other than a termination that constitutes a termination in connection with a "change in control" (as defined in the plan): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12-month salary continuation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro rata portion of his/her semi-annual bonus based on actual results;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued health insurance coverage at the active employee rate for a period up to 12 months; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12 months of Outplacement Services not to exceed $7,300.  
[END TABLE]
In the case of Mr. Muto, he is also entitled to the severance benefits described above in the event his employment is terminated for "good reason" (as described below), except that he will receive 24 months (and not 12 months) of salary continuation payments. 
In lieu of the benefits described above, if our NEOs would have been terminated without cause or terminated employment for "good reason" (as described below) during (1) the 90 day period prior to a change in control (such termination, a "Pre-CIC Termination"), or (2) the period commencing on a Change in Control and ending 24 months later (such termination, a "Post-CIC Termination), the executive would have been eligible for the following upon the change in control (in the case of a Pre-CIC Termination), or upon the termination date (in the case of a Post-CIC Termination): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum equal to 1.5 times (or 2 times, in the case of Mr. Muto) the sum of annual base salary and the greater of a)  annual target bonus for the year in which the CIC occurs; or b) average three-year aggregate annual bonus equaling the sum of the two seasonal bonuses paid in each such fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a pro rata portion (based on the number of days employed during the applicable performance period from when the separation  from service occurs) of the seasonal (semi-annual) bonus based on actual results, payable when other such bonuses are paid;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued health insurance coverage at the active employee rate for a period of up to 18 months;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the case of a Post-CIC Termination, full vesting of any unvested equity awards  (in the case of a Pre-CIC Termination, a lump sum cash equivalent payment equal to the fair market value of the unvested equity awards that were forfeited upon the termination); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 12 months of Outplacement Services not to exceed $7,300.  
[END TABLE]
Under the Severance Plan, "good reason" is defined as (i) any material diminution of responsibilities, duties or authority, (ii) any reduction in base salary and/or benefits, other than a reduction that is uniformly applied to similarly situated employees of not more than 10%, (iii) relocation of the principal place of work outside of a 30-mile radius of the then current work location, or (iv) the failure of a successor to the Company to assume the Severance Plan. With respect to Mr. Muto, under his employment letter, (A) the "good reason" definition also includes any material breach of his employment letter by the Company or the elimination of sourcing from his job responsibilities, and (B) prior to a change in control, a reduction in benefits (but not salary) alone will not constitute "good reason." 
The severance benefits payable under the Severance Plan are subject to: (1) the six month delay to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code; (2) the execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims in favor of the Company within a specified time period; (3) the executive's compliance with certain non-competition and non-solicitation restrictive covenants following a termination (other than a Pre-CIC Termination or a Post-CIC Termination); and (4) reduction to avoid any excise tax on "parachute payments" if the executive would benefit from such reduction as compared to paying the excise tax. Any benefits payable under the Executive Severance Plan supersede and are in lieu of any severance benefits and/or payments provided under any other agreements, arrangements or severance plans by and between the executive and the Company. 
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION IN FISCAL 2018 
After satisfying a waiting period, our NEOs are eligible for participation in our Executive Retirement Plan, which is an unfunded, unsecured nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The Executive Retirement Plan allows our executives to defer a maximum of 50% of their base salary and 75% of their bonuses paid or other performance-based cash compensation awarded. Elections to participate in the Executive Retirement Plan are made by our executives on an annual basis, prior to the beginning of the year in which the compensation is earned. 
We make Company contributions to the Executive Retirement Plan in an amount determined by us for each plan year. For fiscal 2018, our NEOs who were eligible for participation received a Company matching contribution of 1% of up to $265,000 of total compensation deferred, and Company matching contribution of 5% of compensation over $265,000 deferred. Effective January 1, 2018, the compensation limits for calculating the Company matching contribution were increased from up to $265,000 to $270,000. Participants are immediately vested in deferrals of their own compensation. Company matching contributions vest in 25% increments after 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years of service with the Company. All Company matching contributions held and received by the participant are vested after five years of service with the Company. 
The aggregate balance of each participant's account consists of amounts that have been deferred by the participant, Company matching contributions, plus earnings (or minus losses). We do not deposit any amounts into any trust or other account for the benefit of plan participants. In accordance with tax requirements, the assets of the Executive Retirement Plan are subject to claims of our creditors. Account balances are deemed invested in accordance with investment elections designated by the participant. Investment option transfers may be made daily. There are 27 investment options available to plan participants, including fixed income funds, domestic and international equity funds, blended funds and pre-allocated lifestyle fund investments. Interest and gains or losses on each deemed investment are credited or debited to each participant's account daily based on the actual performance of the funds in which the participant is deemed invested. 
Deferred account balances are distributed to the plan participants in accordance with elections made by the participant at the time the deferral is made, subject to Section 409A of the Code. A participant may elect to receive distributions, either in a lump sum or in installments, upon his or her termination of employment with the Company, disability, death, an unforeseeable emergency or a change of control, each of the last two events as defined in Section 409A of the Code. A participant may elect to receive distributions while still employed by the Company if he or she elects to have in-service or education distributions, made at a date specified by the participants. 
The following table shows the executive and Company contributions, earnings and account balances for the NEOs.

(1)  All executive contributions represent amounts deferred by each NEO under the Executive Retirement Plan (Ascena's Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan) and are included as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table under "Salary", "Bonus" and "Non-Equity  Incentive Plan Compensation."

(2)  All registrant contributions are reported under "All Other Compensation" in the Summary Compensation Table.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
The tables below describe and estimate additional compensation and benefits that our NEOs would become entitled to pursuant to their employment agreements, employment letters and other arrangements between the Company and the executive upon a termination of their employment in certain circumstances or in the event of a Change in Control, in each case assuming such event had occurred on August 4, 2018. Where applicable, the amounts payable assume a $4.02 fair value of our common stock (the closing price on August 3, 2018, the last trading day of fiscal 2018). We have calculated these estimated payments to meet SEC disclosure requirements. The estimated payments are not necessarily indicative of the actual amounts any of our NEOs would receive in such circumstances. 
The calculation excludes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  compensation amounts accrued through August 4, 2018 that would be paid in the normal course of continued employment,  such as accrued but unpaid salary, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  vested account balances under our retirement plan that are generally available to all our salaried employees.   
[END TABLE]
In addition, where applicable, the amounts reflected for bonuses reflect the actual amounts paid to the NEO for fiscal 2018, since the hypothetical termination or Change in Control date is the last day of the fiscal year for which the bonus is to be determined. 
In addition to these payments, participants in our Executive Retirement Plan, including the NEOs, may elect to receive distributions, either in a lump sum or in installments, upon his or her termination of employment with the Company, disability, death, or following a Change in Control (subject to Section 409A of the Code). Each NEO's account balance under the Executive Retirement Plan as of the end of fiscal 2018 is set forth under the "Aggregate Balance at Last Fiscal Year End" column of the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table above.

SPECIAL EQUITY PLAN PROVISIONS UNDER CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Acceleration of Equity Awards 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the headings "Non-Qualified Stock Options, RSUs and PSUs under the Company's Omnibus Incentive Plan" and "Long-Term Incentive Plans", eligible employees, including our NEOs, may be awarded PSUs, non-qualified stock options, shares of restricted stock or RSUs that vest over a specified period of years that vary based on the type and timing of the award (unless, in the case of restricted stock and RSUs, the shares are subject to immediate vesting because the recipient satisfies the "Total Years Test"). Prior to its amendment and restatement effective December 17, 2010, the Omnibus Incentive Plan and relevant award agreements, however, provided for accelerated vesting of certain equity awards following a Change in Control of the Company or upon certain termination events, as described below. To reflect corporate governance best practices, the provisions relating to a change of control of the Company were modified pursuant to the amendment and restatement of the Omnibus Incentive Plan for awards granted on or after December 17, 2010, as set forth below. 
Change in Control Provisions under the Omnibus Incentive Plan 
Effective with respect to grants made under the Omnibus Incentive Plan on or after December 17, 2010, unless otherwise determined at grant, such awards will not automatically vest upon a Change in Control (i.e., a "single trigger"), but will vest upon an involuntary termination without Cause that occurs within 2 years following a Change in Control (i.e., upon a "double trigger"). Unless otherwise determined at grant, awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan prior to December 17, 2010 will automatically vest upon a single trigger. 
"Change in Control" is defined in the Omnibus Incentive Plan as: 
✓ any person or group acquires 30% or more of the Companys voting securities; 
✓ a change in a majority of the members of the Board over any two-year (or, for any payment pursuant to an award that is triggered upon a Change in Control and that constitutes 
✓  non-qualified deferred compensation pursuant to Section 409A of the Code (such an award a 409A Award), one year) period unless the new directors election to the Board was approved by at least two-thirds (or, for any payment pursuant to a 409A Award, a majority) of the existing directors (referred to as a change in Board composition); 
✓ a merger of the Company, unless the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior to the merger continue to represent greater than 50% of the voting securities of the company or surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger; 
✓ approval by the stockholders of a plan of liquidation of the Company (this will not apply with respect to any payment pursuant to a 409A Award); or 
✓ a sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets other than a sale to a person or persons who beneficially own, directly or indirectly, at least 50% or more of the combined voting power of the outstanding voting securities of the Company at the time of the sale (or, for awards granted prior to March 3, 2010, approval of the stockholders of such sale) (referred to as an asset sale). 
For awards granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan prior to December 17, 2010, "Change in Control" also includes the following events: 
✓ none of Messrs. Elliot S. Jaffe or David Jaffe, Ms. Roslyn Jaffe, or any of their direct lineal descendants (referred to as the Jaffe family), is a member of the Board; or 
✓ the Jaffe family owns less than 5% of the voting securities of the Company. 
Special Provisions Related to Option Awards Granted Prior to December 17, 2010 
If prior to the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee reasonably determines, in good faith, that the stock options will be honored or assumed, or new rights substituted, then stock options granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan prior to December 17, 2010, generally, will not be subject to accelerated vesting upon a Change in Control. 
If the stock options granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan are accelerated upon a Change in Control, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may authorize the Company or its affiliates to purchase any such accelerated options by paying the option holder the difference between the exercise price of his or her option and the higher of: (i) the highest price paid for a share of common stock in any transaction related to the Change in Control, or (ii) the highest fair market value per share of common stock at any time during the 60-day period preceding the Change in Control. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Special Provisions Related to LTIP Awards 
Restricted stock awards granted under any completed LTIP cycle would immediately vest in the event that a Change in Control occurs or the recipient's employment is terminated due to death or disability. 
Special Provisions Related to Annual or Special Awards 
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, annual or special awards of restricted stock that have not yet vested would vest immediately upon the participant's death, disability, achievement of the Total Years Test or a termination of the participant's employment without Cause or for Good Reason that occurs within 24 months following a Change in Control. In addition, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant, any portion of an award of RSUs that had not yet vested would vest immediately upon the occurrence of the participant's death, disability, or termination on or after achievement of the Total Years Test or a Change in Control; except that, if a recipient makes a deferral election with respect to an RSU award, the foregoing accelerated vesting provisions will not apply to such award if the recipient's termination occurs on or before the 13th month following the grant date due to achievement of the Total Years Test. 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN, AS AMENDED 
INTRODUCTION 
Our stockholders are being asked to approve amendment Number Two ("Amendment") to our 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated effective December 10, 2015), as approved by our stockholders on December 10 2015, and as subsequently amended (referred to below as the "Omnibus Incentive Plan"). The Omnibus Incentive Plan as amended by the Amendment is referred to below as the "Amended Plan." On October 3, 2018, our Board approved the Amendment, subject to, and to be effective upon, stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The amendments to the Omnibus Incentive Plan include the following key modifications: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increase the aggregate share reserve. The Amendment provides for an increase in the current aggregate share reserve  by 13,100,000 shares for a total share reserve of 83,600,000 shares. As of October 4, 2018, 7,090,377 shares remain available for future issuance under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. The remaining share reserve reflects the number of shares  remaining after the grant of annual awards to our employees in September and October 2018 (the size of which increased over prior fiscal years due to the increasing size and complexity of our Company due to our continued growth). The remaining  shares will not be sufficient for long-term incentives expected to be awarded in fiscal 2019 and future years. The Board believes that it is important that a significant portion of the compensation for our key employees, officers and directors  consist of performance-based pay in order to encourage the enhancement of stockholder value by fostering long-term commitment to the benefit of our stockholders and to bolster the motivational effect of overall pay packages to attract and retain the  services of key individuals essential to our long-term growth and financial success. The Board believes that the proposed increase in the share reserve is necessary to insure that a sufficient reserve of common stock remains available for issuance  to allow us to continue to utilize equity incentives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limitation on Non-Employee Director Compensation. The Amendment provides for  a cap on the aggregate amounts of stock-based and cash-based awards which may be granted to any non-employee member of our Board in respect of any fiscal year, solely with respect to his or her service to the  Board, at $750,000. We seek to follow corporate governance best practices. As a result, we are seeking stockholder approval of award limitations for non-employee members of our Board in order to establish  meaningful and appropriate guidelines regarding their compensation.  
[END TABLE]
We anticipate filing a Registration Statement on Form S-8 with the SEC to register the additional amount of new shares of our Common Stock to be included in the aggregate share reserve under the Amendment, effective upon and subject to stockholder approval of the Amendment, as soon as practicable following such stockholders' approval of the Amendment. 
The Omnibus Incentive Plan includes key provisions designed to protect stockholder interests, promote effective corporate governance and reflect use of corporate governance best practices including, but not limited to, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Discounted Options. Stock options may not be granted with exercise prices lower than the fair market value of the  underlying shares on the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Repricing of Under-water Options. The terms of the Stock Incentive Plan do not allow for the repricing of  "under-water" stock options, including the cancellation and reissuance of new options in exchange for stock options whose strike price is above the then-current fair value of the Company's stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Cash Buyout without Stockholder Approval. No cash buyouts of outstanding stock options are permitted under the  Stock Incentive Plan where the option strike price exceeds the then-current fair value of the Company's stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Automatic Vesting on a Change in Control. The terms of the Stock Incentive Plan do not allow for automatic vesting  on a change in control for awards granted on or after December 17, 2010.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Share Recycling for Net Exercises or Tax Withholding. Shares surrendered or withheld to pay either the exercise  price of an award or to withhold taxes in respect of an award do not become available for issuance as future awards under the Stock Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Evergreen Provision. There is no "evergreen" or automatic replenishment provision pursuant to which the  shares authorized for issuance under the Stock Incentive Plan are automatically replenished.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Automatic Grants. The Omnibus Incentive Plan does not provide for automatic grants to any participant.   
[END TABLE]
The Board of Director recommends that our stockholders approve the Amendment. If the requisite stockholder approval of the Amendment is not obtained, the provisions relating to the increase in the aggregate share reserve and the request changes will not take effect. If such approval is 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
 not obtained, we may continue to grant awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan in accordance with the current share reserve and the current terms under the Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
Securities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans 
The following tables provide information about shares of our common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of awards under all of our existing equity compensation plans as of August 4, 2018.

[END TABLE]
The total number of shares of common stock that may be subject to awards under the Amended Plan will not exceed 86,600,000 shares. Such number of shares is subject to adjustment by the Compensation Committee in the event of a recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend or similar corporate transaction. Such shares may be either authorized or unissued shares or shares held in treasury. The closing market price of a share of our common stock reported on the Nasdaq Global Stock Market on October 12, 2018 was $4.52 per share. 
Any shares of restricted stock or other stock-based awards that are not based solely on stock appreciation following the grant date above the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant (referred to by us as "full share awards") are counted against this limit as 2.3 shares for every share granted. In general, if options or any other stock-based awards that are not full share awards are canceled for any reason, or expire or terminate unexpired, the shares covered by such awards again become available for grant. If a share of restricted stock or another stock-based award that is a full share award is forfeited for any reason, 2.3 shares will again become available for grant. 
The number of shares of common stock available for awards under the Amended Plan will be reduced by the total number of exercisable awards exercised (regardless of whether the shares of common stock underlying such awards are not actually issued as the result of net settlement), and 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
 any shares of common stock used to pay any exercise price or tax withholding obligation with respect to any award. In addition, the Company may not use the cash proceeds it receives from the exercise of an exercisable award to repurchase shares of common stock on the open market for reuse under the Amended Plan. 
Administration 
The Amended Plan is administered by a committee (referred to as the "plan committee"), which with regard to employees and consultants is comprised of not less than two individuals appointed by our Board, each of whom is an "independent director" as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and at least two of whom are "non-employee directors" to the extent required by Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and "outside directors" to the extent required by Section 162(m) of the Code (with respect to awards made prior to the effective date of the TCJA). The Compensation Committee, which meets these requirements, currently serves as the plan committee with regard to employees and consultants. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Carl Rubin, Carrie W. Teffner and Linda Yaccarino. Our Board serves as the plan committee with respect to the application of the Amended Plan to non-employee directors. The plan committee may make such rules and regulations and establish such procedures for the administration of the Amended Plan as it deems advisable. 
A member of the Compensation Committee who does not meet the "non-employee director" standard within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or, to the extent applicable, the "outside director" standard within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code (as in effect prior to the enactment of the TCJA) is required to abstain from the actions of the Compensation Committee, as the Compensation Committee may determine, in order to comply with Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act or, to the extent applicable, Section 162(m) of the Code (as in effect prior to the enactment of the TCJA). The Compensation Committee may also establish a subcommittee of the Compensation Committee that is intended to qualify as a committee consisting solely of two or more "non-employee directors" or, to the extent applicable, "outside directors," and may delegate to such subcommittee all approvals, certifications and administrative and other determinations with respect to compensation intended to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act and/or intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, to the extent applicable. 
Eligibility 
The plan committee may grant awards under the Amended Plan to eligible participants, including employees, certain prospective employees, consultants and non-employee directors. The Company estimates that as of October 17, 2018, there are approximately 3,500 eligible employees, no consultants and 10 non-employee directors who are eligible to participate in the Amended Plan. 
Individual Award Limits 
The plan committee has the discretion, in accordance with the provisions of the Amended Plan, to determine the terms of the award, to whom an award is granted and the number of shares of stock, subject to a maximum grant to an eligible participant in any calendar year of 800,000 option shares and, solely with respect to restricted stock and other stock-based awards intended to be "performance-based" compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code, 800,000 shares (in each case, subject to customary adjustments as provided in the Amended Plan), with any unused portion of the limitation available to be carried forward. In addition, for a performance period that is equal to 12 months or less, the Amended Plan provides that the aggregate amount of performance-based compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of any 12-month period may not exceed $10,000,000 (as may be adjusted proportionately for a performance period that is shorter than 12 months). For a performance period that is longer than 12 months but not loner than 36 months, the Amended Plan provides that the aggregate amount of performance-based compensation to be paid to any one participant in respect of any 36-month period will not exceed $20,000,000 (as may be adjusted proportionately for any performance period that is shorter than 36 months). For non-employee members of our Board, the Amended Plan provides that the aggregate value of stock-based Awards and cash-based compensation granted to any such director in respect of any fiscal year of the Company solely with respect to his or her service as a non-employee director, may not exceed $750,000. 
Awards under the Amended Plan 
Stock Options. An option granted under the Amended Plan may be an incentive stock option (an "ISO") (which may be made solely to an eligible employee of the Company, its subsidiaries or its parent (if any)) or a non-qualified stock option (a "Non-ISO") (which may be made to any participant), as determined at the time of grant. In certain circumstances, the grant of Non-ISOs, as opposed to ISOs, can result in federal income tax advantages to the Company, as described below. 
The exercise price for options may not be less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of the grant of the options. The Amended Plan provides that optionees may pay the exercise price: in cash; by delivery to the Company of shares of the Company's common stock owned by 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
 the participant; solely to the extent permitted by law and authorized by the plan committee, through the delivery of irrevocable instructions to a broker reasonably acceptable to the plan committee to promptly deliver to us an amount equal to the purchase price; on such other terms and conditions as may be acceptable to the plan committee (which may include a reduction in the number of shares of stock issuable upon exercise); or any combination of the foregoing. 
An option may not be exercised later than the date specified by the plan committee, which was a maximum of 10 years from the date of the grant for options granted prior to December 11, 2012 and a maximum of 7 years from the date of the grant for options granted on and after December 11, 2012 (five years from the date of the grant in the case of an ISO granted to any employee that owns 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, its subsidiaries or its parent). Unless otherwise specified in an award agreement, an option may be exercised only during the participant's employment, consultancy or directorship or within one month after termination; provided, however, if such termination occurs as a result of (a) death or total and permanent disability or (b) retirement at age 60 or 65 (depending on the participant's number of years of service), then such one-month period is extended to six months or three months, respectively. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a termination of employment for Cause (as defined in the Amended Plan) or a voluntary termination within 90 days after the occurrence of an event which would be grounds for a termination for Cause, any stock option held by the participant at the time of occurrence of the event which would be grounds for a termination for Cause, will immediately terminate and expire. 
Options granted on or after September 21, 2011 are subject to a minimum three-year vesting schedule, except that unvested options may become vested earlier than under the three-year schedule upon a participant's death, disability, retirement, or termination (as more particularly described in the Amended Plan) or upon a Change in Control, in each case, to the extent provided by the plan committee. Awards with respect to up to 5% of the total number of shares reserved for awards under the Amended Plan (referred to as the allowable basket) may be granted to any participant without regard to any limit on accelerated vesting. 
Restricted Stock. The plan committee may award "restricted" shares of the Company's common stock, which are grants of common stock that are subject to risk of forfeiture or other restrictions. Upon the award of restricted stock, the participant generally has the rights of a stockholder with respect to the right to receive dividends and the right to vote the shares. Unless the plan committee specifies otherwise at the time of the award, the payment of dividends, if any, will be deferred until the expiration of the applicable restriction period. Participants who receive restricted stock are required to enter into a restricted stock agreement with the Company, which sets forth the restrictions to which the shares are subject, including, as applicable, the date or dates on which such restrictions will lapse or any performance criteria to be met for such restrictions to lapse. Awards of restricted stock may or may not be performance based. 
If the grant of restricted stock or the lapse of the relevant restrictions is based on the attainment of performance goals, the plan committee will establish for each participant the applicable performance goals, formulae or standards and the applicable vesting percentages with reference to the attainment of such goals or satisfaction of such formulas or standards while the outcome of the performance goals are substantially uncertain. Unless otherwise determined by the plan committee on the date of grant, upon a participant's termination all unvested restricted stock will be forfeited. 
Subject to the allowable basket, shares of restricted stock granted on or after September 21, 2011 are subject to a minimum two-year vesting schedule, except that unvested shares may become vested earlier than under the two-year schedule upon a participant's death, disability, retirement, or termination (as more particularly described in the Amended Plan) or upon a Change in Control, in each case, to the extent provided by the plan committee. 
Other Stock-Based Awards. The plan committee may, subject to applicable legal limits, make a grant of other stock-based awards. The plan committee determines the terms and conditions of any such other stock-based awards, which may include the achievement of certain minimum performance criteria for purposes of compliance with a minimum vesting period. The performance goals for performance-based other stock-based awards may be based on the attainment of performance goals. The exercise price for any exercisable other stock-based award that is not a full share award may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant and such award may not be exercised later than the date specified by the plan committee, which will be a maximum of 7 years from the date of grant. 
Subject to the allowable basket, other stock-based awards consisting of restricted stock units granted on or after September 21, 2011 are subject to a minimum two-year vesting schedule, except that unvested awards may become vested earlier than under the two-year schedule upon a participant's death, disability, retirement, or termination (as more particularly described in the Amended Plan) or upon a Change in Control, in each case, to the extent provided by the plan committee. 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
Performance-Based Cash Awards. The plan committee may grant performance-based cash awards, which are awards denominated and settled in cash. In addition, such performance goals may be based upon the attainment of specified levels of Company (or subsidiary, division, other operational unit or administrative department of the Company) performance under one or more of the measures described below relative to the performance of other corporations. 
Performance Goals 
As noted above, performance-based awards granted under the Amended Plan will be granted or vest based on attainment of specified performance goals established by the plan committee. These awards will be made in the form of a restricted stock award, other stock-based award or performance-based cash award. The performance goals relating to such awards will be based on one or more of the following criteria selected by the plan committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Such performance goals may incorporate provisions for disregarding (or adjusting for) changes in accounting methods, corporate transactions (including dispositions and acquisitions) and other similar type of events or circumstances. 
Change in Control 
Unless otherwise determined by the plan committee at grant, in the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Amended Plan, which definition can be found on page 59 of this proxy statement): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Awards granted prior to December 17, 2010 will vest upon a Change in Control. However, unless the plan committee  provides otherwise at the time an exercisable award is granted, no acceleration of exercisability will occur with respect to such exercisable award if the plan committee reasonably determines in good faith, prior to the occurrence of such  transaction, that the exercisable award will be honored or assumed, or new rights substituted.  
[END TABLE]

PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
In the event of a merger or consolidation in which the Company is not the surviving corporation or in the event of a transaction that results in the acquisition of all or substantially all of the Company's common stock or assets, the plan committee may elect to terminate all outstanding exercisable awards granted under the Amended Plan, provided that during the period from notification of such termination to the date of consummation of the relevant transaction (which must be at least 20 days) each participant shall have the right to exercise all of his or her exercisable awards in full (without regard to any restrictions on exercisability), contingent on the consummation of such transaction. 
Miscellaneous 
Awards granted under the Amended Plan generally are not transferable, except that the plan committee may, in its sole discretion and subject to certain limitations, permit the transfer of Non-ISOs at the time of grant or thereafter to certain "family members" of the participant. 
No awards may be granted under the Amended Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date the Omnibus Incentive Plan was adopted by the Board. Awards granted prior to such date, however, may extend beyond such date and the provisions of the Amended Plan will continue to apply thereto. 
Our Board may from time to time amend, suspend or terminate the Amended Plan except that the rights of a participant with respect to an award granted prior to such amendment, suspension or termination may not be impaired without the participant's consent and, without stockholder approval, no amendment may be made which increases the aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the Amended Plan, increases the maximum individual limitations, changes the classification of individuals eligible to receive awards, extends the maximum option, amends the Amended Plan or an outstanding award to reduce the exercise price of an exercisable award or cancel out-of-the-money outstanding exercisable awards in exchange for cash, other awards or exercisable awards with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price of the original exercisable award or otherwise requires stockholder approval. Our Board may amend the Amended Plan or any award agreement at any time without a participant's consent to comply with applicable law, including Code Section 409A. 
United States Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following discussion of the principal U.S. federal income tax consequences with respect to stock options granted under the Amended Plan is based on statutory authority and judicial and administrative interpretations as of the date of this proxy statement, which are subject to change at any time (possibly with retroactive effect) and may vary in individual circumstances. The discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences (state, local and other tax consequences are not addressed below) to individuals who are citizens or residents of the U.S., other than those individuals who are taxed on a residence basis in a foreign country. In addition, the following discussion does not set forth any gift, estate, social security or state or local tax consequences that may be applicable. 
The U.S. federal income tax law is technical and complex and the discussion below represents only a general summary. The following summary is included for general information only and does not purport to address all the tax considerations that may be relevant. Each recipient of a grant is urged to consult his or her own tax advisor as to the specific tax consequences to such grantee and the disposition of common stock. 
Incentive Stock Options. The grant or exercise of an ISO generally has no income tax consequences for the optionee or the Company. No taxable income results to the optionee upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. However, the amount by which the fair market value of the stock acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price is an adjustment item and will be considered income for purposes of alternative minimum tax. 
The aggregate fair market value of common stock (determined at the time of grant) with respect to which ISOs can be exercisable for the first time by an optionee during any calendar year cannot exceed $100,000. Any excess will be treated as a non-qualified stock option. 
The sale of common stock received pursuant to the exercise of an option that satisfied all of the ISO requirements, as well as the holding period requirement described below, will result in a long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale and the exercise price. To receive ISO treatment, an optionee must be an employee of the Company (or certain affiliates) at all times during the period beginning on the date of the grant of the ISO and ending on the day three months before the date of exercise, and the optionee must not dispose of the common stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of an option either (i) within two years from the date the ISO was granted, or (ii) within one year from the date of exercise of the ISO. Any gain or loss realized upon a subsequent disposition of the shares will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss to the optionee (depending on the applicable holding period). The Company will not be entitled to a tax deduction upon such exercise of an ISO, or upon a subsequent disposition of the shares, unless such disposition occurs prior to the expiration of the holding period described above. 
PROPOSAL TWO — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENT NUMBER TWO TO THE ASCENA RETAIL GROUP, INC. 2016 OMNIBUS INCENTIVE PLAN 
In general, if the optionee does not satisfy the foregoing holding periods, any gain (in an amount equal to the lesser of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of exercise (or, with respect to officers subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the date that sale of such common stock would not create liability, referred to as Section 16(b) liability, under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act) minus the exercise price, or the amount realized on the disposition minus the exercise price) will constitute ordinary income. In the event of such a disposition before the expiration of the holding periods described above, subject to the limitations under Code Sections 162(m) and 280G (as described below), the Company is generally entitled to a deduction at that time equal to the amount of ordinary income recognized by the optionee. Any gain in excess of the amount recognized by the optionee as ordinary income would be taxed to the optionee as short-term or long-term capital gain (depending on the applicable holding period). 
Non-Qualified Stock Options. In general, an optionee will realize no taxable income upon the grant of a Non-ISO and the Company will not receive a deduction at the time of such grant unless the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value (as determined under applicable tax law) at the time of grant. Upon exercise of a Non-ISO, an optionee generally will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock on the date of exercise over the exercise price. Upon a subsequent sale of the stock by the optionee, the optionee will recognize short- term or long-term capital gain or loss depending upon his or her holding period for the stock. Subject to the limitations under Code Sections 162(m) and 280G, the Company will generally be allowed a deduction equal to the amount recognized by the optionee as ordinary income. 
Section 16(b). Any of our officers and directors subject to Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act may be subject to Section 16(b) liability with regard to both ISOs and Non-ISOs as a result of special tax rules regarding the income tax consequences concerning their stock options. 
Code Section 162(m). In general, Code Section 162(m) denies a deduction to any publicly held corporation for compensation paid to certain "covered employees" in its taxable year to the extent that such compensation exceeds $1,000,000. "Covered employees" are a company's chief executive officer and the chief financial officer at any time during the taxable year and certain former and current executive officers of the company, including certain individuals whose compensation is or was required to be reported to stockholders in the Company's proxy statement under the Exchange Act. 
Parachute Payments. In the event that the payment or vesting of any award under the Amended Plan is accelerated because of a change in ownership (as defined in Code Section 280G(b)(2)) and such payment of an award, either alone or together with any other payments made to certain participants, constitute parachute payments under Code Section 280G, then subject to certain exceptions, a portion of such payments would be nondeductible to the Company and the participant would be subject to a 20% excise tax on such portion of the payment. 
Code Section 409A. Code Section 409A provides that all amounts deferred under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan are includible in a participant's gross income to the extent such amounts are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, unless certain requirements are satisfied. If the requirements are not satisfied, in addition to current income inclusion, interest at the underpayment rate plus 1% will be imposed on the participant's underpayments that would have occurred had the deferred compensation been includible in gross income for the taxable year in which first deferred or, if later, the first taxable year in which such deferred compensation is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture. The amount required to be included in income is also subject to an additional 20% tax. While most awards under the Amended Plan are anticipated to be exempt from the requirements of Code Section 409A, awards that are not exempt are intended to comply with Code Section 409A. 
New Plan Benefits 
The benefits that will be awarded or paid under the Amended Plan are not currently determinable. Awards granted under the Amended Plan are within the discretion of the Board or compensation committee, and neither the Board or compensation committee has determined future awards or who might receive them. 
Vote Required 
This proposed amendment of the Omnibus Incentive Plan will be approved if the votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast in opposition of the proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. 
PROPOSAL THREE — RESOLUTION ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
SUMMARY OF THE ADVISORY RESOLUTION 
The Company seeks your advisory vote on the compensation programs of our NEOs for fiscal 2018 pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act (which was added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and the related SEC rules promulgated thereunder) (commonly referred to as "Say-on-Pay"). The Company asks that you support the compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the accompanying tables contained in this proxy statement starting on page 22. 
Our compensation program for executives including our NEOs is designed to attract and retain quality leaders with an emphasis on pay-for-performance and creating long-term sustainable and profitable growth. Our compensation elements seek to balance all aspects of an executive's responsibilities: base salary for day-to-day responsibilities; cash incentive bonus for shorter-term returns linked to semi-annual Company performance; and equity awards for aligning the executives' focus with stockholder value and the long-term, future performance of the Company. 
As noted above, at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders were presented with an advisory vote seeking approval of our fiscal 2017 NEOs executive compensation program, commonly known as the "say-on-pay" proposal. Our 2013 and 2014 say-on-pay proposals were overwhelmingly supported by stockholders with a favorable vote of over 92% of votes cast each year. At our 2015 Annual Meeting, approximately 57% of the votes cast were in favor of our executive compensation program as disclosed in our proxy statement for fiscal 2015, which included favorable votes from three of our top five largest investors (representing over 21.1% of shares outstanding). While fiscal 2015 say-on-pay results reflect continued majority support of our program, this level of support was a significant decline from the prior year's advisory vote. As a result of the changes made to our compensation practices and stockholder engagement, our 2016 say-on-pay proposal was overwhelmingly supported by stockholders with a favorable vote of over 98% of votes cast. At our 2017 Annual Meeting, the Company continued to receive significant favorable stockholder support of its compensation program with a favorable vote in excess of 91% of votes cast. As noted above, we believe we have addressed many of the topics previously raised by our stockholders and continue to welcome feedback to assist in ongoing evaluations of our compensation and governance practices. 
To ensure a pay-for-performance culture and strong alignment between our executive compensation programs and shareholder interests, the Compensation Committee approved a series of key tenets of our programs. These key features are detailed in the Compensation Discussion & Analysis under "What We Do" and "What We Don't Do". These program principles promote best practices, transparency and accountability regarding executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee continuously reviews industry practices, receives independent consultation and ensures the programs adhere to these key features. 
The Company believes that the compensation paid to its NEOs for fiscal 2018 is appropriate and in line with the Company's goals of creating long-term sustainable and profitable growth and aligning the interests of our NEOs with the interests of our stockholders. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific elements of compensation, rather, the vote relates to the overall compensation of the NEOs as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, to the extent there is any significant vote against the NEO compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of stockholders. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends that the stockholders approve the following advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs for fiscal 2018, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved. 
Vote Required 
The say-on-pay proposal will be approved, by non-binding advisory vote, if the votes cast in favor of the proposal exceed the votes cast in opposition of the proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. 
PROPOSAL FOUR — APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S SECOND AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED 
The Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee conducted a review of the Company's Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the "Existing Certificate"), to determine whether any provisions should be amended in light of current law or market practices. After careful consideration and review of the Existing Certificate, the Board, based on the recommendation of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee, determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend and restate the Existing Certificate to incorporate the changes described below. We refer to the Existing Certificate with the proposed amendments described below as the "Restated Certificate." If the proposal to approve the Restated Certificate is approved by the requisite vote of the Company's stockholders, we intend to file the Restated Certificate with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly after the Annual Meeting, at which time it will be effective immediately. 
Proposed Changes to the Existing Certificate 
The Board, based on the recommendation of the Leadership and Corporate Governance Committee, adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable, and recommending that the Company's stockholders approve, the Restated Certificate, as more fully reflected on Annex B (the text of which is subject to revision for such changes as may be required by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or other changes consistent with this Proposal Four that we deem necessary or appropriate). The proposed changes to the Existing Certificate are intended to combine into one document a prior amendment and make the change described below. 
Section 11(c) of the Existing Certificate provides that members of the Board may be removed from office only (1) for cause, by the remaining directors, or (2) with or without cause, by stockholder action, at a meeting of stockholders called for that purpose, by vote of at least 80 percent of the shares of capital stock then entitled to vote at an election of directors. Section 11(c) of the Restated Certificate amends Section 11(c) of the Existing Certificate to delete the language referring to directors having the ability to remove other directors from the board of directors for cause. 
Reasons and Effect of the Proposed Changes 
Under Section 141(k) of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"), directors are not authorized to remove other directors from the board of directors; such power is reserved for the stockholders of the Company. We are seeking to amend Section 11(c) of the Existing Certificate to delete the language referring to directors having the ability to remove other directors from the board of directors for cause to conform with the DGCL. This amendment would not affect the right of the Company's stockholders to remove directors as currently set forth in the Existing Certificate. 
Vote Required 
This proposal to amend and restate the Existing Certificate will be approved if the holders of at least 80% of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting vote in favor of the proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. 
PROPOSAL FIVE — RATIFICATION OF THE ENGAGEMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche") to provide audit services to us and our subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending August 3, 2019. The stockholders are being requested to ratify such selection at the Annual Meeting. A representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and make any statements he or she deem necessary and to respond to appropriate stockholder questions. 
Vote Required 
Although this appointment is not required to be submitted to a vote of the stockholders, the Audit Committee believes it is appropriate as a matter of policy to request that the stockholders ratify the appointment. Assuming a quorum is present, the appointment of Deloitte & Touche as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the fiscal year ending August 3, 2019 will be ratified if the votes cast in favor of ratification exceed the votes cast in opposition to ratification, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will consider the selection of another independent registered public accounting firm. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING AUGUST 3, 2019. 
INFORMATION REGARDING THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has established a policy concerning the pre-approval of the audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Company. The policy requires that all services to be performed by Deloitte & Touche, including audit services, audit-related services and permitted non-audit services, be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Specific services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm are regularly reviewed in accordance with the pre-approval policy. At subsequent 
PROPOSAL FIVE — RATIFICATION OF THE ENGAGEMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 Audit Committee meetings, the Audit Committee receives updates on services being provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, and management may present additional services for approval. The procedures permit limited amounts of services to be approved by one or more members of the Audit Committee pursuant to authority delegated by the Audit Committee. 
During fiscal 2018, the Audit Committee pre-approved all of the services provided by the auditors. The Audit Committee considered whether the provision of non-audit services is permitted under applicable laws and regulations and is compatible with maintaining the independence of Deloitte & Touche. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The following report of the Audit Committee does not constitute soliciting material and will not be deemed to be filed with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or incorporated by reference into any document so filed except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates this Audit Committee Report by reference therein. 
The Audit Committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting, internal controls and audit processes on behalf of the Board and is directly responsible for the compensation, appointment and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of our financial statements and for the appropriateness of the accounting principles and reporting policies that are used. Management is also responsible for testing the system of internal control over financial reporting, and reports to the Audit Committee on any deficiencies found. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche, is responsible for auditing our consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, as well as examining and reporting on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Under its written charter, our Audit Committee has the authority to conduct any investigation appropriate to fulfilling its responsibilities, has direct access to our independent registered public accounting firm as well as any of our employees, and has the ability to retain, at our expense, special legal, accounting or other consultants or experts it deems necessary in the performance of its duties. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the overall scope, plan and results of the audit and the audited consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018 with management, our Internal Audit Department and Deloitte & Touche. The discussions included a review of the selection and application of the Company's accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, the clarity of the disclosures in the Company's financial statements and any matters that are required to be discussed under the rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee has received from Deloitte & Touche the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants' communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and discussed with Deloitte & Touche their independence from management and the Company. We have received written confirmation from Deloitte & Touche of their independence within the meaning of the Securities Act and the requirements of PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by Deloitte & Touche is compatible with maintaining their independence, and has satisfied itself with respect to Deloitte & Touche's independence. 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 4, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
This report is provided by the following directors, who constitute the fiscal 2018 Audit Committee, other than Randy L. Pearce, who retired from the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee on October 4, 2018.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Our executive officers and directors are required under the Exchange Act to file reports of ownership of common stock of the Company with the SEC. Copies of those reports must also be furnished to the Company. Based solely on a review of the copies of reports furnished to the Company and written representations that no other reports were required, the Company believes that during fiscal 2018 the executive officers and directors of the Company timely complied with all applicable filing requirements. 
INTEREST OF MANAGEMENT AND OTHERS IN CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS; RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
In September 2007, the Board adopted a written policy for the review and approval or ratification of any transaction with a related person, which applies to related person transactions after the adoption date of the policy. Under this policy, related persons include our directors and executive officers and beneficial owners who are known to control over five percent of our common stock, as well as the immediate family members of any of the foregoing. The policy generally defines a related person transaction as one or a series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships in which: (i) the Company was, is or will be a participant; (ii) a related person has a direct or indirect material interest; and (iii) the amount involved exceeds or is expected to exceed $120,000 (determined without regard to the amount of profit or loss involved in the transaction). The policy does not cover arrangements available on the same basis to all employees generally or employment or compensation arrangements for our executive officers or director compensation arrangements. 
Under the policy, a related person transaction requires the approval or ratification of the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee in those situations in which the legal department, in consultation with the CEO or the CFO, determines that it is not practicable or desirable for us to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting for review. Prior to approving or ratifying any transaction, the Audit Committee or the Chair will consider the material facts of the transaction, including the related person's relationship to us and their interest in the transaction, and will determine whether the transaction is entered into in good faith and on fair and reasonable terms to us. Under the policy, ongoing related person transactions need not be re-approved unless any of the terms of such transaction are modified. No person may participate in the review of a transaction in which such person, or any of his or her immediate family members, may have a direct or indirect material interest. 
During fiscal 2018, no transactions were reviewed by the Audit Committee since there were no new related person transactions, or any modifications to existing related person transactions, during fiscal 2018. 
See above under the heading "Employment Letters and Retirement Agreements," for a description of our retirement agreements with Mrs. Roslyn S. Jaffe and Mr. Elliot S. Jaffe. Mrs. Jaffe is the spouse of Elliot S. Jaffe, Chairman Emeritus and a founder of our Company, and they are the parents of David Jaffe, a director, Chairman and our CEO, Elise Jaffe, a non-executive officer and a more than 5% stockholder, and Richard Jaffe, a significant holder of the Company's stock. 
The Company (through one of its subsidiary brands) leases two of its store locations from Nordan, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Rosell III, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, of which various trusts in the names of the grandchildren of Elliot S. Jaffe maintain a 100% ownership interest. David Jaffe, our Chairman and CEO, and Richard Jaffe are trustees of those trusts and managers of Rosell III, LLC. The following table describes the terms of these leases:

The Board of Directors is further authorized to increase (but not above the total number of authorized shares of the class) or decrease (but not below the number of shares of any such series then outstanding) the number of shares of any series, the number of which was fixed by it, subsequent to the issuance of shares of such series then outstanding, subject to the powers, preferences and rights, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof stated in the resolution of the Board of Directors originally fixing the number of shares of such series.

Section 5. The Corporation is to have perpetual existence. 
Section 6. Except as otherwise expressly provided by the terms of any series of Preferred Stock permitting the holders of such series of Preferred Stock to act by written consent, any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of the stockholders and may not be effected by written consent in lieu of a meeting.

Section 7. No director shall be personally liable to the Corporation or any of its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended. If the DGCL is amended hereafter to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL, as so amended.
