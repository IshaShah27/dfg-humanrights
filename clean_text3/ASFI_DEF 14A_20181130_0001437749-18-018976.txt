ASTA FUNDING, INC.  210 Sylvan Avenue  Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632  ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  November 30, 2018
PROXY STATEMENT
GENERAL INFORMATION
The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board of Directors of Asta Funding, Inc. (the "Company," "we" or "us") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at the Crowne Plaza Englewood, 401 South Van Brunt Street, Englewood, New Jersey 07631 on Friday, November 30, 2018, at 10:00 AM, eastern standard time, and at any adjournments, postponements or continuations thereof (the "Meeting") for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A stockholder giving a proxy has the right to revoke it by giving written notice of such revocation to the Secretary of the Company at any time before it is voted, by submitting to the Company a duly-executed, later-dated proxy, or by voting the shares subject to such proxy by written ballot at the Meeting. The presence at the Meeting of a stockholder who has given a proxy does not revoke such proxy unless such stockholder files the aforementioned notice of revocation or votes by written ballot.
This proxy statement, the enclosed form of proxy and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017, which includes our consolidated financial statements, are first being mailed to stockholders beginning on November 1, 2018. All shares represented by valid proxies pursuant to this solicitation (and not revoked before they are exercised) will be voted as specified in the proxy. Proxy cards that are returned signed, but without voting instructions, will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" each of the nominees listed in Proposal 1 above, a vote "FOR" Proposals 2 and 3 listed above, and a vote, on Proposal 4, for an advisory (and non-binding) vote on executive compensation to be held every three years.
The solicitation of proxies may be made by directors, officers and regular employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries by mail, telephone, facsimile or e-mail or in person without additional compensation payable with respect thereto. Arrangements will be made with brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy-soliciting material to the beneficial owners of stock held of record by such persons, and we will reimburse them for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in so doing. All costs relating to the solicitation of proxies will be borne by us including expenses in connection with the preparation and mailing of the proxy statement, form of proxy and any other material furnished to the stockholders by us in connection with the Meeting.
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to Be Held on November 30, 2018. 
This proxy statement, the accompanying form of proxy card and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, including financial statements, are available on the internet at http://www.astproxyportal.com/ast/07745/. Under the rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are providing access to our proxy materials both by sending you this full set of proxy materials and by making our proxy materials available to you free of charge on the Internet.
VOTING AT THE MEETING
Who Can Vote
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on October 11, 2018, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Meeting, and at any postponement(s), adjournment(s) or continuations thereof. As of the record date, 6,685,415 shares of our Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), were issued and outstanding. Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share for each proposal presented at the Meeting.
How to Vote; How Proxies Work
Our Board of Directors is asking for your proxy. Whether or not you plan to attend the Meeting, we urge you to vote by proxy in advance of the Meeting. Please complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and return it at your earliest convenience. Instead of using the paper proxy card provided along with this proxy statement, you may vote over the Internet. If you have Internet access you may vote your shares by following the Internet instructions on the proxy card. If you hold your shares through a broker or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided to you by that broker or other nominee to vote.
Any proxy signed and returned to us and not specifying to the contrary, and not designated as an abstention as described below, will be voted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the election of each of the director nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the ratification of the selection of EisnerAmper LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR (in a non-binding and advisory capacity) the approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● THREE YEARS (in a non-binding and advisory capacity) on the frequency by which the non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation will be held.  
[END TABLE]
Should any matters not described above be properly presented at the Meeting, the persons named in the proxy card will vote in accordance with their judgment. The proxy card authorizes these persons, in their discretion, to vote upon such matters as may properly be brought before the Meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof.
What Constitutes a Quorum
The presence at the Meeting in person or by proxy of holders of outstanding Common Stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting will constitute a quorum.
What Vote is Required
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast with a quorum present. The five persons who receive the greatest number of votes of the holders of Common Stock represented in person or by proxy at the Meeting will be elected directors of the Company. The affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote is required to approve: (i) the ratification of the selection of EisnerAmper LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year and (ii) on a non-binding advisory basis, the approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers. With regard to the frequency by which the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers will be held, the frequency (i.e., every year, every two years or every three years) receiving the majority, or, if no frequency receives a majority, the plurality, of the votes cast with a quorum present will be approved on a non-binding advisory basis.
How Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes Are Treated
Abstentions will be counted as shares that are present for purposes of determining a quorum. For (i) the election of directors and (ii) the proposal regarding the frequency by which the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers will be held, abstentions do not have any effect on the outcome. For (i) the ratification of the selection of EisnerAmper LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2018 fiscal year and (ii) the vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to our named executive officers, abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the proposal.
Broker non-votes occur when a broker or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not have discretionary voting power on a matter and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Broker non-votes are included in the determination of the number of shares represented at the Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. If you hold your shares through a broker or other nominee and do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your "street name" shares, your broker or nominee will not be permitted to vote them on non-routine matters, which are Proposals 1, 3 and 4, resulting in broker non-votes for these proposals. Shares subject to a broker non-vote will not be considered entitled to vote with respect to Proposals 1, 3 and 4, and thus will not affect the outcome of Proposals 1, 3 and 4. Brokers have discretionary authority to vote for the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 2) and, therefore, if you do not provide your broker or other nominee with instructions on how to vote your "street name" shares, your broker or nominee is permitted to vote them on Proposal 2 and there will be no broker non-votes on Proposal 2.
How to Revoke
Any person giving a proxy in the form accompanying this proxy statement has the power to revoke it at any time before its exercise at the Meeting. The proxy may be revoked by filing with our Secretary, at 210 Sylvan Avenue, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey 07632, an instrument of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or by electing to vote in person at the Meeting. A stockholder who attends the Meeting need not revoke the proxy and vote in person unless he or she wishes to do so. The mere presence at the Meeting of the person appointing a proxy does not, however, revoke the appointment. If you are a stockholder whose shares are not registered in your own name, you will need additional documentation from your record holder to vote personally at the Meeting.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF MANAGEMENT AND CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS

The Business Experience and Qualifications of Each Director
We believe that our Board of Directors should be composed of individuals with sophistication and experience in many substantive areas that impact our business. We believe that experience, qualifications, or skills in the following areas are most important: experience in the distressed consumer credit industry; regulatory; accounting and finance; capital markets; strategic planning; human resources and development practices; and board practices of other corporations. These areas are in addition to the personal qualifications described in this section. We believe that all of the current members of our Board of Directors possess the professional and personal qualifications necessary for board service, and have highlighted particularly noteworthy attributes for each such member in the individual biographies below. The principal occupation and business experience, for at least the past five years, of each current director is as follows:

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN PROPOSAL ONE.
PROPOSAL TWO-RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
On March 9, 2017, the Audit Committee approved the dismissal of Mazars USA LLP ("Mazars") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Such dismissal was effective after Mazars's review of the Company's unaudited quarterly financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 and the filing of the related Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q with the SEC on May 10, 2017. Also on March 9, 2017, after reviewing proposals from several accounting firms, the Audit Committee selected EisnerAmper LLP ("EisnerAmper") to be appointed following the filing of the Form 10-Q related to the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. 
The audit report of Mazars on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 30, 2016, did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion with respect to the Company's financial statements, nor was such report qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.
During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through May 10, 2017, there were no disagreements with Mazars on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to its satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference in connection with its opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement.
During the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through May 10, 2017, were no "reportable events" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. However, on September 18, 2018, the Company filed Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, for the purpose of amending and restating certain of the Company's previously issued financial statements. In connection with the restatement, Mazars re-audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 and 2016, and expressed an adverse opinion thereon due to the presence of several material weaknesses, each as described more fully therein. Such material weaknesses constituted "reportable events" as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee has discussed these material weaknesses with Mazars and EisnerAmper, and has authorized Mazars to respond fully to the inquiries of EisnerAmper concerning such material weaknesses.
During the Company's fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, and the subsequent interim period through May 10, 2017, the Company did not consult with EisnerAmper regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item 304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. 
The Company provided Mazars a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested that Mazars furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether or not Mazars agrees with the statements made herein. A copy of that letter, dated October 12, 2018, was furnished as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017.
Our Audit Committee has the responsibility to select, retain and oversee the work of outside auditors and, when appropriate, to replace the outside auditors. Stockholder ratification of the appointment of EisnerAmper LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 is not required by law, by the NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements or by our Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws. However, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of EisnerAmper LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance and practice. If the stockholders fail to ratify the appointment, we will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the selection is ratified, we may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm in the future, if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.
A representative of EisnerAmper LLP is expected to be present at the Meeting, will make such statements as EisnerAmper LLP may desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from the stockholders. A representative from Mazars will not be present at the Meeting. To pass, this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Stock present in person or by proxy at the Meeting and entitled to vote.
The fees billed by EisnerAmper LLP for professional services rendered for the period from March 9, 2017, the date of its appointment, through the end of the 2017 fiscal year are reflected in the following table:

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act") rules generally require any engagement by a public company of an accountant to provide audit or non-audit services to be pre-approved by the audit committee of that company. This pre-approval requirement is waived with respect to the provision of services other than audit, review or attest services if certain conditions as set forth in Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) under the Exchange Act are met. All of the services described above were pre-approved by our Audit Committee and, therefore, were not provided pursuant to a waiver of the pre-approval requirements set forth in such rule.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF EISNERAMPER LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM.
PROPOSAL THREE-ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank"), enacted in July 2010, requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding and advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.
We seek to closely align the interests of our named executive officers with the interests of our stockholders. Our compensation programs are designed to reward our named executive officers for the achievement of individual goals and the achievement of certain Company-wide goals such as increased total stockholder return, while at the same time avoiding the encouragement of unnecessary or excessive risk-taking.
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather the vote relates to the compensation paid to our named executive officers in its entirety, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, its Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. To the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of our stockholders.
We urge stockholders to read the "Executive Compensation" section of this proxy statement, which provides detailed information on our compensation policies and practices and the compensation of our named executive officers.
We ask our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Executive Compensation" section of the Proxy Statement, and the compensation tables and narrative discussion set forth therein, is hereby approved."
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.
PROPOSAL FOUR-ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF AN ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Dodd-Frank also provides that our stockholders must be given the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, for their preferences as to how frequently we should seek future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the executive compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, which we refer to as an advisory vote on executive compensation. By voting with respect to this Proposal 4, our stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer that we conduct future advisory votes on executive compensation once every one, two, or three years. Our stockholders also may, if they wish, abstain from casting a vote on this proposal.
After careful consideration, our Board of Directors has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs once every three years is the most appropriate alternative for the Company and, therefore, our Board recommends that you vote for a three-year interval for the advisory vote on executive compensation. In determining to recommend that our stockholders vote for a frequency of once every three years, the Board considered how an advisory vote at this frequency will provide our stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our overall compensation philosophy, policies and practices in the context of our long-term results for the corresponding period, while avoiding over-emphasis on short term variations in compensation and business results. An advisory vote occurring once every three years will also permit our stockholders to observe and evaluate the impact of any changes to our executive compensation policies and practices which have occurred since the last advisory vote on executive compensation, including changes made in response to the outcome of a prior advisory vote on executive compensation. We will continue to engage with our stockholders regarding our executive compensation program during the period between advisory votes on executive compensation.
We recognize that our stockholders may have different views as to the best approach for the Company. Accordingly, we look forward to hearing from our stockholders as to their preferences on the frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation. When this frequency vote was last held in 2012, our stockholders indicated a preference to hold the advisory vote to approve executive compensation once every three years, and the Board and Compensation Committee implemented that standard.
This vote is advisory and not binding on us or our Board of Directors in any way. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote, however, when considering the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. The Board may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the frequency receiving the most votes cast by our stockholders.
Stockholders may cast a vote on the preferred voting frequency by selecting the option of one year, two years, or three years (or abstain) when voting in response to the resolution set forth below.
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders determine, on a non-binding, advisory basis, whether the preferred frequency of an advisory vote on the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers as set forth in the Company's proxy statement should be every year, every two years, or every three years."
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE OPTION OF ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS AS THE PREFERRED FREQUENCY FOR ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
The following are the executive officers of the Company who are not directors of the Company:
Bruce R. Foster, CPA, age 58, serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company since March 2016.

There are no events or legal proceedings material to an evaluation of the ability or integrity of any executive officer of the Company. Moreover, no executive officer of the Company is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company in any legal proceeding.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
We are currently considered a smaller reporting company for purposes of the SEC's executive compensation disclosure rules. In accordance with such rules, we are required to provide a Summary Compensation Table (reporting two fiscal years of compensation) and an Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End Table, as well as limited narrative disclosures. Further, current reporting obligations extend only to our "Named Executive Officers" with respect to the 2017 year, which included Mr. Gary Stern, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our two most highly compensated executive officers other than Mr. Gary Stern, Messrs. Foster and Berman, who were serving as of September 30, 2017. Additionally, while we are not required to disclose compensation for any other executive officers, we are choosing to voluntarily report compensation paid to Ricky Stern because he is considered an integral part of the Company's executive management team as the manager of GAR Disability Advocates, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Narrative Following Summary Compensation Table
Total compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers is generally divided among three principal components. Base salary is generally fixed and does not vary based on our financial and other performance. Other components, such as cash bonuses and stock options or other equity or equity-based awards, are variable and dependent upon our market performance. Historically, judgments about these elements have been made subjectively. In the case of stock options, the value is dependent upon our future stock price and, accordingly, such awards are intended to reward the Named Executive Officers for favorable Company-wide performance. Our Compensation Committee reviews total compensation to see if it falls in line with peer companies and may also look at overall market data. For fiscal year 2017, the Compensation Committee determined that our compensation program was generally competitive with the members of our peer group. Our goal to promote pay for performance emphasizes the variable elements of overall compensation over fixed base salaries. In this regard, it is our policy to emphasize long-term equity awards over short-term cash bonuses, as the long-term awards are intended to align with goals such as total shareholder return. In previous years, the Compensation Committee engaged a professional compensation consultant, Adams Consulting Group, LLC ("Adams") to provide benchmarking data and assist in the compensation process. Adams issued a report to the Compensation Committee in October 2015 (the "2015 Adams Report"). Each of the three elements of executive compensation has been determined by evaluating the recommendations set forth in the 2015 Adams Report, as well as our analysis of our financial performance, overall economic conditions and certain individual achievements, such as successful completion of assigned tasks. 
With respect to the 2017 year, we held base salaries consistent with 2016 levels. We did not grant stock options or other equity-based compensation awards to our Named Executive Officers during the 2017 year, although each of our Named Executive Officers held outstanding stock option awards as detailed below. Our executive bonuses are dependent on meeting corporate objectives. Our annual performance-based bonus opportunities for all of our Named Executive Officers are dependent upon our achievement of annual corporate objectives established each year and, in the case of our Named Executive Officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the individual officer's contributions towards such corporate objectives. Our Board of Directors may choose to award additional bonuses based on significant corporate achievements that occur during the year. We maintain a reasonable limit on the maximum performance bonus that may be paid.
Severance and Change-in-Control Benefits. Currently, we have an employment agreement with our Chief Financial Officer, Bruce R. Foster. None of our other Named Executive Officers are providing services under an employment agreement, and would not receive severance benefits pursuant to any formal plan or program. Under his agreement, Mr. Foster will receive a base salary of $275,000, subject to annual increase, and be eligible to receive cash and non-cash bonuses at the discretion of the Board of Directors or a duly constituted committee of the Board. He will also be entitled to participate in any other benefit plans established by the Company for executive employees. Mr. Foster's agreement has an 18 month non-compete and non-solicitation provision. The agreement has a one (1) year term, and the term will be extended by one year on each anniversary date of the agreement unless either party, at least 90 days prior to an anniversary dates, provides the other party with notice of its intention not to extend the term of the agreement. Under the agreement, Mr. Foster can be terminated with or without "cause," as defined in the agreement. In the event he is terminated without "cause," he will receive severance equal to three (3) months of his then current base salary. In the event of a change in control of the Company, Mr. Foster will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times his then current base salary.

BOARD ORGANIZATION AND MEETINGS
Composition of the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has also determined that the following members of the Board satisfy the NASDAQ definition of independence: Mark Levenfus, David Slackman and Timothy Bishop. Harvey Leibowitz and Edward Celano were determined to be independent prior to their departures from the Board.
During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Board of Directors held 33 meetings, the Audit Committee held five meetings, the Compensation Committee held two meetings, and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, all members of the Board of Directors, when acting in such capacity, attended at least 75% of all meetings of the Board of Directors that such director was eligible to attend, and of all meetings of committees of the Board of Directors of which such director was a member. Our policy states that all Board members should attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and all directors attended our Annual Meeting held on May 19, 2017.
Board's Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight. The Board of Directors is currently comprised of five directors, three of whom satisfy the NASDAQ definition of independence: Mark Levenfus, David Slackman and Timothy Bishop. Our Board of Directors currently believes that our Company is best served by combining the roles of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors believes that as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Stern is the director most familiar with our business and industry, and most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities and leading discussion and execution of strategy. Our independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside our company, while our Chief Executive Officer brings company-specific experience and expertise. Our Board of Directors believes that the combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is the best leadership structure for the Company at the current time as it promotes the efficient and effective development and execution of our strategy and facilitates information flow between management and our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors recognizes, however, that no single leadership model is right for all companies at all times. Accordingly, the Board of Directors intends to periodically review its leadership structure.
On January 6, 2017, the Company adopted an amendment to its Amended and Restated By-laws (the "Amendment"). The Amendment provides that the Board of Directors shall elect a lead independent director from its Board of Directors. The lead independent director executes the following functions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● with the Chairman of the Board of Directors, establishes the agenda for regular meetings of the Board of Directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● establishes the agenda for, and presides over, meetings of independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● presides over any portions of meetings of the Board of Directors at which the evaluation or compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is presented or discussed;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● presides over any portions of meetings of the Board of Directors at which the performance of the Board of Directors is discussed; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● exercises other such powers and duties as the Board of Directors may, from time to time, determine in accordance with applicable law.  
[END TABLE]
Currently, David Slackman serves as lead independent director. The Amendment will remain in effect until January 6, 2019, and shall cease to be in effect after such date.
The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing and monitoring the material risks facing the Company. In its oversight role, the Board of Directors regularly reviews the Company's strategic initiatives, which address, among other things, the risks and opportunities facing the Company. The Board of Directors also has overall responsibility for executive officer succession planning and reviews succession plans from time to time. The Board of Directors has delegated certain risk management oversight responsibility to its committees. The Audit Committee plays an important risk management function, and oversees elements of compliance and legal risk.
Compensation Committee Matters
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee consists of David Slackman (Chairman) and Mark Levenfus. The Compensation Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to review the executive compensation of our officers and directors and to recommend any changes in compensation to the full Board of Directors. As noted above, both members of the Compensation Committee have been determined to be "independent" within the meaning of SEC and NASDAQ regulations. As required under NASDAQ Rule 5605(d)(1), the Compensation Committee assesses the adequacy of its charter on an annual basis.
Compensation Committee Charter. The Board of Directors has adopted a Compensation Committee charter to govern its Compensation Committee. Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee may delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to one or more subcommittees when appropriate. The Compensation Committee charter is available on our website at www.astafunding.com.
Audit Committee Matters
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee consists of Mark Levenfus (Chairman), David Slackman and Timothy Bishop. The Audit Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to, among other things: serve as an independent and objective party to monitor our financial reporting process, internal control system and disclosure control system; review and appraise the audit efforts of our independent accountants; assume direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of the work of the outside auditors and for the resolution of disputes between the outside auditors and our management regarding financial reporting issues; and provide an open avenue of communication among the independent accountants, financial and senior management, and the Board of Directors.
Audit Committee Financial Expert. The Board of Directors has determined that Mark Levenfus is an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined by the SEC. As noted above, Mr. Levenfus, as well as the other members of the Audit Committee, have been determined to be "independent" within the meaning of SEC and NASDAQ regulations.
Audit Committee Charter. The Audit Committee performed its duties during fiscal year 2017 under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee charter is available on our website at www.astafunding.com.
Independence of Audit Committee Members. Our Common Stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are governed by the listing standards applicable thereto. All members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have been determined to be "independent directors" pursuant to the definition contained in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules and under the Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act.
Audit Committee Report. In connection with the preparation and filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017:

Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Audit Committee Members:  Mark Levenfus (Chairman)  David Slackman  Timothy Bishop
The foregoing report of the Audit Committee is not to be deemed "soliciting material" or deemed to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, except to the extent specifically requested by us or incorporated by reference in documents otherwise filed.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Matters
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee ("Governance Committee"). The Governance Committee consists of Timothy Bishop (Chairman), Mark Levenfus and David Slackman. Pursuant to its charter, the Governance Committee is empowered by the Board of Directors to, among other things, recommend to the Board of Directors qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors and to identify the manner in which the Governance Committee evaluates nominees recommended for the Board.
Independence of Governance Committee Members. Members of the Governance Committee of the Board of Directors have been determined to be "independent directors" pursuant to the definition contained in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the NASDAQ Listing Rules.
Procedures for Considering Nominations Made by Stockholders. The Governance Committee's charter and guidelines developed by the Governance Committee describe procedures for nominations to be submitted by stockholders and other third-parties, other than candidates who have previously served on the Board of Directors or who are recommended by the Board of Directors. The guidelines state that a nomination must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at our principal executive offices not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, notice to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by us. The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting will not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a notice as described above. The guidelines require a nomination notice to set forth as to each person whom the proponent proposes to nominate for election as a director: (a) all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, as amended (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and (b) information that will enable the Governance Committee to determine whether the candidate or candidates satisfy the criteria established pursuant to the charter and the guidelines for director candidates.
Qualifications. The charter and guidelines developed by the Governance Committee describe the minimum qualifications for nominees and the qualities or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. Each nominee:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Governance Committee Charter. The Governance Committee performed its duties during fiscal year 2017 under a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. The Governance Committee charter is available on our website at www.astafunding.com.

We assist our directors and Section 16 officers in making their Section 16(a) filings pursuant to powers of attorney granted by our directors and Section 16 officers on the basis of information obtained from them and our records. Based solely on a review of the reports furnished to us, or written representations from reporting persons that all reportable transaction were reported, we believe that during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, all of our officers, directors and greater than ten percent owners timely filed all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a).

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Procedures for the Approval of Related Person Transactions
While the Company does not have a written policy, the Audit Committee Charter provides that the Audit Committee has the authority to establish, and communicate to the full Board and management, policies that restrict us and our affiliates from entering into related person transactions without the Audit Committee's prior review and approval. In accordance with these policies, the Audit Committee on a timely basis reviews and, if appropriate, approves all related person transactions.
At any time in which an executive officer, director or nominee for director becomes aware of any contemplated or existing transaction that, in that person's judgment may be a related person transaction, the executive officer, director or nominee for director is expected to notify the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the transaction. Generally, the Chairman of the Audit Committee reviews any reported transaction and may consult with outside legal counsel regarding whether the transaction is, in fact, a related person transaction requiring approval by the Audit Committee. If the transaction is considered to be a related person transaction, then the Audit Committee will review the transaction at its next scheduled meeting or at a special meeting of the committee.
Related Person Transactions
On December 28, 2011, the Company, through a newly-formed indirect subsidiary, ASFI Pegasus Holdings, LLC ("APH"), entered into a joint venture (the "Venture") with Pegasus Legal Funding, LLC ("PLF") to form Pegasus Funding, LLC ("Pegasus") for a period of five (5) years (the "Term") in accordance with an Operating Agreement between PLF and APH. The Venture purchases interests in personal injury claims from claimants who are a party to a personal injury litigation with the expectation of a settlement in the future. In connection with the Venture, Piccolo Business Advisory, which is owned by Louis Piccolo, a non-independent director of the Company, receives a fee from Pegasus, which is calculated at $350,000 per $10,000,000 loaned to Pegasus by Fund Pegasus, LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, up to a maximum of $700,000, including interest at 4% per annum, payable over six years with payments being made in part from Pegasus's operating expenses during the Term and thereafter by PLF and its affiliates. Piccolo Business Advisory has been paid $690,000 as of September 30, 2017. One of the Company's subsidiaries is advancing to Pegasus funds to cover Pegasus's operating expenses, which include payments to Piccolo Business Advisory. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid Piccolo Business Advisory $133,000 in each year. The Company paid its final payment to Piccolo Business Advisory in March 2018, and has no further obligations under this arrangement.
On September 17, 2015, the Company agreed to terms on a consulting agreement (the "Consulting Agreement") for a two-year, $80,000 contract with Piccolo Business Advisory. The Consulting Agreement provides that Piccolo Business Advisory will provide consulting services to the Company, which includes analysis of proposed debt and equity transactions, due diligence and financial analysis and management consulting services. The compensation is paid quarterly. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company paid Mr. Piccolo approximately $80,000 each year for such services. The Consulting Agreement expired on September 30, 2017, and was not renewed by the Company.
On July 1, 2015, Mr. Arthur Stern, former Chairman Emeritus of the Company, retired from the Board of Directors of the Company and became a consultant to the Company. As of April 30, 2016, the consulting agreement with Mr. Stern was terminated. There were no amounts paid to Mr. Stern for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, Mr. Stern was paid $88,000.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
We currently expect to hold our 2019 meeting of stockholders in the spring of 2019. If a stockholder desires to submit a proposal to fellow stockholders at our annual meeting to be held in 2019 and wishes to have it set forth in the corresponding proxy statement and identified in the corresponding proxy form prepared by management, in accordance with Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, such stockholder must submit such proposal in a writing to our executive offices and it must be received at our executive offices no later than November 15, 2018. This deadline is calculated assuming we hold our 2019 stockholders' meeting in May 2019; if the anticipated date of our 2019 stockholders' meeting changes significantly, we may also shift the deadline for stockholder proposals, in which case we will publicly announce the deadline change when we announce the date for the 2019 stockholders' meeting. Any stockholder proposal submitted for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2019 stockholders' meeting must meet the requirements of Rule 14a-8 to be included in the 2019 proxy materials.
Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws, director nominations and other business may be brought at the annual meeting only by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof, or by a stockholder entitled to vote who has delivered notice to us containing certain information specified in the Amended and Restated Bylaws (x) not later than the close of business on the 60th day, nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day, in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting (if such meeting is to be held on a day which is not more than 30 days in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting or not later than 60 days after the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting); and (y) with respect to any other annual meeting of stockholders, the close of business on the tenth day following the date of public disclosure of the date of such meeting.
