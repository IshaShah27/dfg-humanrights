Dear Fellow Shareholders: 
We invite you to attend our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on Monday, April 8, 2019 at the Bigwood Event Center in Fergus Falls, Minnesota, at 10:30 A.M. CDT. 
2018 was another excellent year for Otter Tail Corporation. We remain well-positioned to deliver shareholder value. Strong and stable electric operations have provided cash flow to support dividends, and our manufacturing businesses provide earnings growth potential, with both platforms supported by a targeted capital growth plan. We remain focused on our objectives to grow our business, achieve operational and commercial excellence, and develop our talented employees. 
We look forward to sharing more about our 2018 results and our strategy for continued success during the meeting. 
You will find enclosed a formal Notice of Annual Meeting and the Proxy Statement, which describe the business we will conduct. We will ask you to elect three Directors; approve, in a non-binding advisory vote, executive compensation; and ratify the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Also available is a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which contains instructions for accessing our Proxy Statement, proxy card, and the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K online. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission permits companies to furnish proxy materials online, allowing us to provide you comprehensive information while reducing our environmental impact and printing and distribution costs. 
Your vote is important. Please review the proxy card for instructions on how you can vote your shares online, by telephone, or by mail. If your shares are in a brokerage account, please follow instructions you receive from your broker.

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

As of the record date, 39,729,708 common shares of Otter Tail Corporation were issued and outstanding, of which a majority must be present in person or by proxy in order to constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    How  do I vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have elected to provide access to our proxy  materials over the Internet. Accordingly, we have sent to most of our shareholders the Notice containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report via the Internet. Shareholders who have received the Notice will not be  sent a printed copy of our proxy materials in the mail unless requested.  
[END TABLE]
You may vote either in person at the Annual Meeting or by granting a proxy. If you desire to grant a proxy, you have three voting options: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by telephone;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by Internet; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
If you intend to vote by proxy, please follow the instructions on the Notice you received for our Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If you received paper copies of our proxy materials, you also received a proxy card for voting your shares. To register your vote, complete, date and sign the proxy card and return it in the enclosed envelope or vote your proxy by telephone or Internet in accordance with the voting instructions on the proxy card. Voting by proxy will not affect your right to vote your shares if you attend the Annual Meeting and desire to vote in person.  If you hold your shares through a broker or nominee and wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must request a legal proxy from your broker or nominee and bring it to the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    May  I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You have the right to revoke your proxy any time before the Annual Meeting by:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• providing written notice to an officer of Otter Tail Corporation and voting in person at the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting another proper proxy by telephone or the Internet; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a new written proxy bearing a later date at any time before the proxy is voted at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    How  are the votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In Proposal 1, the election of Directors, you may vote FOR one or more of the nominees or you may WITHHOLD your vote for one or more nominees.  You may vote FOR, AGAINST or ABSTAIN on Proposal 2, the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers as described in this Proxy Statement. You may vote FOR, AGAINST or  ABSTAIN with respect to Proposal 3, the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. If you return your signed proxy card, but do not mark the boxes showing how you  wish to vote your shares will be voted FOR all proposals.  
[END TABLE]
The impact of a "withhold" vote, in combination with the majority voting, policy is described below. 
If your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm and you do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposal for which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. Brokers have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 3, the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, but they do not have discretionary authority to vote on either of the other proposals. If a broker submits "broker non-votes," meaning a proxy that indicates that the broker does not have discretionary authority as to certain shares to vote on one or more proposals, those shares will be counted as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the meeting, but will not be considered as present and entitled to vote with respect to such proposals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    How  many votes are needed to approve each proposal?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In Proposal 1, the election of Directors, a nominee will be elected by a favorable vote of plurality of the shares of voting stock present and  entitled to vote, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. A plurality means that if shareholders are electing three Directors, the three Director nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected. Shareholders do not have the  right to cumulate their vote for Directors. Any standing Director candidate who receives a greater number of "WITHHELD" votes than "FOR" votes for his or her election will be required to submit a letter of resignation to the  Board for consideration by the Corporate Governance Committee as outlined in the Corporation's Corporate Governance Guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
In Proposal 2, the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation provided to the Named Executive Officers as described in the Proxy Statement, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority (at least 50%) in voting power of the common shares, which are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote, is required to approve the resolution. 
In Proposal 3, the ratification of Deloitte & Touche, LLP to serve as the independent public accounting firm, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority (at least 50%) in voting power of the common shares which are present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote is required to ratify the appointment.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    Where  and when will I be able to find the results of the voting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Preliminary results will be announced at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Otter Tail Corporation will publish the final results in a  current report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting. You may also find the results on our website www.ottertail.com.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:    Who  bears the cost of soliciting votes for the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Otter Tail Corporation will pay the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials. In addition to  soliciting proxies by mail, employees of Otter Tail Corporation may solicit them by telephone or in person. Employees receive no additional compensation for these solicitation activities.  
[END TABLE]
Election of Directors 
The Board of Directors of Otter Tail Corporation is composed of nine Directors divided into three classes. The members of each class are elected to serve three-year terms with the term of office of each class ending in successive years. 
The Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, nominates Mr. Steven L. Fritze, Ms. Kathryn O. Johnson, and Mr. Timothy J. O'Keefe for re-election to serve three-year terms ending at the time of the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2022, and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. 
Under Minnesota law, the affirmative vote of a plurality of the common shares present and entitled to vote for Directors is required for the election of the nominees to the Board of Directors. Proxies, unless otherwise directed thereon, will be voted in favor of all nominees. The proxies solicited may be voted for a substitute nominee or nominees in the event that any of the nominees is unable to serve or for good reason will not serve, which is a contingency not now anticipated. 
The Board of Directors has adopted a governance guideline whereby a Director candidate in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" from his or her election than votes "FOR" such election must tender his or her resignation for the Board's consideration. After recommendation from the Corporate Governance Committee, the Board will determine whether to accept the resignation and publicly disclose that decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. 
Biographies of the Director nominees and of the continuing Directors are found on the following pages, including an outline of his or her senior leadership roles, qualifications and experience to serve on the Board. Except as otherwise noted, each Director and Director nominee has held the same position or another executive position with the same employer for the past five years. 
The Board of Directors has determined that, with the exception of Mr. Charles S. MacFarlane, our President and Chief Executive Officer, all of the Directors and Director nominees are independent as defined by the Nasdaq Listing Standards. However, due to Mr. John D. Erickson's longstanding ties to Otter Tail Corporation, as described in his biography, he serves on no standing committees. The Board gave additional consideration to the independence of Mr. Nathan I. Partain as he will begin his 26th year on the Board of Directors. The Board concluded he was independent because he is actively employed outside of his Board service, he has no business-related contacts with Otter Tail Corporation outside of his Board service and his social contacts with management are limited to Board-related activities. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of all nominees to the Board of Directors.

Board Leadership 
Pursuant to Otter Tail Corporation's bylaws and governance guidelines, the Board of Directors determines the best Board leadership structure for Otter Tail Corporation. Otter Tail Corporation has a separate Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, each of whom are elected annually by the Board. Otter Tail Corporation believes that its leadership structure is optimal for Otter Tail Corporation at this time. This structure allows the Chief Executive Officer to focus on managing the businesses of Otter Tail Corporation while the Chairman oversees the functioning of the Board. Both leaders work closely together on Board matters. The Chief Executive Officer's familiarity with the business, and the Chairman's independent perspective, strengthen the Board's agenda and discussions.  Risk Oversight 
The Board of Directors oversees the enterprise risk management program for Otter Tail Corporation. The Board of Directors is routinely called upon in the exercise of its business judgment to make complex and evolving risk assessments. In order to fulfill these responsibilities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Executive Risk Committee: The Corporation has created an Executive Risk Committee comprised of the executive officers of the  Corporation. The Executive Risk Committee meets quarterly to identify and assess risks, and to ensure adequate mitigation strategies are implemented across the operating companies. Reports from the Executive Risk Committee are provided to the Board  on a quarterly basis by the Vice President, Internal Audit and Business Risk Management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Strategic Plan and Executive Officer Succession Planning: The Board of Directors assesses risks associated with the strategic plan  annually and also reviews and discusses succession planning for the Otter Tail Corporation executive officers and other management positions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Annual and Quarterly Risk Review: The Board of Directors also oversees a complete corporate risk assessment at least annually and  reviews risk, including cyber security and emerging risks, quarterly throughout the year in conjunction with the Business Risk Management report.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Presentations on Key Topics: In addition to its quarterly discussion on risk, in 2018, the Board had four presentations on  cybersecurity. Two of the presentations were given by external consultants, one by the Vice President of Information Technology and one by the Vice President of Internal Audit and Business Risk Management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Committee Risk Oversight: While the Board is ultimately responsible for risk oversight, Otter Tail Corporations three standing  committees assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee reports to the Board on risks associated with financial reporting and controls, and it also reports to the Board on its review of  the enterprise risk management program. The Audit Committee meets quarterly in executive sessions with the Chief Financial Officer, the Vice President of Internal Audit and Business Risk Management and other members of senior management, as well as  with the external auditors to discuss our major financial risk exposures.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Director Nomination Process 
Our goal is a balanced and diverse Board, with members whose collective skills, backgrounds, and experiences are relevant to our businesses. The Corporate Governance Committee Charter provides that the skills and characteristics generally required of Directors include diversity, business background and experience, accomplishments, experiences in the business related to Otter Tail Corporation and a willingness to make the requisite commitment of time and effort. Accordingly, the Board of Directors has not set minimum standards for Director candidates. Rather, it seeks highly qualified individuals with diverse backgrounds and business and life experiences that will enable them to constructively review and guide management of Otter Tail Corporation. The Corporate Governance Committee considers and evaluates potential Director candidates and makes recommendations to the full Board of Directors. Any shareholder may submit a recommendation for nomination to the Board of Directors by sending a written statement of the qualifications of the recommended individual to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Otter Tail Corporation, P.O. Box 496, Fergus Falls, MN 56538-0496. For the Board of Directors to consider a nominee recommendation for the 2020 Annual Meeting, shareholders   should submit the recommendation and the required information by November 1, 2019, for inclusion in Otter Tail Corporation's Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting. The Corporate Governance Committee will use the same process for evaluating all nominees, regardless of whether the nominee recommendation is submitted by a shareholder or some other source. 
If a shareholder wants to nominate a candidate for election to the Board of Directors, the shareholder must give written notice to the Corporate Secretary of Otter Tail Corporation for the nomination to be properly made. Notice must be received at Otter Tail Corporation's principal executive offices at least 90 days before the date that is one year after the prior year's regular meeting. The notice must set forth: (i) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the nomination and of the nominee or nominees, (ii) a representation that the shareholder is a holder of record of shares of Otter Tail Corporation entitled to vote at the meeting and that the shareholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the shareholder and each nominee and any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the shareholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee proposed by the shareholder as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the proxy rules of the SEC had each nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board of Directors, and (v) the consent of each nominee to serve as a Director of Otter Tail Corporation if so elected. 
Meetings 
The full Board of Directors held a total of five regularly scheduled meetings in 2018. In addition to these meetings, the Board of Directors held a planning retreat with senior management in June 2018. During 2018, the Board of Directors met regularly in executive session with only the independent Directors. Each Director attended at least 75 percent of the total meetings of the Board of Directors and the meetings of the committees on which he or she served. All Directors attended the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2018. 
Contact with the Board of Directors 
Questions may be sent to the entire Board of Directors, to a particular committee, or to an individual Director. The mailing address is Otter Tail Corporation, Board of Directors, P.O. Box 496, Fergus Falls, MN 56538-0496 and the e-mail address is boardofdirectors@ottertail.com.

Committees of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors has established a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance Committee whose charters and delegated responsibilities are reviewed annually and can be found at www.ottertail.com. 
Audit Committee 
Responsibilities: The Audit Committee reviews the financial results of Otter Tail Corporation, reviews accounting, audit and control procedures, and retains and supervises the independent registered public accounting firm.

The Audit Committee routinely meets in executive session with internal audit and the independent registered public accounting firm without management present. During 2018, the Committee received regular presentations on new accounting standards affecting Otter Tail Corporation.

Meetings: The Compensation Committee held four meetings in 2018. 
For further information on the actions of the Compensation Committee, please refer to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") on page 17 and the Report of the Compensation Committee on page 29. 
Corporate Governance Committee 
Responsibilities: The Corporate Governance Committee identifies and recommends to the Board of Directors qualified candidates for election as Directors, Director committee assignments, and actions necessary for the proper governance of Otter Tail Corporation and for the evaluation of the performance of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. With input from the Chief Executive Officer, the Corporate Governance Committee recommends certain executive officers for annual election. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews issues and developments related to corporate governance practices and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on changes in structure, rules or practice necessary for compliance and for good corporate governance. 
Membership: The Corporate Governance Committee is composed of four members of the Board of Directors. During 2018, they were Ms. Karen M. Bohn (Chair), Mr. Steven L. Fritze, Ms. Kathryn O. Johnson, and Mr. Timothy J. O'Keefe. The Board has determined that all committee members are independent Directors as defined by the Nasdaq Listing Standards. 
Meetings: The Corporate Governance Committee held four meetings in 2018.  Director Compensation 
Director compensation is designed to attract and retain qualified, non-employee Directors and to align their interests with those of our shareholders. The Compensation Committee periodically reviews compensation practices for non-employee Directors to ensure that Director compensation remains competitive with market practices and commensurate to the responsibilities undertaken by our Directors. In 2017, a market analysis of Director compensation was conducted, using data from the National Association of Corporate Directors and the Peer Group (as listed on page 19). As a result of this analysis and counsel from Willis Towers Watson ("Willis"), our compensation consultant, we updated Director compensation in April 2018 as indicated below. 
Non-employee Directors, except the Chairman, receive an annual retainer of $60,000. The Chairman receives an annual retainer of $125,000. Each Committee chair currently receives an additional retainer of $14,000 per year, except that the Audit Committee chair's retainer was increased to $20,000 starting in April 2018. Directors do not receive a meeting fee for attending Board or standing committee meetings. As an executive officer of Otter Tail Corporation, Mr. MacFarlane does not receive non-employee Director compensation for his service as a member of the Board of Directors. 
Each non-employee Director receives an annual grant of restricted stock with an approximate value of $80,000 granted under the terms of the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan on the date of the Annual Meeting. Beginning in 2018, each non-employee Director receives an additional grant of restricted stock with an approximate value of $10,000 for each standing committee on which they serve, and the Chairman receives an additional grant of restricted stock with an approximate value of $25,000. All shares of restricted stock awarded to non-employee Directors are eligible for full dividend and voting rights and, beginning in 2018, vest over a period of three years at the rate of 33.3% per year, rather than over a period of four years at the rate of 25% per year. 
In 2018, a market analysis of Director compensation was conducted, using data from the National Association of Corporate Directors and the Peer Group (as listed on page 19). As a result of this analysis and in consultation with Willis, compensation consultant for Otter Tail Corporation, the Board approved a $5,000 increase in the annual retainer for all Directors, including the Chairman, commencing in April 2019. 
Non-employee Directors may elect to receive their annual retainers in the form of cash, stock or a combination of both. Non-employee Directors may elect to defer the receipt of all or part of their cash compensation pursuant to the Otter Tail Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors. The deferral may be in the form of cash or stock units. Cash deferrals receive interest at a rate equal to 1% over the prime commercial rate of U.S. Bank National Association. Deferrals in the form of stock units are credited quarterly with dividend equivalents equal to the dividend rate on Otter Tail Corporation's common shares, and the deferred amount is paid out in common shares. 
Otter Tail Corporation has established a stock ownership guideline for non-employee Directors, who are expected to hold Otter Tail Corporation stock equal to five times the value of the non-Chair annual retainer ($325,000) to be achieved within five years of beginning service on the Board of Directors. All existing non-employee Directors either meet the guideline or are within the five-year period provided to reach the guideline.  Director Compensation Table 
The following table provides summary compensation information for each non-employee Director for the year ending December 31, 2018.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires Otter Tail Corporation's Directors and executive officers and holders of more than 10% of Otter Tail Corporation's common shares to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of common shares and other equity securities of Otter Tail Corporation. Based solely on a review of the Section 16 reports filed by the Directors and executive officers, Otter Tail Corporation believes that during the year ended December 31, 2018, its Directors and executive officers complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements on a timely basis, except one Form 4 was filed late for each of Charles S. MacFarlane, Paul L. Knutson, and Timothy J. Rogelstad in April 2018 relating to transactions in which shares were withheld to cover taxes.  Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary 
Otter Tail Corporation believes that strong, effective leadership is the cornerstone of its continued growth and success. To be successful, Otter Tail Corporation must be able to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified executive officers with the competencies needed to excel in a rapidly changing marketplace and to understand issues relating to a diverse group of companies in several different industries. 
Executive compensation at Otter Tail Corporation is focused on results. Total direct compensation includes base pay, annual cash incentive and stock-based long-term incentive. The mix of pay is designed to reflect a strong bias towards pay for performance by placing a majority of target compensation at risk. The only elements of total direct compensation that are not performance based are base pay and restricted stock units. Annual cash incentive and other stock-based long-term incentive are performance and metric based. The individual performance portion of the annual cash incentive has a discretionary element. 
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Otter Tail Corporation provided shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation. 93.7% of shareholders present and entitled to vote (excluding broker non-votes) approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Otter Tail Corporation's Named Executive Officers. Consistent with the shareholders' preference expressed in the 2017 vote on the frequency for the advisory vote on executive compensation, Otter Tail Corporation will conduct an advisory vote on executive compensation annually. 
The Compensation Committee takes into account the result of the shareholder vote in determining executive compensation policies and decisions. The Compensation Committee views the 2018 vote as a strong expression of the shareholders' general satisfaction with Otter Tail Corporation's current executive compensation programs. While the Compensation Committee considers this shareholder satisfaction in determining the present framework of executive compensation programs, decisions regarding incremental changes in the compensation programs and individual compensation are made in consideration of Otter Tail Corporation's performance, current economic conditions, and individual executive officer performance as described in more detail below. 
Purpose and Philosophy 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for developing and recommending to the Board of Directors the goals and objectives of Otter Tail Corporation's compensation policies and practices for the executive officers, including the following individuals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Charles S. MacFarlane, our President and Chief Executive Officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Kevin G. Moug, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Timothy J. Rogelstad, our Senior Vice President, Electric Platform, and President, Otter Tail Power Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• John S. Abbott, our Senior Vice President, Manufacturing Platform, and President, Varistar, which includes our manufacturing and plastics reporting  segments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Jennifer O. Smestad, our Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.  
[END TABLE]
These individuals are referred to in this CD&A as the "Named Executive Officers." Each of these Named Executive Officers is included in the Total Realized Pay, Summary Compensation Table and the related tables beginning on page 26. 
The Compensation Committee has adopted an Executive Compensation Policy, which outlines the overall executive compensation philosophy of Otter Tail Corporation and describes the components of executive compensation for executive officers.  In accordance with its Executive Compensation Policy, Otter Tail Corporation provides fair and equitable compensation to its executive officers by combining base pay, annual cash incentive, stock-based long-term incentive, retirement plans, and competitive health, dental, vacation and other traditional benefits. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Base pay is designed to be market competitive and to reflect tenure, experience, skillset and individual performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Annual cash incentive awards are designed to reward executives for Otter Tail Corporations current year financial success and recognize  the responsibilities of the executive officers for meeting Otter Tail Corporations financial performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Stock-based long-term incentive awards provided under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan focus on long-term performance by aligning the executive  officers long-term financial interests with shareholders interests.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Retirement plans are provided to encourage long tenure among the executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Health, vacation, dental and other benefits are designed to be competitive with companies with whom Otter Tail Corporation competes for  executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
The key elements of our executive compensation philosophy are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Pay is performance-based  Approximately 63% of executive officer compensation is at risk and is contingent on company performance.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Incentives are aligned with our business strategy. Performance goals and targets are aligned with our annual business plan, as well as our  long-term growth model and strategic priorities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Compensation policies promote accountability and mitigate incentive risks. For example:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We place caps on incentive payouts – Our short-term incentive and performance share awards are designed to pay out at a maximum of 190% and 150%  of target respectively.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Clawback Policy provides that, after an accounting restatement, Otter Tail Corporation will attempt to recoup amounts paid to current and former  executive officers under incentive plans during the prior three years if those amounts would not have been paid based on the restated financial statements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Stock ownership ensures executives long-term interest in the Corporation. We require all of our executive officers to own a meaningful  amount of Otter Tail Corporation stock, as described under Stock Ownership Guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
Market Conditions and Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee periodically retains a compensation consultant to provide market-based compensation data in connection with its consideration of the compensation of the executive officers. The Compensation Committee has retained Willis as its compensation consultant to assess the competitiveness of the compensation provided to executive officers of Otter Tail Corporation taking into consideration current market conditions. 
The Compensation Committee, with Willis's assistance, uses this market-based compensation data to compare the compensation provided to the executive officers in the areas of total remuneration, annual incentive and long-term incentive. This information is also used in evaluating other components of executive compensation and practices, including incentive metrics, stock ownership guidelines and compensation policy matters. The analysis compares both the structure of compensation and the amount of compensation provided to each of the executive officer positions. Willis has found that the structure of compensation is in line with market practice. 
The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Willis, used published survey data (including the 2017 Willis Towers Watson Energy Services Survey, the 2017 Mercer Executive Survey – Energy Sector, and the Willis Towers Watson CDB General Industry Survey) as the primary benchmark to evaluate 2018 executive compensation levels, with peer group data used as reference for validation of the survey data.  Willis created a peer group of publicly traded utility, manufacturing and distribution companies of comparable size, heavily weighted to electric utilities to reflect the relative size of Otter Tail Corporation's operating companies and taking into account other considerations that Willis deemed relevant such as geographic location (the "Peer Group"). The Peer Group is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee and changes, if necessary, are made to it. The Peer Group consisted of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ALLETE, Inc.    4931 Electric and other services combined 
 Apogee Enterprises, Inc.    3231 Glass products made of purchased glass 
 Avista Corp.    4931 Electric and other services combined 
 Black Hills Corporation    4911 Electric services 
 Chart Industries, Inc.    3443 Fabricated plate work (boiler shops) 
 El Paso Electric Co.    4911 Electric services 
 ESCO Technologies, Inc.    3825 Instruments to measure electricity 
 Franklin Electric Co., Inc.    3621 Motors and generators 
 Graco Inc.     3561 Pumps & pumping equipment 
 Great Plains Energy, Inc.    4911 Electric services 
 IDACORP, Inc.    4911 Electric services 
 MGE Energy Inc.    4931 Electric and other services combined 
 Northwest Natural Gas Company    4924 Natural gas distribution 
 Northwestern Corp.    4931 Electric and other services combined 
 ONE Gas, Inc.    4924 Natural gas distribution 
 PNM Resources, Inc.    4911 Electric services 
 Portland General Electric Co.    4911 Electric services 
 Tennant Company    3580 Refrigeration & service industry machinery 
 Unitil Corp.     4931 Electric and other services combined 
 Vectren Corporation    4923 Gas transmission and distribution 
 Westar Energy, Inc.    4931 Electric and other services combined 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of evaluating 2019 executive compensation, three companies have been removed from the peer group. Great Plains Energy, Inc. merged with Westar Energy, Inc. to create Evergy, Inc., and Vectren was acquired by CenterPoint. These companies were not replaced in the Peer Group. 
In addition to market-based compensation data, the Compensation Committee considers individual performance, historical compensation, internal equity and regional information. The Compensation Committee also received compensation recommendations from Mr. MacFarlane for Mr. Moug, Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad. The Compensation Committee may, but is not required to, consider the recommendations. The Compensation Committee did not receive a recommendation for Mr. MacFarlane. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews its engagement with Willis and assesses Willis' independence as a compensation consultant. In 2018, Willis provided services to Otter Tail Corporation totaling $295,387, of which $32,319 was for executive compensation consulting. Fees for other services totaled $263,068, which included Property & Casualty Insurance brokerage. 
The decision to engage Willis for these other services was recommended by management, subject to the Compensation Committee's approval. According to Willis' consulting independence protocols, the Willis personnel who provide the brokerage services operate separately and independently of the Willis advisers who perform executive compensation-related services. Those executive compensation advisers may not serve in broader relationship-management roles, and the compensation paid to those advisers is not directly tied to fees paid by Otter Tail Corporation. Upon review, the Compensation Committee concluded that any potential conflicts of interest were mitigated by these protocols. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered factors relevant to Willis's independence from management, including the six factors set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Standards.  Elements of the Executive Compensation 
Base Pay 
Base pay is set with reference to the market for similar jobs in the utility and general industry sectors as determined by the survey data. An individual executive's base pay also takes into consideration tenure, experience, skillset and individual performance. 
Annual Cash Incentive 
The Otter Tail Corporation Executive Annual Incentive Plan provides annual cash incentives to the executive officers for achieving annual performance targets for Otter Tail Corporation and its two platforms, the Electric Platform and the Manufacturing Platform, depending on the executive officer's position and responsibilities. The annual cash incentive is designed to place a significant portion of each executive officer's annual cash compensation "at risk" depending upon the financial and workplace safety performance of Otter Tail Corporation for that year and on the executive officer's individual performance. The financial targets are aligned with the annual budget approved by the Board of Directors. The target annual cash incentive for each executive officer is measured as a percentage of base pay, ranging from 45% to 100% of base pay. The target for annual cash incentive is set with reference to the market data for similar jobs in the utility and general industry sectors as determined by the published data. 
The Compensation Committee sets threshold and maximum performance levels in addition to the target performance levels for the financial measures to incent the executive officers to strive for the best possible performance in a difficult year and a maximum performance level to reward exceptional performance. The annual cash incentive is capped at 200% of target. 
As noted above, the Executive Annual Incentive Plan includes a non-financial measure for workplace safety. One of Otter Tail Corporation's five core values is safety. Otter Tail Corporation strives to provide safe work places and requires safe work practices throughout its businesses. The Compensation Committee believes that management's commitment to workplace safety is critical to achieving Otter Tail Corporation's goals regarding workplace safety. Safety is measured against the weighted average composite case rate for the industries in which Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries operate. Subject to the Compensation Committee discretion, the incentive for safety is paid if the weighted average composite case rate of Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries for the year is less than the weighted average composite case rate for the past three years for the industries in which Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries operate. 
2018 Outcomes 
For 2018 the financial measures for the Executive Annual Incentive Plan were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate Adjusted Earnings per Share;

[END TABLE]
These are non-GAAP financial measures that Otter Tail Corporation uses to compare results of operations from period to period for compensation purposes. In determining whether a financial measure has been met for the year, actual performance for each measure on a GAAP basis is to be adjusted by the following items: (1) unusual, extraordinary or nonrecurring events; (2) changes in applicable accounting rules or principles or in the company's methods of accounting; (3) results of discontinued operations; (4) asset write downs; (5) litigation or   claim judgments or settlements; (6) changes in tax law affecting reported results; (7) severance, contract termination and other costs related to exiting business activities; (8) acquisitions; (9) gains or losses from the disposition of businesses or assets; (10) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (11) other publicly identified one-time items. The Compensation Committee may exercise discretion and decline to make an adjustment for one or more of these items whether the exercise of that discretion reduces or increases the payout. 
The following tables show a breakdown of financial, workplace safety and individual performance goals for each Named Executive Officer's annual cash incentive for 2018 and actual performance against each goal:

(6)  Individual Performance. Each executive officer receives a percentage of the total target payout based upon individual performance. The  actual amount of the award will be determined by the CEO, who may award up to 200% of the target amount, and the award is subject to approval by the Compensation Committee and ratification by the independent members of the Board of Directors. The  CEO's individual performance award is determined by the Compensation Committee, subject to ratification by the independent members of the Board of Directors. Individual performance exceeded target, with payout average a total of 145% of target  for the executive officers in aggregate in 2018.

Each executive officer receives 10% of the total target payout if Otter Tail Corporation (Mr. MacFarlane,  Mr. Moug, and Ms. Smestad), the Electric Platform (Mr. Rogelstad) and the Manufacturing Platform (Mr. Abbott) achieve their respective targets for workplace safety. The safety target was met by Corporate and the Manufacturing  Platform, and missed by the Electric Platform in 2018, but due to a workplace fatality, the Compensation Committee exercised its discretion and declined to pay the safety incentive to the executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term Incentives 
Long-term incentive compensation for executive officers consists of performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards granted by the Compensation Committee under the Otter Tail Corporation 2014 Stock Incentive Plan. 
The performance share awards are designed to tie the long-term incentives for the executive officers to Otter Tail Corporation stock performance and to further align the interests of the executive officers with shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of performance shares awarded to the executive officer's vest based on relative total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder  return ("TSR") of companies in the Edison Electric Institute Index ("EEI Index") for the three-year period beginning on the first day of the year in which the grant is awarded. The EEI Index is chosen because it is the sector  that includes Otter Tail Corporation common shares. Total shareholder return (for both Otter Tail and peer group determination) is

[BEGIN TABLE]
     determined by comparing the stock price appreciation plus the value of dividends reinvested over the three-year period measured as of the average closing price for the 20 trading days immediately  following January 1 and as of the average closing price for the 20 trading days immediately preceding January 1 following the end of the three-year period. There were 42 members in the index as of December 31, 2018.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of performance shares vest based on achieving targets for three-year adjusted Return on Equity ("ROE"). For purposes of calculation,  three-year adjusted ROE is equal to the average of adjusted ROE for each of the three years in the performance period. For each of those three years, adjusted ROE is equal to Otter Tail Corporation's adjusted earnings divided by the 13-month average of total outstanding common equity using the 13 months ending at the end of the fiscal year. Adjustments include: (1) unusual, extraordinary or nonrecurring events; (2) changes in  applicable accounting rules or principles or in the company's methods of accounting; (3) results of discontinued operations; (4) asset write downs; (5) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (6) changes in tax law  affecting reported results; (7) severance, contract termination and other costs related to exiting business activities; (8) acquisitions; (9) gains or losses from the disposition of businesses or assets; (10) gains or losses from the  early extinguishment of debt; and (11) other publicly identified one-time items. The Compensation Committee may exercise discretion and decline to make an adjustment for one or more of these items.   
[END TABLE]
In both cases, the number of shares vested increases linearly if the target is exceeded and decreases linearly for performance below target but above threshold.

[END TABLE]
The restricted stock unit awards are also designed to align the interest of the executive officers with that of shareholders. They do so by rewarding continuity of service of the executive officers since the restricted stock unit awards vest ratably over a period of four years, and unvested restricted stock units are forfeited upon voluntary termination. In addition, the value of shares awarded increases or decreases with the value provided to shareholders. 
In 2018 the Compensation Committee set targeted amounts for long-term incentive awards with reference to the market data for similar jobs in the utility and general industry sectors as determined by the published data. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For performance shares, the target number of shares for each executive officer was calculated in part by dividing the targeted value delivered for each  executive officer, which is determined using a market-based compensation analysis, by an indicative grant-date fair value based on a Monte-Carlo simulation model and on the present value of the return-on-equity component (excluding dividends). This blended rate was $36.53.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For restricted stock units, the number of shares actually awarded to each executive officer was calculated by dividing the targeted value delivered for  each executive officer, which is determined using a market-based compensation analysis, by the average closing per share price of Otter Tail Corporation common shares during the 19 trading days following January 1, 2018 ($42.12).   
[END TABLE]
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards—Performance Share Grants 
The Compensation Committee approved, and the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified, the grants of performance shares on February 5, 2018. The three-year performance period for these awards is from   January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The actual payment of common shares may range from 0% to 150% of the target amount and will be paid in 2021. For 50% of the performance shares granted, the target amount will be paid if the total shareholder return for Otter Tail Corporation is at the 50th percentile of the total shareholder returns of the companies that comprise the EEI Index over the three-year period or if the executive retires (Mr. Moug only). The threshold performance level is set at the 25th percentile of the total shareholder return and the maximum performance level is set at the 75th percentile of the total shareholder return. Payment is capped at the target amount should total shareholder return be negative. 
Otter Tail Corporation believes the target is appropriate as it indicates performance consistent with the sector over the three-year performance period. Stronger-than-sector performance is awarded with additional shares. Weaker-than-sector performance is penalized, with the executive officers receiving fewer or no shares. The performance shares, to the extent they become payable, are paid in common shares of Otter Tail Corporation. 
Whether the remaining 50% of the performance shares granted become payable will be based upon the three-year adjusted ROE of Otter Tail Corporation as compared to the established target. The target is established by the Compensation Committee based on an evaluation of prior years' annual adjusted ROE, Otter Tail Power Company authorized return on equity, and EEI Index and regional peer utility return on equity history and trend. The actual payment of common shares may range from 0% to 150% of the target amount and will be paid in 2021. The target amount will be paid if the three-year adjusted ROE for Otter Tail Corporation is at the target performance (9.75%) or if the executive retires (Mr. Moug only). The threshold performance level is set at 8.25% and the maximum performance level is set at 10.75%. Otter Tail Corporation believes the target is appropriate as it indicates performance that is above the median return on equity performance in our industry. Stronger-than-target performance is rewarded with additional shares. Weaker-than-target performance is penalized with the executive officers receiving fewer or no shares. The performance shares, to the extent they become payable, are paid in common shares of Otter Tail Corporation. 
2016-2018 Performance Share Outcomes 
The table below summarizes the goals for three-year TSR and three-year adjusted ROE established for the performance shares granted in 2016, with a performance period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, and the combined payout. Three-year TSR relative to peers exceeded the maximum performance level, with performance exceeding all others in the EEI Index. Three-year ROE on GAAP basis was 10.63%, Three-year adjusted ROE, which excludes the impact of ongoing costs related to discontinued operations and the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on deferred tax balances, was above target, and the resulting combined payout exceeded the target.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards — Restricted Stock Unit Grants 
The Compensation Committee approved, and the independent members of the Board of Directors ratified, the grants of restricted stock units on February 5, 2018. The units vest at a rate of 25% per year over a four-year period with the first quarter vesting on February 6, 2019, and the remaining quarters on the same date in 2020, 2021 and 2022. They vest in full upon retirement except that, if Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott or   Ms. Smestad retires on or before June 30 of the calendar year that includes the grant date, the shares vested will be prorated according to the number of months worked in the year of grant divided by 12. Following the grant date, the executive officers receive cash payments equal to the amount of cash dividends that would have been paid if shares had been issued instead of restricted stock units, subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. 
Other Benefits 
The executive officers receive health, dental, life, vacation and other traditional benefits identical to or consistent with the non-executive employees of Otter Tail Corporation. 
Total Realized Pay 
Total Realized Pay, which is the actual remuneration earned by the executive officers in a particular year, is an important additional measure of total compensation. Information related to Total Realized Pay is meant to supplement, rather than to replace, the information found in the Summary Compensation Table. Total Realized Pay reflects the compensation actually paid based on performance, which can differ substantially from compensation as presented in the Summary Compensation Table. For example, total compensation as presented in the Summary Compensation Table contains estimated values of grants of performance shares that are based on multiple assumptions that may or may not be realized and can only be realized at the end of a three-year performance period. In addition, the Summary Compensation Table may show an increase or decrease in change in pension value, depending on the valuation assumptions and discount rates used to calculate present value of pension benefits. 
Otter Tail Corporation defines Total Realized Pay as the sum of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary paid during the year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentive award earned based on performance during the year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value realized upon the vesting of long-term incentive awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other compensation paid during the year.  
[END TABLE]
When considering Total Realized Pay, Otter Tail Corporation excludes the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in pension value as reported in the Summary Compensation Table because it is largely driven by accounting and valuation assumptions that do not  reflect the compensation realized by the executive officer in a particular year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value of long-term incentive awards such as performance shares and restricted stock units that are granted in a particular year but do not vest in  that year.  
[END TABLE]
 The following table compares Total Realized Pay for our Named Executive Officers employed as of December 31, 2018 to the Total Compensation as presented in the Summary Compensation Table. As noted above, this table is not intended to be a substitute for the Summary Compensation Table.

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Otter Tail Corporation has established common share ownership guidelines to ensure that the executive officers remain focused on long-term shareholder value. The ownership guidelines provide that an executive's minimum stock ownership requirement is based on the value of the executive's holdings as a multiple of the executive's base salary. The stock ownership guidelines are as follows: Mr. MacFarlane, 5 times base salary; Mr. Moug, Mr. Rogelstad, and Mr. Abbott, 2 times base salary; and Ms. Smestad, 1 times base salary. For purposes of satisfying the ownership guidelines, unvested restricted stock units are included. Officers are given five years to meet the guidelines from the time they are subject to an initial or increased holding guideline. Additionally, for all awards granted on or after June 22, 2017, each executive must hold 100% of shares received (net of tax) pursuant to stock awards until the applicable ownership guideline has been met. The Compensation Committee may grant waivers of the ownership or holding requirements in special circumstances. At the date of this Proxy Statement, all executive officers met the ownership guidelines or are within their five-year accumulation period. 
Retirement Income and Deferred Compensation 
Otter Tail Corporation believes that long-term service by its executive officers has been fundamental to its success. Accordingly, Otter Tail Corporation provides executive officers security in retirement through its pension and supplemental retirement plans. The Named Executive Officers, except for Mr. Abbott, participate in the plans related to retirement income. Retirement benefits for Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad are described separately below.  Retirement income is provided to certain executive officers through the Otter Tail Corporation Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") and non-qualified Executive Survivor and Supplemental Retirement Plan ("ESSRP"). Combined, these plans deliver a defined pension benefit that increases with years of service and compensation. A further description of the benefits under these plans is in the narrative description to the Pension Benefits Table beginning on page 34. 
Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad participate in the Executive Restoration Plus Plan ("Restoration Plan"), which was adopted in 2012 for executive officers and certain others who are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan or the ESSRP. Subject to its annual discretion, Otter Tail Corporation will contribute a sum equal to 6.5% of annual compensation for the plan year in excess of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit in effect for that year plus 3% of annual compensation to retirement accounts for Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad, provided they each are employed on the last day of the plan year. Contributions will be made for partial years when they retire. A further description of the benefits under the Restoration Plan is found beginning on page 35.

The Named Executive Officers, except for Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad, who may defer under the Restoration Plan, may elect to participate in a non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The plan offers a relatively low cost, competitive benefit consistent with plans offered by other employers. Participation in the plan is limited to the executive officers of Otter Tail Corporation and certain other employees of Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries. Under the plan, participants may defer up to 50% of their base pay and 100% of their annual cash incentive compensation. The amounts deferred are segregated into one or more accounts chosen by the participant and earn a return based on the performance of the investment option chosen by the participant. Each participant is solely at risk for investment returns. Investment options and 2018 rates of return are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Select Bond      -0.21%

 Index 500 Stock      -4.58%  
 MidCap Growth Stock      -7.38%  
 International  Equity      -15.41%  
[END TABLE]
One account under the plan has a beginning distribution date coinciding with retirement. Other accounts may have distribution dates determined by the participant. Deferred contributions are made pre-tax. Each participant makes his or her own investment decisions on the amounts deferred. There are no Otter Tail Corporation contributions to the plan for executive officers and Otter Tail Corporation is not at risk for individual investment returns.  Otter Tail Corporation also provides a 401(k) retirement savings plan in which the employees of Otter Tail Corporation, including the executive officers, may participate. The plan permits all employees to set aside a portion of their income into the 401(k) retirement savings plan and Otter Tail Corporation matches 50% of the first 5% set aside by an employee up to the statutory maximum. Employees hired after September 1, 2006, may be awarded an enhanced employer contribution. In 2018 that award was 4%. The participation of the executive officers is on the same terms as other participants in the plan. 
Severance Benefits 
Otter Tail Corporation has entered into change-in-control severance agreements with each of the executive officers, which provide financial protection in the event of a change in control that disrupts the executive officer's career. These agreements are designed to attract and retain high caliber executive officers, recognizing that change-in-control protections are commonly provided at comparable companies with which Otter Tail Corporation competes for executive talent. In addition, the change-in-control protections will enhance the impartiality and objectivity of the executive officers in the event of a change-in-control situation and better ensure that shareholder interests are protected. The protections contained in the change-in-control agreements provide for a "double trigger," which means that there must be both a change in control and a termination of employment for the provisions to apply. A more complete description of the change in control agreements is found beginning on page 37. 
Otter Tail Corporation also provides severance benefits to executive officers upon termination from employment under certain circumstances not involving a change in control pursuant to employment agreements or, in lieu of such agreements, an Executive Severance Plan adopted in February 2015. The employment agreements and the Executive Severance Plan are more fully described beginning on page 37. 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
Subject to the usual rules concerning reasonable compensation, including our obligation to withhold or otherwise collect certain income and payroll taxes, we generally will be entitled to a corresponding income tax deduction at the time an executive recognizes ordinary income from compensation we have paid. However, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits publicly held corporations from deducting more than $1 million per year in compensation paid to certain named executive officers. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Act"), which was signed into law at the end of 2017, makes significant changes to the deduction limit under Section 162(m), all of which are effective for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018. The Act eliminates the current exception to the deduction limit for qualified performance-based compensation and broadens the application of the deduction limit to certain current and former executive officers who previously were exempt from such limit. However, the Act also includes a transition provision, which exempts compensation under a written binding agreement that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and that was not subsequently materially amended. Therefore, compensation paid to a covered executive in excess of $1 million will not be deductible for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018 unless it qualifies for transition or other regulatory relief. 
The Compensation Committee's policy is to take reasonable steps to preserve tax deductions available under Section 162(m). However, the Compensation Committee reserves its right to authorize executive compensation that may not be fully deductible if it deems it necessary or appropriate to do so.  Report of Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee of Otter Tail Corporation's Board of Directors is composed of four independent Directors as defined by the Nasdaq Listing Standards and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee reviewed and discussed with management the foregoing CD&A. Based upon that review and discussion with management and its independent review of the CD&A, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement and in Otter Tail Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.

(2)  The amounts shown represent the aggregate grant-date fair values of: performance shares at target (2018 — $35.73/share, 2017 —  $30.25/share, 2016 — $24.03/share), restricted stock unit grants (2018 — $41.325/unit, 2017 — $37.65/unit, 2016 — $28.915/unit), as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 and using the same assumptions as are described  at Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Otter Tail Corporation for 2018. The estimated maximum payout value of the performance awards based on the per share  grant-date fair value of the shares are as follows: Mr. MacFarlane (2018 — $1,329,156, 2017 — $1,157,063, 2016 — $1,272,389); Mr. Moug (2018 — $450,198, 2017 — $408,375, 2016 — $475,794);  Mr. Rogelstad (2018 — $332,289, 2017 — $285,863, 2016 — $320,801); Mr. Abbott (2018 — $332,289, 2017 — $313,088, 2016 — $320,801); and Ms. Smestad (2018 — $225,099). Because the amounts shown  primarily reflect the value ascribed to performance shares, which are awarded only if Otter Tail Corporation meets certain total shareholder return benchmarks over a three-year period as compared to peers for all grants and certain return on equity  targets as described in the CD&A, the amount may not represent the value actually received by the executive officers.

Represents an award granted to Mr. Abbott effective January 1, 2018 under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan and described in the CD&A. The award is contingent upon Otter Tail Corporation reaching its performance target on corporate adjusted earnings per share, the Manufacturing Platform reaching performance targets in two categories (adjusted net income and safety) and individual performance. Mr. Abbott is entitled to receive an award in an amount of 50% to 200% of the target for each financial category based upon the performance of Otter Tail Corporation and the Manufacturing Platform, provided at least the threshold performance level is met. The workplace safety measure is paid at 100% if the target is met, subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee if there is a workplace fatality. Mr. Abbott is entitled to receive an award in an amount of 0% to 200% of target for individual performance awarded at the discretion of Mr. MacFarlane and the Compensation Committee, subject to ratification by the independent members of the Board of Directors. The amount actually earned in 2018 is reported in part under "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" and in part under "Bonus" in the Summary Compensation Table.

(3)  Represents grants of performance shares that vest dependent upon the three-year total shareholder return as compared to the total shareholder  returns for the companies comprising the EEI Index (50%) and upon Otter Tail Corporation's meeting a three-year target on adjusted ROE (50%). For Mr. Moug in the event of death, disability, retirement at age 62 or older, or certain  departures in connection with a change in control, the performance shares will be paid at target and in the event of resignation for good reason or termination without cause performance shares vest on a pro rata basis based upon the performance  against the goal at the time of termination. Mr. Moug turns 62 in 2021. For Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad in the event of death, disability or certain departures in connection with a change in  control, performance shares will be paid at target. In the event of retirement at age 62 or on qualification for early retirement, payment, if any, will be made according to financial results at the end of the performance period, except that if the  executive retires on or before June 30 in the year of the grant, it will be prorated according to the number of months worked in the year of grant divided by 12. Mr. MacFarlane is eligible for early retirement in 2019. In the event  employment is terminated without cause or resignation for good reason, payment, if any, will be made according to financial results at the end of the performance period, prorated according to the number of months employed divided by 36 months.  Holders of performance shares do not have any of the rights of a shareholder unless and until they receive common shares. The awards of performance shares are more fully described in the CD&A.

Employees of Otter Tail Corporation and non-union employees of Otter Tail Power Company hired prior to September 1, 2006, and union employees of Otter Tail Power Company hired prior to November 1, 2013 (January 1, 2009 for Coyote Station employees) are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. Benefits for Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Moug and Ms. Smestad are determined by multiplying 37% of final average earnings (as defined in the Plan) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of benefit accrual service up to 30 years and the denominator of which is 30. For these executive officers, final average earnings are determined using the 42 consecutive months out of the last 10 consecutive years prior to the participant's retirement that produces the highest average salary. In addition, for each year of benefit accrued service earned in excess of 30 years, the executive's benefit will increase by 1% up to a maximum of 110% of the benefit. For Mr. Rogelstad the benefit is determined by multiplying 38% of his final average earnings by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years of benefit accrual service up to 30 years and the denominator of which is 30. Final average earnings for Mr. Rogelstad is determined by using the 30 consecutive months out of the last 10 years prior to his retirement that produces the highest average salary. A full pension benefit is paid if the executive officer retires after he or she reaches age 62. If the executive officer commences payment prior to age 62, the pension benefit reduces on a scale beginning at 5% at age 61 and ending at 39% at age 55, the earliest age at which the pension benefit may be received. The Pension Plan does not provide for a lump sum distribution. 
Mr. Abbott is not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan. 
Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Moug, and Mr. Rogelstad participate in the ESSRP. Participation in the ESSRP is determined by the Compensation Committee. Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Moug, and Mr. Rogelstad will receive retirement benefits under the ESSRP equal to the greater of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  A benefit equal to 65% of the participant's final average earnings (as defined in the ESSRP) offset by the participant's social  security benefit and the amount of the participant's benefit from Otter Tail Corporation's tax-qualified defined benefit Pension Plan, provided the amount of this benefit will not increase after  December 31, 2010. The benefit amount accrues over a 15-year period. If this benefit is applicable, it will be paid for 15 years to the participant or the participant's beneficiary or for such longer  period of time as the participant lives. Final average earnings for Mr. Moug is defined as highest consecutive 42-month average of base salary and incentive bonus paid during the 10 years prior to  termination. Final average earnings for Mr. MacFarlane and Mr. Rogelstad is defined as the average of the total cash payments (base pay and bonus) paid to the participant during the highest consecutive 30 months in the 10 years prior to  the date as of which final average earnings is determined.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The benefit calculated under Otter Tail Corporation's tax-qualified defined benefit Pension Plan,  modified to include the participant's bonus in the computation of covered compensation and to exclude any statutory compensation and benefit limits, and offset by the participant's benefit from the  tax-qualified defined Pension Plan. If this benefit is applicable, it will be paid in the same form as the participant's tax-qualified defined benefit Pension Plan  benefit.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Moug, and Mr. Rogelstad are all vested in their benefits under the ESSRP. Mr. Moug was granted an additional 5 years of service under the ESSRP as of January 1, 2005. The increase in years of service for Mr. Moug was designed to more equitably apply the reduction in benefits caused by the January 1, 2005 Amendment to the ESSRP. The ESSRP does not provide for a lump sum distribution. 
If an executive officer under the ESSRP dies while employed by Otter Tail Corporation, Otter Tail Corporation will pay the participant's beneficiary an amount equal to four times the participant's annual salary and bonus at the time of death. If an executive officer under the ESSRP dies after retirement or dies after termination for other reasons with a vested benefit, Otter Tail Corporation will pay the participant's beneficiary a lesser amount, depending upon the executive officer's age at death and his or her vested percentage. 
If an executive officer retires prior to age 62 or terminates employment prior to retirement with a vested benefit in the ESSRP, the executive officer will receive a reduced benefit amount. If a participant dies while still employed, his or her beneficiary will receive the actuarial equivalent of the participant's benefit in 15 annual installments. Upon a change in control (as defined in the ESSRP), or in the event of the death of the executive officer while actively employed by Otter Tail Corporation, the executive officer becomes 100% vested in his or her accrued benefit. In the event of disability, years of credited service and years of participation continue to accrue under the ESSRP until such time as payments under Otter Tail Corporation's long-term disability plan end. The Board of Directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the ESSRP, but no such action can reduce the benefits already accrued. 
Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad participate in the Executive Restoration Plus Plan, which is a non-qualified defined contribution plan. The Plan permits a participant to defer up to 50% of salary in 1% increments and up to 100% of annual cash incentive compensation in 1% increments. In addition, subject to its annual discretion, Otter Tail Corporation will contribute a sum equal to 6.5% of the annual compensation for the plan year in excess of Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit in effect for that plan year plus 3% of annual compensation to the deferral and retirement accounts for Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad, provided they are each employed on the last day of the plan year. The Plan provides that each participant makes his or her own investment decisions on the amounts deferred and, on the amounts, contributed by Otter Tail Corporation and is solely at risk for investment returns. A participant's elected deferred sub-account will be fully vested at all times. A participant's employer contributions sub-account will be vested to the same extent he or she is vested in any employer contributions under the 401(k) retirement savings plan provided, however, that a participant will become fully vested in their employer contribution sub-account upon death, becoming disabled, or a change in control, provided the date on which the participant becomes fully vested in the employer contributions as a result of any of those events occurs while the participant is actively employed by or associated with Otter Tail Corporation. The Plan allows for full vesting of employer contributions if retiring at or after age 62 and to allow Otter Tail Corporation to make restorative or other discretionary contributions on behalf of participants. 
If a participant separates from service or becomes disabled, the vested portion of the participant's account will be paid in a lump sum. If a participant dies while still employed, the participant's vested account will be paid to the participant's beneficiary in a lump sum payment. The Board of Directors has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the Executive Restoration Plus Plan, but no such action can reduce the benefits already accrued. 
The following table summarizes the number of years of credited service and present accumulated value of the pension benefits for Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Moug, Mr. Rogelstad, and Ms. Smestad under the Otter Tail Corporation Pension Plan and ESSRP. Payments made for Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad under the Executive   Restoration Plus Plan are found on the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table and in the Summary Compensation Table.

 Potential Termination Payments Upon a Change in Control 
Otter Tail Corporation has entered into change in control severance agreements (the "Severance Agreements") with the Named Executive Officers. The Severance Agreements provide for certain payments and other benefits if, following a Change in Control, Otter Tail Corporation terminates the Named Executive Officer's employment without Cause or the Named Executive Officer terminates his or her employment for Good Reason. Such payments and benefits include: (i) severance pay equal to two times the sum of the Named Executive Officer's salary (at the highest annual rate in effect during the two years prior to the termination) and average annual incentive compensation (for the two years prior to the termination); (ii) two years of continued life, health and disability insurance; (iii) the payment of legal fees and expenses relating to the termination; and (iv) the termination of any noncompetition arrangement between Otter Tail Corporation and the Named Executive Officer. Severance and benefits will be paid by the Corporation or its successor in a lump sum not later than one day prior to the effective date of the termination. Under the Severance Agreements, "Cause" is defined as willful and continued failure to perform duties and obligations or willful misconduct materially injurious to Otter Tail Corporation; "Good Reason" is defined to include a material change in the employee's responsibility or status, a reduction in salary or benefits, or a mandatory relocation; and "Change in Control" is defined to include a change in control of the type required to be disclosed under SEC proxy rules, acquisition by a person or group of 35% of the outstanding voting stock of Otter Tail Corporation, a proxy fight or contested election that results in Continuing Directors (as defined in the Severance Agreements) not constituting a majority of Otter Tail Corporation's Board of Directors, or another event the majority of the Continuing Directors determines to be a Change in Control. 
Potential Termination Payments Outside a Change in Control 
Otter Tail Corporation has entered into an employment agreement (the "Employment Agreement") with Mr. Moug. Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad are participants in the Executive Severance Plan. The Employment Agreement provides that if Otter Tail Corporation terminates the employment of the Named Executive Officer for Cause or if the Named Executive Officer terminates the employment relationship without Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreements) the Named Executive Officer will receive base pay and benefits through the date of termination. Alternatively, if Otter Tail Corporation terminates the employment of the Named Executive Officer for any other reason, or if the Named Executive Officer terminates the employment relationship for Good Reason, Otter Tail Corporation will pay a severance payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of the Named Executive Officer's base pay plus such officer's most recent annual cash incentive payment in full satisfaction of Otter Tail Corporation's obligations to the Named Executive Officer, to be paid in a lump sum within fifteen days of termination. The Executive Severance Plan provides Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad with a severance payment under similar circumstances equal to 1.5 times the sum of base pay plus the target annual cash incentive payment, and for Mr. MacFarlane, 2.0 times the sum of base pay plus the target annual cash incentive payment. Severance payments under the Executive Severance Plan will be paid by the Corporation or its successor, in a lump sum not later than one day prior to the effective date of the termination. In return, each of Mr. MacFarlane, Mr. Rogelstad, Mr. Abbott and Ms. Smestad, as a terminated executive, must release all claims relating to employment and termination and comply with certain additional covenants, including non-disparagement, non-compete, non-solicitation of employees and vendors and the assignment of intellectual property.  The following table presents information regarding potential payments pursuant to the agreements described above and the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan for each of the Named Executive Officers named below assuming the event took place on the last business day of the fiscal year, December 31, 2018.

 Compensation Policies and Risk 
Otter Tail Corporation believes that its compensation policies and practices for its employees are such that they do not create risk that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Otter Tail Corporation. As described in this Proxy Statement, the Named Executive Officers of Otter Tail Corporation are paid two forms of incentive compensation. Short-term incentives are measured against corporate adjusted earnings per share, corporate adjusted ROE, platform adjusted net income, platform adjusted ROE, workplace safety and individual performance. These financial and safety measures are transparent, subject to review and the Clawback Policy, and can be verified by audit. Only a portion of short-term incentive, individual performance, is discretionary. Otter Tail Corporation's long-term incentives are based upon total shareholder return and three-year adjusted ROE and are transparent and subject to review and the Clawback Policy. Otter Tail Corporation believes there is little room for manipulation and a relatively low level of risk. To the extent that incentive compensation is used for other employees at Otter Tail Corporation, consistent practices are followed. Otter Tail Corporation's employee compensation policies and practices, including those that apply to our executive officers, were reviewed and discussed first by the executive team, including its Vice President of Human Resources, and then by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors. 
Pay Ratio Disclosure 
Otter Tail Corporation provides fair and equitable compensation to its employees through a combination of competitive base pay, incentives, retirement plans and other benefits. We are disclosing the following pay ratio and supporting information, which compares the annual total compensation of our employees other than Mr. MacFarlane (including full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees) and the annual total compensation of Mr. MacFarlane, our President and CEO, as required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The median of the annual total compensation of all employees of Otter Tail Corporation (other than our CEO) was $65,537; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement, was $3,341,624.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees was 51 to 1. 
To determine the pay ratio, we took the following steps: 
We determined that we would use the same median employee identified last year because there has been no change in our employee population or our employee compensation arrangements, and there have been no changes in the median employee's circumstances, that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosure. 
Last year, in order to identify the median employee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that as of December 31, 2017, our employee population consisted of approximately 2,242 individuals, all located in the United  States. This population consists of our full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees. We excluded a limited number of temporary agency employees, whose compensation was determined by the agency and who are not considered our employees for  purposes of the pay ratio calculation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We compared the base pay of our employees as reflected in our payroll records for 2017, which was our measurement period. We selected the determination  date and measurement period because they were recent periods for which employee census and compensation information are readily available.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     We selected annual salary as our compensation measure because it was readily available in our existing payroll systems, it was consistently calculated for each employee, and because it was a  reasonable proxy for total compensation for purposes of determining the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
Using the same median employee identified last year, we calculated such employee's annual total compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in that employee's annual total compensation of $65,537. The median employee's annual total compensation includes salary and overtime pay, as well as incentive payments, retirement plan benefits, company matching contributions to the 401(k) retirement savings plan, and the cost of health and other benefits. 
With respect to the CEO, we used the amount reported as total compensation in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Any estimates and assumptions used to calculate total annual compensation are described in footnotes to the Summary Compensation Table. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
As required pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, Otter Tail Corporation is providing its shareholders with a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as described in the CD&A and the accompanying tables contained in this Proxy Statement. Otter Tail Corporation asks that you support the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board of Directors or Otter Tail Corporation. However, the Board of Directors will review the results of your voting and take those results into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
As has been described in this Proxy Statement, executive compensation at Otter Tail Corporation is heavily weighted towards pay for performance and focused on driving strong financial performance. Both short-term and long-term incentives have significant performance components attached to them. The Compensation Committee has established targets that permit payment of short-term and long-term incentives only when Otter Tail Corporation's financial and safety metrics are met. Long-term incentives are tied to Otter Tail Corporation stock performing well in the market and on strong returns on equity. Historically, in years when Otter Tail Corporation has not met its financial and safety targets, the Named Executive Officers have not received short-term incentives, or the amount of those incentives has been significantly reduced. Similarly, when Otter Tail Corporation's stock has not performed well, long-term incentives have not been paid. Short-term and long-term incentives are only paid when Otter Tail Corporation is operating safely and performing well financially and in the market. 
Otter Tail Corporation believes it has designed compensation programs that are appropriate to attract and retain talented and dedicated key executives who are focused on Otter Tail Corporation's performance. 
Otter Tail Corporation also believes that the information provided above and in this Proxy Statement demonstrates that its executive compensation programs are appropriate to ensure that the interests of the Named Executive Officers are aligned with the long-term interests of Otter Tail Corporation's shareholders. Accordingly, Otter Tail Corporation is asking its shareholders to vote FOR the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, That the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Otter Tail Corporation's Named Executive Officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the tabular disclosure regarding such compensation and the accompanying narrative disclosure set forth in such Proxy Statement." 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR adoption of the resolution approving the compensation of Otter Tail Corporation's Named Executive Officers. Adoption of this resolution will require the affirmative vote of the majority of the common shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  Report of Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee of Otter Tail Corporation's Board of Directors is composed of four independent Directors (as defined by the Nasdaq Listing Standards) and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee retains and supervises Otter Tail Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm, currently Deloitte & Touche, LLP. 
Management is responsible for Otter Tail Corporation's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of Otter Tail Corporation's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
In this context, the Audit Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Otter Tail Corporation's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). Otter Tail Corporation's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence. 
Based on the Audit Committee's discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm and the Audit Committee's review of the consolidated financial statements and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in Otter Tail Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.

Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
At the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board of Directors will propose that shareholders ratify the appointment of the firm of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of Otter Tail Corporation for 2019. This firm has no direct or indirect financial interest in Otter Tail Corporation. 
The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Shareholder ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board of Directors is submitting the appointment of Deloitte & Touche, LLP to the shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm, but it retains sole responsibility for appointing and terminating the independent registered public accounting firm.  A partner of the independent registered public accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting to answer questions and to make a statement if they desire to do so. An affirmative vote of a majority of the common shares present and entitled to vote with respect to the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm is required for ratification. Proxies, unless otherwise directed thereon, will be voted in favor of this proposal. The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the ratification of Deloitte & Touche, LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Fees

Pre-Approval of Audit/Non-Audit Services Policy 
Otter Tail Corporation's Audit Committee has adopted, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy, which sets forth the procedures and the conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm may be pre-approved. The independent registered public accounting firm has reviewed this policy and believes that implementation of the policy will not adversely affect the firm's independence. 
Four categories of services have been defined by Otter Tail Corporation within the policy to provide a consistent framework for assessment, decision making, approval and reporting. The following is a summary of the key provisions of the policy. 
Audit services are specified services directly related to performing the independent audit of Otter Tail Corporation and its subsidiaries. The independent registered public accounting firm will submit to the Audit Committee for pre-approval the scope and estimated fees associated with the current year audit at the August Audit Committee meeting.  Audit-related services are specified services that are related extensions of audit services and are logically performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. Additional services exceeding the specified pre-approved limits require specific Audit Committee approval. 
Tax services are specified services related to tax matters. Using the independent registered public accounting firm for these matters creates efficiencies, minimizes disruption, or preserves confidentiality. Additional services exceeding the specified pre-approved limits, or adding service types to the pre-approved list, requires specific Audit Committee approval. 
Other services include (a) "synergistic" services for which utilizing the independent registered public accounting firm creates efficiencies, minimizes disruption, or preserves confidentiality, or (b) "unique qualifications" services for which management has determined that the independent registered public accounting firm possesses unique or superior qualifications to provide the services. Additional services exceeding the specified pre-approved limits, or adding service types to the pre-approved list, requires specific Audit Committee approval. 
"Restricted" non-audit services include nine specific restricted services outlined in the SEC's rule on auditor independence. These services are not to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
During 2017 and 2018, all of the services provided by Deloitte Entities for the services described above under audit fees, audit-related fees, tax fees and all other fees were pre-approved by the Audit Committee consistent with this procedure. 
Policy and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons 
The Board of Directors of Otter Tail Corporation has adopted a Policy and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons. This policy delegates to the Audit Committee responsibility for reviewing, approving, or ratifying transactions with "Related Persons" that are required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC. Under the policy, a "Related Person" includes any of the Directors, nominee for Director, or executive officers of Otter Tail Corporation, certain shareholders and their immediate families. The policy applies to transactions in which Otter Tail Corporation is a participant and a Related Person will have a direct or indirect material interest and the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Under the policy, Otter Tail Corporation management is responsible for disclosing to the Audit Committee all material information related to any covered transaction in order to give the Audit Committee an opportunity to authorize, approve, or ratify the covered transaction based upon its determination that the covered transaction is fair and reasonable and on terms no less favorable to Otter Tail Corporation than could be obtained in a comparable arm's length transaction with an unrelated third party. A copy of the Policy and Procedures Regarding Transactions with Related Persons can be found at www.ottertail.com. For 2018 Otter Tail Corporation is unaware of any related party transactions covered under this policy. 
Shareholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
Any holder of common shares of Otter Tail Corporation who intends to present a proposal that may properly be acted upon at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Otter Tail Corporation must submit such proposal to Otter Tail Corporation so that it is received at Otter Tail Corporation's executive offices at P.O. Box 496, Fergus Falls, MN 56538-0496, on or before October 31, 2019, for inclusion in Otter Tail Corporation's Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting. 
If a holder of common shares wishes to present a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders but does not wish to include it in the Proxy Statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting or wishes to nominate a   candidate for Director, the holder must submit notice of the proposal or nomination in accordance with the procedures provided in the Otter Tail Corporation Bylaws to Otter Tail Corporation's executive offices on or before January 9, 2020 in order for the proposal to be considered timely. 
Other Business 
As of the date hereof, the Board of Directors of Otter Tail Corporation is aware of no other proposals to be presented to the Annual Meeting in addition to the items described above. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxies will vote thereon at their discretion. 
A copy of Otter Tail Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements and schedules thereto, filed with the SEC, is available without charge to shareholders. Address written requests to:  Appendix A 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
Financial measures used to determine cash incentives under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan and to determine performance shares awarded under the 2016-2018 Performance Share Grant are based on financial measures calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which are adjusted for items deemed to be unusual or extraordinary. The GAAP measure may be adjusted for items which fall under these categories as appropriate: (1) unusual, extraordinary or nonrecurring events; (2) changes in applicable accounting rules or principles or in the company's methods of accounting; (3) results of discontinued operations; (4) asset write downs; (5) litigation or claim judgments or settlements; (6) changes in tax law affecting reported results; (7) severance, contract termination and other costs related to exiting business activities; (8) acquisitions; (9) gains or losses from the disposition of businesses or assets; (10) gains or losses from the early extinguishment of debt; and (11) other publicly identified one-time items. 
For 2018, the Corporate Adjusted Earnings Per Share and the Corporate Adjusted Return on Equity reflect only one adjustment from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, in order to exclude the impact of discontinued operations. Otherwise, only GAAP financial measures were used in determining the 2018 cash incentive under the Executive Annual Incentive Plan. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporate Adjusted Earnings Per Share to the Corporate diluted Earnings Per Share as determined in accordance with GAAP for 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 GAAP Corporate Earnings Per Share    $ 2.06

 Corporate Adjusted Return on  Equity      11.57%  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, the Corporate Three-Year Adjusted Return on Equity reflects adjustments from the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure in order to exclude the impact of discontinued operations for each of the years 2016, 2017 and 2018 and to exclude the effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on 2017 results. 
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Corporate Three-Year Adjusted Return on Equity, used to determine the shares awarded under the Corporation's 2016-2018 performance shares, to the GAAP calculation.

A-1 
Otter Tail Corporation's management believes that the Corporate Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Adjusted Return on Equity, and Three-Year Adjusted Return on Equity reflect the management's performance in operating the Corporation and provide a meaningful representation of the performance of our core business. However, management understands there are material limitations on the use of non-GAAP measures. Non-GAAP measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures for purposes of analyzing financial performance, and they may be calculated differently from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
