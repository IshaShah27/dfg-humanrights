Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee endeavors to ensure that the compensation program for executive officers is effective in attracting and retaining key executives responsible for our success and in promoting our long-term interests and those of our stockholders. The committee, without applying any specific quantitative formulas, considers such factors as revenues, net income, duties and scope of responsibility, industry standards and comparable salaries, corporate growth, profits, goals and market share increases. The functions of the Compensation Committee include reviewing and establishing compensation plans for our executive officers. 
The key member of management involved in the compensation process was E.J. Elliott. Mr. Elliott was not present during the Compensation Committee's discussions regarding his compensation. The two members of the Compensation Committee were David A. Air and Cort J. Dondero. Currently, the Compensation Committee is comprised only of independent directors, as defined by NASDAQ rules.

Accordingly, the Nominating Committee reviews recommendations of its individual members and gives considerable weight to candidates with industry-related experience and expertise that will benefit the Company. Additionally, the Nominating Committee believes that persons selected must have a serious work ethic and an ability to work as a constructive member of a team for the benefit of the stockholders. The Nominating Committee did not meet during fiscal 2018. 
In addition to any other applicable requirements, if a stockholder desires to nominate a director for election at an annual meeting, such stockholder must (A) be a stockholder of record on both (1) the date such stockholder provides notice of such nomination to us and (2) the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (B) have given timely notice in proper written form to our Secretary. If a stockholder is entitled to vote only for a specific class or category of directors at the annual meeting, such stockholder's right to nominate one or more persons for election as a director at the meeting shall be limited to such class or category of directors. 
To be timely in connection with the annual meeting, a stockholder's notice shall be delivered to the Secretary at our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. As a result, with respect to the 2020 Annual Meeting, any notice given by a stockholder pursuant to the provisions of our Bylaws must be received no earlier than November 8, 2019 and no later than December 8, 2019, unless our 2019 Annual Meeting date is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days from March 7, 2019. If our 2019 Annual Meeting date is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed by more than 60 days, then notices must be received no earlier than the 120th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting and no later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the date on which the meeting date is publicly announced. 
In the event we call a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any stockholder entitled to vote for the election of such director(s) at such meeting (and satisfying the requirements set forth above) may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such position(s) as are specified in our notice of such meeting, but only if the stockholder notice is delivered to the Secretary at our principal executive office no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the first day on which the date of the special meeting and either the names of all nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be elected at such meeting or the number of directors to be elected shall have been publicly announced. 
To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary must set forth (A) as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director (1) the name, business address and residence address of the person, (2) the principal occupation or employment of the person, (3) the class or series and number of shares of our capital stock if any, which are owned beneficially or of record by the person and (4) any other information relating to the person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder; and (B) as to the stockholder giving notice (1) the name and record address of such stockholder, (2) the class or series and number of shares of our capital stock which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (3) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder, (4) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to nominate the person(s) named in its notice and (5) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Such notice must also be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, officers and certain stockholders to file with the Commission an initial statement of beneficial ownership and certain statements of changes in beneficial ownership of our equity. Based solely on our review of such forms received by us, we are unaware of any instances of noncompliance, or late compliance, with such filings during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Independent Directors 
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market. NASDAQ requires that a majority of our directors be "independent," as defined by NASDAQ's rules. Generally, a director does not qualify as an independent director if the director or a member of a director's immediate family has had in the past three years certain relationships or affiliations with us, our external or internal auditors, or other companies that do business with us. Our Board has affirmatively determined that a majority of its directors are independent directors under NASDAQ rules. Based on these standards, the Board determined that our independent directors include the following current directors and nominees for director: David A. Air, James P. Sharp and John G. Coburn. 
Independent Director Meetings in Executive Sessions 
Our independent directors meet separately from the other directors in executive sessions. Any independent director may call an executive session of independent directors at any time. The independent directors did not meet in an executive session during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Stockholder Communications with Directors 
Stockholders wishing to communicate with Directors should send their correspondence to the individual Director or Directors in care of the Executive Chairman at 5201 N. Orange Blossom Trail, Orlando, Florida 32810. Our policy is to forward such communications to the addressees if the issues/subjects are material and relevant. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders 
We encourage all incumbent directors, as well as all nominees for election as director, to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All of our incumbent directors attended our Annual Meeting in 2018. 
Code of Ethics 
We have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions. We will provide to any person without charge, upon written request, addressed to our corporate headquarters, attention Corporate Secretary, a copy of such code of ethics. 
Board Leadership Structure and Independence 
Our Board leadership structure is currently comprised of (i) an Executive Chairman, (ii) President of the Company, and (iii) Chairman for each of our Compensation Committee and Audit Committee. 
From time to time, the entire Board reviews the Company's leadership structure, including the positions of Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the President. Mr. E.J. Elliott currently serves as Executive Chairman. Mr. Elliott has held this position since 1968 and is intimately familiar with our history, current business and objectives for the future. By serving as our Executive Chairman, Mr. Elliott is able to provide strong and consistent leadership, vision and direction as we pursue our plans. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
Our Board of Directors oversees risk to help ensure a successful business at the Company. While the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, and other members of our senior leadership team are responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board of Directors is responsible for appropriate risk oversight and assisting management in addressing specific risks, such as strategic and competitive risks, financial risks, legal risks, and operational risks. 
The Board believes that its leadership structure facilitates its oversight of risk by combining, Board committees, and majority independent Board composition, with an experienced Executive Chairman who has detailed knowledge of our business, history, and the complex challenges we face. The Executive Chairman's in-depth understanding of these matters and involvement in the day-to-day management of the Company positions them to promptly identify and raise key risks to the Board and focus the Board's attention on areas of concern. The independent committee chairs and other directors also are experienced professionals or executives who can and do raise issues for Board consideration and review, and are not hesitant to challenge management. The Board believes there is a well-functioning and effective balance between the non-management directors and the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, which enhances risk oversight. 
The Board exercises its oversight responsibility for risk both directly and through its three standing committees. Throughout the year, the Board and each committee spends a portion of their time reviewing and discussing specific risk topics. The full Board is kept informed of each committee's risk oversight and related activities through frequent non-member attendance at committee meetings and committee meeting minutes available to all directors. Strategic, operational and competitive risks are presented and discussed at the Board's regular quarterly meetings. On at least an annual basis, the Board conducts a review of our long-term strategic plans and other members of senior management report on our top risks and the steps management has taken or will take to mitigate these risks. As needed between Board meetings, our Executive Chairman reports to the Board on the critical issues we face and the recent developments in our business units, including identified risks. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing our financial risks. The Audit Committee meets with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, and the independent auditor to discuss our major financial risk exposures, financial reporting, internal controls, and credit and liquidity risk. The Audit Committee meets regularly in separate executive session with the independent auditor to facilitate a full and candid discussion of risk and other issues. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing compensation risk and ensuring executive compensation is aligned with performance. The Compensation Committee is charged with monitoring our equity-based compensation plans. 
The Nominating Committee oversees risk related to our overall governance, including Board and committee composition, Board size and structure, director independence, ethical and business conduct and our corporate governance profile and ratings. The Nominating Committee also is engaged in overseeing risks associated with succession planning for the Board and management. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Committee Process and Procedures 
The members of the Compensation Committee for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 (hereafter in the Executive Compensation section referenced as "2018") were David A. Air (Chairman) and Cort J. Dondero. The Compensation Committee meets as circumstances dictate. Agendas for the meetings are typically established with input from the Compensation Committee's Chairman and the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). At times, our CEO attends portions of the meetings of the Compensation Committee. However, the Compensation Committee also conducts meetings to consider, discuss and evaluate issues without the presence of any of our executive officers. Our CEO is never present during voting or deliberations with respect to his own compensation. 
To assist the Compensation Committee in the design of effective compensation programs, policies and practices, including developing a mix of cash and equity compensation and annual and long-term compensation that promotes our compensation objectives, and that is competitive in the marketplace, the Compensation Committee may retain a compensation consultant from time to time subject to Board approval.

The following table presents the annual summary compensation for Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and three highest-paid executive officers other than the CEO and CFO who were serving as our executive officers as of September 30, 2018 and who had fiscal year 2018 total qualifying compensation in excess of $100,000 (collectively the "Named Executive Officers").

(1)  The amounts included in this column represent the grant date fair value of stock options granted in the  applicable year, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The grant date fair value is generally the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the award's service period, but does not include a reduction for  forfeitures. Amounts for fiscal 2016 include the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 of restricted stock granted as tenure-based awards.  
(2)  The amounts reported under All Other Compensation represent contributions to the Company's 401(k) Plan on  behalf of the Named Executive Officers and personal use of a company vehicle.

CEO Pay Ratio 
We are required to disclose the CEO to median employee pay ratio as calculated in accordance with Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified our median employee by examining the 2018 total compensation for all employees, excluding our CEO, who were employed by Gencor on September 30, 2018. All employees were included, whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis. Adjustments were made to annualize the compensation of employees who were not employed by the Company for the entire year. 
After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 in this proxy statement. Using this methodology, we have estimated that the median of the annual total compensation of our employees, excluding our CEO, was $48,419, and the annual total compensation of our CEO was $451,138. To calculate the pay ratio, we divided our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation by our median employee's annual total compensation. Therefore, our 2018 CEO to median employee pay ratio is approximately 9:1. 
Employment Agreements 
We do not have employment agreements with any of the Named Executive Officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table. Employment may terminate at any time without severance. Each Named Executive Officer is entitled to the standard benefits available to all employees and has executed our non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreed to keep confidential our trade secrets and other confidential information.

2009 Incentive Compensation Plan 
On March 6, 2009 the stockholders of the Company approved the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2009 Plan"). The 2009 Plan provides that the total number of shares of Company stock that may be subject to the granting of awards under the 2009 Plan ("Awards") at any time during the term of the 2009 Plan shall be equal to 800,000 shares of Common Stock and 160,000 shares of Class B stock. The foregoing limit shall be increased as provided for in the 2009 Plan. Persons eligible to receive Awards under the 2009 Plan include our employees, directors, consultants and other persons who provide services to the Company. The 2009 Plan imposes individual limitations on the amount of certain Awards in part to comply with IRS Code Section 162(m). The Awards can be in the form of stock options, restricted and deferred stock, performance awards and other stock base awards as provided for in the 2009 Plan. On July 1, 2011, 298,000 common stock options were issued under the 2009 Plan. These options vested at 25% per year from October 1, 2012 through October 1, 2015. On May 28, 2012, 20,000 of common stock options were issued under the 2009 Incentive Compensation Plan. These options vested at 25% per year from May 28, 2013 through May 28, 2016. On January 19, 2016, 30,000 (45,000 post stock split) of Class B stock options were issued under the 2009 Plan. These options vest at 25% per year starting on January 19, 2017 through January 19, 2020. On September 26, 2016, 30,000 of Class B stock options were issued under the 2009 Plan. These options vest at 25% per year starting on September 26, 2017 through September 26, 2020. As of September 30, 2018, 482,000 shares of Company common stock and 100,000 shares of Class B stock are available for granting of awards under the 2009 Plan. 
Payments Upon a Change of Control 
Under the terms of the 2009 Plan, upon the occurrence of a change of control, each option holder shall be entitled to receive, pursuant to an option exercise, such number and kind of securities as the option holder would have been entitled to had the option holder exercised the option prior to a change of control. 
Assuming a change of control had occurred on September 30, 2018 and the Named Executive Officer listed in the table entitled "Outstanding Equity Awards in Fiscal Year 2018" exercised the full amount of their awards, the cash value of the accelerated awards for the Named Executive Officer would be as follows:

With respect to the foregoing responsibilities and processes, the Committee recognizes that the Company's financial management, including its internal audit staff, as well as the independent auditors, have more time, knowledge, and more detailed information regarding the company than do Committee members. Consequently, in discharging its oversight responsibilities, the Committee will not provide or be deemed to provide any expertise or special assurance as to the Company's financial statements or any professional certification as to the independent auditors' work. While the Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in this Charter, it is not the duty of the Committee to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This is the responsibility of management and the independent auditors. Nor is it the duty of the Committee to conduct investigations, to resolve disagreements, if any, between management and the independent auditors, or to assure compliance with laws and regulations and the Company's internal policies and procedures.
