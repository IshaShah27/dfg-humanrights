INTRODUCTION
The Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Adams Natural Resources Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the "Fund"), will be held on Tuesday, April 16, 2019, at 9:00 a.m., local time, at the Fund's offices at 500 E. Pratt St., Suite 1300, Baltimore, MD 21202, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and also set forth below. This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of proxies to be used at the meeting and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof and is first being sent to stockholders on or about February 27, 2019.
At the Annual Meeting, action is to be taken on (1) the election of a Board of Directors; (2) the ratification of the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm; and (3) the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Stockholder Meeting to Be Held On April 16, 2019:
This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting, a form of the proxy, and the 2018 Annual Report to stockholders are all available on the internet at the following website: http://www.astproxyportal.com/ast/13580/
How You May Vote and Voting By Proxy 
You can provide voting instructions by using telephone or internet options as instructed in the enclosed proxy card, or by dating, executing and mailing the proxy card. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting, however, even if you intend to do so, please provide voting instructions by one of the methods described above. Except for Proposals (1) and (2), referred to above, the proxies confer discretionary authority on the persons named therein or their substitutes with respect to any business that may properly come before the meeting. Stockholders retain the right to revoke executed proxies at any time before they are voted by written notice to the Fund, by executing a later dated proxy, or by appearing and voting at the meeting. All shares represented at the meeting by proxies in the accompanying form will be voted, provided that such proxies are properly executed. In cases where a choice is indicated, the shares represented will be voted in accordance with the specifications so made. In cases where no specifications are made, the shares represented will be voted FOR Proposal (1) and FOR Proposal (2). 
If your shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, or other holder of record, you will receive instructions from the holder of record that you must follow in order to vote your shares. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a broker's proxy card and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting in order to vote. 
If you have questions regarding how to attend the meeting and vote in person, please contact the Secretary of the Fund by telephone at (800) 638-2479 or by email at contact@adamsfunds.com.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​​​
Who May Vote 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on February 1, 2019, may vote at the Annual Meeting. The total number of shares of common stock of the Fund ("Common Stock") outstanding and entitled to be voted on the record date was 29,512,764. Each share is entitled to one vote. The Fund has no other class of security outstanding. 
Vote Requirement 
For Proposal (1), referred to above, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the meeting. Proposal (2), referred to above, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting. 
Quorum Requirement 
A quorum is necessary to hold a valid meeting. If stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting are present in person or by proxy, a quorum will exist. Proxies received by the Fund that are marked "withhold authority" or abstain, or that constitute a broker non-vote, are counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker returns a valid proxy but does not vote on a particular matter because the broker does not have the discretionary voting power for that matter and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Proxies marked "withhold authority," abstentions, and broker non-votes do not count as votes cast with respect to any proposal, and therefore, such proxies would have no effect on the outcome of Proposals (1) and (2), above. 
Appraisal Rights 
Under Maryland law, there are no appraisal or other dissenter rights with respect to any matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting that is described herein. 
Other Matters 
The Fund will pay all costs of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. Solicitation will be made by mail, and officers, regular employees, and agents of the Fund may also solicit proxies by telephone or personal interview. The Fund has retained AST Fund Solutions, LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies. The Fund will pay AST Fund Solutions, LLC a fee for its services, not to exceed $2,500, and will reimburse AST Fund Solutions, LLC for its expenses, which the Fund estimates should be approximately $1,500. The Fund expects to request brokers and nominees who hold stock in their names to furnish this proxy material to their customers and to solicit proxies from them, and will reimburse such brokers and nominees for their out-of-pocket and reasonable clerical expenses in connection therewith. 
Fund Complex 
The Fund is part of Adams Funds (the "Fund Complex"), which is composed of the Fund and Adams Diversified Equity Fund, Inc. ("ADX"), a closed-end investment company that is also traded on the New York Stock Exchange. TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Unless contrary instructions are given by the stockholder signing a proxy, it is intended that each proxy in the accompanying form will be voted at the Annual Meeting for the election of the following nominees to the Board of Directors to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 and until their successors are duly elected and qualify, all of whom have consented to serve if elected: 
If for any reason one or more of the nominees above-named shall become unable or unwilling to serve when the election occurs, proxies in the accompanying form will, in the absence of contrary instructions, be voted for the election of the other above-named nominees and may be voted for substitute nominees in the discretion of the persons named as proxies in the accompanying form.

The valuation date used in calculating the dollar value of shares owned is December 31, 2018.
​
The Board has adopted equity ownership requirements for the directors and senior staff. Under these equity ownership requirements, the Chief Executive Officer, portfolio managers, research analysts, and other executive officers must own a certain value of equity in the Fund equal to a multiple of his or her annual salary. Non-employee directors must own at least $100,000 of the Fund's Common Stock within 10 years of joining the Board. 
The nominees for election as directors of the Fund identified above are also the nominees for election to the Board of Directors of ADX, the Fund's largest stockholder (see "Principal Stockholder" on page 11) and part of the Fund Complex. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Seven of the Fund's eight directors are not "interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Act"), and are independent directors. Mr. Stoeckle is the only member of the Board who is an "interested person" under the Act and thus is not an independent director. The Board has elected Dr. Kathleen T. McGahran, an Independent Director, to serve as the Chair of the Board. 
Board's Oversight of Risk Management for the Fund 
The Board's role in risk management of the Fund is that of oversight. The internal staff of portfolio managers, research analysts, and administrative personnel is responsible for the day-to-day management of the Fund, including risk management (including management of investment performance and investment risk, valuation risk, issuer and counterparty credit risk, compliance risk, and operational risk). As part of its oversight, the Board has delegated to the Audit Committee the primary role of overseeing the assessment and management of risks, including major financial risks, by the Fund's management and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control such risks. The Audit Committee reports to the Board on a periodic basis on its discussions of these items with management. In addition, the Board, acting at its regularly scheduled meetings, receives reports from senior management, including the Fund's portfolio management team, the Chief Compliance Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer. Between Board meetings, the Executive Committee, and/or the Chair of the Board, and/or the Chairman of the Audit Committee, as appropriate, interact with the CEO and other senior executives on any matter requiring action by or notice to the Board. The Board also receives  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​
periodic presentations from senior management regarding specific operational, compliance, or investment areas, such as business continuity, personal trading, valuation, investment research, and securities lending, and receives reports from the Fund's General Counsel regarding regulatory, compliance, and governance matters. The Fund believes that its leadership structure enhances risk oversight. It should be noted that, in its oversight role, the Board is not a guarantor of the Fund's investments or activities. 
Process for Stockholders to Communicate with Board 
The Board of Directors has implemented a process for stockholders of the Fund to send communications to the Board. Any stockholder desiring to communicate with the Board, or with specific individual directors, may do so by writing to the Secretary of the Fund at Adams Natural Resources Fund, Inc., 500 E. Pratt Street, Suite 1300, Baltimore, MD 21202, or by sending an email message to the Secretary at contact@adamsfunds.com. The Secretary has been instructed by the Board to promptly forward all such communications to the addressees indicated thereon. 
Policy on Board of Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings 
The Fund's policy with regard to attendance by the Board of Directors at Annual Meetings is that all directors are expected to attend, absent unusual and extenuating circumstances that prohibit attendance. All of the directors then serving attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Each director and officer of the Fund who is subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Fund's securities are required to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") by a specified date his or her beneficial ownership of or transactions in the Fund's securities. Based upon a review of filings with the Commission, such forms received by the Fund, and written representations that no other reports are required, the Fund believes that each director, officer, and greater than ten percent beneficial owners filed all requisite reports with the Commission on a timely basis during 2018.
Information as to Other Executive Officers 
Set forth below are the names, ages, and positions with the Fund, as of December 31, 2018, of all executive officers of the Fund other than those who also serve as directors. Executive officers serve as such until the election of their successors.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
Audit Committee 
Mr. Escherich (Chair), Dr. Arzac, Dr. Gale, and Ms. Kloppenburg, each of whom is an independent director as such is defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, and none of whom is an "interested person" as such is defined by the Act, constitute the membership of the Board's standing Audit Committee, which met four times in 2018. The Board has determined Mr. Escherich to be an audit committee financial expert, as that term is defined in federal securities regulations. The Board has adopted a written charter under which the Committee operates. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter ("Charter") is available on the Fund's website: www.adamsfunds.com. Set forth below is the report of the Committee: 
Audit Committee Report 
The purposes of the Audit Committee are set forth in the Committee's written Charter. As provided in the Charter, the role of the Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its oversight on matters relating to accounting, financial reporting, internal control, auditing, risk assessment and risk management, regulatory compliance activities, and other matters the Board deems appropriate. The Committee also selects the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with the provisions set out in the Charter. Management, however, is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Fund's financial statements, and for the procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out proper audits and reviews. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the 2018 Annual Report of the Fund with the Fund's management and with PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed pursuant to Statement of Auditing Standards No. 61, as modified or supplemented. The Committee has also received from PwC the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Committee concerning independence, considered whether the provision of nonaudit services by PwC is compatible with maintaining PwC's independence, and discussed with PwC its independence. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions with management and PwC referred to above, and subject to the limitations on the responsibilities and role of the Committee set forth in the Charter and discussed above, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Fund's 2018 Annual Report for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Respectfully submitted on February 14, 2019, by the members of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors:

Compensation Committee 
Mr. Dale (Chair), Mr. Arzac, Ms. Kloppenburg, and Dr. Smith constituted the membership of the Board's standing Compensation Committee, which met four times in 2018. The Committee reviews and  TABLE OF CONTENTS
recommends changes in the compensation of the directors, officers, and employees, including salaries and the cash incentive compensation plans in which the executive officers, officers and employees of the Fund are eligible to participate. 
Executive Committee 
Dr. McGahran (Chair), Mr. Dale, Mr. Escherich, Dr. Gale, and Mr. Stoeckle constitute the membership of the Board's standing Executive Committee, which met two times in 2018. The Committee has the authority of the Board of Directors between meetings of the Board except as limited by law, the Fund's Bylaws, or Board resolution. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
Dr. Gale (Chair), Mr. Dale, Mr. Escherich, and Dr. Smith constituted the membership of the Board's standing Nominating and Governance Committee, which met three times in 2018. The Board has adopted a written charter under which the Nominating and Governance Committee operates, a copy of which is available to stockholders at the Fund's website: adamsfunds.com. 
Each of the members of the Committee is an independent director as such is defined by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and none is an "interested person" as such term is defined by the Act. 
Among other responsibilities, the Committee supervises and reviews the Board composition, Board evaluations, director nominations, and corporate governance matters. For director nominations, the Committee recommends to the full Board nominees for director and leads the search for qualified director candidates. The Committee has used a third-party search firm to help identify candidates who may meet the needs of the Board. The firm provides information on candidates for review and discussion by the Committee. 
The Committee will consider unsolicited recommendations for director candidates from stockholders of the Fund. Stockholders may recommend candidates for consideration by the Committee by writing to the Secretary of the Fund at the office of the Fund, 500 E. Pratt Street, Suite 1300, Baltimore, MD 21202, giving the candidate's name, biographical data, and qualifications, and stating whether the candidate would be an "interested person" of the Fund. A written statement from the candidate, consenting to be named as a candidate, and if nominated and elected, to serve as a director, should accompany any such recommendation. 
The process that the Committee uses for identifying and evaluating nominees for director is as follows: When there is a vacancy on the Board, either through the retirement or other withdrawal of a director or the Board's determination that the size of the Board should be increased, nominations to fill that vacancy are made by independent directors on the Board. The members of the Committee meet with the prospective director nominee. If a majority of the Committee members are satisfied that the prospective director nominee is qualified and will make a positive addition to the Board, as many of the other independent directors meet with him or her as is possible. The Committee then nominates the candidate at a meeting of the Board and a vote is taken by the full Board on whether to elect the nominee to the Board and to include the nominee in the Fund's proxy for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. The Fund anticipates that a similar process will be used for any qualified director candidate properly recommended by a stockholder. 
The Board does not have a formal policy regarding the consideration of diversity in identifying Board candidates. When considering a new candidate for the Board, the Committee and the full Board may consider the diversity of skills, experience and/or perspective a prospective nominee will bring to the Board as part of their evaluation of the contribution that such prospective director nominee will  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
make to the Board. Such factors will be considered in the context of the Board's existing membership at the time such potential candidate is considered. 
Board of Directors Compensation 
During 2018, each director who is not an interested person, except for Dr. McGahran, received an annual retainer fee of $65,000. Dr. McGahran, the Board Chair, received an annual retainer fee of $85,000. The Chairperson of each committee received an additional annual retainer fee of $3,000 for that committee. The total amount of fees paid to independent directors in 2018 was $505,667. 
Transactions with Adams Diversified Equity Fund, Inc.
The Fund shares certain expenses for research, accounting services, other office services (including proportionate salaries and other employee benefits), rent and related expenses, and miscellaneous expenses, such as office supplies, postage, subscriptions, and travel, with ADX. These expenses were paid by ADX and, on the date the payment was made, the Fund simultaneously paid to ADX its allocated share of such expenses, based on either the proportion of the size of the investment portfolios of the two companies, relative net assets of the two companies, or, where possible, on an actual usage basis. In 2018, the Fund's share of such expenses was $945,510. 
Compensation of Directors and Executive Officers 
The following table sets forth for each of the persons named below the aggregate compensation received from the Fund during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for services in all capacities:

2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan 
In 2005, the Board of Directors adopted an equity incentive compensation plan for the Fund, called the 2005 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2005 Plan"), to replace the Stock Option Plan adopted in 1985, and described below. The 2005 Plan was reapproved by the stockholders at the 2010 Annual Meeting. The 2005 Plan expired by its terms on April 27, 2015, and grants can no longer be made under it. 
Administration 
The 2005 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which has general responsibility to ensure that the 2005 Plan is operated in a manner that served the best interests of the Fund's stockholders. 
Awards 
The following types of awards are currently outstanding under the 2005 Plan: 
 restricted stock units;
​
 deferred stock units.
​
In addition, dividend equivalents were awarded in connection with awards under the 2005 Plan. 
The awards are described more fully below. 
Restricted Stock Units.   The 2005 Plan permitted restricted stock units to be granted to Participants. Restricted stock units represent rights to receive stock and are subject to certain restrictions and a risk of forfeiture.
Deferred Stock Units.   The 2005 Plan authorized deferred stock units to be granted to Participants. A deferred stock unit is the right to receive stock, cash, or a combination of stock and cash at the end of a time period specified by the Compensation Committee. Deferred stock units may or may not be  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
subject to restrictions (which may include a risk of forfeiture), which restrictions will lapse at the expiration of the specified deferral period or at earlier times, as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Employee Thrift Plans 
Employees of the Fund who have completed six months of service may defer up to 100% of base salary and cash incentive compensation to a tax qualified thrift plan instead of being paid currently, and the Fund contributes an amount equal to 100% of each employee's contribution (up to 6% of base salary and cash incentive compensation) but not in excess of the maximum permitted by law (see footnotes to the Compensation Table set forth on page 15 regarding 2018 contributions for the officers identified therein). The Fund also has the discretion to contribute annually to each employee's thrift plan account an amount of up to 6% of the employee's combined base salary and cash incentive compensation attributable to the prior year's service with the Fund. All employee contributions are credited to the employee's individual account. Employees may elect that their salary deferral and other contributions be invested in Common Stock, or the common stock of PEO, or a number of mutual funds, or a combination thereof. All of the Fund's matching contribution is invested in accordance with the employee's investment elections. An employee's interest in amounts derived from the Fund's contributions becomes non-forfeitable upon completion of 36 months of service or upon death or retirement. Payments of amounts not withdrawn or forfeited under the Thrift Plan may be made upon retirement or other termination of employment. 
The Fund also maintains an Executive Nonqualified Supplemental Thrift Plan for eligible employees of the Fund (the "Nonqualified Plan"). The purpose of the Nonqualified Plan is to provide deferred compensation in excess of contribution limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on tax-qualified thrift plans, including the Employee Thrift Plan of the Fund described above. In accordance with such limitations, for 2018, the maximum annual amount that an individual can defer to all tax-qualified thrift plans offered by the Fund is $18,500 for those under the age of 50, and $24,500 for those age 50 and over, and the maximum combined amount – consisting of both the employee's contributions and the Fund's matching contributions – that can go into any single tax-qualified thrift plan is $55,000 per year for those under the age of 50 and $61,000 per year for those age 50 and over. 
The Nonqualified Plan permits an eligible employee to contribute to the Nonqualified Plan up to the maximum amount of 6% of the employee's salary and cash incentive compensation that he or she is prevented from contributing to the tax-qualified thrift plan because of the Internal Revenue Code's limitations on annual contributions, and for the Fund to contribute the 100% matching contribution on that sum and/or the Fund's discretionary contribution that would otherwise be limited by the Internal Revenue Code's limitations on annual contributions. The employee's contributions and the Fund's contributions to the Nonqualified Plan are invested in eligible mutual funds in accordance with the employee's investment elections. 
Brokerage Commissions 
During the past fiscal year, the Fund paid brokerage commissions in the amount of $461,165 on the purchase and sale of portfolio securities traded on the New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System, and on swap transactions, substantially all of which were paid to brokers providing research and other investment services to the Fund. The average per share commission rate paid by the Fund was $0.03. No commissions were paid to an affiliated broker.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​​

(2) RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
As permitted under the Act, the Audit Committee selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 100 E. Pratt Street, Suite 2600, Baltimore, MD 21202, an independent registered public accounting firm, for recommendation to the full Board as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books and accounts of the Fund for the year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP was the Fund's principal auditor during the year 2018. A majority of the members of the Board of Directors who are not "interested persons" (as defined by the Act) have approved the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. While not required under the Act, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have determined to submit for stockholder ratification the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 at the Annual Meeting. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are expected to be present at the meeting to make a statement, if they so desire, and to respond to appropriate questions. The Fund has been informed that PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not have any direct financial or any material indirect financial interest in the Fund. 
Independent Accountant Fees
Audit Fees 
The aggregate fees for professional services rendered by the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements for 2018 and the audit of the Fund's annual financial statements and review of the Fund's semi-annual financial statements for 2017 were $82,862 and $80,919, respectively. 
Audit-Related Fees 
There were no audit-related fees in 2018 and 2017.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
Tax Fees 
The aggregate fees for professional services rendered to the Fund by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the review of the Fund's excise tax calculations and preparations of federal, state, and excise tax returns for 2018 and 2017 were $11,500 and $18,494, respectively. 
All Other Fees 
There were no other fees for services rendered to the Fund by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in 2017. In 2018, other fees for services rendered to the Fund by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP related to the implementation of a new accounting standard were $500.
The Board's Audit Committee has considered the provision by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP of the services covered in this All Other Fees section and found that they are compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence. 
Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. In assessing requests for services by the independent auditors, the Committee considers whether such services are consistent with the auditor's independence; whether the independent auditors are likely to provide the most effective and efficient service based upon their familiarity with the Fund; and whether the service could enhance the Fund's ability to manage or control risk or improve financial statement audit and review quality. The Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to its Chair. Any pre-approvals by the Chair under this delegation are to be reported to the Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services performed for 2018 were pre-approved by the Committee. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP.
(3) OTHER MATTERS AND ANNUAL REPORT
As of the date of this proxy statement, management knows of no other business that will come before the meeting. Should other business be properly brought up, it is intended that proxies in the accompanying form will be voted thereon in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting such proxies. 
The Annual Report of the Fund for the year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements, is being mailed to all stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting to be held on April 16, 2019.

In addition, for stockholder proposals or director nominations that a stockholder seeks to bring before the 2020 Annual Meeting but does not seek to have included in the Fund's proxy statement and form of proxy for that meeting, the following requirements apply: Pursuant to the Fund's Bylaws, in order for stockholder proposals or nominations of persons for election to the Board of Directors to be properly brought before the 2020 Annual Meeting, any such stockholder proposal or nomination (including in the case of a nomination, the information required by the Fund's advance notice Bylaws provisions) must be received at the office of the Fund no earlier than September 30, 2019 and no later than October 30, 2019. The Fund's advance notice Bylaw requirements are separate from, and in addition to, the Commission's requirements (including the timing requirements described in the preceding paragraph) that a stockholder must meet in order to have a stockholder proposal included in the proxy statement. Should the Fund determine to allow a stockholder proposal that is received by the Fund after October 30, 2019 to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies in the form accompanying the proxy statement for such meeting will have discretionary voting authority with respect to such stockholder proposal.
