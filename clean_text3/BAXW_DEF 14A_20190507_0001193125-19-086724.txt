 Baxter International Inc. One Baxter Parkway Deerfield, Illinois 60015   March 26, 2019      
   Dear Fellow Stockholder: It is my pleasure to invite you to attend Baxter's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at our corporate  headquarters located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m.   Baxter's mission is unchanging and enduring: Save and Sustain Lives. It is a constant that defines our emphasis on medically necessary products as well as the  commitment of our employees. What does change, in contrast, is how we bring this mission to life. For the past three years, we have been on a journey of transformation to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders.   We continue investing to renew the pace of high-potential innovation across the company. This is an  essential part of our commitment to patients, and equally essential to delivering increased value for our investors. Building on our recent progress, we intend to continue accelerating innovation through our internal research and development  pipeline, business development, and by expanding into new adjacencies, from prevention through recovery. We are employing a highly disciplined business development strategy, assessing opportunities of varying scope and scale. We are focused on  ensuring a complementary fit – whether through adjacencies or even new healthcare lines beyond our current core – as well as a return on investment in line with our current standards and expectations.   Simultaneously, we will maintain our tenacious focus on operational efficiency, which has been key  to increasing our margins and cash flow over the past three years. Our focus on operational excellence has been a defining element of our ongoing transformation. Zero-based organization and spending initiatives have helped usher in a new era of  efficiency, agility and spending discipline across all corners of the business.   An evolving  culture has played a crucial role in Baxter's broader transformation over the past three years. Our longtime mission to Save and Sustain Lives is being pursued with a new sense of dynamism and urgency, powered by levers like speed, simplicity,  courage and collaboration. This charge will continue in order to maintain and accelerate our renewed trajectory.   Our 50,000 employees1 make it all possible. Our globe-spanning diversity is matched only by the commitments we  share…including our passion for patients, our drive to innovate, and our belief in reaching beyond today's goals and expectations. As much as any strategy, these traits will continue to form our future and the impact we deliver for our  stakeholders.   As Baxter's Chairman and CEO, it is gratifying to help channel this energy  into meaningful results. We have already accomplished a great deal; but I am convinced that this is prologue for what is to come. There are so many opportunities within our reach to advance healthcare, refine our operations and deliver enhanced  value for investors. Now it is time to deliver on the potential we have worked hard to create. Many thanks for your ongoing support and confidence as this journey continues.   We hope that you join us at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to discuss our results and learn more about our strategic agenda. Details of the business to be conducted  at the Annual Meeting are included in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement, which we encourage you to read carefully. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please review the information on attendance provided  on page 73 of the proxy statement.   Your vote is very important to us. Whether or not you plan  to attend in person, I urge you to vote your shares as promptly as possible. You may vote your shares by Internet or by telephone. If you received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, you may sign, date and return the proxy card in the enclosed  envelope.

   Dear Fellow Stockholder: It is my pleasure to invite you to attend Baxter's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at our corporate  headquarters located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m.   Baxter's mission is unchanging and enduring: Save and Sustain Lives. It is a constant that defines our emphasis on medically necessary products as well as the  commitment of our employees. What does change, in contrast, is how we bring this mission to life. For the past three years, we have been on a journey of transformation to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders.   We continue investing to renew the pace of high-potential innovation across the company. This is an  essential part of our commitment to patients, and equally essential to delivering increased value for our investors. Building on our recent progress, we intend to continue accelerating innovation through our internal research and development  pipeline, business development, and by expanding into new adjacencies, from prevention through recovery. We are employing a highly disciplined business development strategy, assessing opportunities of varying scope and scale. We are focused on  ensuring a complementary fit – whether through adjacencies or even new healthcare lines beyond our current core – as well as a return on investment in line with our current standards and expectations.   Simultaneously, we will maintain our tenacious focus on operational efficiency, which has been key  to increasing our margins and cash flow over the past three years. Our focus on operational excellence has been a defining element of our ongoing transformation. Zero-based organization and spending initiatives have helped usher in a new era of  efficiency, agility and spending discipline across all corners of the business.   An evolving  culture has played a crucial role in Baxter's broader transformation over the past three years. Our longtime mission to Save and Sustain Lives is being pursued with a new sense of dynamism and urgency, powered by levers like speed, simplicity,  courage and collaboration. This charge will continue in order to maintain and accelerate our renewed trajectory.   Our 50,000 employees1 make it all possible. Our globe-spanning diversity is matched only by the commitments we  share…including our passion for patients, our drive to innovate, and our belief in reaching beyond today's goals and expectations. As much as any strategy, these traits will continue to form our future and the impact we deliver for our  stakeholders.   As Baxter's Chairman and CEO, it is gratifying to help channel this energy  into meaningful results. We have already accomplished a great deal; but I am convinced that this is prologue for what is to come. There are so many opportunities within our reach to advance healthcare, refine our operations and deliver enhanced  value for investors. Now it is time to deliver on the potential we have worked hard to create. Many thanks for your ongoing support and confidence as this journey continues.   We hope that you join us at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to discuss our results and learn more about our strategic agenda. Details of the business to be conducted  at the Annual Meeting are included in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement, which we encourage you to read carefully. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please review the information on attendance provided  on page 73 of the proxy statement.   Your vote is very important to us. Whether or not you plan  to attend in person, I urge you to vote your shares as promptly as possible. You may vote your shares by Internet or by telephone. If you received a paper copy of the proxy card by mail, you may sign, date and return the proxy card in the enclosed  envelope. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may revoke your proxy and vote in person.

If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please review the information on attendance provided  on page 73 of the proxy statement.   Your vote is very important to us. Whether or not you plan  to attend in person, I urge you to vote your shares as promptly as possible. You may vote your shares by Internet or by telephone.

Very truly yours,        José (Joe) E. Almeida Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer 
   Dear Fellow Stockholder: It is my pleasure to invite you to attend Baxter's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at our corporate  headquarters located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m.   Baxter's mission is unchanging and enduring: Save and Sustain Lives. It is a constant that defines our emphasis on medically necessary products as well as the  commitment of our employees. What does change, in contrast, is how we bring this mission to life. For the past three years, we have been on a journey of transformation to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders.   We continue investing to renew the pace of high-potential innovation across the company. This is an  essential part of our commitment to patients, and equally essential to delivering increased value for our investors. Building on our recent progress, we intend to continue accelerating innovation through our internal research and development  pipeline, business development, and by expanding into new adjacencies, from prevention through recovery. We are employing a highly disciplined business development strategy, assessing opportunities of varying scope and scale. We are focused on  ensuring a complementary fit – whether through adjacencies or even new healthcare lines beyond our current core – as well as a return on investment in line with our current standards and expectations.   Simultaneously, we will maintain our tenacious focus on operational efficiency, which has been key  to increasing our margins and cash flow over the past three years. Our focus on operational excellence has been a defining element of our ongoing transformation. Zero-based organization and spending initiatives have helped usher in a new era of  efficiency, agility and spending discipline across all corners of the business.   An evolving  culture has played a crucial role in Baxter's broader transformation over the past three years. Our longtime mission to Save and Sustain Lives is being pursued with a new sense of dynamism and urgency, powered by levers like speed, simplicity,  courage and collaboration. This charge will continue in order to maintain and accelerate our renewed trajectory.   Our 50,000 employees1 make it all possible. Our globe-spanning diversity is matched only by the commitments we  share…including our passion for patients, our drive to innovate, and our belief in reaching beyond today's goals and expectations. As much as any strategy, these traits will continue to form our future and the impact we deliver for our  stakeholders.   As Baxter's Chairman and CEO, it is gratifying to help channel this energy  into meaningful results. We have already accomplished a great deal; but I am convinced that this is prologue for what is to come. There are so many opportunities within our reach to advance healthcare, refine our operations and deliver enhanced  value for investors. Now it is time to deliver on the potential we have worked hard to create. Many thanks for your ongoing support and confidence as this journey continues.

This charge will continue in order to maintain and accelerate our renewed trajectory.   Our 50,000 employees1 make it all possible. Our globe-spanning diversity is matched only by the commitments we  share…including our passion for patients, our drive to innovate, and our belief in reaching beyond today's goals and expectations. As much as any strategy, these traits will continue to form our future and the impact we deliver for our  stakeholders.   As Baxter's Chairman and CEO, it is gratifying to help channel this energy  into meaningful results. We have already accomplished a great deal; but I am convinced that this is prologue for what is to come. There are so many opportunities within our reach to advance healthcare, refine our operations and deliver enhanced  value for investors. Now it is time to deliver on the potential we have worked hard to create. Many thanks for your ongoing support and confidence as this journey continues.   We hope that you join us at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to discuss our results and learn more about our strategic agenda. Details of the business to be conducted  at the Annual Meeting are included in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement, which we encourage you to read carefully. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please review the information on attendance provided  on page 73 of the proxy statement.   Your vote is very important to us.

   Dear Fellow Stockholder: It is my pleasure to invite you to attend Baxter's Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Tuesday, May 7, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at our corporate  headquarters located at One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Registration will begin at 8:00 a.m.   Baxter's mission is unchanging and enduring: Save and Sustain Lives. It is a constant that defines our emphasis on medically necessary products as well as the  commitment of our employees. What does change, in contrast, is how we bring this mission to life. For the past three years, we have been on a journey of transformation to deliver enhanced value for our stakeholders.   We continue investing to renew the pace of high-potential innovation across the company. This is an  essential part of our commitment to patients, and equally essential to delivering increased value for our investors. Building on our recent progress, we intend to continue accelerating innovation through our internal research and development  pipeline, business development, and by expanding into new adjacencies, from prevention through recovery. We are employing a highly disciplined business development strategy, assessing opportunities of varying scope and scale. We are focused on  ensuring a complementary fit – whether through adjacencies or even new healthcare lines beyond our current core – as well as a return on investment in line with our current standards and expectations.   Simultaneously, we will maintain our tenacious focus on operational efficiency, which has been key  to increasing our margins and cash flow over the past three years. Our focus on operational excellence has been a defining element of our ongoing transformation. Zero-based organization and spending initiatives have helped usher in a new era of  efficiency, agility and spending discipline across all corners of the business.

   Dear Stockholder: It has been my privilege to serve as Baxters lead independent director during 2018. I also enjoyed meeting with several of our investors as part of our stockholder  engagement program in late 2018 (as described on p.32 of the proxy statement). I look forward to continuing to engage in productive dialogue with our stockholders in 2019 and beyond.   Your Board plays a key advisory role in the mission and strategic direction of the company, and we  are actively committed to our oversight responsibilities across all areas of the company. The Board includes diverse and independent directors with a wide range of skills and experiences that support Baxters strategy and help to position the  company for long-term success in the complex and rapidly changing healthcare environment.   As a  lead director, I liaise closely with the other independent directors to help ensure their input is incorporated into the Board meetings and work closely with Joe Almeida to develop the agenda topics. Additionally, I provide an independent channel  for investors and other stakeholders to access the Board and Baxter generally. There were many developments in our Board and governance practices in 2018, including:      Board Refreshment  We welcomed two new Board members: Patricia (Patty) Morrison and Amy  Wendell. Their appointments were the result of our ongoing board refreshment activities, which included (for the first time) the use of a third party to help oversee our annual self-assessment process. Both Amy and Patty bring critical experience in  the areas of information technology and cybersecurity and M&A, respectively, which complement Baxters strategies and potential transformation activities. Ms. Carole Shapazian and Mr. Munib Islam have announced their decisions to  depart from the Board effective May 6th. We are grateful for their years of service and contributions to Baxter.      Stockholder Engagement  We continued to build upon our year-round engagement program with  stockholders to better understand their perspectives on a variety of relevant issues, including strategy, performance, governance, compensation, corporate responsibility and Board composition, refreshment and leadership.      Governance Improvements   Consistent with feedback received from several investors and in light of the companys increased focus on digital health, we amended our Committee charters in February 2019 to assign oversight responsibility for IT functions (including non-product related cybersecurity matters) to the Audit Committee. The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee is now responsible for cybersecurity as it relates to Baxter products and services.  Ms. Morrison has been added to the Audit Committee in light of her significant expertise in these areas.   I am confident that Baxter will continue to build on its growing momentum with the Boards active involvement, valuable input and support. I am equally confident  that we currently have the proper structures in place to help accomplish the companys long term strategic goals.   Best regards,        Thomas T. Stallkamp Lead Director

Your Board plays a key advisory role in the mission and strategic direction of the company, and we  are actively committed to our oversight responsibilities across all areas of the company. The Board includes diverse and independent directors with a wide range of skills and experiences that support Baxters strategy and help to position the  company for long-term success in the complex and rapidly changing healthcare environment.   As a  lead director, I liaise closely with the other independent directors to help ensure their input is incorporated into the Board meetings and work closely with Joe Almeida to develop the agenda topics. Additionally, I provide an independent channel  for investors and other stakeholders to access the Board and Baxter generally. There were many developments in our Board and governance practices in 2018, including:      Board Refreshment  We welcomed two new Board members: Patricia (Patty) Morrison and Amy  Wendell. Their appointments were the result of our ongoing board refreshment activities, which included (for the first time) the use of a third party to help oversee our annual self-assessment process. Both Amy and Patty bring critical experience in  the areas of information technology and cybersecurity and M&A, respectively, which complement Baxters strategies and potential transformation activities. Ms. Carole Shapazian and Mr. Munib Islam have announced their decisions to  depart from the Board effective May 6th. We are grateful for their years of service and contributions to Baxter.      Stockholder Engagement  We continued to build upon our year-round engagement program with  stockholders to better understand their perspectives on a variety of relevant issues, including strategy, performance, governance, compensation, corporate responsibility and Board composition, refreshment and leadership.      Governance Improvements   Consistent with feedback received from several investors and in light of the companys increased focus on digital health, we amended our Committee charters in February 2019 to assign oversight responsibility for IT functions (including non-product related cybersecurity matters) to the Audit Committee. The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee is now responsible for cybersecurity as it relates to Baxter products and services.  Ms. Morrison has been added to the Audit Committee in light of her significant expertise in these areas.   I am confident that Baxter will continue to build on its growing momentum with the Boards active involvement, valuable input and support. I am equally confident  that we currently have the proper structures in place to help accomplish the companys long term strategic goals.   Best regards,        Thomas T. Stallkamp Lead Director

Both Amy and Patty bring critical experience in  the areas of information technology and cybersecurity and M&A, respectively, which complement Baxters strategies and potential transformation activities. Ms. Carole Shapazian and Mr. Munib Islam have announced their decisions to  depart from the Board effective May 6th. We are grateful for their years of service and contributions to Baxter.      Stockholder Engagement  We continued to build upon our year-round engagement program with  stockholders to better understand their perspectives on a variety of relevant issues, including strategy, performance, governance, compensation, corporate responsibility and Board composition, refreshment and leadership.      Governance Improvements   Consistent with feedback received from several investors and in light of the companys increased focus on digital health, we amended our Committee charters in February 2019 to assign oversight responsibility for IT functions (including non-product related cybersecurity matters) to the Audit Committee. The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee is now responsible for cybersecurity as it relates to Baxter products and services.  Ms. Morrison has been added to the Audit Committee in light of her significant expertise in these areas.   I am confident that Baxter will continue to build on its growing momentum with the Boards active involvement, valuable input and support. I am equally confident  that we currently have the proper structures in place to help accomplish the companys long term strategic goals.   Best regards,        Thomas T. Stallkamp Lead Director 
   Dear Stockholder: It has been my privilege to serve as Baxters lead independent director during 2018. I also enjoyed meeting with several of our investors as part of our stockholder  engagement program in late 2018 (as described on p.32 of the proxy statement). I look forward to continuing to engage in productive dialogue with our stockholders in 2019 and beyond.   Your Board plays a key advisory role in the mission and strategic direction of the company, and we  are actively committed to our oversight responsibilities across all areas of the company. The Board includes diverse and independent directors with a wide range of skills and experiences that support Baxters strategy and help to position the  company for long-term success in the complex and rapidly changing healthcare environment.   As a  lead director, I liaise closely with the other independent directors to help ensure their input is incorporated into the Board meetings and work closely with Joe Almeida to develop the agenda topics. Additionally, I provide an independent channel  for investors and other stakeholders to access the Board and Baxter generally.

1   For purposes of calculating performance under the company's 2018 annual incentive plan, net sales were calculated at  budgeted exchange rates (as of January 1, 2018) and were adjusted to exclude results associated with sales of the company's newly acquired RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK products. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations per share and  adjusted operating margin were further adjusted (for purposes of performance calculations under the company's 2018 annual and long-term incentive plans) to exclude the results associated with RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK. We refer to these measures  as used in the proxy statement as adjusted net sales, further adjusted earnings per share or further adjusted EPS and further adjusted operating margin, respectively. These amounts totaled $11.6 billion in adjusted net sales, $3.01 in further  adjusted EPS and 17.2% in further adjusted operating margin. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Structure of Compensation Program—Financial Targets" and "—Performance Over the Long  Term—Performance Against Adjusted Operating Margin Target" for a reconciliation of the amounts listed in the graphics above along with further adjusted amounts (as described in this paragraph) to the applicable measures calculated in  accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

 Items to consider when evaluating this proposal: 
    Existing  Governance Structure: The companys existing governance structure allows the Board flexibility to make changes in the companys leadership structure in accordance with the best interests of the company and its stockholders    Consistent Communication and Coordination Through Transformation: Having  Mr. Almeida serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman allows consistent communication and coordination throughout the company and effective and efficient implementation of corporate strategy    Established Independent Oversight: The existing leadership structure and  corporate governance practices provide strong independent oversight of the Board, including the regular evaluation and review of the leadership structure by the Board. In 2018, the Board augmented this review process through the use of a third party  to oversee its annual self-assessment process. This process resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors, Patricia Morrison and Amy Wendell, to the Board    Strong Lead Director: The responsibilities of the lead director  are significant and include functioning as the primary liaison between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. Additionally, Mr. Stallkamp, who has served in the role since 2014, has helped oversee the company  and Board through significant milestones and periods of transition, including the July 2015 spin-off of Baxalta Incorporated (Baxalta) and the recruitment and appointment of Joe Almeida as Chief Executive  Officer and Chairman beginning January 1, 2016

 Items to consider when evaluating this proposal: 
    Baxter  Stockholders Have the Right to Call a Special Meeting: The companys organizational documents allow holders of 25% of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock to call a special meeting. This is approximately one-half of the percentage that would be required to act by written consent under the proposal    Minority Stockholders May be Left Out of the Written Consent Process:  The proposal does not include a requirement that all stockholders be given prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, stockholders holding a mere majority of the companys outstanding voting shares could adopt an action by  written consent that is binding on the company and the companys stockholders. In contrast, holders of just 25% of the outstanding shares of the companys common stock are already permitted to call a special meeting which requires prior  notice and gives all stockholders the opportunity to participate in the process    The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee Provides Strong  Oversight Over Product and Safety Matters: The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee is responsible for the oversight of risk management in the areas of product quality and safety at Baxter. It has overseen a significant reduction  in product recalls and the elimination of multiple Warning Letters since 2015    Committed to Maintaining Strong Corporate Governance Practices and  Protecting Stockholder Rights: This commitment is evidenced by, among other things, Baxters proxy access bylaw, the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting, the complete declassification of the Board, majority voting standard for  directors, the removal of super-majority voting provisions from Baxters organizational documents and Board composition and refreshment efforts

This is approximately one-half of the percentage that would be required to act by written consent under the proposal    Minority Stockholders May be Left Out of the Written Consent Process:  The proposal does not include a requirement that all stockholders be given prior notice and an opportunity to be heard. Furthermore, stockholders holding a mere majority of the companys outstanding voting shares could adopt an action by  written consent that is binding on the company and the companys stockholders.

Baxter's Bylaws require each director to be elected by the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director in uncontested elections; that is, the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that director. Abstentions will not be considered votes cast. In a contested election (a situation in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the standard for election of directors will be a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors. If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at an annual meeting of stockholders, under Delaware law the director would continue to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." However, under the company's Bylaws, any incumbent director who fails to be reelected at an annual meeting must offer his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee would then make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. In accordance with the Bylaws, the Board would act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date that the election results are certified. The director who offers his or her resignation would not participate in the Board's decision. 
All of the nominees have indicated their willingness to serve if elected, but if any should be unable or unwilling to stand for election, proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. No nominations for directors were received from stockholders (including as a result of any proxy access nominations), and no other candidates are eligible for election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Accordingly, there is no director election contest and each director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director in order to be reelected to the Board. Unless proxy cards are marked otherwise, the individuals named as proxies intend to vote the shares represented by proxy in favor of all of the Board's nominees. 
Set forth below under "—Nominees for Election as Directors" is information concerning the nominees for election.

Board of Directors 
As of March 26, 2019, the Board consists of 14 members. As previously announced, Mr. Munib Islam will be resigning from the Board effective May 6, 2019. Ms. Carole Shapazian will be retiring from the Board effective on the same date. In connection with these departures, the size of the Board will be reduced from 14 to 12 members. 
The Board has determined that each of the following current directors satisfies Baxter's independence standards and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) for independence: Thomas F. Chen, John D. Forsyth, James R. Gavin III, M.D., Ph.D., Peter S. Hellman, Munib Islam, Michael F. Mahoney, Patricia B. Morrison, Stephen N. Oesterle, M.D., Carole J. Shapazian, Cathy R. Smith, Thomas T. Stallkamp, Albert P.L. Stroucken and Amy A. Wendell. Please refer to "—Director Independence" below for a discussion of Baxter's independence standards. 
Mmes. Morrison and Wendell joined the Board in February 2019. In 2018, the Board held eight meetings. Each director attended at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and meetings of the committees on which he or she served in 2018. Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the company's expectation that directors attend each annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, all of the directors then in office participated in the 2018 annual meeting in person or by teleconference. 
The Board has a mix of relatively new and longer-tenured directors. This mix provides the Board with the benefit of new perspectives from shorter-tenured directors. It also helps to maintain the continuity of the Board and the Board's familiarity with, and knowledge of, the Baxter organization. In connection with the recent appointments of Mmes. Morrison and Wendell to the Board and the upcoming departures of Mr. Islam and Ms. Shapazian from the Board, the average Board tenure will decrease from 8.3 years (immediately prior to these appointments) to 7.8 years. 
Director Independence 
Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines require that the Board be composed of a majority of directors who meet the criteria for "independence" established by the rules of the NYSE. To be considered independent, the Board must affirmatively determine that a director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with Baxter (either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Baxter), and solely with regard to Compensation Committee members, consider all relevant factors that could impair his or her ability to make independent judgments about executive compensation. 
In making its independence determinations, the Board considers transactions, relationships and arrangements between Baxter and entities with which directors are associated as partner, stockholder or officer. When these transactions, relationships and arrangements have existed, they have generally been in the ordinary course of business and of a type customary for a global diversified company such as Baxter.

Director Qualifications 
As discussed below in "—Nomination of Directors," directors are selected on the basis of the specific criteria set forth in Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The experience, expertise and knowledge represented by the Board as a collective body allow the Board to lead Baxter in a manner that serves its stockholders' interests appropriately. Key attributes, experience and skills for each of the company's director nominees are included above under "—Nominees for Election as Directors". Set forth below is a summary of the collective qualifications, experiences and backgrounds of the director nominees in the aggregate. Each chevron represents a director nominee who possesses the specific attribute or experience. 
Nomination of Directors 
It is the policy of the Corporate Governance Committee to consider candidates for director recommended by stockholders, members of the Board and management. 
Each year, the Corporate Governance Committee oversees a robust review of the structure and composition of the Board and each committee. This review or self-evaluation is conducted to help assess how the Board and each committee functions in light of the company's strategic objectives, the company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and each committee charter. It also helps to identify any potential gaps or areas that the Board would like to augment by appointing new directors, rotating existing directors off the Board or refreshing committee assignments. 
For 2018, the Board engaged a third party to help oversee this self-evaluation process. This third party, an outside law firm with significant experience advising the boards of directors of other S&P 500 companies, conducted a one-on-one interview with each

 director. A representative from the law firm summarized those findings during presentations to the full Board and each committee in November 2018. The Board took this feedback into account when conducting its annual self-assessment process. The Board anticipates engaging a third party every few years or as circumstances otherwise warrant to help conduct these self-assessments. 
In connection with the annual self-assessment process (as described above), the Board retained a third-party search firm to help conduct a search for two new directors. The search firm was charged with seeking out candidates with significant information technology and cybersecurity experience in light of the company's increased focus on digital health. They were also asked to pursue candidates with significant merger and acquisition activity (including integration) experience. Additionally, the Board charged the search firm to seek out a diverse slate, with a particular focus on recruiting female candidates. 
With input from members of the Corporate Governance Committee, the search firm identified Mses. Morrison and Wendell. These efforts ultimately resulted in the Corporate Governance Committee recommending that the Board appoint both Mses. Morrison and Wendell. They joined the Board in February 2019. 
The Corporate Governance Committee evaluates all candidates for director in the same manner regardless of the source of the recommendation. Stockholder recommendations for candidates for director should include the same information required by Baxter's Bylaws for stockholder director nominees and be sent to the Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, Baxter International Inc., One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. 
Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that (as described below), director nominees selected by the Corporate Governance Committee must: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• possess fundamental qualities of intelligence, honesty, perceptiveness, good judgment, maturity, high ethics and standards,  integrity, fairness and responsibility;  
• have a genuine interest in the company and recognition that as a member of the Board, each director is accountable to all  stockholders of the company, not to any particular interest group;  
• have a background that demonstrates an understanding of business and financial affairs and the complexities of a large,  multifaceted, global business, governmental or educational organization;  
• be or have been in a senior position in a complex organization such as a corporation, university or major unit of government  or a large not-for-profit institution;  
• have no conflict of interest or legal impediment that would interfere with the duty of loyalty owed to the company and its  stockholders;  
• have the ability and be willing to spend the time required to function effectively as a director;  
• be compatible and able to work well with other directors and executives in a team effort with a view to a long-term  relationship with the company as a director; and  
• have independent opinions and be willing to state them in a constructive manner.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Board adopted certain amendments to its Corporate Governance Guidelines, which included the adoption of a mandatory retirement age of 75, subject to certain exceptions (such as, during a CEO succession or during a material merger, acquisition or disposition). 
A nominee's ability to meet the independence criteria established by the NYSE is a factor in the nominee selection process. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors are selected on the basis of talent and experience. Diversity of background, including diversity of gender, race, ethnic or geographic origin, age and experience (including in business, government and education as well as healthcare, science and technology), is a relevant factor in the selection process. This factor is relevant as a diverse Board is likely to be a well-balanced Board with varying perspectives and a breadth of experience that will positively contribute to robust discussion at Board meetings. A diverse board is also more reflective of Baxter's global customer base. The Board's focus on diversity matters helped to inform the recently completed director search and the appointments of both Mses. Morrison and Wendell to the Board. 
As discussed above, the Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to help identify potential gaps or areas that the Board may look to augment in light of the company's strategies. Ms. Morrison's diverse corporate leadership experience across multiple industries, coupled with her extensive experience in cybersecurity, global IT planning and digital transformations and her focus in digital health, helps support Baxter's pursuit of top quartile performance in its growth through innovation goal. Her contributions to the Board are expected to help the company maintain its position within the top quartile of industry leading performance. Ms. Wendell's investor.baxter.com

 comprehensive experience in business development strategy, corporate finance and portfolio management initiatives (including integration and restructuring activities) in the healthcare industry helps support the company's goal to deliver sustainable top-quartile performance for its stockholders and grow through innovation (both organic and inorganic). Mses. Morrison and Wendell also further enhance the diversity of the Board's membership. The Board's thoughtful approach to Board composition has resulted in a balance of skillsets and backgrounds that align with the company's strategic initiatives and are core to the Baxter business, enabling the Board to more effectively oversee the company's ongoing transformation efforts. 
If a vacancy occurs or is expected to occur on the Board (and the Board desires to fill the position), the Board initiates a process to identify potential candidates, if that process has not already been launched. Once a candidate has been identified, the Corporate Governance Committee (on behalf of the Board) and the independent search firm will engage in a process that includes a thorough investigation of the candidate, an examination of his or her business background and education, research on the individual's accomplishments and qualifications, in-person interviews and reference checking. If this process generates a positive indication, the lead director, members of the Corporate Governance Committee and the Chairman of the Board will meet separately with the candidate and then confer with each other regarding the candidate. After consideration of these background screens and interviews (possibly with multiple candidates), the Corporate Governance Committee may then recommend an individual to the full Board for further evaluation and ultimately election. If the full Board agrees, the Chairman of the Board is then authorized to extend an offer to the individual candidate to join the Board at that time or nominate the candidate for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
In addition to making recommendations to the Board, eligible stockholders are able to nominate a candidate for election to the Board through the proxy access provisions of Baxter's Bylaws. Subject to compliance with the related requirements (including with respect to the nominating stockholders and the nominee), the nominee will be included in the proxy statement as a stockholder nominee. The proxy access provision provides that a group of up to 20 stockholders that have held at least 3% of Baxter's outstanding shares for at least three years can nominate up to two individuals or 20% of the Board, whichever is greater, for election at an annual stockholders' meeting. No stockholders submitted any proxy access nominees for consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
Communicating with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders and other interested parties may contact any of Baxter's directors, including the lead director or the non-management directors as a group, by writing a letter to Baxter Board of Directors c/o Corporate Secretary, Baxter International Inc., One Baxter Parkway, Deerfield, Illinois 60015, or by sending an e-mail to boardofdirectors@baxter.com. Baxter's Corporate Secretary will forward communications directly to the lead director, unless a different director is specified. 
See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Summary—Stockholder Engagement" for a discussion of the company's stockholder outreach efforts. 
Other Corporate Governance Information 
Corporate Governance Guidelines

Since 1995, the Board of Directors has had in place a set of corporate governance guidelines reflecting these principles. Baxter's current Corporate Governance Guidelines, most recently revised in February 2018, cover topics including director qualification standards, mandatory retirement age, director responsibilities (including those of the lead director), director access to management and independent advisors, director compensation, director orientation and continuing education, succession planning and the annual evaluations of the Board and its committees. Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines are available on Baxter's website at www.baxter.com under "Our Story—Our Governance—Corporate Governance Matters—Corporate Governance Guidelines."

Board's Oversight of Risk 
Baxter's risk management activities include the identification and assessment of the key risks facing the company among the universe of business risks (strategic, operational, financial, regulatory/compliance, cybersecurity, etc). These risks are identified across the organization and come from multiple businesses, regions and functions. The Board and, as appropriate, its committees review these risks on at least an annual basis after they have been identified and assessed by management (including by the company's Risk Committee, as discussed below) and regularly review the initiatives put in place to mitigate the effects of these risks. 
These reviews include updates throughout the year from the businesses, regions and functions from which the key risks arise. Over the course of the year, each of the key risks and related mitigation strategies is reviewed with the Board or one or more committees of the Board, as applicable. For example, the Audit Committee reviews the financial risk assessment process and findings of the internal auditors while the Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee and the Audit Committee jointly receive an update from the ethics and compliance function at least annually. After giving effect to the recent amendments to the Audit and Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee charters, the Audit Committee has assumed oversight responsibility for the company's information technology (IT) functions, including non-product related cybersecurity matters. The Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee is now responsible for overseeing product or service based IT matters, including cybersecurity. The Audit Committee has, however, maintained responsibility for the oversight of any cybersecurity incident, including ones related to Baxter products and services. Both committees will receive updates from company management on these topics throughout the year. Additionally, the full Board will receive at least one update on IT and cybersecurity matters each year. Other risks are also reviewed by the Board as well as a Board committee. For example, quality updates are provided to the full Board throughout the year during the review of business and technology strategies of related global business units, capital expenditures or business development activities. The Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee receives a quality update as part of each regularly scheduled meeting. Through its risk oversight activities, the company identifies opportunities to further embed systematic enterprise risk management into its business processes. The Board actively encourages management to continue to identify enterprise risk and develop appropriate mitigation strategies. 
In addition to the Board's role in enterprise risk management, various committees of the Board are also expressly tasked by their charters to be responsible for the oversight of certain risks. More specifically and in addition to the IT and cybersecurity matters described above, the Audit Committee is charged with oversight of the process by which management assesses and manages risk as well as the company's major financial risk exposures and the steps taken to monitor and control these exposures, while the Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee is charged with oversight of Baxter's quality, compliance and innovation strategy programs (including with respect to product cybersecurity and IT matters) as well as review of strategic issues and corporate actions relating to current and emerging political issues, corporate citizenship and public policy. 
In 2017, Baxter formed the Risk Committee which is comprised of functional and business leaders. The committee meets approximately three times per year and engages in meaningful discussions about the company's enterprise risk management program. The Risk Committee helps to drive accountability across the organization, define the company's risk tolerances and evaluate the sufficiency of the company's mitigation plans. Throughout the year, the Board receives updates about the Risk Committee's activities and assessments from the head of Corporate Audit. 
Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
The Board recognizes that related person transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest. Accordingly, pursuant to Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Corporate Governance Committee has been charged with reviewing related person transactions regardless of whether the transactions are reportable pursuant to applicable rules of the SEC. For purposes of this policy, a "related person transaction" is any transaction in which the company was, is or is to be a participant and in which any related person has a direct or indirect material interest other than transactions that involve less than $50,000 when aggregated with all similar transactions. For any related person transaction to be consummated or to continue, the Corporate Governance Committee must approve or ratify the transaction. The Corporate Governance Committee will approve or ratify a transaction if it determines that such transaction is in Baxter's best interest. Related person transactions are reviewed as they arise and are reported to the Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Committee also reviews materials prepared by the Corporate Secretary (including information identified in questionnaires distributed annually to the company's directors, executive officers and controller and in the company's annual search of certain of its IT systems) to determine whether any related person transactions have occurred that have not been reported.

Board Structure and Processes 
Board Leadership Structure; Lead Director 
Mr. Almeida has served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer since January 1, 2016. Thomas T. Stallkamp currently serves as the lead director and has been elected annually to such position since May 2014. That annual election is made solely by the independent directors, instead of by the full Board. 
The Board regularly reviews the leadership structure of the company, including whether the position of Chairman should be held by an independent director. In connection with Mr. Almeida's appointment, the Board determined that it was in Baxter stockholders' best interests to keep the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles combined. The Board reached this decision in light of Mr. Almeida's significant industry and leadership experience, including as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Covidien. The Board also believed that Mr. Almeida would effectively connect the Board and Baxter management as he worked with management to establish Baxter's new strategic framework and refresh its long range plan. As Chairman of the Board, he has developed a process through which each component of this strategic framework is reviewed with the Board on a regular basis. 
As Chairman of the Board and pursuant to Baxter's Bylaws, Mr. Almeida presides at all Board and stockholder meetings, serves as the primary spokesperson for Baxter and acts as a liaison between the Board and the stockholders. As Chief Executive Officer and pursuant to Baxter's Bylaws, Mr. Almeida supervises the business of the company, subject to the direction of the Board. 
As lead director and pursuant to Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Mr. Stallkamp (or in his absence, another independent director) has the following responsibilities and authority: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding at all executive sessions of the Board;  
• acting as the principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman;  
• approving meeting agendas for the Board;  
• approving meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
• working with the Chairman to facilitate timely and appropriate information flow to the Board; and  
• ability to call meetings of the independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, executive sessions of the Board occurred as part of every regularly scheduled meeting of the Board and covered critical issues facing the company, including matters related to the company's product portfolio and inventory levels, capital allocation strategies and potential and ongoing business development opportunities. The lead director, together with the chairpersons of the Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees, lead the non-employee directors in the annual review and approval of compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Stallkamp serves as the contact person for interested parties to communicate directly with the independent members of the Board and has engaged with Baxter stockholders on selected topics, including corporate governance matters. 
Each May, the Corporate Governance Committee recommends a lead director for approval. Mr. Stallkamp has served in this role since May 2014 and was most recently elected in May 2018. 
As discussed above, the Board has determined that the combined Chief Executive Officer—Chairman structure currently serves the best interests of the company and its stockholders at this time in light of Mr. Almeida's significant industry and leadership experience and the strong role played by the lead director in accordance with Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board made this determination in advance of extending an offer to Mr. Almeida to serve as Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 
Executive Sessions 
As discussed above, independent directors of the Board met in executive session without management at every regularly scheduled meeting during 2018 in accordance with Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines. Mr. Stallkamp, as lead director, led these executive sessions. Additionally, the Audit Committee is required by its charter to regularly hold separate sessions during committee meetings with each of the internal auditor, the independent registered public accounting firm and management. The Compensation, Corporate Governance and Quality, Compliance and Technology Committees generally meet in executive session at each meeting.

Committees of the Board 
The standing committees of the Board of Directors consist of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Corporate Governance Committee and the Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee. 
Each committee consists solely of independent directors and is governed by a written charter. All standing committee charters are available on Baxter's website at www.baxter.com under "Our Story—Our Governance—Board Committees & Charters." 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee is currently composed of Albert P.L. Stroucken (Chair), Peter S. Hellman, Munib Islam, Patricia B. Morrison, Cathy R. Smith and Thomas T. Stallkamp, each of whom is independent under the rules of the NYSE and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act). The Board has determined that Messrs. Hellman, Stallkamp, Stroucken and Ms. Smith each qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee is primarily concerned with the integrity of Baxter's financial statements, system of internal accounting controls, the internal and external audit process and the process for monitoring compliance with laws and regulations (including with regard to cybersecurity matters). The Audit Committee's duties include: (1) reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of Baxter's internal control over financial reporting with management and the external and internal auditors and reviewing with management Baxter's disclosure controls and procedures; (2) retaining and evaluating the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm; (3) approving audit and permissible non-audit engagements to be undertaken by the independent registered public accounting firm; (4) reviewing the scope of the annual external and internal audits; (5) reviewing and discussing Baxter's financial statements (audited and unaudited), as well as earnings press releases and related information, prior to their filing or release; (6) overseeing legal and regulatory compliance as it relates to financial matters; (7) overseeing the company's IT functions, including non-product related cybersecurity matters; (8) holding separate executive sessions with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditor and management; (9) discussing guidelines and policies governing the process by which Baxter assesses and manages risk; and (10) approving certain financing matters, proposed corporate transactions and capital expenditures. The Audit Committee met 10 times in 2018. The Audit Committee Report appears on page 59. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is currently composed of John D. Forsyth (Chair), Peter S. Hellman, Michael F. Mahoney, Carole J. Shapazian and Thomas T. Stallkamp, each of whom is independent under the rules of the NYSE and is a non-employee director under the rules promulgated by the SEC under Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee exercises the authority of the Board relating to employee benefit and equity-based plans and the compensation of the company's officers. The Compensation Committee's duties include: (1) making recommendations for consideration by the Board, in executive session and in coordination with the Corporate Governance Committee, concerning the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer; (2) determining the compensation of the company's officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) and advising the Board of such determination; (3) making recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive compensation plans and equity-based plans and exercising the authority of the Board concerning benefit plans; (4) serving as the administration committee of the company's equity-based plans; (5) making recommendations to the Board concerning director compensation; (6) reviewing the adequacy of the company's stock ownership guidelines and periodically assessing compliance with these guidelines; and (7) overseeing the company's compensation philosophy and strategy and periodically assessing the risk related to its compensation policies and practices. The Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees work together to establish a link between the Chief Executive Officer's performance and decisions regarding his compensation. All compensation actions relating to the company's Chief Executive Officer are subject to the approval of the independent directors of the Board. The Compensation Committee met three times in 2018. The Compensation Committee Report begins on page 30. 
The Compensation Committee has the sole and direct responsibility for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of any advisor retained by the Compensation Committee, and it has directly engaged George B. Paulin, Chairman of Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. (FW Cook), as its independent compensation consultant. Additionally, Aon Hewitt assists the Compensation Committee with the compilation of market data from time to time. Mr. Paulin reports directly and exclusively to the Compensation Committee and his firm provides no services to Baxter except advising on executive and Board compensation matters. He provides analyses and recommendations that help inform the Compensation Committee's decisions, but he does not decide or approve any compensation investor.baxter.com

 actions. During 2018, he advised the Compensation Committee Chairman on setting agenda items for Compensation Committee meetings, reviewed management proposals presented to the Compensation Committee, assisted in the Compensation Committee's assessment of Baxter's compensation policies and practices and conducted a review of the compensation of non-employee directors at Baxter's peer companies. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Structure of Compensation Program—Baxter's Peer Group and Use of Peer Group Data" for additional information on Baxter's peer groups. In accordance with the rules of the SEC and the NYSE regarding the independence of compensation consultants, Mr. Paulin provided the Compensation Committee information regarding any personal, financial, or business relationships between FW Cook and Baxter, its management or the members of the Compensation Committee that could impair its independence or present a conflict of interest. Based on its review of this information, the Compensation Committee determined that there were no relationships that impair the independence or create a conflict of interest between Baxter and FW Cook and the partners, consultants and employees who provide services to the Compensation Committee (including Mr. Paulin). In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews the substantive performance of Mr. Paulin and FW Cook as part of its engagement process.

Oesterle, M.D, and Amy A. Wendell. The Board, through the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee, will appoint a new chairperson to this committee in connection with Ms. Shapazian's retirement. The Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to legal, regulatory (including quality) and other compliance matters and the company's innovation strategy. These responsibilities now include oversight over cybersecurity and other IT matters as they relate to the development of Baxter products and services. The committee also advises the Board with respect to Baxter's responsibilities as a global corporate citizen.

Special Litigation Committee 
The Special Litigation Committee is composed of Stephen N. Oesterle, M.D. (Chair), Michael F. Mahoney and Cathy R. Smith. The committee was established in September 2017 by the Board to investigate, on behalf of Baxter stockholders, a stockholder demand relating to alleged breaches of fiduciary duties by certain Baxter directors and officers. The Special Litigation Committee met five times in 2018. While it is not a standing committee of the Board, it is continuing to work on the matter. 
Director Compensation 
Non-employee directors are compensated for their service under Baxter's non-employee director compensation plan with cash compensation and equity awards of fully vested Baxter shares. For 2018, in addition to the cash compensation paid to all other non-employee directors (as described below under "—Cash Compensation"), Third Point LLC (Third Point), in recognition of

 Mr. Islam's service as a director, was paid an amount in cash equal to the value of the fully vested Baxter shares awarded to all other non-employee directors in May 2018 (as described below under "—Equity Grant"). Baxter's director compensation program utilizes equity awards in order to further align the interests of directors with Baxter stockholders. 
As previously announced, Mr. Islam has announced that he will be resigning from the Board effective May 6, 2019. As a result, he will not be eligible to receive any equity award (or a cash award in lieu of equity) in 2019, as his resignation will be effective before the May 7, 2019 grant date. Until May 6th, he continues to serve on the Board as a Third Point nominee in accordance with the terms of the company's September 2015 Support Agreement with Third Point and as a senior Third Point executive. 
Cash Compensation 
In 2018, each non-employee director was paid a $90,000 annual cash retainer and a $2,000 fee for each committee meeting attended, including meetings of the Special Litigation Committee. Directors no longer receive additional compensation for each Board meeting attended. 
Each non-employee director who acts as the chairperson of any standing committee receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000, except for the Chair of the Audit Committee who receives an additional retainer of $20,000 in light of the increased frequency of meetings held by this committee. The lead independent director is paid an additional annual cash retainer of $50,000. Non-employee directors are eligible to participate in a deferred compensation plan that allows for the deferral of all or any portion of cash payments until their Board service ends. The plan provides participants with a select subset of investment elections available to all eligible employees under Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. 
Equity Grant 
For 2018, the aggregate value of a non-employee director's annual equity grant was $185,000. Except as described above for Mr. Islam, 100% of this grant was made in fully vested Baxter shares unless a director elected to receive 50% of the value of the grant in fully vested options. All equity awards are subject to a six-month forfeiture period in the event the director stops serving on the Board during that period (other than as a result of death, disability or qualifying retirement). Beginning in 2019, each non-employee director can elect to defer receipt of all of his or her fully vested stock award under the deferred compensation plan each year. 
Other Director Compensation 
Directors are eligible to participate in the Baxter International Foundation matching gift program, under which Baxter's foundation matches gifts made by employees and directors to eligible non-profit organizations. The maximum gift total for a director participant in the program is $20,000 in any calendar year. 
Baxter's Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors; Prohibitions on Trading 
Baxter's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that after five years of Board service, each director is expected to hold common stock equal to five times the annual cash retainer provided to directors. In 2018, all directors whom have served on the Board for at least five years were in compliance with these guidelines. Further, the Board had previously determined that Mr. Islam satisfied this guideline by virtue of Third Point's ownership of Baxter common stock. See "Ownership of Our Stock—Security Ownership by Certain Beneficial Owners" for a description of Third Point's holdings. Mses. Morrison and Wendell have until February 2024 to satisfy these guidelines. 
Pursuant to Baxter's securities trading policy, Baxter directors are prohibited from engaging in short-term trading activities (including hedging) and option transactions in Baxter stock. As a result, directors cannot enter into any "put" or "call" options or otherwise buy or sell derivatives on any Baxter stock. Additionally, it is Baxter's policy not to permit directors to pledge Baxter securities as collateral for loans or otherwise as a security interest.

3  The amounts shown in this column are valued based on the grant date fair value of the underlying stock option award computed in  accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. For more information on how these amounts are calculated, please see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form  10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. Each of Messrs. Chen, Forsyth, Hellman and Stallkamp and Dr. Gavin and Ms. Smith elected to receive 50% of the value of their May 2018 equity grant in the  form of fully vested stock options. This resulted in the issuance of 9,027 fully vested stock options to each electing independent director. As of December 31, 2018, each non-employee director had the  following number of stock options outstanding, all of which were fully vested as of such date: Mr. Chen (26,869); Mr. Forsyth (47,546); Dr. Gavin (56,986); Mr. Hellman (56,986); Mr. Islam (6,290); Mr. Mahoney (20,777);  Dr. Oesterle (1,060); Ms. Shapazian (30,179); Ms. Smith (0); Mr. Stallkamp (30,286); and Mr. Stroucken (47,959).  
4  The amounts in this column include matching gift contributions made by Baxter's charitable foundation as of March 1, 2019 on  qualifying charitable donations made by the following directors in 2018: Mr. Hellman ($14,750); Dr. Oesterle ($15,085); Ms. Shapazian ($20,000); and Mr. Stallkamp ($20,000). These are the only components of "All Other  Compensation" that involved an amount equal to or greater than $10,000 for any director in 2018.

Corporate Responsibility 
Corporate responsibility is fundamental to Baxter's strategic aspirations and supports its mission to save and sustain lives. The company is focused on achieving top quartile results relative to its industry peers and other comparators across four dimensions: quality and patient safety, best place to work, growth through innovation and industry leading performance. Baxter's corporate responsibility strategy focuses on the issues that matter most to the company (in accordance with its mission and strategic goals) and its stakeholders. This strategy also reflects Baxter's assessment of where it may be able to have the greatest positive impact, and is reflected in Baxter's Corporate Responsibility Priorities and Goals (which are set forth in Baxter's annual Corporate Responsibility Report and briefly highlighted below). 
Management and Board Oversight 
Baxter's Corporate Responsibility Council, composed of executives and subject matter experts from across the company, helps oversee Baxter's corporate responsibility strategies and leads the company's efforts to integrate corporate responsibility into the company's business. Beginning in 2018, the full Board is now updated on corporate responsibility matters (including a discussion of related goals and industry trends) at least annually. Topics included in the September 2018 discussion incorporated environmental, health and safety and a review of Baxter's philanthropic contributions (consistent with the company's mission and strategic goals). This discussion also included updates on the company's Best Place to Work initiatives and Baxter's diversity and inclusion efforts. 
Previously, portions of these updates had been provided to the Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee. And pursuant to Baxter's enhanced stockholder engagement program, Baxter directors and management have engaged in corporate responsibility discussions with certain investors. Outputs from these discussions are shared with the entire Board during Board wide corporate responsibility updates and to the Corporate Governance Committee as part of its oversight of corporate governance matters generally. See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Summary—Stockholder Engagement" for additional Information. 
Priorities and Goals 
Baxter has a long-standing commitment to responsible operations and corporate responsibility reporting. Baxter is ever conscious of its global impact, including with respect to its employees, the communities it operates in and the people who use its products. The company believes that it has an obligation to ensure that these commitments are reflected in its global impact. Baxter's 2020 Corporate Responsibility Priorities and Goals cover the following eight categories:

      28                     Corporate Responsibility 
[END TABLE]
Many of these goals contain quantitative targets against which performance is assessed, tracked and disclosed in the company's Corporate Responsibility Report annually. 
In 2018, Baxter was honored for its efforts as an employer of choice and a socially responsible and sustainable business, receiving a number of recognitions including: Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens, Forbes' America's Best Large Employers, Working Mother's 100 Best Companies, as well as Equal Opportunity Publications' Top 50 Employer of Women Engineers and Top 50 Employer in STEM Workforce Diversity. The company was named one of America's Most JUST Companies by JUST Capital, and has consistently received a top score of 100 percent on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's Corporate Equality Index (CEI). Baxter is proud to have also been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the FTSE4Good Index Series, the Diversity Best Practices Leading Inclusion Index of U.S. companies, and to receive Newsweek Magazine's Green Ranking. These awards are among numerous other regional and country-specific recognitions across the globe. 
Annual Reporting 
Baxter is committed to sharing information about its corporate responsibility programs, priorities, goals and performance. The annual Corporate Responsibility Report illustrates the company's commitment to sound governance and balanced, transparent disclosure. It also serves as a platform for stakeholder engagement and provides an important means for soliciting feedback on the company's activities. More information about Baxter's corporate responsibility efforts and initiatives, including the 2017 Corporate Responsibility Report, is available on Baxter's website at www.baxter.com under "Our Story — Corporate Responsibility."

The company has designed its executive compensation programs to attract, motivate, reward and retain the senior management talent required to help achieve its corporate and strategic objectives and increase stockholder value. As discussed below in Compensation Discussion and Analysis, pay-for-performance is the most significant structural element of Baxter's executive compensation program, where the majority of executive pay is at risk and is only delivered if specific annual and long-term performance requirements are met. 
In addition, Baxter has also adopted policies, like the stock ownership guidelines and the executive compensation recoupment policy, to help ensure long-term focus and appropriate levels of risk-taking by executive officers. 
The Board believes that Baxter's executive compensation program is designed to meet the objectives discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section. Accordingly, the Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Baxter International Inc. approve the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers as  described in the proxy statement under "Executive Compensation," including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and other narrative disclosure contained therein.

This say-on-pay advisory vote is non-binding on the Board. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and thoughtfully consider the voting results when making future decisions concerning the compensation of the company's future named executive officers. The next say-on-pay advisory vote will be held at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis discusses the 2018 compensation paid to Baxter's executive officers who are identified as named executive officers below. The purpose of this discussion is to provide investors with an understanding of the company's executive compensation policies and practices, and the decisions regarding the compensation for the named executive officers. 
Summary 
2018 Results 
Baxter's financial results for 2018 reflect the company's achievement of significant financial, operational and strategic objectives. The related highlights include the following, all of which are consistent with the company's previously reported results except with respect to net sales, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin, each of which have been adjusted (or further adjusted as applicable), as described below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• exceeded the net sales target (calculated at budgeted exchange rates established at January 1, 2018) of  $11,549 million by $39 million (or 100.3% of target), after having eliminated the sales associated with the company's newly acquired RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK products;  
• exceeded the adjusted EPS target of $2.80 per share by $0.21 (or 107.7% of target), after having eliminated the results  associated with RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK (based on further adjusted EPS results);  
• exceeded the free cash flow target of $1,360 million by $55 million (or 104.0% of target);  
• exceeded the adjusted operating margin target of 17.0% by 20 basis points (or 101.2% of target), after having eliminated the  results associated with RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK;  
• delivery of innovative products for patients and expanded access to life-sustaining therapies through 22 new product  launches (excluding geographic expansions); and  
• returned $2.8 billion to stockholders in 2018 through cash dividends and share repurchases.  
[END TABLE]
As discussed in "—Structure of Compensation Program—Financial Targets" below, Baxter's short-term cash compensation program for 2018 was based on the company's further adjusted EPS, adjusted net sales and free cash flow performance for 2018, subject to adjustments for individual performance. Payouts for PSU awards earned under Baxter's long-term incentive plan in 2018 are based on Baxter's total shareholder return (for the period between January 1, 2018 and December 31, 2020) and the company's further adjusted operating margin performance in 2018. 
Baxter's global net sales totaled $11.1 billion in 2018 (or $11.6 billion calculated on an adjusted basis), with adjusted EPS of $3.05 and adjusted operating margin of 17.4%. For purposes of the company's 2018 cash bonus plan, adjusted EPS, as reported, was reduced by $0.04 to $3.01 to exclude results associated with RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK. Baxter achieved free cash flow (operating cash

 flow less capital expenditures) of $1.4 billion. Additionally, for purposes of adjusted operating margin PSUs earned in 2018, under the company's long term incentive plan, adjusted operating margin, as reported, was reduced by 20 basis points to 17.2% to also exclude RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK results. This approach is consistent with the company's historical practice of excluding the financial effect of material acquisitions from its results for purposes of calculating company performance under its compensation plans. See "—Structure of Compensation Program—Financial Targets" and "—Performance Over the Long-Term—Performance Against Adjusted Operating Margin Target" for a reconciliation of adjusted net sales, further adjusted EPS, further adjusted operating margin and free cash flow to the closest GAAP measure. 
The company's financial, operational and strategic performance (as discussed above) were all significant factors in the compensation decisions made for 2018. A comparison of the performance of Baxter's common stock against certain of its peers over the past three years provides another perspective on Baxter's overall performance. This comparison is an additional factor that the Compensation Committee or the Board, as applicable, considered when making compensation decisions for 2018. While the Compensation Committee has historically considered the relative performance of Baxter's common stock over longer periods when making compensation decisions, the shorter time period is intended to reflect the impact of Mr. Almeida's appointment as the company's new Chief Executive Officer and Chairman (effective January 1, 2016) and the subsequent changes made to the company's strategic framework and long range plan. 
The graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return (including reinvested dividends) on Baxter common stock and the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Health Care Index for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. As set forth below, the total shareholder return for Baxter for this period totaled approximately 78%, as compared to 30% for the S&P 500 Composite Index and 26% for the S&P 500 Health Care Index over the same period.

2018 Named Executive Officers 
For 2018, the Baxter named executive officers include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   José E. Almeida     Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer 
   Giuseppe Accogli     Senior Vice President and President, Global Businesses 
   Brik V. Eyre     Senior Vice President and President, Americas 
   Sean Martin     Senior Vice President and General Counsel 
   James K. Saccaro     Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 
[END TABLE]
On March 21, 2019, Baxter announced that Mr. Eyre will retire from the company effective June 30, 2019, and will cease serving as Senior Vice President and President, Americas as of April 1, 2019. In connection with his retirement, Mr. Accogli will succeed Mr. Eyre as Senior Vice President and President, Americas effective April 1, 2019. 
2018 Say-on-Pay Vote 
At the 2018 annual meeting, approximately 93% of the stockholders voting at the meeting approved the compensation paid to Baxter's named executive officers in 2017. Due to the strong level of stockholder support and consistent with discussions with select institutional investors (as described below), the company substantially maintained its executive compensation policies for 2018. 
The Compensation Committee and management are committed to continuing to strengthen pay-for-performance alignment, as well as the overall design of Baxter's executive compensation programs. As part of the outreach discussed below in "—Stockholder Engagement," stockholders provided the following feedback related to Baxter's compensation practices: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• queried whether stock options should constitute performance based compensation;  
• questioned the company's decision to issue retention stock units to certain named executive officers in 2017;   
• expressed a preference for three year (rather than annual) performance targets for the adjusting operating margin PSUs  granted to the company's executive officers; and  
• probed the company's decision to use different peer groups for purposes of evaluating its executive compensation  program generally and for assessing performance under its TSR PSU awards.  
[END TABLE]
While the Compensation Committee appreciates the feedback and took it into consideration, the Compensation Committee and management believe there is an appropriate business rationale for maintaining most of these features of the company's executive compensation program at this time. Consistent with the company's executive compensation program generally, the company did not issue any RSUs to executive officers in 2018. 
Stockholder Engagement 
Baxter sponsors an ongoing stockholder engagement program. At the direction of the Board, this program was expanded in 2017 to cover additional topics, including corporate responsibility matters, and to target additional stockholders. Additionally, Thomas Stallkamp, the lead independent director, took part in many of these discussions. As part of this program, the company is committed to engaging in constructive dialogue with its stockholders. Management is primarily responsible for stockholder communications and engagement, with involvement from the lead director and the chairs of the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees. Management provides regular updates to the Board on topics or concerns raised by stockholders. The Board considers this feedback as well as the interests of all stakeholders when overseeing company strategy, formulating governance practices and designing or evaluating compensation programs, as discussed above. 
During 2018 and early 2019, Mr. Thomas Stallkamp and select members of management have met with stockholders as part of the company's annual outreach program. These discussions followed an outreach to top Baxter investors representing over 50% of Baxter's outstanding shares. These investors include institutional investors, hedge funds, mutual funds and public pension funds. The company continues to meet with interested stockholders. Topics covered in these discussions have been expanded from prior years and now include Baxter's strategy and performance, Board composition, structure and refreshment and succession planning and executive compensation and corporate responsibility matters. Management continues to solicit feedback from stockholders on these subjects and will continue to provide related updates to the Board.

2018 Compensation Program Summary 
Baxter's compensation program for 2018 was consistent with the 2017 program. The annual financial measures and weightings used for 2018 annual cash bonus assessment were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Adjusted EPS      50%  
   Net Sales      30%  
   Free Cash Flow      20%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs constitute 50% of the annual equity grant for named executive officers in 2018.  One-half of the 2018 PSUs are measured against Baxter's TSR relative to its healthcare index peer group (as described below) over a three-year period, and one-half  of the 2018 PSUs are measured against three annual adjusted operating margin targets. Baxter utilizes three annual measures for adjusted operating margin at this time given the challenges of establishing a meaningful and precise three-year  performance target. This approach is consistent with the practices of several of Baxter's peer companies for similar performance measures. Each annual measure only affects one-third of the initial grant  requiring sustained performance over the three-year period to earn the full target award. Additionally, all PSU awards are subject to the satisfaction of a three-year time vesting requirement.  
• The performance schedule for both the TSR and adjusted operating margin PSUs are aligned with peer group practice. With  respect to TSR PSUs, the performance and payout schedule is as follows:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 TSR PSU Plan Payout     Peer Group Achievement Level 
 TSR PSU Plan Payout     Peer Group Achievement Level 
   200% of target    75th Percent Rank 
   150% of target    65th Percent Rank 
   100% of target    50th Percent Rank 
     25% of  target    25th Percent Rank 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The peer group used to determine Baxter's achievement level for TSR PSUs is the Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index. The  Compensation Committee has elected to use an indexed based peer group for this purpose, consistent with the recommendation of FW Cook, in the interest of potentially dampening volatility (given the larger number of companies contained in the index  as compared to those in the peer group used by the Compensation Committee for benchmarking executive compensation) and providing continuity as companies leave the executive compensation peer group due to mergers and acquisitions and other corporate  activity. This approach of utilizing an indexed peer group for purposes of TSR calculations is utilized by many of Baxter's peer companies. Additionally, Baxter's Investor Relations group utilizes this index for performance comparisons.   
• With respect to the adjusted operating margin PSUs, the schedule for 2018 awards is as follows:  
[END TABLE]

2018 Executive Compensation Awarded and Earned 
For his service as Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2018, Mr. Almeida has compensation reported in the Summary Compensation Table of $15,645,125. In reviewing the company's programs and the decisions made relative to Mr. Almeida's compensation, the independent members of the Board (including all Compensation Committee members) believe that Mr. Almeida was fairly rewarded for leading the company in 2018. They also believe that Mr. Almeida's compensation reflects the increased value delivered to Baxter stockholders beginning with the start of his tenure in 2016, as reflected in the three-year total shareholder return graph set forth above.

      34                     Executive Compensation 
[END TABLE]
A primary component of this total was Mr. Almeida's base salary of $1,300,000, as established in October 2015 in connection with his hiring. Mr. Almeida has not received a salary increase since he began serving as Baxter's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in January 2016. 
Another primary component of Mr. Almeida's 2018 compensation was his annual cash bonus of $2,582,450. Mr. Almeida's annual bonus funded at 137% of target reflecting the company's adjusted net sales, further adjusted EPS and free cash flow achievements, and he was provided 100% of his funded bonus target. 
In 2018, Mr. Almeida received 50% of his equity awards in stock options and 50% in PSUs. One-half of the newly issued PSUs are measured against Baxter TSR performance for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, and one-half are measured against three annual adjusted operating margin targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020, subject to satisfaction of the three-year time vesting requirements. For 2018, and as discussed in "—Financial Targets" below, the company's adjusted operating margin performance was reduced to reflect the exclusion of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK products. Mr. Almeida's long-term incentive grant for 2018 has a grant date fair value of $11,628,156. This value represents: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the full amount of the stock options granted to him as part of the 2018 annual grant process;  
• the full amount of the TSR PSUs granted to him as part of the 2018 annual grant process;  
• the first one-third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs granted to him in  connection with the 2018 annual grant process;  
• the second one-third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs awarded to him in  connection with the 2017 annual grant process; and  
• the final one-third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs awarded to him in  connection with his hiring in October 2015 (which was made to him in lieu of a 2016 annual grant).  
[END TABLE]
The remaining two-thirds of the adjusted operating margin PSUs awarded to Mr. Almeida as part of the 2018 annual grant process will be deemed granted in 2019 and 2020 (in two equal installments). Similarly, the final one-third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs awarded in connection with his 2017 annual grant will be deemed granted in 2019. These PSUs are deemed granted at these times because the related performance criteria are to be established in each of these years. 
Each named executive officer (other than Mr. Almeida) received total performance based compensation (cash bonus, stock options and PSUs) for 2018 as follows: $2,880,436 (Mr. Accogli); $3,056,490 (Mr. Eyre), $2,333,503 (Mr. Martin) and $3,824,816 (Mr. Saccaro). These amounts reflect input made by the Compensation Committee and Mr. Almeida to reflect the individual's 2018 performance or potential, as discussed below. 
A significant component of the total compensation paid to the named executive officers in 2018 was in the form of equity. The ability of the named executive officers to realize the grant date fair value of long-term incentives that are subject to the satisfaction of future performance vesting requirements will ultimately depend on the company's performance over the long term. 
Compensation Philosophy 
Baxter's compensation program is designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recognize company and individual performance;  
• drive the long-term financial performance of the company (and in doing so, encourage innovation and appropriate levels of  risk-taking); and  
• reflect the value of each officer's position in the market and within the company.  
[END TABLE]
The objectives of the program are to compensate Baxter's executive officers in a manner that is consistent with these principles, align the interests of management and stockholders and drive sustained and superior performance relative to the company's peers. The program is also designed to be comparable with companies with which Baxter competes for executive talent in order to attract, retain and motivate high-performing executives.

Structure of Compensation Program 
Pay-for-Performance 
Pay for performance is the most significant structural element of Baxter's compensation program. Baxter's focus on pay-for-performance is best demonstrated through the structure of its executive compensation programs, where the majority of executive pay is at risk and subject to specific annual and long-term performance requirements (including in the case of stock options, the performance of Baxter common stock). As shown below for 2018, 89% of Mr. Almeida's target compensation and 78% of the average target compensation for the other named executive officers was at risk and subject to performance. 
Named Executive Officer (NEO) Total Target Direct Compensation 
For 2018, Baxter's annual performance against financial targets of adjusted EPS, adjusted net sales and free cash flow helped to determine the payout of cash bonuses under Baxter's cash bonus plan. The payout amounts determined in relation to these financial targets were adjusted to reflect the officer's individual performance for 2018, as discussed below under "—Individual Performance." 
For 2018, Baxter named executive officers received 50% of their annual equity grants in the form of PSUs, of which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• one-half will be measured against Baxter's three-year TSR relative to the  company's peer group (as discussed in "—Performance Against Peers"), and  
• one-half will be measured against three annual adjusted operating margin targets.   
[END TABLE]
Stock options make up the remaining 50% of annual equity awards for 2018. The overall performance of Baxter's common stock determines the value of the stock options. The size of the equity awards is intended to reflect the officer's potential for future performance or advancement, as assessed by the Compensation Committee or the Board. See "—Individual Performance" for additional information. 
Financial Targets 
The Compensation Committee selected adjusted EPS, net sales at budgeted exchange rates and free cash flow as the financial measures for funding the cash bonus pool and as financial metrics for the cash bonus plan for 2018.    The table below shows the relative weight assigned to each measure for 2018:

[END TABLE]
Adjusted EPS, adjusted net sales (or net sales at budgeted exchange rates) and free cash flow were selected as financial metrics for the 2018 cash bonus plan as they are of immediate interest to stockholders and are the primary measures on which Baxter regularly provides guidance and publicly announces earnings to the market. 
Baxter generally calculates adjusted EPS for purposes of funding its cash bonus pool the same way it calculates adjusted EPS when publicly announcing earnings. The company uses net sales at budgeted exchange rates as a target for the same reason that Baxter provides sales guidance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and certain other items— that is, the company believes it provides a better perspective on underlying sales growth. The use of budgeted exchange rates allows Baxter to evaluate final performance on the same foreign currency basis that was used for setting the target and establishing the budget. The company uses free cash flow (rather than operating cash flow) as it gives effect to the company's capital expenditures and better reflects the cash available for future investment. Additionally, the company's historical practice has been to exclude the financial effect of material acquisitions from its results for purposes of calculating company performance under its compensation plans. 
The table below provides adjusted EPS, net sales and free cash flow targets for 2018, as well as actual results. For the first two metrics, actual results for 2018 constitute further adjusted EPS and adjusted net sales, reflecting the elimination of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK results (as discussed below). The Compensation Committee approved the company funding percentage under the 2018 cash bonus plan of 137%.

[BEGIN TABLE]
  1  Further adjusted EPS for purposes of the 2018 cash bonus plan was calculated as the company's diluted earnings per  share (determined in accordance with GAAP) as adjusted for special items and the impact of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK results. Special items for 2018 totaled $313 million (or $36 million on an after-tax  basis), or $0.06 per diluted share. These adjustments primarily related to intangible asset amortization, business optimization initiatives, acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Claris Injectables Limited (Claris) and the  RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK products, upfront payments related to research and development collaborations and license agreements, a gain from remeasuring the company's previously held investment to fair value upon acquisition of a controlling  interest in its joint venture in Saudi Arabia, certain product related items (including product litigation), Hurricane Maria insurance recoveries, costs associated with complying with certain European regulations (medical device reporting  regulations), the settlement of certain Claris-related claims and an update to the estimated impact of tax reform previously made by the company. Adjusted EPS for the 2018 bonus plan was further adjusted to remove the impact of $22 million, or  $0.04 per diluted share, of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK results from the year. We refer to this further adjusted amount as further adjusted EPS throughout the proxy statement. Total GAAP EPS from continuing operations in 2018 was $2.99.   
  2  Net Sales for purposes of the 2018 cash bonus plan were calculated as the company's reported net sales (determined in  accordance with GAAP) at budgeted exchange rates as of January 1, 2018. These amounts were adjusted to reflect the elimination of $52 million of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK net sales in 2018. We refer to this adjusted amount as adjusted net sales  throughout the proxy statement. Adjusted net sales totaled $11.6 billion for 2018. GAAP net sales for 2018 totaled $11.1 billion.  
  3  Free Cash Flow is calculated from the company's operating cash flow from continuing operations calculated in  accordance with GAAP less capital expenditures. This amount excluded $681 million in capital expenditures in 2018.  
  4  Level of achievement used to determine funding of the cash bonus pool may not foot due to rounding. For 2018, the  pool was funded at two times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool (other than Mr. Almeida, for whom the bonus pool was funded at two times his target cash bonus).  
  5  Bonus payout approved by the Compensation Committee based on performance of each financial metric. The funding of each metric  ranges from 0% to 200% with the achievement of target performance at 100%. Each metric funds linearly between the threshold and target, the target and mid-point, and the  mid-point and maximum. The band of funding around the target varies by metric. This variation reflects the probability of achievement of a given target based on historical performance data.

Performance Over the Long-Term 
As a healthcare company, Baxter operates in a rapidly changing, increasingly competitive and heavily regulated environment. Accordingly, encouraging its executive officers to focus on the long-term performance of the company is particularly important to Baxter. In 2018, Baxter granted PSUs designed to reward strong and sustained long-term performance by the company on two important measures: TSR and adjusted operating margin. Fifty percent of each PSU award in 2018 was based on each of TSR and adjusted operating margin. 
Performance Against Peers 
TSR PSUs were granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and each have a three-year performance period. The performance period for the 2016 TSR PSUs ended on December 31, 2018. The performance periods for the 2017 and 2018 TSR PSUs will end on December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. 
The TSR PSUs described in this section are measured based on the following formula: 
Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Consecutive Trading Days of the Performance Period minus Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Consecutive Trading Days Immediately 
Preceding the Commencement of the Performance Period plus Reinvested Dividends 
Average Closing Stock Price Over the Last Twenty Consecutive Trading Days Immediately Preceding the 
Commencement of the Performance Period 
The TSR PSUs pay out in shares of Baxter common stock in a range of 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs awarded. The table below shows how the company's TSR against its peers (as described below) correlates with the 0% to 200% range of payouts for the 2016 TSR PSUs.

The performance and payout schedule for the 2017 TSR PSUs and the 2018 TSR PSUs is shown in the following table, based on the company's TSR performance relative to the related performance of the companies in the Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index over the relevant period:

TSR PSUs pay out linearly between each set of data points above the 25th percentile and below the 85th percentile (with respect to the 2016 TSR PSUs) or above the 25th percentile and below the 75th percentile (with respect to the 2017 and 2018 TSR PSUs). In order to pay out at the 100% target level, Baxter must outperform its peers at the 60th percentile (with respect to the 2016 TSR PSUs) or 50th percentile (with respect to the 2017 and 2018 TSR PSUs) over the relevant performance period.

The Compensation Committee elected to use a peer index (the Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index) for purposes of evaluating TSR performance beginning with the 2017 TSR PSU awards. See "—Baxter's Peer Group and Use of Peer Group Data" for additional information. This index will be used for purposes of assessing performance for the 2018 and 2019 TSR PSUs as well. 
Performance Against Adjusted Operating Margin Target 
Adjusted operating margin PSUs were granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Adjusted operating margin was established as the relevant performance metric for 2019 as well. 
One-third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs are deemed granted on the annual grant date of the year the award is made and on each of the annual grant dates of the subsequent two years. The third tranche of the 2016 PSUs, the second tranche of the 2017 PSUs and the first tranche of the 2018 PSUs were deemed granted in 2018, in connection with the establishment of the related adjusted operating margin target (as discussed below). Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by net sales for the period. Historically, Baxter has calculated adjusted operating margin (for purposes of its long-term incentive plan) in the same manner that it calculates and publicly announces its adjusted operating margin guidance and performance. Adjusted operating margin PSUs will pay out in shares of Baxter common stock in a range of 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs awarded. The table below shows how the company's further adjusted operating margin 2018 performance for the third tranche of the 2016 adjusted operating margin PSUs correlates with the 0% to 200% range of payouts.

The company set the adjusted operating margin target for 2018 at 17.0%. This target applies to the third tranche of the 2016 PSUs, the second tranche of the 2017 PSUs and the first tranche of the 2018 PSUs. Baxter achieved further adjusted operating margin of 17.2% in 2018, or 101.2% of the adjusted operating margin target. Special items impacting 2018 operating income totaled $337 million. These adjustments primarily related to intangible asset amortization, business optimization initiatives, acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition of Claris and the RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK products, upfront payments related to research and development collaborations and license agreements, certain product related items (including product litigation), Hurricane Maria insurance recoveries, costs associated with complying with certain European regulations (medical device reporting regulations) and the settlement of certain Claris-related claims. In connection with the calculation of 2018 further adjusted operating income, the elimination of RECOTHROM and PREVELEAK results account for the reduction of an additional $26 million in operating income. GAAP operating income for 2018 totaled $1.6 billion. 
Performance of Baxter Common Stock 
The performance of Baxter common stock helps to determine the value of the stock options and TSR PSUs that were granted to the named executive officers in 2018. 
Individual Performance 
The Compensation Committee assesses the individual performance and/or future potential of each company officer (other than the Chief Executive Officer) in making compensation decisions related to cash bonuses and equity awards. The independent members of the Board make this determination with respect to the Chief Executive Officer. Baxter believes it is important to consider an individual's performance in assessing compensation and not just the company's overall performance relative to the financial targets discussed above. 
The assessment of an individual's performance in the prior fiscal year may result in an adjustment of the amount that would otherwise be paid out to that individual under the cash bonus plan for that year based on the company's financial performance. Assessment of the future potential of an officer (which is informed by past performance) may cause the Compensation Committee or the Board, as applicable, to adjust the size of equity grants that would otherwise be made to that officer in a given year under the company's long-term incentive plan based on peer group positioning. 
The Compensation Committee's assessment of individual performance and future potential is inherently subjective and requires significant input from the Chief Executive Officer, who reviews the performance goals and self-evaluations of each of the other executive officers and shares his insights and recommendations with the Compensation Committee. Based on that input, the Compensation Committee assesses how well an officer fulfilled his or her obligations in the past year and an officer's potential for future contributions to Baxter. The assessment of the prior year's performance focuses on how well the operations or function for which an officer is responsible performed during the year. The Compensation Committee also considers how well an officer performed against the performance goals set for the officer. 
The independent members of the Board are responsible for assessing the Chief Executive Officer's performance each year and making adjustments to any bonus or equity award that would otherwise be made to the Chief Executive Officer under the cash bonus plan or long-term incentive plan, as applicable. As part of this assessment, they review the extent to which the Chief Executive Officer has satisfied his goals for the year (as described below). This review is conducted with the support of the lead independent director and the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committees, which oversee the establishment of the Chief Executive Officer's goals and the annual review process. 
The goals set for each named executive officer for 2018 reflect the diversity of the company's business and the wide range of responsibilities that are attributed to each of these officers. For example, Mr. Almeida had performance goals for 2018 covering the areas of leadership, innovation, quality/regulatory/compliance, strategic and business development, operational excellence, people/Board relations and financial sustainability. These goals are in addition to the financial targets established for the company generally under the cash bonus and long-term incentive plans. For the other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers various performance criteria depending on the nature of the executive's role. These criteria include goals such as implementation of critical projects (like acquisitions or divestitures), product development, regulatory or quality performance and innovation or research. 
In evaluating each officer's performance against his or her goals, consideration is given not only to whether an objective was met but most significantly how the objective was met. This consideration reflects how appropriately the officer prioritized meeting an objective relative to the officer's other responsibilities.

[END TABLE]
Accordingly, the adjustments that are made to an officer's compensation based on his or her performance are not directly correlated to the number of goals that an officer achieved. The Compensation Committee believes that this type of rigid correlation could motivate an officer to focus on achieving his or her performance goals rather than on fulfilling his or her job responsibilities in a manner that is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. For 2018, the Board made no individual adjustment with respect to Mr. Almeida's cash bonus award. Based upon the recommendation of Mr. Almeida and with the approval of the Compensation Committee, the other named executive officers received no individual adjustments to their 2018 cash bonus awards. 
In February 2018, the Board awarded an individual adjustment of 111% with respect to Mr. Almeida's 2018 long-term equity award. The other named executive officers received adjustments to their 2018 equity grants within a range of 95% to 108% of target. See "—Elements of Executive Compensation—Equity Awards—Individual Equity Grants" and "—Elements of Executive Compensation—Cash Bonuses—Determination of 2018 Annual Bonus Payouts—Individual Performance" for additional information regarding individual adjustment determinations made for the named executive officers in 2018. 
Baxter's Peer Group and Use of Peer Group Data 
Use of peer group data plays a significant role in the structure of the compensation program as it is a primary input in setting target levels for base salaries, cash bonuses and equity awards and helps to ensure that compensation is market competitive in order to attract and retain top talent. Baxter uses data from companies that the Compensation Committee has objectively selected as comparable companies (the peer group) to help identify a reasonable starting point for base salaries, cash bonuses and equity awards and then analyzes company and individual performance to determine whether it is appropriate to move away from this baseline. Peer group data also plays a role in what non-cash compensation is paid to the named executive officers as the market data the company obtains regarding companies in its peer group helps determine what types and amounts of non-cash compensation are appropriate for competitive purposes. If data is not available for a particular officer's position at the company, the Compensation Committee utilizes the information that is available to Aon Hewitt as well as internal equity principles to set an officer's compensation targets at levels that are competitive with other officers at Baxter. 
The companies in Baxter's compensation peer group are intended to be its closest comparators as a medical products company. This peer group of 21 companies (as established in July 2014) was used to assess performance under the 2016 TSR PSUs. Beginning with the 2017 TSR PSUs, the Compensation Committee approved the use of the Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index for purposes of evaluating the company's TSR performance over the applicable three-year period. It did so consistent with the recommendation of FW Cook which was made based upon other peer company practices and in light of the fact that Baxter management uses this index within its investor relations function. The Dow Jones Medical Equipment Index consisted of approximately 50 companies as of December 31, 2018. 
This index will also be used for purposes of evaluating the company's 2019 TSR PSUs, which were recently granted in February 2019. 
For 2018, the following companies were included in Baxter's updated peer group for purposes of benchmarking executive compensation. This list reflects the deletion, in 2017, of companies from the peer group that had different business strategies or executive compensation policies than Baxter. It also reflects the impact of consolidation within the healthcare sector since the peer group was first established in 2014:

The median revenue and market capitalization for these companies was approximately $10.4 billion and $21.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 or as of December 31, 2018, as applicable.

For 2019, Danaher Corporation has been added to the peer group for purposes of benchmarking executive compensation. FW Cook proposed this addition in response to further industry consolidation and in the interest of adding a company with a financial profile similar to that of Baxter's to the peer group.

Elements of Executive Compensation 
Base Salaries 
As discussed above, the Compensation Committee or the Board (in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) generally sets salaries within a competitive range between the 25th to the 75th percentile of salaries paid to comparable officers of companies in the peer group based on multiple factors, with a primary focus on the 50th percentile of the peer group. These factors include the individual's prior performance, overall experience, tenure in position and impact on company results, current comparison to benchmark position and an assessment of internal equity among peers. 
For 2018, Mr. Almeida received a base salary of $1,300,000. Effective as of February 24, 2018, the base salaries of each of the named executive officers (other than Mr. Almeida) were increased as part of the annual review process. As a result of these adjustments, salaries increased from (i) $687,000 to $710,000 (for Mr. Accogli), (ii) $660,000 to $673,000 (for Mr. Eyre), (iii) $620,000 to $635,000 (for Mr. Martin) and (iv) $700,000 to $717,000 (for Mr. Saccaro). For 2019, the base salaries for Messrs. Accogli, Eyre, Martin and Saccaro have been increased to $735,000, $693,000, $651,000 and $739,000, respectively. As noted above, Mr. Almeida's base salary and the only component of his compensation that is not performance based, remained unchanged for 2019. Additionally, Mr. Eyre will stop serving as an executive officer effective April 1, 2019. 
Cash Bonuses 
Cash bonus targets, like salaries, are set by the Compensation Committee (or the Board in the case of Mr. Almeida) within a competitive range generally between the 25th to the 75th percentile of the peer group, with a primary focus on the 50th percentile of the peer group. The same factors which influence the setting of salaries also impact the establishment of cash bonus targets. Payouts under the cash bonus plan range from 0% to 250% based on a combination of company (0% to 200%) and individual performance (0% to 125%). In the event that an individual incurs a termination of employment on or after July 1 of the performance year due to death or disability, the individual remains eligible for cash bonus program and the target amount will be prorated to reflect the number of full days of participation. 
Target Setting 
Cash bonus targets for all applicable named executive officers are set within a range that is competitive with cash bonuses targets of comparable officers at companies in Baxter's peer group (as in effect for the applicable period). The Compensation Committee has the discretion to further adjust each officer's cash bonus target as it deems appropriate. Typical reasons for adjusting cash bonus targets are experience, sustained individual performance, promotability and internal equity. 
Determination of 2018 Annual Bonus Payouts 
Based on the company's performance against its 2018 financial targets, the bonus pool was funded at two times the base salary for each executive officer covered by the bonus pool (other than Mr. Almeida). For Mr. Almeida, the bonus pool was funded at two times his target cash bonus in accordance with the terms of his offer letter. Application of the funding schedule associated with each metric resulted in an aggregate funding percentage of 137%, which the Compensation Committee approved as presented by company management. The actual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer was calculated using the following formula: (x) such officer's cash bonus target multiplied by (y) the company's aggregate performance across the three applicable metrics (as discussed below). The Compensation Committee or the Board then had the ability to further adjust the resulting amount in light of the applicable officer's individual performance for the relevant period, as discussed below in "—Individual Performance." 
Company Performance. For 2018, Baxter performed relative to its adjusted EPS, net sales and free cash flow financial targets at 107.7%, 100.3% and 104.0%, respectively; provided that adjusted EPS and net sales performance for 2018 were assessed as adjusted net sales and further adjusted EPS. This resulted in aggregate company performance of 137%. See " —Structure of Compensation Program—Financial Targets" for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP measures. 
Individual Performance. The goals for each Baxter named executive officer for 2018 reflect the responsibilities that are attributed to each of these officers. In evaluating each officer's performance against his goals, consideration was given not only to whether an objective was met, but also to how the objective was met. 
The Compensation Committee believes that the methodology it uses in paying cash bonuses is consistent with providing compensation that reflects how an officer is valued within the company and the marketplace. Based on the Compensation

[END TABLE]
Committee's assessment (or the Board's assessment in the case of Mr. Almeida) the 2018 cash bonus payouts were based on the company's financial performance (137% of target), with no adjustments made for individual performance. 
Equity Awards 
Equity awards are a significant component of each named executive officer's compensation package. The company's compensation program emphasizes equity awards to motivate executive officers to drive the long-term performance of the company and to align their interests with those of the company's stockholders. This emphasis is appropriate as these officers have the greatest role in establishing the company's direction and should have the greatest proportion of their compensation aligned with the long-term interests of Baxter's stockholders. This alignment is furthered by requiring officers to satisfy the stock ownership guidelines discussed below under "—Baxter's Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers; Prohibitions on Trading." 
Structure of Equity Compensation Program 
Baxter's equity compensation program for named executive officers has historically provided for annual grants in equal proportion of PSUs and stock options based on grant value. 
The company also periodically grants equity to named executive officers for recognition, recruitment and retention purposes, and as discussed above, utilizes equity as a primary vehicle to attract and retain high performing executives. In general, the Compensation Committee views one-time grants and grants not tied to performance as appropriate in limited circumstances and seeks to avoid their use to the extent it may be inconsistent with a pay-for-performance philosophy. The company did not make any retention grants to the named executive officers in 2018. 
Individual Equity Grants 
In order to determine the size of equity grants to be granted to each named executive officer (other than Mr. Almeida) in connection with the annual grant process in March 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed market data on the size of equity awards made to similarly situated officers at companies in Baxter's peer group. The Compensation Committee (or the Board in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) set targets that are competitive with the peer group for each of the named executive officers as of the assessment date. In determining the actual amount of each officer's equity grant, the Compensation Committee or the Board, as applicable, then used its discretion in March 2018 to adjust 2018 target equity grants for the company's named executive officers, across a range of 95% to 111% of the applicable peer group benchmark. These adjustments were made primarily to reflect an assessment of each named executive officer's sustained individual performance and future potential. 
The Board awarded Mr. Almeida 111% of his equity target in March 2018 as a result of Baxter's top quartile industry performance and the significant improvements made by the company as part of its quality and safety programs. 
One-half of the PSUs granted to the named executive officers in 2018 are measured on Baxter's TSR performance for the period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, and one-half are measured on annual adjusted operating margin (OM) targets for 2018, 2019 and 2020. 
Perquisites 
Baxter provides a very limited range of perquisites to its named executive officers. Baxter permits limited personal travel on company aircraft due to the potential efficiencies associated with such use. All personal aircraft usage must be pre-approved by the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the terms of the company's aircraft policy. The company and Mr. Almeida entered into an Aircraft Time Sharing Agreement in March 2018 whereby Mr. Almeida leases the company's aircraft on a non-exclusive, time sharing basis in accordance with the terms of the company's aircraft policy. Consistent with the company's practices, the agreement requires him to pay the company for any personal use at a reimbursement rate set by the Federal Aviation Regulations. 
Baxter may from time to time reimburse business-related travel and other related entertainment and incidental costs for officers and their significant others. Reimbursement for spouses or significant others of company officers is currently limited to incentive sales meetings at which the attendance of a significant other is encouraged. When such significant other travel occurs, Baxter pays these expenses and costs as the business purpose served is closely related to the benefits received. During 2018, Baxter's named executive officers were also eligible for reimbursement for executive physical examinations and related health services. 
In 2018, except as disclosed in the footnotes to the "—Executive Compensation Tables—Summary Compensation Table," the aggregate incremental cost associated with providing each perquisite was less than $10,000 for each named executive officer.

Retirement and Other Benefits 
Messrs. Eyre and Saccaro are participants in Baxter's pension and supplemental pension plans due to their prior employment with Baxter. These plans were closed to new participants as of December 31, 2006. Since Messrs. Eyre and Saccaro rejoined the company after this date, they are not eligible to accrue additional benefits in the company's pension plans. Messrs. Almeida, Accogli and Martin are not eligible to participate in Baxter's pension plans as each executive was hired by Baxter or transferred to the United States after the plans were closed to new participants in 2006. Employees hired or rehired after that date, including each named executive officer, receive an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of their compensation in Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan if their compensation exceeds the compensation that can be taken into account under Baxter's 401(k) plan. A more detailed discussion of the pension program is provided under the caption "—Executive Compensation Tables—Pension Benefits." 
Each of the named executive officers is eligible to participate in Baxter's deferred compensation plan, which permits the officer to defer the receipt of covered compensation and receive a 3.5% company match. Baxter allows named executive officers to participate in a deferred compensation plan in order to provide a market competitive plan as well as to facilitate retirement savings as part of the total compensation program in a cost- and tax-effective way for the company. The terms of Baxter's deferred contribution plan are more fully described under the caption "—Executive Compensation Tables—2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices 
With the assistance of the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee reviewed Baxter's material compensation policies and practices applicable to its employees, including its executive officers, and concluded that these policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. The key features of the executive compensation program that support this conclusion include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appropriate pay philosophy, peer group and market positioning;  
• effective balance in cash and equity mix, short- and long-term focus, corporate, business unit and individual performance  focus and financial and non-financial performance measurement and discretion; and  
• meaningful policies that mitigate risk, such as the stock ownership guidelines and executive compensation recoupment policy  discussed below.

Baxter's Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers; Prohibitions on Trading 
In order to align their economic interests with those of stockholders, executive officers are required to own a certain amount of Baxter stock. The Chief Executive Officer is required to achieve ownership of Baxter common stock valued at a minimum of six times annual base salary within five years of his or her appointment. Each of the other executive officers is required to achieve ownership of Baxter common stock valued at a minimum of four times annual base salary, in each case within five years of becoming an executive officer. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Accogli, Eyre, and Saccaro have met their ownership requirements, Mr. Almeida met his ownership requirements in February 2019 and Mr. Martin is expected to meet his ownership requirements within the five-year phase-in period (which will end in February 2022). This requirement, like the executive compensation recoupment policy discussed below, helps ensure long-term focus and appropriate levels of risk-taking by executive officers. 
Pursuant to Baxter's securities trading policy, officers and certain other employees, including all named executive officers, are prohibited from engaging in short-term trading activities (including hedging) and option transactions in Baxter stock. As a result, these persons cannot enter into any "put" or "call" options or otherwise buy or sell derivatives on any Baxter stock. Additionally, it is Baxter's policy to not permit officers to pledge Baxter securities as collateral for loans or otherwise as a security interest. 
Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy 
Baxter has an executive compensation recoupment policy that applies to all cash bonuses paid by Baxter under its incentive plans and all grants of equity awarded by the company to any person designated as an officer by the Board. Following any restatement of the company's financial results or if an officer violates a restrictive covenant contained in any agreement between the company and the officer, the Board will review the facts and circumstances that led to the requirement for the restatement or the violation and take any actions it deems appropriate with respect to executive incentive compensation. With respect to a restatement, the Board will consider whether an officer received compensation based on performance reported, but not actually achieved, or was accountable for the events that led to the restatement, including any misconduct. Actions the Board may take include recovery, reduction or forfeiture of all

 or part of any bonus, equity or other compensation previously provided or to be provided in the future, disciplinary actions and the pursuit of any other remedies. Baxter intends to disclose the aggregate amount of incentive compensation recovered under this policy, so long as the underlying event has already been publicly disclosed by the company. The company has made no such recoupments under the policy. 
Post-Termination Compensation 
Named executive officers may be entitled to receive certain payments if Baxter undergoes a change in control and the officer ceases to be employed by the company pursuant to severance agreements between Baxter and each executive officer. Providing for payments in a change in control situation is consistent with market practice and helps ensure that if a change in control is in the best interests of the stockholders (as determined by the Board), officers have appropriate incentives to remain focused on their responsibilities before, during and after the transaction without undue concern for their personal circumstances. In consideration for these benefits, the named executive officers have agreed to be bound for two years from the date of their respective termination to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants. The named executive officers' severance benefits were not a significant factor in determining their other compensation elements because the Compensation Committee did not believe that these benefits, as provided, exceeded market practices of peer companies in a way that justified a reduction in or any enhancement of any other elements. None of the named executive officers is entitled to any excise tax gross-up covering the officer's change in control benefits. 
In addition, under the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Almeida is entitled to receive certain payments in the event that his employment with Baxter is terminated by Baxter other than for cause or by Mr. Almeida for good reason within five years of his hire date. 
For a more detailed discussion of these agreements, including the estimated amounts that would be payable assuming a termination date of December 31, 2018, please refer to the information under the caption "Executive Compensation Tables—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Following a Change in Control."

1  All stock option awards made in 2018 are non-qualified stock options and vest  ratably in annual one-third increments over the three-year period beginning on the grant date.  
2  The option exercise prices reflect the closing price of Baxter's common stock on the grant date.  
3  The amounts shown represent award opportunities under Baxter's 2018 annual cash bonus program at  100% of target bonus. There is no threshold amount for cash bonuses. The maximum cash bonus that could have been paid to any participating officer for 2018 performance was the lesser of (i) two times an officer's salary (or target bonus in  the case of Mr. Almeida) and (ii) $10 million. The actual cash bonus paid to each named executive officer for his 2018 performance is reported as "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" in  the Summary Compensation Table.  
4  These PSUs will be paid out in shares of Baxter common stock based on the change in Baxter TSR during the three-year performance period  ending on December 31, 2020. The amounts set forth under "Threshold," "Target" and "Maximum" represent the number of shares of Baxter common stock that would be paid out after the three-year performance period if  Baxter's TSR performance for the measurement period achieves the 25th, 50th and 75th  percentiles of the indexed peer group, respectively. For more information on how these payouts are determined, please see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Structure of Compensation Program—Performance over the  Long-Term—Performance Against Peers."  
5  The OM 2016 PSU Grants represent the third tranche of adjusted operating margin PSUs deemed granted in 2018, in connection with the  establishment of the 2018 adjusted operating margin target. The OM 2017 PSU Grants represent the second tranche of adjusted operating margin

Description of Certain Awards Granted in 2018 
Consistent with the company's executive compensation program, each named executive officer's grant for 2018 consisted of 50% stock options, and 50% PSUs, with adjusted operating margin PSUs and TSR PSUs each comprising 50% of the PSU award. 
Performance Share Units 
The TSR PSUs granted in 2018 will be paid out in shares of Baxter stock based on the change in total Baxter TSR during the performance period ending on December 31, 2020 compared to its indexed peer group. The adjusted operating margin PSUs granted in 2018 will be paid out in shares of Baxter stock after the end of the same three-year performance period based on achievement of three annual adjusted operating margin targets. The company's 2018 further adjusted operating margin performance of 17.2% exceeded the related adjusted operating margin target and the number of adjusted operating margin PSUs corresponding to the 2018 performance period have been awarded. The adjusted operating margin target for 2019 was established by the Board in February 2019. The adjusted operating margin target for 2020 will be established by the Board in the first quarter of 2020. 
One third of the adjusted operating margin PSUs granted in 2018 will be awarded after the end of each applicable annual performance period. Notwithstanding these annual awards, none of the awarded adjusted operating margin PSUs will vest until the end of the third annual performance period. TSR PSUs granted in 2018 are scheduled to vest at the end of the three-year performance period. 
Generally, if an officer ceases to be employed at Baxter before his or her PSUs vest, the PSUs will terminate on the date of termination unless the termination is due to death, disability, retirement or a change in control. If an officer who is retirement eligible (as defined below) retires after December 31, 2018, then the officer's PSUs will continue to vest based upon their original vesting schedule. If an officer is terminated due to death or disability after December 31, 2018, the officer's PSUs will be deemed to have been earned at 100% of target and paid out within 60 days of the death or disability termination date. See "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Following a Change in Control" for a discussion of the impact of a change of control transaction on outstanding PSUs. An individual is retirement eligible if he or she is at least 65 years of age, or at least 55 years of age with at least ten years of service. 
Stock Options 
Each named executive officer received a stock option grant in connection with the company's annual equity award process in March 2018. 
All stock options granted to named executive officers in 2018 vest one-third per year over a three-year period, starting on the first anniversary of the grant date. The exercise price of each stock option granted by Baxter to its executive officers under the company's incentive compensation programs is the closing price of Baxter's common stock on the grant date. Generally, if an officer ceases to be employed at Baxter before his or her stock options vest, these options will expire on the date such officer's employment is terminated unless the termination is due to death, disability, retirement or a change in control. If an officer who is retirement eligible (as defined below) retires after December 31, 2018, then the officer's stock options will continue to vest based upon their original vesting schedule and expire on the fifth anniversary of the termination date. If an officer is terminated due to death or disability after December 31, 2018, the officer's options will vest immediately and expire five years later. Except as discussed above, each of these options expires on the ten-year anniversary of the grant date. These grants are reflected in the "All Other Option Awards: Number of Securities Underlying Options" column in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table above. See "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Following a Change in Control" for a discussion of the impact of a change of control transaction on outstanding stock options.

Certain Employment Arrangements 
Almeida Offer Letter 
Mr. Almeida's offer letter, dated as of October 28, 2015, provides for an annual base salary of $1,300,000. Mr. Almeida has not received a salary increase since he was appointed to his current position effective January 1, 2016. He is eligible to participate in Baxter's officer bonus and long-term incentive programs at a level commensurate with his position as Chief Executive Officer as determined by the independent directors of the Board, and to receive benefits to the same extent and on the same terms as those benefits provided to other senior executives, such as health, disability, insurance and retirement benefits. The offer letter also provides for severance equal to two years' base salary and target bonus in the event of an involuntary termination without cause or termination with good reason within five years of his hire date. In addition to these benefits, in accordance with the terms of his change of control agreement, Mr. Almeida is eligible for certain payments in the event of his termination for good reason or termination without cause following a change in control. For more information about these payments, please see "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Following a Change in Control." Mr. Almeida also is subject to certain restrictive covenants, including non-competition, non-solicitation of customers, suppliers and employees and non-disparagement. 
Non-Compete / Non-Solicit Agreements; Equity Clawback Provision 
Effective in 2017, long term incentive plan participants, including named executive officers, were required to execute updated non-competition, non-solicitation and confidentiality agreements (Non-Competition Agreement). In addition, each annual equity grant since 2017 contains an equity clawback provision in the event that a participant violates the terms of his or her Non-Competition Agreement after leaving Baxter. In this event, all unvested awards (including awards that would otherwise have vested if the individual were retirement eligible) are terminated. Additionally, all awards that vested within the 12 months prior to termination that have not otherwise been sold or exercised are cancelled and any gain from the sale or exercise of any award that vested within the 12 months prior to termination is subject to recoupment by Baxter.

1  The amounts in this column have been determined by using pensionable earnings and benefit service  through 2018. The present value of this accrued benefit is deemed payable at the earlier of normal retirement (age 65) or the earliest point where it would be unreduced (85 points, where each year of age and Baxter service equals one point). It was  calculated as an annuity payable for the life of the participant and the present value of the benefit at the assumed payment age was discounted to the current age as of measurement date. Messrs. Almeida, Accogli and Martin are not eligible to  receive any pension benefits. See note 2 below for information regarding the participation of Messrs. Eyre and Saccaro under these plans. The present values of the accrued benefits are based on the following assumptions:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Discount Rate    4.27% 
 Postretirement Mortality    Retirement Plan 2014, adjusted to reflect past experience 
 Termination/Disability    None assumed 
 Retirement Age    Earlier of age 65 or attainment of 85 points 
[END TABLE]
Other assumptions not explicitly mentioned are the same as those assumptions used for Baxter's financial reporting. Please refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for more information on those assumptions.

2  Messrs. Eyre and Saccaro are participants in the pension and supplemental pension plan due to their prior employment with Baxter.  However, as they were rehired by Baxter after these plans were closed to new participants in December 2006, each of them receives an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of his compensation in Baxter's  tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan and nonqualified deferred compensation plan annually in lieu of additional pension accruals. These are the same benefits to which the other named executive officers are  entitled.  
[END TABLE]
Baxter's tax-qualified pension plan is a broad-based retirement income plan. The normal retirement (age 65) benefit equals (i) 1.75 percent of a participant's "Final Average Pay" multiplied by the participant's number of years of pension plan participation, minus (ii) 1.75 percent of a participant's estimated primary social security benefit, multiplied by the participant's years of pension plan participation. "Final Average Pay" is equal to the average of a participant's five highest consecutive calendar years of earnings out of his or her last ten calendar years of earnings. In general, the compensation considered in determining the pension payable to the named executive officer includes salary and cash bonuses awarded under the officer bonus program. Although age 65 is the normal retirement age under the pension plan, the pension plan has early retirement provisions based on a point system. Under the point system, each participant is awarded one point for each year of pension plan participation and one point for each year of age. Participants who terminate employment after accumulating at least 65 points, and who wait to begin receiving their pension plan benefits until they have 85 points, receive an unreduced pension plan benefit regardless of their actual age when they begin receiving their pension plan benefits. 
Baxter's supplemental pension plan is offered to provide a benefit for the amount of eligible compensation that is disallowed as pensionable earnings under the pension plan pursuant to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), that limit the benefit available to highly compensated employees under qualified pension plans. Accordingly, this plan is available to all employees eligible to participate in the pension plan whose benefit under the pension plan is limited by the Code. If the present value of a participant's benefit in the supplemental plan does not exceed $50,000 when the participant terminates employment, such participant will be paid in a lump sum. If the present value of the benefit exceeds $50,000, the participant will be paid in an annuity investor.baxter.com

 commencing when the participant is first eligible for early retirement, regardless of whether the participant elects to commence his or her qualified plan benefit at that time. As permitted by the transitional rules under related tax regulations, persons who were participants in the plan at the end of 2006 were given a one-time option to elect a different commencement date. Deferred salary and bonus amounts that may not be included under the pension plan are included in the supplemental plan. In addition, individual employment agreements may provide for additional pension benefits to be paid through the supplemental pension plan. 
Participation in the pension and supplemental pension plans was closed as of December 31, 2006. Any employees hired or rehired after that date (including Messrs. Eyre and Saccaro) are not eligible to participate in or receive additional benefits under the pension plan or supplemental pension plan, but instead receive an additional employer contribution equal to 3% of his or her compensation in Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan (and nonqualified deferred compensation plan if his or her compensation exceeds the compensation that can be taken into account under Baxter's 401(k) plan). Employees who were hired prior to December 31, 2006, but who did not have a vested interest in the pension plan, were eligible to elect to cease accruing benefits in the pension plan (and supplemental plan, if applicable), and instead receive the additional 401(k) plan employer contribution.

2  Amounts in this column are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table and include  company non-matching contributions attributable to 2018 but not yet credited to participant accounts.  
3  Amounts in this column are not included in the Summary Compensation Table as Baxter's deferred compensation plan provides  participants with a subset of investment elections available to all eligible employees under Baxter's 401(k) plan.

[END TABLE]
A participant in Baxter's deferred compensation plan may elect to defer a portion of his or her eligible compensation (up to 50% of base salary and up to 100% of eligible bonus) during the calendar year as long as the participant makes such election prior to the beginning of the calendar year. For named executive officers, eligible compensation under the deferred compensation plan includes a participant's base salary and any annual cash bonus. Participants in the deferred compensation plan may select from a subset of investment elections available to all eligible employees under Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. Amounts in a participant's account are adjusted on a daily basis upward or downward to reflect the investment return that would have been realized had such amounts been invested in the investments selected by the participant. Participants may elect to change their investment elections once each calendar month. Baxter is also required to match contributions to the deferred compensation plan up to 3.5% of a participant's eligible compensation. Any participant who either was hired after December 31, 2006, or elected not to continue to accrue benefits in the pension plan, receives a company contribution equal to 3% of his or her eligible compensation in excess of the compensation that is recognized in Baxter's 401(k) plan, regardless of whether the participant is otherwise eligible to elect to defer a portion of his or her compensation. Deferrals under the plan are not recognized as eligible compensation for the qualified pension plan (but are recognized in the supplemental pension plan) or in calculating benefit pay under Baxter's welfare benefit plans and result in lower compensation recognized for company matching under Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan. 
Participants may elect to be paid distributions either in a lump sum payment or in annual installment payments over two to 15 years. Such election must be made when the participant first becomes eligible to participate in the plan. Distributions will be paid in the first quarter of the plan year following such participant's termination of employment unless such participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code. No distributions will be paid in connection with the termination of a specified employee until at least six months following such termination and any amounts that would have otherwise been paid during such six-month period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum, without interest, at the expiration of such period.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Following a Change in Control 
In consideration for the change in control benefits discussed below, each named executive officer identified in the table below has agreed to be bound for two years from the date of his termination to non-competition, non-solicitation and non-disparagement covenants. The named executive officer is also required to execute a customary release of claims to receive the benefits discussed below. 
Each of Messrs. Almeida, Accogli, Eyre, Martin and Saccaro has entered into a change in control agreement with the company that provides for certain payments (as described below) in the event Baxter undergoes a change in control and the officer is terminated by the company (other than for cause or as a result of death or disability) or the officer terminates his employment for good reason during the term (which generally lasts two years and automatically extends each year). Additionally, and as set forth in note 1 to the table below, Mr. Almeida is entitled to receive severance in certain cases outside of a change of control if he is terminated within five years of his hire date. 
The change of control payments set forth below include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum cash payment generally equal to twice the aggregate amount of such officer's salary and target bonus for the  year in which termination occurs (reported as severance payments in the table below);  
• a prorated bonus;  
• a lump sum cash payment generally equal to continued retirement and savings plan accruals for two years;   
• two years of continued health and welfare benefit coverage;  
• two years of additional age and service credit for retiree health and welfare benefit purposes; and  
• outplacement expense reimbursement in an amount not to exceed $50,000.  
[END TABLE]
None of the change in control agreements between the company and any of the named executive officers provides for gross-up payments to cover excise taxes that may be payable by them in connection with a change in control. 
The table set forth below shows Baxter's potential payment and benefit obligations to each of the named executive officers assuming that a change in control of the company had occurred and as a result the named executive officer either was terminated without cause or terminated his or her employment for good reason as of December 31, 2018. The accelerated vesting of equity awards that is included in the table below would occur as a result of the terms of the equity compensation programs governing these awards rather than the terms of the change in control agreements.

CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by the applicable rules of the SEC, the company is providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of its global employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Almeida, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). For the year ended December 31, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the median Baxter employee (identified in accordance with the procedures described below)  was $45,226; and  
• the annual total compensation of Mr. Almeida as reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation  Table above was $15,645,125.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of Mr. Almeida's annual total compensation for 2018 to the annual total compensation of the median Baxter employee (as defined in applicable rules of the SEC) in 2018 is 346 to 1. The company believes this ratio is a reasonable estimate based on Baxter-specific employee demographics and compensation and was calculated in accordance with applicable rules of the SEC. Baxter's ratio may not be comparable to the ratio disclosed by its peer companies due to a number of factors, including the geographic distribution of its employees, the nature of the business (products or services), the performance of the company and whether the company manufactures its own products. 
The company used the methodology, material assumptions, adjustments and estimates as described in this section to identify the median Baxter employee and to calculate the annual total compensation of the median Baxter employee. As of November 1, 2018, Baxter's employee population consisted of approximately 49,000 individuals. The company did not utilize any exceptions permitted under applicable rules of the SEC to exclude any individuals from the total employee population when identifying the median employee. 
Baxter elected to identify a new median employee for 2018 given that last year's employee population excluded employees of Claris, the generic injectables business that Baxter acquired in 2017. To identify the median employee from Baxter's employee population for 2018, the company compared the amount of salary and target cash bonus for 2018 as reflected in Baxter's human resources information system for the employees referenced above (but excluding Mr. Almeida). In making this determination, Baxter annualized the compensation of all employees who were hired in 2018 but did not work for Baxter for the entire fiscal year. Using this approach, Baxter initially identified a subset of median individuals with the same salary and 2018 target bonus opportunity. Baxter then identified and calculated the elements of annual total compensation for 2018 for these individuals using the same methodology used to calculate Mr. Almeida's total compensation. Finally, Baxter selected an individual within the initial subset as its "median employee," identified as a full-time, hourly employee located in the United States. Application of this approach resulted in annual total compensation (including overtime and the contributions made by the company to Baxter's tax-qualified Section 401(k) plan) for such median employee of $45,226.

     The Audit Committee recommends a vote FOR the  ratification of the appointment of PwC as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.   
[END TABLE]
In accordance with its charter, the Audit Committee of the Board is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation (including the negotiation of audit fees), retention and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm retained to audit the company's financial statements. The Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as the independent registered public accounting firm for Baxter in 2019. PwC, or its predecessor firm, has served as Baxter's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since 1985. 
Before reappointing PwC as the company's independent auditor for 2019, the Audit Committee carefully considered PwC's qualifications as an independent registered public accounting firm. This included a review of PwC's performance in prior years, its knowledge of the company and its operations as well as its reputation for integrity and competence in the fields of accounting and auditing. The Audit Committee's review also included matters required to be considered under rules of the SEC on auditor independence, including the nature and extent of non-audit services, to ensure that the provision of such services will not impair the independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee expressed its satisfaction with PwC in all of these respects. In accordance with SEC rules and PwC policies, the lead partner overseeing the company's engagement rotates every five years and the Audit Committee and its Chairman are directly involved in Baxter's selection of the lead engagement partner. 
The Audit Committee believes that retaining PwC again in 2019 is in the best interests of the company and our stockholders, and therefore the Audit Committee requests that stockholders ratify the appointment. Further, the Audit Committee believes that, if handled properly, there are numerous benefits of a long independent auditor relationship, including. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• higher audit quality due to PwC's deep understanding of Baxter's business and accounting policies and practices;   
• efficient fee structures due to PwC's familiarity with Baxter and industry expertise; and  
• avoidance of significant costs and disruptions (including Board and management time and distractions) that would be  associated with retaining a new independent auditor.  
[END TABLE]
Nonetheless, the Audit Committee is also aware that a long-tenured auditor may be believed by some to pose an independence risk. To address these concerns, there are robust safeguards for auditor independence, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a strong regulatory framework for auditor independence, including limitations on  non-audit services and mandatory audit partner rotation requirements;  
• oversight of PwC that includes regular communication on and evaluation of the quality of the audit and auditor independence;   
• PwC's own internal independence processes and compliance reviews;  
• annual assessment of PwC's qualifications, service quality, sufficiency of resources, quality of communications,  independence, working relationship with our management, objectivity, and professional skepticism;  
• conducting regular private meetings separately with each of PwC and Baxter management at the end of each regularly scheduled  Audit Committee meeting;  
• overseeing the selection of PwC's new lead engagement partner with each rotation; and  
• considering periodically whether to conduct a search or request for proposal process for a new independent registered public  accounting firm.

The members of the Audit Committee and the Board believe that the continued retention of PwC as Baxter's independent registered public accounting firm is currently in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. Therefore the Audit Committee requests that stockholders vote in favor of the ratification of the appointment of PwC as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. If the company's stockholders do not ratify the appointment of PwC, the Audit Committee will consider the selection of another independent registered public accounting firm for 2020 and future years (as part of its annual assessment and appointment process). 
One or more representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they so desire.

Audit Committee Report 
Dear Stockholders: 
The Audit Committee is currently composed of six directors, all of whom meet the independence and other requirements of the NYSE. Additionally, four Audit Committee members qualify as an "audit committee financial expert." The Audit Committee has the responsibilities set out in its charter, which has been adopted by the Board and is reviewed annually. These responsibilities include: (1) reviewing the adequacy and effectiveness of Baxter's internal control over financial reporting with management and the external and internal auditors, and reviewing with management Baxter's disclosure controls and procedures; (2) retaining and evaluating the qualifications, independence and performance of PwC, the company's independent registered public accounting firm; (3) approving audit and permissible non-audit engagements to be undertaken by PwC; (4) reviewing the scope of the annual external and internal audits; (5) reviewing and discussing Baxter's financial statements (audited and unaudited), as well as earnings press releases and related information, prior to their filing or release; (6) overseeing legal and regulatory compliance as it relates to financial matters; (7) overseeing the company's IT functions, including non-product related cybersecurity functions; (8) holding separate executive sessions with PwC, the internal auditor and management; (9) discussing guidelines and policies governing the process by which Baxter assesses and manages risk; and (10) approving certain financing matters, proposed corporate transactions and capital expenditures. 
Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of Baxter's consolidated financial statements and Baxter's internal control over financial reporting. PwC is responsible for performing an independent integrated audit of Baxter's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of Baxter's internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). PwC also reviews Baxter's interim financial statements in accordance with the applicable auditing standards. Ultimately, it is the Audit Committee's responsibility to monitor and oversee these processes on behalf of the Board. The Audit Committee met 10 times in 2018, including meeting with PwC and Baxter's internal auditor, both privately and with management present. 
In fulfilling its duties, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management Baxter's audited financial statements included in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 as well as Baxter's interim financial statements included in the company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in 2018, in all cases including detailed discussions of the accompanying footnotes and related Management's Discussion and Analysis. These reviews also included, among other things, a discussion of Baxter's critical accounting policies; the reasonableness of significant financial reporting judgments, including the quality (not just the acceptability) of the company's accounting principles; the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting; corrected and uncorrected misstatements noted by PwC during its audit of the company's annual financial statements and review of the company's interim financial statements; and the potential effects of changes in accounting regulation and guidance on the company's financial statements. 
In addition, in connection with its review of the company's annual audited financial statements, the Audit Committee has discussed with PwC the matters required to be communicated pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees), has received and reviewed the written communications from PwC required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PwC its independence. The Audit Committee also has considered whether the provision by PwC of non-audit services to Baxter is compatible with maintaining PwC's independence. 
Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that Baxter's audited financial statements referred to above be included in Baxter's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
The table set forth below lists the fees billed to Baxter by PwC for audit services rendered in connection with the integrated audits of Baxter's consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by PwC during these periods.

 All Other Fees      11        93   
 Total    $ 9,933      $ 12,141   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees include fees for services performed by PwC relating to the integrated audit of the consolidated annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the review of financial statements included in the company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and statutory and regulatory filings or engagements. The audit fees in 2017 were higher than 2018 primarily due to incremental audit procedures applied as a result of the U.S. federal income tax reform, the impact of foreign exchange and business development activities. 
Audit-Related Fees include fees for assurance and related services performed by PwC that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the financial statements, including accounting consultations. The decrease in these fees from 2017 is attributable to a reduction of approximately $200,000 for the preparation of special reports pursuant to agreed upon procedures and a reduction of approximately $300,000 for GAAP accounting consultations. 
Tax Fees include fees for services performed by PwC for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. Of these amounts, approximately $318,000 in 2018 and $526,000 in 2017 were related to tax compliance services, including transfer pricing support, income tax return preparation or review and VAT compliance. Fees for tax consulting services of approximately $437,000 in 2018 and $147,000 in 2017 were related to international, federal, state and local tax planning, assistance with tax audits and appeals and other tax consultations. 
All Other Fees include fees for all other services performed by PwC. 
Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Fees 
The Audit Committee must pre-approve the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the company's consolidated financial statements. Prior to the engagement, the Audit Committee reviews and approves a list of services expected to be rendered during that year by the independent registered public accounting firm. Reports on projects and services are presented to the Audit Committee on a regular basis. 
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy for engaging the independent registered public accounting firm for other audit and permissible non-audit services. Under the policy (which is reviewed and approved annually), the Audit Committee has identified specific audit, audit-related, tax and other services that may be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. The engagement for these services specified in the policy requires the further, separate pre-approval of the chair of the Audit Committee or the entire Audit Committee if specific dollar thresholds set forth in the policy are exceeded. Any project approved by the chair under the policy must be reported to the Audit Committee at the next meeting. Services not specified in the policy as well as the provision of internal control-related services by the independent registered public accounting firm, require separate pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
All audit, audit-related, tax and other services provided by PwC in 2018 were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with its pre-approval policy.

Stockholder Proposal 
Independent Board Chairman—Proposal 4 
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, an amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
This proposal topic was 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. This proposal topic also won 48%-support from Baxter shareholders in 2015. This 48%-support would have been above 50% if all shareholders had the same access to independent proxy voting advice. 
Shareholder proposals such as this have played a leadership role in improving the governance rules of our company from a shareholder perspective. As a result of shareholder proposals at Baxter an onerous 67% shareholder vote requirement was eliminated (2013), shareholders now have a right to call for a special meeting (2013) and there is now shareholder proxy access at our company (2016). 
There is concern that the Baxter Chairman/CEO, José Almeida, received 10-times the negative votes as certain other Baxter directors. Also Thomas Stallkamp, Baxter Lead Director, had 18-years long-tenure. Long-tenure can impair the independence of a director no matter how well qualified. And independence is an all-important qualification for a Lead Director. 
An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight responsibilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between these positions to insure a balance of power and authority on the Board. 
Please vote yes:

Board of Directors' Statement Opposing the Stockholder Proposal 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
Baxter's lead director role provides strong independent oversight 
The Board recognizes the need for it to effectively operate independent of management and to have the benefit of meaningful independent leadership. As such, the Board regularly evaluates and reviews its leadership structure to determine if any changes are appropriate based on the current needs of the Board and the company. The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that so long as the Chief Executive Officer is also the Chairman of the Board, the independent directors will annually elect a lead director from among the independent directors. The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for recommending a candidate for lead director. The duties and responsibilities of the lead director, including as provided in the Corporate Governance Guidelines, are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• preside at all Board executive sessions and all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman and CEO is not present,  including executive sessions of the independent members of the Board;  
• act as principal liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and CEO;  
• review and approve meeting agendas for the Board and work with the Chairman and CEO to facilitate timely and appropriate  information flow to the Board;  
• review and approve meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
• have the authority to call special meetings of the independent directors;  
• in consultation with the chair of the Corporate Governance Committee, lead the annual performance evaluation of the  Chair/CEO and the CEO succession process;  
• engage with Baxter's stockholders on selected topics including corporate governance and executive compensation; and   
• serve as the contact person for interested parties to communicate directly with the independent directors.   
[END TABLE]
The company's existing governance structure allows the Board to make changes in the company's leadership structure if and when the Board believes that such actions are in the best interests of the company and its stockholders. The Board believes that the company and its stockholders are best served by a flexible policy that permits but does not require the same individual to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. A policy that would restrict the Board's discretion in selecting the Chairman would deprive the Board of the opportunity to select the most qualified and appropriate individual to lead the Board as Chairman. The Board expressed the same position in its response to a similar stockholder proposal considered by stockholders in 2018. The decreased level of support received by the 2018 proposal (approximately 26% in 2018 down from 30% in 2016 and from 48% in 2015) indicates that company stockholders are widely supportive of the Board's position and current leadership structure. 
The Board has acted in the best long-term interests of its stockholders to identify the right leadership structure 
At this time, having one individual serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, complemented by a strong lead director allows consistent communication and coordination throughout the company and effective and efficient implementation of corporate strategy. This combined role has been integral in unifying company employees behind the company's current long-range strategy. Additionally, as Chairman, Mr. Almeida discusses all material matters with the Board, and provides regular and robust disclosure of the company's business with the Board. 
The independent directors have determined that Mr. Almeida remains eminently qualified to fill this combined role and the Board believes doing so is optimal for the company and its stockholders. Mr. Almeida's decades of experience in the medical products industry, including his previous experience as the chairman and chief executive officer of another publicly held medical device company, make him well positioned to lead Baxter's business, operations and strategy and to serve as the chairman of the Board. 
While Mr. Stallkamp has served on the Board since 2000, he has only served as lead director since May 2014. He was appointed to that role in advance of the July 2015 Baxalta spin-off and in light of his significant knowledge of the company. That experience was invaluable in helping to lead the company through the spin-off and in the recruitment and appointment of Joe Almeida as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman beginning January 1, 2016.

The proposal is not necessary to ensure effective oversight of management and accountability to stockholders 
The Board has adopted various governance practices to promote the active, independent oversight of company management. These practices include the use of executive sessions of only the independent directors as part of every regularly scheduled Board meeting. During the executive sessions, led by our lead director Mr. Stallkamp, the independent directors discuss various matters relating to the company and the functioning of the Board. Mr. Almeida is the single member of management of the company's 14 directors on the Board—all other members are independent. Furthermore, the Board's four standing committees are comprised entirely of independent directors. Oversight of many critical matters for the company and the Board is entrusted to independent directors serving on these committees. In fact, the Corporate Governance Committee led the search that resulted in the recent appointments of Mses. Patricia Morrison and Amy Wendell as part of its ongoing board refreshment efforts. After giving effect to these appointments, 50% of the directors have an average tenure of less than four years. 
Since the 2016 Annual Meeting at which a similar stockholder proposal was defeated, the Board has overseen the complete declassification of the Board. Effective as of last year, all of Baxter's directors are elected to serve one year terms. Additionally, with this change came the elimination of all super-majority provisions from the company's organizational documents. 
In 2018, Mr. Stallkamp helped oversee the expansion of the Board's annual self-assessment program, which ultimately led to the recent director appointments (as discussed above). He also participated in the company's annual corporate governance outreach efforts during which he had the opportunity to engage directly with several of the company's large institutional stockholders. 
The Board believes it is important that it retain the flexibility and ability to exercise judgment, in accordance with its fiduciary duties, to determine the most effective Board leadership structure to best serve the interests of the company and its stockholders today and in the future. 
Thus, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.

Stockholder Proposal 
Right to Act by Written Consent—Proposal 5 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law. 
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. 
Taking action by written consent in place of a of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. 
This proposal won impressive 41%-support at the 2018 Baxter annual meeting. Thus it could have won more than 50%-support from the large shareholders who have ready access to independent information on the importance of this topic (as opposed to only the biased management information that small shareholders have). 
Dozens of Fortune 500 companies provide for both shareholder rights—to act by written consent and to call a special meeting. Our higher 25% threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting is one more reason that we should have the right to act by written consent. 
Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director to help deal with concerns like these and to avoid similar reoccurrences:

Please vote yes: 
Right to Act by Written Consent—Proposal 5 
Board of Directors' Statement Opposing the Stockholder Proposal 
The Board has carefully considered the proposal and recommends that stockholders vote AGAINST the proposal for the following reasons: 
Minority stockholders may be excluded from the written consent process 
The Board believes that all stockholders should have the opportunity to deliberate and vote on pending stockholder actions, not just those acting privately, without open deliberation and discussion, in the majority. The Board also believes that it is preferable to have stockholders take action that affects all stockholders, using the open and transparent process of an annual or special meeting that provides sufficient notice and the opportunity for all voices to be heard before voting. This proposal may actually diminish the rights of minority stockholders to participate in corporate governance, and reduce corporate due process, transparency and minority stockholder protections. 
Under the proposal, stockholders holding a mere majority of the company's outstanding voting shares would be necessary to act by written consent. No prior notice to other stockholders is required to be provided under the proposal, nor any opportunity to be heard in opposition. In contrast, currently under the company's organizational documents holders of just 25% of the outstanding shares of the company's common stock are already permitted to call a special meeting, where notice is provided up and contrasting viewpoints can be shared, heard and deliberated prior to decision-making. Moreover, there are thousands of combinations of different stockholders that can be aggregated to reach the 25% special meeting threshold, with no aggregation cap or minimum duration of ownership requirement. 
Under current company due process rules, coalitions of investors wanting to act by written consent (as suggested in the proposal) could instead simply call a special meeting and allow for constructive deliberation and voting at the special meeting. In addition to other benefits, this approach helps to ensure that the company governs its affairs in the most efficient, cost-effective and fulsome manner consistent with legal and regulatory requirements while also giving company stockholders a meaningful ability to propose actions for stockholder consideration between annual meetings.

      68                     Stockholder Proposal 
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that action by written consent can be misused to circumvent the important deliberative process of a stockholder meeting. Written consent rights as proposed could deprive many stockholders of the opportunity to deliberate in an open and transparent process, or even receive accurate and complete information on important pending actions. Under this, important actions affecting the rights of all stockholders could be taken by a bare majority, acting in a covert fashion, without the knowledge or participation of many stockholders, thereby disenfranchising those stockholders left out of the process. The written consent process could also be undertaken by different groups at substantially the same time and result in the adoption of written consents that are duplicative or contradictory. 
By contrast, all stockholders can participate in a special meeting. The process of voting at a stockholder meeting provides for transparent, public and deliberate consideration of issues facing the company. It provides stockholders with the ability to discuss concerns with other stockholders, with the Board and with management, and it helps to ensure that all stockholders have sufficient information and an opportunity to weigh the arguments that all sides present before voting on the proposal 
The Board has a demonstrated history of commitment to high standards of corporate governance 
The Board remains committed to maintaining strong corporate governance practices and protecting stockholder rights. This commitment has been evidenced through the adoption in recent years of various provisions in the company's organizational documents, including the charter provision that enables stockholders to call a special meeting (as discussed above), the recent adoption of a proxy access bylaw, the complete declassification of the Board (which was fully implemented as of the 2018 Annual Meeting) and the implementation of a majority voting standard for directors. It is also evidenced by the removal of super-majority provisions from the company's organizational documents (in connection with the declassification of the Board). The Board also critically evaluates itself each year in the interest of helping to ensure that its directors possess an appropriate mix of skills, experience and backgrounds. In 2018, the Board elected to expand the scope of this annual self-assessment process through the use of a third party. This self-assessment process resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors—Patricia Morrison and Amy Wendell. 
The Quality, Compliance and Technology Committee exercises strong independent oversight of product quality and safety 
In addition to its commitment to strong governance principles, the Board provides oversight in the company's pursuit of its strategic goals—which include top quartile performance in the areas of Patient Safety and Quality. The Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee of the Board is responsible for the oversight of risk management in the areas of product quality and safety. This committee meets during each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. Each Quality, Compliance & Technology Committee meeting includes a detailed Quality & Compliance Review during which the committee is briefed on the status of related matters, including the status of the company's outstanding Warning Letters. Since 2015, the company has closed out all but two outstanding Warning Letters. And while the existence of a product recall can be a sign of a company looking to rectify potential product or patient safety issues of which it has become aware, Baxter product recalls have decreased by more than 50% from 2015 to 2018. 
Other items alleged in the proposal are importantly outdated. In November 2018, the Department of Justice advised the company that it had closed its investigation into the manufacturing, selling, pricing and shortages of IV solutions and containers and communications with competitors regarding the same – and that the company was no longer a subject of the investigation. These are substantially the same matters on which the class action referred to in the proposal is based. The proposal fails to note that a federal judge dismissed that class action in July 2018. And while the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2018, the company has already filed a motion to dismiss that amended complaint. 
The Board's current leadership structure and engagement practices promote accountability to stockholders 
Mr. Stallkamp, as the lead director, provides effective, independent leadership to the Board. As reflected in the Board's response to Proposal 4—Independent Board Chairman, the Board has conferred significant responsibilities upon the lead director. Mr. Stallkamp's leadership and experience were instrumental in helping the company successfully complete the Baxalta spin-off and recruiting Mr. Almeida as the successor to Mr. Robert Parkinson. He also provides a communication channel for stockholders to engage with or contact the independent directors, including as part of the company's corporate governance outreach efforts (as described in "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Summary—Stockholder Engagement"). Mr. Stallkamp participated in several discussions with company stockholders in 2018. These established stockholder communication and engagement practices provide stockholders with opportunities to raise important matters and propose actions for stockholder consideration outside the annual meeting process.

[END TABLE]
In short, the Board believes that implementation of the proposal is not in the best interests of the company or its stockholders. The company's charter already provides stockholders with the ability to call a special meeting at which they could elect to take any action that would otherwise be included in a written consent. Furthermore, the Board has adopted strong corporate governance practices, including ongoing Board refreshment efforts, and established mechanisms through which stockholders can communicate with the Board. 
Thus, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.

• Each other matter requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock, present in person or by proxy  and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who will count the vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What constitutes a quorum?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are broker non-votes and what effect do they have?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Broker non-votes occur when nominees, such as banks and brokers holding shares on  behalf of beneficial owners, do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial holders. If that happens, the nominees may vote those shares only on matters deemed "routine" by the NYSE, such as the ratification of the appointment of  the company's independent registered public accounting firm. On "non-routine" matters nominees cannot vote unless they receive voting instructions from beneficial owners, resulting in so called  "broker non-votes." The items being considered at the Annual Meeting, except for the ratification of the appointment of the company's independent registered public accounting firm, under  "Proposal 3—Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm," are considered "non-routine" matters.  
[END TABLE]
Broker non-votes will have no impact on "Proposal 1—Election of Directors," "Proposal 2—Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Compensation," "Proposal 4—Independent Board Chairman" or "Proposal 5—Right to Act by Written Consent." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What effect does an abstention have?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Abstentions or directions to withhold authority will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1. Abstentions will have  the same effect as a vote against any of the other matters specified in the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is "householding" and how does it affect me?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Baxter has adopted "householding," a procedure under which stockholders of record who have the same address and  last name and do not receive proxy materials electronically will receive a single Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of proxy materials, unless one or more of these stockholders notifies the company that they wish to continue  receiving individual copies. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. This procedure can result in significant savings to the company by reducing printing and postage costs.  
[END TABLE]
If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or set of proxy materials, or if you wish to receive separate copies of future Notices, annual reports and proxy statements, please call 1-866-540-7095 or write to: Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. The company will deliver the requested documents to you promptly upon your request. 
Any stockholders of record who share the same address and currently receive multiple copies of proxy materials who wish to receive only one copy of these materials per household in the future may contact Broadridge at the address or telephone number listed above. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, please contact your broker, bank, or other nominee to request information about householding. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What shares are covered by the proxy card?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  The proxy card covers all shares held by you of record (registered in your name), including any shares credited to your  Incentive Investment Plan account or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Plan account held in custody by the plan trustee. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, you will receive separate instructions from your broker, bank  or other nominee describing how to vote your shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote if I hold my shares through the Baxter Incentive Investment Plan or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment  Plan?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you are a current or former Baxter employee with shares credited to your account in the Baxter Incentive Investment  Plan or Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Plan, then your completed proxy card (or vote via the Internet or by telephone) will serve as voting instructions to the plan trustee. The trustee will vote the shares credited to your account as you  direct, except as may be required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Shares for which the trustee has not received timely instructions shall be voted by the trustee to the extent permitted by the Incentive Investment Plan or  Puerto Rico Savings and Investment Plan or required by law in its uncontrolled discretion. To allow sufficient time for voting by the plan trustee, your voting instructions must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 2, 2019.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Does the company offer an opportunity to receive future proxy materials electronically?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. If you wish to receive future proxy materials over the Internet instead of receiving copies in the mail, follow the  instructions provided when you vote through the Internet. If you vote by telephone, you will not have the option to elect electronic delivery while voting.  
[END TABLE]
If you elect electronic delivery, the company will discontinue mailing the proxy materials to you beginning next year and will send you an e-mail message notifying you of the Internet address or addresses where you may access next year's proxy materials and vote your shares. You may discontinue electronic delivery at any time. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are the benefits of electronic delivery?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Electronic delivery reduces the company's printing and mailing costs as well as the environmental impact of the  Annual Meeting. It is also a convenient way for you to receive your proxy materials and makes it easy to vote your shares over the Internet.
