To Our Stockholders: 
You are cordially invited to attend the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders of Neurotrope, Inc. to be held at 10:00 A.M. EST on Wednesday, December 12, 2018, at the offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, P.C., located at 666 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10017. 
Details regarding the meeting, the business to be conducted at the meeting, and information about Neurotrope, Inc. that you should consider when you vote your shares are described in this proxy statement. 
At the annual meeting, seven persons will be elected to our Board of Directors. In addition, we will ask stockholders to approve a proposed amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the aggregate number of shares available for the grant of awards by 600,000 shares, to ratify the selection of Friedman LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. The Board of Directors recommends the approval of each of the first three proposals. Such other business will be transacted as may properly come before the annual meeting. 
Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow companies to furnish proxy materials to shareholders over the Internet, we have elected to deliver our proxy materials to the majority of our shareholders over the Internet. This delivery process allows us to provide shareholders with the information they need, while at the same time conserving natural resources and lowering the cost of delivery. On October 25, 2018, we began sending to our stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access our proxy statement for our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our 2018 annual report to shareholders. The Notice also provides instructions on how to vote online and includes instructions on how to receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail. 
We hope you will be able to attend the annual meeting. Whether you plan to attend the annual meeting or not, it is important that you cast your vote either in person or by proxy. You may vote over the Internet as well as by mail. When you have finished reading the proxy statement, you are urged to vote in accordance with the instructions set forth in this proxy statement. We encourage you to vote by proxy so that your shares will be represented and voted at the meeting, whether or not you can attend. 
Thank you for your continued support of Neurotrope, Inc. We look forward to seeing you at the annual meeting. 
Sincerely, 
Charles S. Ryan, J.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer

In this proxy statement, we refer to Neurotrope, Inc. as "Neurotrope," "the Company," "we" and "us." 
This proxy statement relates to the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors for use at the annual meeting. 
On or about October 25, 2018, we began sending the Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials to all stockholders entitled to vote at the annual meeting. TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Why is the Company Soliciting My Proxy? 
The Board of Directors of Neurotrope, Inc. is soliciting your proxy to vote at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders to be held at the offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, P.C., located at 666 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10017 on Wednesday, December 12, 2018 at 10:00 A.M. and any adjournments of the meeting, which we refer to as the annual meeting. The proxy statement along with the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders summarizes the purposes of the meeting and the information you need to know to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
We have sent you this proxy statement, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the proxy card and a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, because you owned shares of Neurotrope, Inc. common stock on the record date. The Company intends to commence distribution of the Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to throughout this proxy statement as the Notice, and, if applicable, the proxy materials, to stockholders on or about October 25, 2018. 
Why Did I Receive a Notice in the Mail Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials Instead of a Full Set of Proxy Materials? 
As permitted by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, we may furnish our proxy materials to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet, rather than mailing printed copies of these materials to each stockholder. Most stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. We believe that this process should expedite stockholders' receipt of proxy materials, lower the costs of the annual meeting and help to conserve natural resources. If you received a Notice by mail or electronically, you will not receive a printed or email copy of the proxy materials, unless you request one by following the instructions included in the Notice. Instead, the Notice instructs you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials and submit your proxy on the Internet. If you requested a paper copy of the proxy materials, you may authorize the voting of your shares by following the instructions on the proxy card, in addition to the other methods of voting described in this proxy statement. 
Who Can Vote? 
Only stockholders who owned our common stock at the close of business on October 23, 2018 are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. On this record date, there were 7,909,693 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
You do not need to attend the annual meeting to vote your shares. Shares represented by valid proxies, received in time for the annual meeting and not revoked prior to the annual meeting, will be voted at the annual meeting. For instructions on how to change or revoke your proxy, see "May I Change or Revoke My Proxy?" below. 
How Many Votes Do I Have? 
Each share of our common stock that you own entitles you to one vote. TABLE OF CONTENTS
How Do I Vote? 
Whether you plan to attend the annual meeting or not, we urge you to vote by proxy. All shares represented by valid proxies that we receive through this solicitation, and that are not revoked, will be voted in accordance with your instructions on the proxy card or as instructed via Internet or telephone. You may specify whether your shares should be voted for or withheld for each nominee for director, and whether your shares should be voted for, against or abstain with respect to each of the other proposals. If you properly submit a proxy without giving specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations as noted below. Voting by proxy will not affect your right to attend the annual meeting. If your shares are registered directly in your name through our stock transfer agent, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc., or you have stock certificates registered in your name, you may vote: 
 By Internet.   Follow the instructions included in the Notice or, if you received printed materials, in the proxy card to vote by Internet.
​
 By telephone.   Follow the instructions included in the Notice or, if you received printed materials, in the proxy card to vote by telephone.
​
 By mail.   If you received a proxy card by mail, you can vote by mail by completing, signing, dating and returning the proxy card as instructed on the card. If you sign the proxy card but do not specify how you want your shares voted, they will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations as noted below. 
​
 In person at the meeting.   If you attend the meeting, you may deliver a completed proxy card in person or you may vote by completing a ballot, which will be available at the meeting. 
​
If your shares are held in "street name" (held in the name of a bank, broker or other holder of record), you will receive instructions from the holder of record. You must follow the instructions of the holder of record in order for your shares to be voted. Internet voting also will be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. If your shares are not registered in your own name and you plan to vote your shares in person at the annual meeting, you should contact your broker or agent to obtain a legal proxy or broker's proxy card and bring it to the annual meeting in order to vote. 
How Does the Board of Directors Recommend That I Vote on the Proposals? 
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote as follows: 
 "FOR" the election of the nominees for director; 
​
 "FOR" the amendment to increase the number of shares available for the grant of awards under the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan; 
​
 "FOR" the ratification of the selection of Friedman LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2018; and 
​
 "FOR" the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
​
Internet voting for stockholders of record will be available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 11, 2018 
If any other matter is presented at the annual meeting, your proxy provides that your shares will be voted by the proxy holder listed in the proxy in accordance with his best judgment. At the time this proxy statement was first made available, we knew of no matters that needed to be acted on at the annual meeting, other than those discussed in this proxy statement. 
May I Change or Revoke My Proxy? 
If you give us your proxy, you may change or revoke it at any time before the annual meeting. You may change or revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways: 
 if you received a proxy card, by signing a new proxy card with a date later than your previously delivered proxy and submitting it as instructed above; 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
 by notifying Neurotrope's Secretary in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or 
​
 by attending the annual meeting in person and voting in person. Attending the annual meeting in person will not in and of itself revoke a previously submitted proxy. You must specifically request at the annual meeting that it be revoked. 
​
Your most current vote, whether by Internet or proxy card is the one that will be counted. 
What if I Receive More Than One Notice or Proxy Card? 
You may receive more than one Notice or proxy card if you hold shares of our common stock in more than one account, which may be in registered form or held in street name. Please vote in the manner described above under "How Do I Vote?" for each account to ensure that all of your shares are voted. 
Will My Shares be Voted if I Do Not Vote? 
If your shares are registered in your name or if you have stock certificates, they will not be counted if you do not vote as described above under "How Do I Vote?" If your shares are held in street name and you do not provide voting instructions to the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares as described above, the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares has the authority to vote your unvoted shares only on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 3 of this proxy statement) without receiving instructions from you. Therefore, we encourage you to provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee. This ensures your shares will be voted at the annual meeting and in the manner you desire. A "broker non-vote" will occur if your broker cannot vote your shares on a particular matter because it has not received instructions from you and does not have discretionary voting authority on that matter or because your broker chooses not to vote on a matter for which it does have discretionary voting authority. 
Your bank, broker or other nominee does not have the ability to vote your uninstructed shares in the election of directors. Therefore, if you hold your shares in street name it is critical that you cast your vote if you want your vote to be counted for the election of directors (Proposal 1 of this proxy statement). In the past, if you held your shares in street name and you did not indicate how you wanted your shares to be voted in the election of directors, your bank, broker or other nominee was allowed to vote your shares on your behalf in the election of directors as it deemed appropriate. In addition, your bank, broker or other nominee is prohibited from voting your uninstructed shares on any matters related to executive compensation and the equity plan. Thus, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote in the election of directors or on matters related to executive compensation and the equity plan, no votes will be cast on these proposals on your behalf. 
What Vote is Required to Approve Each Proposal and How are Votes Counted? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  Proposal 1: Elect Directors  ​ ​  The nominees for director who receive the most votes (also known as a "plurality" of the votes cast) will be elected. You may vote either FOR all of the nominees, WITHHOLD your vote from all of the nominees or WITHHOLD your vote from any one or more of the nominees. Votes that are withheld will not be included in the vote tally for the election of the directors. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name for the election of the directors. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote.   ​ 
​  Proposal 2: Approve an Amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan  ​ ​ The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting for this proposal is required to approve the amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available for the grant of awards. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on this proposal. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. ​ 
​  Proposal 2: Approve an Amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan  ​ ​ The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting for this proposal is required to approve the amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares available for the grant of awards. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on this proposal. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. ​ 
[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  Proposal 3: Ratify Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm  ​ ​  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting for this proposal is required to ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of this vote. Brokerage firms have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on this proposal. If a broker does not exercise this authority, such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. We are not required to obtain the approval of our stockholders to select our independent registered public accounting firm. However, if our stockholders do not ratify the selection of Friedman LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2018, our Audit Committee of our Board of Directors will reconsider its selection.   ​ 
​  Proposal 4: Approve an Advisory Vote on the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers  ​ ​  The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of this vote. Brokerage firms do not have authority to vote customers' unvoted shares held by the firms in street name on this proposal. As a result, any shares not voted by a customer will be treated as a broker non-vote. Such broker non-votes will have no effect on the results of this vote. Although the advisory vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation.  ​ 
[END TABLE]
Is Voting Confidential? 
We will keep all the proxies, ballots and voting tabulations private. We only let our Inspectors of Election, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc., examine these documents. Management will not know how you voted on a specific proposal unless it is necessary to meet legal requirements. We will, however, forward to management any written comments you make, on the proxy card or otherwise provide. 
Where Can I Find the Voting Results of the Annual Meeting? 
The preliminary voting results will be announced at the annual meeting, and we will publish preliminary, or final results if available, in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the annual meeting. If final results are unavailable at the time we file the Form 8-K, then we will file an amended report on Form 8-K to disclose the final voting results within four business days after the final voting results are known. 
What Are the Costs of Soliciting these Proxies? 
We will pay all of the costs of soliciting these proxies. We have engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies and to provide related advice and informational support, for a services fee, plus customary disbursements, which are not expected to exceed $10,000 in total. In addition, our directors and employees may solicit proxies in person or by telephone, fax or email. We will pay these employees and directors no additional compensation for these services. We will ask banks, brokers and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries to forward these proxy materials to their principals and to obtain authority to execute proxies. We will then reimburse them for their expenses. 
What Constitutes a Quorum for the Annual Meeting? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, regardless of whether the proxy has authority to vote on all matters, of the holders of a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares entitled to vote at the annual meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Votes of stockholders of record who are present at the annual meeting in person or by proxy, abstentions, and broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. TABLE OF CONTENTS
Attending the Annual Meeting 
The annual meeting will be held at 10:00 A.M. on Wednesday, December 12, 2018, at the offices of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, P.C., located at 666 Third Avenue, New York, New York, 10017. When you arrive at Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo, P.C., signs will direct you to the appropriate meeting rooms. You need not attend the annual meeting in order to vote. 
Householding of Annual Disclosure Documents 
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules concerning the delivery of annual disclosure documents allow us or your broker to send a single Notice or, if applicable, a single set of our proxy materials to any household at which two or more of our stockholders reside, if we or your broker believe that the stockholders are members of the same family. This practice, referred to as "householding," benefits both you and us. It reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and helps to reduce our expenses. The rule applies to our Notices, annual reports, proxy statements and information statements. Once you receive notice from your broker or from us that communications to your address will be "householded," the practice will continue until you are otherwise notified or until you revoke your consent to the practice. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to have access to and utilize separate proxy voting instructions. 
If your household received a single Notice or, if applicable, a single set of proxy materials this year, but you would prefer to receive your own copy, please contact our transfer agent, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc., by calling their toll free number, 1-866-223-0448. 
If you do not wish to participate in "householding" and would like to receive your own Notice or, if applicable, set of Neurotrope's proxy materials in future years, follow the instructions described below. Conversely, if you share an address with another Neurotrope stockholder and together both of you would like to receive only a single Notice or, if applicable, set of proxy materials, follow these instructions: 
 If your Neurotrope shares are registered in your own name, please contact our transfer agent, Philadelphia Stock Transfer, Inc., and inform them of your request by calling them at 1-866-223-0448 or writing them at 2320 Haverford Rd., Suite 230, Ardmore, Pennsylvania 19003. 
​
 If a broker or other nominee holds your Neurotrope shares, please contact the broker or other nominee directly and inform them of your request. Be sure to include your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account number. 
​
Electronic Delivery of Company Stockholder Communications 
Most stockholders can elect to view or receive copies of future proxy materials over the Internet instead of receiving paper copies in the mail. 
You can choose this option and save the Company the cost of producing and mailing these documents by following the instructions provided on your proxy card. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of October 11, 2018, by (i) each stockholder known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock (our only class of voting securities), (ii) each of our directors and director nominees and executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement, and (iii) all of our directors and executive officers as a group.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers any timely submitted and qualified director candidates recommended by any security holder entitled to vote in an election of Directors. To date no security holders have made any such recommendations. 
The Nominating Committee considers issues of diversity among its members in identifying and considering nominees for director, and strives where appropriate to achieve a diverse balance of backgrounds, perspectives, experience, age, gender, ethnicity and country of citizenship on the board and its committees.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
The leadership structure of the Board currently consists of a Chairman of the Board who oversees the Board meetings and a Vice-Chairman of the Board. The Company separates the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in recognition of the differences between the two roles. Our Board believes this division of responsibility is an effective approach for addressing the risks we face. All of our Board committees are comprised of only independent directors. All Board committees are chaired by independent directors who report to the full Board whenever necessary. We believe this leadership structure helps facilitate efficient decision-making and communication among our directors and fosters efficient Board functioning at meetings. 
Our management is primarily responsible for managing the risks we face in the ordinary course of operating our business. The Board oversees potential risks and our risk management activities by receiving operational and strategic presentations from management which include discussions of key risks to our business. The Board also periodically discusses with management important compliance and quality issues. In addition, the Board has delegated risk oversight to each of its key committees within their areas of responsibility. For example, the Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight of the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements and the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements relating to the Company's financial statements and related disclosures. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in its risk oversight function by overseeing strategies with respect to our incentive compensation programs and key employee retention issues. We believe our Board leadership structure facilitates the division of risk management oversight responsibilities among the Board committees and enhances the Board's efficiency in fulfilling its oversight function with respect to difference areas of our business risks and our risk mitigation practices. 
Stockholder Communications to the Board 
The Board believes that the most efficient method of stockholders and other interested parties to raise issues and ask questions and to get a response is to direct such communications through the Investor Relations team at the address provided in the "Contact Us" section of our website, www.neurotrope.com.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
The address listed for our Investor Relations team on our website is supervised on a daily basis by Neurotrope's Chief Financial Officer, who will promptly forward to the Board any communication intended for them.

The 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan. 
​
(2)
Includes the increase in the number of shares available for issuance under the 2013 Plan that became effective on November 21, 2016, which increased the number of available shares by 372,825 and which did not receive approval by our stockholders. On November 21, 2016, the Company issued options to purchase an aggregate of 372,825 shares of common stock, which options feature an exercise price of $10.56 per share. Subsequent to issuance, 19,634 options were canceled. 
​
As described below, incentive awards authorized under the 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan include, but are not limited to, incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Code. If an award granted under the 2013 Plan or 2017 expires, terminates, is unexercised or is forfeited, or if any shares are surrendered to us in connection with the exercise of an incentive award, the shares subject to such award and the surrendered shares will become available for further awards under the 2017 Plan. 
The number of shares of our common stock subject to the 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan or any number of shares subject to (a) any numerical limit in the 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan, (b) to the terms of any incentive award or (c) to any combination of the foregoing, is expected to be adjusted in the event of any change in our outstanding common stock by reason of any stock dividend, spin-off, split-up, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, liquidation, business combination or exchange of shares or similar transaction. 
Administration 
The Compensation Committee of our Board or our Board administers the 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan. Subject to the terms of the 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan, the Compensation Committee or our Board has complete authority and discretion to determine the terms of awards under the 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan, as applicable.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Grants 
The 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan authorize the grant to participants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance grants intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code and stock appreciation rights, as described below: 
 Options granted under the 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan entitle the grantee, upon exercise, to purchase a specified number of shares from us at a specified exercise price per share. The exercise price for shares of our common stock covered by an option generally cannot be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant unless agreed to otherwise at the time of the grant. In addition, in the case of an incentive stock option granted to an employee who, at the time the incentive stock option is granted, owns stock representing more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any parent or subsidiary, the per share exercise price will be no less than 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. 
​
 Restricted stock awards and restricted stock units may be awarded on terms and conditions established by the Compensation Committee or Board, which may include performance conditions for restricted stock awards and the lapse of restrictions on the achievement of one or more performance goals for restricted stock units. 
​
 The Compensation Committee or Board may make performance grants, each of which will contain performance goals for the award, including the performance criteria, the target and maximum amounts payable, and other terms and conditions. 
​
 The 2013 Plan and 2017 Plan authorize the granting of stock awards. The Compensation Committee or Board will establish the number of shares of our common stock to be awarded and the terms applicable to each award, including performance restrictions. 
​
 Stock appreciation rights entitle the participant to receive a distribution in an amount not to exceed the number of shares of our common stock subject to the portion of the stock appreciation rights exercised multiplied by the difference between the market price of a share of our common stock on the date of exercise of the stock appreciation rights and the market price of a share of our common stock on the date of grant of the stock appreciation rights. 
​
The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock that may be awarded and sold under the 2013 Plan is 685,329 and under the 2017 Plan is 800,000 new shares of common stock, plus up to 200,000 additional shares that may be issued if awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan are cancelled or expire. 
Duration, Amendment, and Termination 
The Board has the power to amend, suspend or terminate the 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan without stockholder approval or ratification at any time or from time to time. No change may be made that increases the total number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to incentive awards or reduces the minimum exercise price for options or exchange of options for other incentive awards, unless such change is authorized by our stockholders within one year. Unless sooner terminated, the 2013 Plan and the 2017 Plan will each terminate ten years after their respective dates of adoption.  TABLE OF CONTENTS​

Consulting and Settlement Agreements 
On August 4, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with SM Capital Management, LLC ("SMCM"), a limited liability company owned and controlled by Mr. Joshua N. Silverman (the "Consulting Agreement"). Mr. Silverman was appointed to the Board on August 4, 2016. Pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, SMCM shall provide consulting services which shall include, but not be limited to, providing business development, financial communications and management transition services, for a one-year period, subject to annual review thereafter. SMCM's annual consulting fee is $120,000, payable by the Company in monthly installments of  $10,000. In addition, SMCM shall be reimbursed for (i) all pre-approved travel in connection with the consulting services to the Company, (ii) upon submission to the Company of appropriate vouchers and receipts, for all other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred by SMCM in furtherance of the Company's business and (iii) SMCM's out-of-pocket legal and advisory fees in connection with SMCM's recent involvement with the Company, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred in connection with the proposed consent solicitation and the Consulting Agreement, which reimbursement shall not exceed $50,000. In addition, the Consulting Agreement provides that effective immediately, Mr. Silverman shall be appointed as a member of the Board and that Mr. Silverman shall continue to be a member of the Board throughout the consulting term. The Consulting Agreement further provides that the Board and all applicable committees of the Board shall take all necessary actions to appoint Mr. Silverman as Chairman of the Board and as Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board and that Mr. Silverman shall continue to serve as Chairman of the Board and Chairman of the Audit Committee throughout the consulting term. In addition, the Consulting Agreement provides that the Company shall take all actions within its control, including the recommendation of such director nominee by the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board, to nominate and appoint one (1) additional member to the Board designated by Mr. Silverman during the initial consulting term. The Company agreed to indemnify Mr. Silverman to the fullest and same extent as the Company provides indemnification to its directors from time to time under the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws and applicable law, and under the Company's policies of Directors and Officers Liability Insurance. In addition, the Company agreed to provide compensation to Mr. Silverman in the same amounts as the Company provides to its non-employee directors for service in the capacity of a director of the Company. 
On August 4, 2016, the Company reached a settlement agreement (the "Settlement Agreement") with Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, the "Investors") to settle a proposed consent solicitation pertaining to the reconstitution of the Board. On November 13, 2015, each of Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. ("Iroquois Master Fund"), Iroquois Capital Investment Group LLC ("ICIG") and American Capital Management ("American Capital") participated in the November 2015 Private Placement pursuant to which (i) Iroquois Master Fund purchased for an aggregate of  $1,200,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and certain warrants to acquire 312,500 shares of common stock, (ii) ICIG purchased for an aggregate of  $100,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and certain warrants to acquire 26,043 shares of common stock and (iii) American Capital purchased for an aggregate of  $200,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and certain warrants to acquire 52,086 shares of common stock. In addition, each of Iroquois Master Fund, ICIG and American Capital entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2015, for the registration of the resale of the common stock issued or issuable in the private placement. Prior to August 1, 2016, Mr. Silverman shared voting and dispositive power over the shares owned by Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and ICIG. As of August 1, 2016, Mr. Silverman relinquished voting and dispositive power over shares beneficially owned by Iroquois and, accordingly, Mr. Silverman no  TABLE OF CONTENTS
longer beneficially owns any shares of Common Stock held by Iroquois or ICIG, although he has a pecuniary interest in Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. American Capital Management, LLC is a retirement vehicle for the benefit of Mr. Silverman and others, of which Mr. Silverman holds a pecuniary interest but does not beneficially own 
In connection with the Settlement Agreement, on August 4, 2016, the Company and Charles S. Ramat, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, entered into a Separation Agreement (the "Ramat Separation Agreement"). Pursuant to the Ramat Separation Agreement which was mutually agreed upon by the Company and Mr. Ramat, Mr. Ramat agreed to resign as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a member of the Board (the "Termination Date") and the parties agreed that Mr. Ramat is being terminated without cause. Mr. Ramat's resignation from the Board and all other positions occurred on September 1, 2016. Mr. Ramat continued to receive his current salary and benefits through the Termination Date except that his salary was reduced by $10,000 per month. On the Termination Date, Mr. Ramat received a lump sum severance payment in the amount of  $200,000, which was equal to the amount of severance he was entitled to receive if he was terminated by the Company for a reason other than cause or by him for good reason pursuant to his employment agreement with the Company. The Ramat Separation Agreement further provided that (a) the Consulting Agreement between Ramat Consulting Group and the Company, effective February 28, 2013, shall automatically be restored and become fully effective and reinstated on the same terms and conditions for the balance of its five year term, which shall expire on February 28, 2018, and pursuant to which consulting fees are to be paid at the rate of  $50,000 per annum, payable monthly, and (b) on the Termination Date, Mr. Ramat's (i) outstanding unvested stock options shall immediately vest, notwithstanding that Mr. Ramat, on the previously scheduled vesting dates, will no longer be an employee, director, or service provider to the Company, and (ii) vested options (including those whose vesting occurs pursuant the preceding clause) shall continue to be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years following the respective dates of grant of such options. The Ramat Separation Agreement also extends the non-competition provision contained in Mr. Ramat's employment agreement notwithstanding the termination of Mr. Ramat's employment without cause, except that he is permitted to participate in a business that is engaged in the development and/or sale of products using bryologs only for the indication of AIDS. The Ramat Separation Agreement also included a mutual general release of claims and a requirement to obtain similar release agreements from Iroquois Master Fund Ltd. and certain other investors. 
Also in connection with the Settlement Agreement, on August 4, 2016, (i) Board members Paul Freiman and Jay Haft resigned from the Board, its subsidiaries and all committees thereof and (ii) the Board appointed each of Mr. Joshua N. Silverman and former director Dr. Kenneth J. Gorelick to the Board. In connection with the resignations of each of Mr. Freiman and Mr. Haft from the Board, the Company entered into Director Separation Agreements, dated August 4, 2016, with each of Mr. Freiman and Mr. Haft (the "Director Separation Agreements"). Pursuant to such Director Separation Agreements, each of Mr. Freiman and Mr. Haft's (i) outstanding unvested stock options shall immediately vest, notwithstanding that such director, on the previously scheduled vesting dates, will no longer be an employee, director, or service provider to the Company, and (ii) vested options (including those whose vesting occurs pursuant the preceding clause) shall continue to be exercisable for a period of ten (10) years following the respective dates of grant of such options. The Director Separation Agreements also included mutual consent rights for press releases and other public communications, a non-disparagement provision and a mutual general release of claims. 
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we paid an aggregate of  $141,770 and $67,900, respectively, to Dr. Gorelick's consulting company for fees in connection with consulting services provided to the Company in connection with the Company's clinical trial. 
Statements of Work under CRE License 
Effective November 13, 2013, we agreed to a statement of work with CRE pursuant to which we contracted for the further development of our potential therapeutic product. Pursuant to this statement of work, we paid CRE $251,939 for related personnel and research services. CRE completed the services pursuant to this statement of work in 2014. As of March 12, 2014, we entered into a statement of work with CRE to continue pre-clinical activities relating to the commercialization of our therapeutic product. We paid CRE the entire total pursuant to this statement of work of approximately $465,000 during the year ended December 31, 2014. CRE completed the services pursuant to this statement of work in 2014.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
On February 4, 2015, we entered into a Statement of Work and Account Satisfaction Agreement with CRE (the "February 2015 SOW"), which was effective as of October 1, 2014 and continued until September 30, 2015. 
Pursuant to the February 2015 SOW, we agreed, among other things, to pay CRE $20,000 in quarterly payments during the twelve months from the date of the February 2015 SOW in exchange for advising and consulting services by CRE's chief scientist regarding our contract with Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of Niemann-Pick Type C disease. 
Under the February 2015 SOW, Neurotrope BioScience also agreed to pay CRE $2,400,000 in service fees and other amounts payable at a rate of  $200,000 per month for each month from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015. The parties agreed that the first $600,000 of payments satisfy certain outstanding amounts owed to CRE. In consideration for the February 2015 SOW, in addition to the terms described above, CRE also agreed to (a) use commercially reasonable efforts to enroll, at no cost to Neurotrope BioScience, at least four additional compassionate use or expanded access patients, in trials of CRE's Alzheimer's therapeutic drug platform during the term of the February 2015 SOW, (b) perform certain services requested by Neurotrope BioScience for the further development of CRE's Alzheimer's therapeutic drug platform, (c) perform certain services for the further development of CRE's Alzheimer's diagnostic test, (d) to the extent permitted by applicable law, transfer all of its rights and regulatory obligations, except for those relating to the compassionate use expanded access trials, associated with CRE's IND 71,276 to Neurotrope BioScience, (e) conduct initial research on the application of its PKC|g@ platform to treat Fragile X disease, along with various other terms and conditions, (f) conduct initial research on PUFA derivatives for the purpose of developing a commercially usable PKC|g@ activator and (g) provide assistance, advice and other similar services to us regarding our analysis of bryologs pursuant to our agreement with Stanford University, for the purpose of developing a commercially usable PKC|g@ activator. Furthermore, CRE agreed to transfer a certain amount of bryostatin drug substance and bryostatin kits containing drug substance for non-human use to a third-party for storage. In order for CRE to perform certain of the services described in (c) above, Neurotrope BioScience reimbursed a third party for services CRE received from such third party in the amount of  $150,000 in connection with CRE's former diagnostic trial program with such third party. 
Neurotrope Bioscience entered into a new Statement of Work Agreement on November 12, 2015 (the "November 2015 SOW Agreement"). The November 2015 SOW Agreement replaced the February 2015 SOW Agreement, which was effective as of October 1, 2014 and expired on September 30, 2015. Pursuant to the November 2015 SOW Agreement, Neurotrope Bioscience agreed to pay CRE $1,166,666 in service fees payable in the amount of  $83,333 per month for each month from November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016. The payments under the November 2015 SOW Agreement satisfied Neurotrope Bioscience's obligations to reimburse CRE pursuant to Section 5.6 of the CRE License for any and all attorneys' fees, translation costs, filing fees, maintenance fees, and other costs and expenses related to applying for, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents and applications for the licensed intellectual property incurred by CRE during the term of the November 2015 SOW Agreement (but, for the avoidance of doubt, such payments shall not satisfy any attorneys' fees, translation costs, filing fees, maintenance fees, or other costs or expenses related to applying for, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining patents and applications for the licensed intellectual property incurred by CRE after the expiration or termination of the November 2015 SOW Agreement term), as well as any litigation costs which CRE may incur related to any of the licensed intellectual property during the November 2015 SOW Agreement term. CRE shall not commence any litigation to enforce the licensed intellectual property without the consent of Neurotrope (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or denied). 
In consideration for the payments made pursuant to the November 2015 SOW Agreement, CRE agreed to perform the services requested by Neurotrope Bioscience for the further development of Neurotrope's bryostatin drug platform. Thus far, four patients have been treated, three of which were treated under an IND cleared by the FDA. The payments set forth above satisfied any and all of Neurotrope Bioscience's obligation whatsoever to CRE or to any other third party for costs incurred or to be incurred by CRE relating to such trials. Neurotrope Bioscience and CRE shall jointly review protocols which shall be established to the parties' mutual satisfaction and contain appropriate safety measures to be employed by the treating physician. No additional compassionate use or expanded access patients will be enrolled by CRE without the consent of Neurotrope Bioscience.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
CRE License 
On February 4, 2015, Neurotrope BioScience, CRE and NRV II, LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Technology License and Services Agreement (the "CRE License"), which further amended and restated the Technology License and Services Agreement dated as of October 31, 2012, as amended by Amendment No. 1 dated as of August 21, 2013. 
Pursuant to the CRE License, Neurotrope BioScience maintained its exclusive (except as described below), non-transferable (except pursuant to the CRE License's assignment provision), world-wide, royalty-bearing right, with a right to sublicense (in accordance with the terms and conditions described below), under CRE's and NRV II's respective right, title and interest in and to certain patents and technology owned by CRE or licensed to NRV II, LLC by CRE as of or subsequent to October 31, 2012 to develop, use, manufacture, market, offer for sale, sell, distribute, import and export certain products or services for therapeutic applications for AD and other cognitive dysfunctions in humans or animals (the "Field of Use"). Additionally, the CRE License specifies that all patents that issue from a certain patent application, shall constitute licensed patents and all trade secrets, know-how and other confidential information claimed by such patents constitute licensed technology under the CRE License. Furthermore, on July 10, 2015, under the terms of the Statement of Work and Account Satisfaction Agreement dated February 4, 2015, Neurotrope BioScience's rights relating to an in vitro diagnostic test system reverted back to CRE and, accordingly, Neurotrope BioScience no longer has any rights under the CRE License for diagnostic applications using the CRE patent portfolio or technology. 
Notwithstanding the above license terms, CRE and its affiliates retain rights to use the licensed intellectual property in the Field of Use to engage in research and development and other non-commercial activities and to provide services to Neurotrope BioScience or to perform other activities in connection with the CRE License. 
Under the CRE License, Neurotrope BioScience may not enter into sublicense agreements with third parties except with CRE's prior written consent, which consent shall not be commercially unreasonably withheld. Furthermore, the CRE License dated February 4, 2015 revises the agreement that was entered into as of October 31, 2012 and amended on August 21, 2013, in that it provides that any intellectual property developed, conceived or created in connection with a sublicense agreement that Neurotrope BioScience entered into with a third party pursuant to the terms of the CRE License will be licensed to CRE and its affiliates for any and all non-commercial purposes, on a worldwide, perpetual, non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-terminable, fully paid-up, royalty-free, transferable basis, with the right to freely sublicense such intellectual property. Previously, the agreement had provided that such intellectual property would be assigned to CRE. 
Pursuant to the terms of the November 12, 2015 amendment to the CRE License, we paid an aggregate of approximately $348,000 to CRE following the closings of the Series B private placement, which constituted an advance royalty payment to CRE and will be offset (with no interest) against the amount of future royalty obligations payable until such time that the amount of such future royalty obligations equals in full the amount of the advance royalty payments made. Neurotrope Bioscience shall be subtracted from the gross proceeds to determine the "Post-PA Fee Proceeds." 
Under the CRE License, CRE and Neurotrope BioScience will jointly own data, reports and information that is generated on or after February 28, 2013, pursuant to the license agreement dated October 31, 2012 and amended on August 21, 2013, by Neurotrope BioScience, on behalf of Neurotrope BioScience by a third party or by CRE pursuant to a statement of work that the parties enter into pursuant to the CRE License, in each case to the extent not constituting or containing any data, reports or information generated prior to such date or by CRE not pursuant to a statement of work (the "Jointly Owned Data"). CRE has agreed not to use the Jointly Owned Data inside or outside the Field of Use for any commercial purpose during the term of the CRE License or following any expiration of the CRE License other than an expiration that is the result of a breach by Neurotrope BioScience of the CRE License that caused any licensed patent to expire, become abandoned or be declared unenforceable or invalid or caused any licensed technology to enter the public domain (a "Natural Expiration") provided, however, CRE may use the Jointly Owned Data inside or outside the Field of Use for any commercial  TABLE OF CONTENTS
purpose following any termination of the CRE License. Also, CRE granted Neurotrope BioScience a license during the term and following any Natural Expiration, to use certain CRE data in the Field of Use for any commercial purposes falling within the scope of the license granted to Neurotrope BioScience under the CRE License. 
The CRE License further requires us to pay CRE (i) a fixed research fee equal to a pro rata amount of $1 million in the year during which we close on a Series B Preferred Stock financing resulting in proceeds of at least $25 million, (ii) a fixed research fee of  $1 million per year for each of the five calendar years following the completion of such financing and (iii) an annual fixed research fee in an amount to be negotiated and agreed upon no later than 90 days prior to the end of the fifth calendar year following the completion of such financing to be paid with respect to each remaining calendar year during the term of the CRE License. This fixed research fee is not yet due. 
For the year ending December 31, 2016, the Company paid CRE a total of  $1,028,915 which consisted of contractual payments pursuant to a statement of work executed in November 2015 totaling $1 million plus fees for testing drug product of  $28,915. For the year ending December 31, 2017, the Company paid CRE a total of  $214,619 for maintenance of CRE's patent portfolio relating to technologies licensed to the Company by CRE.

APPROVAL OF THE AMENDMENT TO NEUROTROPE, INC. 2017 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN  (Notice Item 2) 
General 
Our Board of Directors is requesting that our stockholders approve the adoption of an amendment to the Neurotrope, Inc. 2017 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan"), which amendment was approved by the Board of Directors on October 9, 2018, effective upon stockholder approval at the annual meeting. If this proposal is approved, the number of shares authorized for issuance of awards under the Plan will be increased from 800,000 to an aggregate of 1,400,000 shares of common stock. The Plan will continue to allow additional shares to be issued under the Plan if awards outstanding under the 2013 Plan are forfeited, expire or are cancelled, provided that no more than 200,000 shares shall be added to the Plan from the 2013 Plan. 
The Plan was approved by our Board of Directors and stockholders in 2017. By its terms, the Plan may be amended by our Compensation Committee, provided that any amendment approved by our Compensation Committee which is of a scope that requires stockholder approval as required by (i) the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, (ii) in order to ensure favorable federal income tax treatment for any incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or (iii) for any other reason, is subject to obtaining such stockholder approval. 
As of October 23, 2018, a total of 23,434 shares of our common stock remain available for issuance under the Plan; options to purchase a total of 776,566 shares of common stock are outstanding under the Plan; options to purchase a total of 647,395 shares of common stock are outstanding under the 2013 Plan; and restricted stock units for the issuance of a maximum of 0 shares of our common stock were outstanding. As of October 23, 2018, a total of 0 shares of our common stock have been issued upon the exercise of options and vesting of other equity awards granted under the Plan. 
The outstanding options under the Neurotrope, Inc. 2013 Equity Incentive Plan and the Plan have a consolidated weighted average exercise price of  $19.01 and a consolidated weighted average remaining term of 8.3 years. As of October 23, 2018, the equity overhang, represented by (a) the sum of all outstanding stock options and other stock-based awards under all Company equity plans, plus the number of shares available for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Plan as a percentage of  (b) the sum of  (i) the number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of October 23, 2018, plus (ii) the number of shares described in clause (a) above, was 15.8%. If the amendment to the Plan is approved by stockholders, the equity overhang would be 20.9%. 
Reasons for Amendment of the Plan 
Our Board, the Compensation Committee and management believe that the effective use of stock-based long-term incentive compensation is vital to our ability to achieve strong performance in the future. The Plan will maintain and enhance the key policies and practices adopted by our management and Board of Directors to align employee and stockholder interests and to link compensation to Company performance. In addition, our future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to maintain a competitive position in attracting, retaining and motivating key personnel. We believe that the increase in the number of shares available for issuance under our Plan is essential to permit our management to continue to provide long-term, equity-based incentives to present and future key employees, consultants and directors. The Board believes that the number of shares currently remaining available for issuance pursuant to future awards under the Plan, as of October 23, 2018, is not sufficient for future granting needs. The Board currently believes that if the amendment to the Plan is approved by stockholders, the 1,400,000 shares available for issuance under the Plan (plus up to 200,000 additional shares to be issued if awards outstanding under our 2013 Plan are cancelled or expire) will result in an adequate number of shares of common stock being available for future awards under the Plan. 
The following is a brief summary of the Plan, as amended. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the Plan, a copy of which is attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Summary of Material Features of our Plan 
Eligibility.   The Plan allows us, under the direction of our Compensation Committee, to make grants of stock options, restricted and unrestricted stock awards and other stock-based awards to employees, consultants and directors who, in the opinion of the Compensation Committee, are in a position to make a significant contribution to our long-term success. All employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its affiliates are eligible to participate in the Plan. As of October 23, 2018, there were approximately sixteen individuals eligible to participate in the Plan. 
Shares Available for Issuance.   The Plan provides for the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of our common stock plus up to 200,000 additional shares to be issued if awards outstanding under our 2013 Plan are cancelled or expire on or after March 9, 2017. Generally, shares of common stock reserved for awards under the Plan that lapse or are canceled (other than by exercise) will be added back to the share reserve available for future awards. However, shares of common stock tendered in payment for an award or shares of common stock withheld for taxes are not available again for future awards. The Plan provides that no participant may receive awards for more than 400,000 shares of common stock in any fiscal year. 
Stock Options.   Stock options granted under the Plan may either be incentive stock options, which are intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 422 of the Code, or non-qualified stock options, which are not intended to meet those requirements. Incentive Stock Options may be granted to employees of the Company and its affiliates. Non-qualified options may be granted to employees, directors and consultants of the Company and its affiliates. The exercise price of a stock option may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. If an incentive stock option is granted to an individual who owns more than 10% of the combined voting power of all classes of our capital stock, the exercise price may not be less than 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and the term of the option may not be longer than five years. 
Award agreements for stock options include rules for exercise of the stock options after termination of service. Options may not be exercised unless they are vested, and no option may be exercised after the end of the term set forth in the award agreement. Generally, stock options will be exercisable for three months after termination of service for any reason other than death or total and permanent disability, and for 12 months after termination of service on account of death or total and permanent disability but will not be exercisable if the termination of service was due to cause. 
Restricted Stock.   Restricted stock is common stock that is subject to restrictions, including a prohibition against transfer and a substantial risk of forfeiture, until the end of a "restricted period" during which the grantee must satisfy certain vesting conditions. If the grantee does not satisfy the vesting conditions by the end of the restricted period, the restricted stock is forfeited. 
During the restricted period, the holder of restricted stock has the rights and privileges of a regular stockholder, except that the restrictions set forth in the applicable award agreement apply. For example, the holder of restricted stock may vote and accrue dividends on the restricted shares; but he or she may not sell the shares until the restrictions are lifted. 
Other Stock-Based Awards.   The Plan also authorizes the grant of other types of stock-based compensation including, but not limited to stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards, and stock unit awards. Our Board of Directors or an authorized committee may award such stock-based awards subject to such conditions and restrictions as it may determine. These conditions and restrictions may include continued employment with us through a specified restricted period. 
Plan Administration.   In accordance with the terms of the Plan, our Board of Directors has authorized our Compensation Committee to administer the Plan. The Compensation Committee may delegate part of its authority and powers under the Plan to one or more of our directors and/or officers, but only the Compensation Committee can make awards to participants who are subject to the reporting and other requirements of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or "covered employees" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code. In accordance with the provisions of the Plan, our Compensation Committee determines the terms of awards, including: 
 which employees, directors and consultants will be granted awards; 
​
​ TABLE OF CONTENTS
 the number of shares subject to each award; 
​
 the vesting provisions of each award; 
​
 the termination or cancellation provisions applicable to awards; and 
​
 all other terms and conditions upon which each award may be granted in accordance with the Plan. 
​
In addition, our Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, amend any term or condition of an outstanding award provided (i) such term or condition as amended is permitted by our Plan, and (ii) any such amendment shall be made only with the consent of the participant to whom such award was made, if the amendment is adverse to the participant; and provided, further, that, without the prior approval of our stockholders, options and stock appreciation rights will not be repriced, replaced or regranted through cancellation or by lowering the exercise price of a previously granted award. 
Stock Dividends and Stock Splits.   If our common stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares or if we issue any shares of common stock as a stock dividend, the number of shares of our common stock deliverable upon exercise of an option issued or upon issuance of an award shall be appropriately increased or decreased proportionately, and appropriate adjustments shall be made in the purchase price per share and performance goals applicable to performance-based awards, if any, to reflect such subdivision, combination or stock dividend. 
Corporate Transactions.   Upon a merger or other reorganization event, our Board of Directors, may, in its sole discretion, take any one or more of the following actions pursuant to our Plan, as to some or all outstanding awards: 
 provide that all outstanding options shall be assumed or substituted by the successor corporation; 
​
 upon written notice to a participant provide that the participant's unexercised options will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction unless exercised by the participant; and 
​
 with respect to stock grants and in lieu of any of the foregoing, our Board of Directors or an authorized committee may provide that, upon consummation of the transaction, each outstanding stock grant shall be terminated in exchange for payment of an amount equal to the consideration payable upon consummation of such transaction to a holder of the number of shares of common stock comprising such award (to the extent such stock grant is no longer subject to any forfeiture or repurchase rights then in effect or, at the discretion of the Board of Directors or an authorized committee, all forfeiture and repurchase rights being waived upon such transaction). 
​
Amendment and Termination.   The Plan may be amended by our stockholders. It may also be amended by our Compensation Committee, provided that any amendment approved by our Compensation Committee which is of a scope that requires stockholder approval as required by (i) the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, (ii) in order to ensure favorable federal income tax treatment for any incentive stock options under Code Section 422, (iii) in order to continue to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code, to the extent such compliance is deemed desirable, or (iv) for any other reason, is subject to obtaining such stockholder approval. In addition, other than in connection with stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations or reorganizations, the Compensation Committee may not without shareholder approval reduce the exercise price or cancel any outstanding option in exchange for a replacement option having a lower exercise price, or for any other equity award or for cash. In addition, the Compensation Committee may not take any other action that is considered a direct or indirect "repricing" for purposes of the shareholder approval rules of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Shares are listed, including any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles. However, no such action may adversely affect any rights under any outstanding award without the holder's consent. 
Duration of Plan.   The Plan will expire by its terms on March 9, 2027.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
Federal Income Tax Considerations 
The material federal income tax consequences of the issuance and exercise of stock options and other awards under the Plan, based on the current provisions of the Code and regulations, are as follows. Changes to these laws could alter the tax consequences described below. This summary assumes that all awards granted under the Plan are exempt from or comply with, the rules under Section 409A of the Code related to nonqualified deferred compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​  Incentive Stock Options:   ​ ​  Incentive stock options are intended to qualify for treatment under Section 422 of the Code. An incentive stock option does not result in taxable income to the optionee or deduction to us at the time it is granted or exercised, provided that no disposition is made by the optionee of the shares acquired pursuant to the option within two years after the date of grant of the option nor within one year after the date of issuance of shares to the optionee (referred to as the "ISO holding period"). However, the difference between the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise and the option price will be an item of tax preference includible in "alternative minimum taxable income" of the optionee. Upon disposition of the shares after the expiration of the ISO holding period, the optionee will generally recognize long term capital gain or loss based on the difference between the disposition proceeds and the option price paid for the shares. If the shares are disposed of prior to the expiration of the ISO holding period, the optionee generally will recognize taxable compensation, and we will have a corresponding deduction, in the year of the disposition, equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise of the option over the option price. Any additional gain realized on the disposition will normally constitute capital gain. If the amount realized upon such a disqualifying disposition is less than fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise, the amount of compensation income will be limited to the excess of the amount realized over the optionee's adjusted basis in the shares.   ​ 
​  Non-Qualified Options:   ​ ​  Options otherwise qualifying as incentive stock options, to the extent the aggregate fair market value of shares with respect to which such options are first exercisable by an individual in any calendar year exceeds $100,000, and options designated as non-qualified options will be treated as options that are not incentive stock options.   ​ 
​ ​ ​ ​  A non-qualified option ordinarily will not result in income to the optionee or deduction to us at the time of grant. The optionee will recognize compensation income at the time of exercise of such non-qualified option in an amount equal to the excess of the then value of the shares over the option price per share. Such compensation income of optionees may be subject to withholding taxes, and a deduction may then be allowable to us in an amount equal to the optionee's compensation income.   ​ 
​ ​ ​ ​  An optionee's initial basis in shares so acquired will be the amount paid on exercise of the non-qualified option plus the amount of any corresponding compensation income. Any gain or loss as a result of a subsequent disposition of the shares so acquired will be capital gain or loss.   ​ 
​  Stock Grants:   ​ ​  With respect to stock grants under our Plan that result in the issuance of shares that are either not restricted as to transferability or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of shares received. Thus, deferral of the time of issuance will generally result in the deferral of the time the grantee will be liable for income taxes with respect to such issuance. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the grantee.   ​ 
[END TABLE]
 TABLE OF CONTENTS
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​ ​  With respect to stock grants involving the issuance of shares that are restricted as to transferability and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, the grantee must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares received at the first time the shares become transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever occurs earlier. A grantee may elect to be taxed at the time of receipt of shares rather than upon lapse of restrictions on transferability or substantial risk of forfeiture, but if the grantee subsequently forfeits such shares, the grantee would not be entitled to any tax deduction, including as a capital loss, for the value of the shares on which he previously paid tax. The grantee must file such election with the Internal Revenue Service within 30 days of the receipt of the shares. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the grantee.   ​ 
​  Stock Units:   ​ ​  The grantee recognizes no income until the issuance of the shares. At that time, the grantee must generally recognize ordinary income equal to the fair market value of the shares received. We generally will be entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income recognized by the grantee.  ​

New Plan Benefits 
The amounts of future grants under the Plan are not determinable as awards under the Plan and will be granted at the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, or other delegated persons and we cannot determine at this time either the persons who will receive awards under the Plan or the amount or types of any such awards. 
Required Vote 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares cast at the annual meeting is required for the approval of the amendment of our Plan.

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM  (Notice Item 3) 
The Audit Committee has appointed Friedman LLP, as our independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Board proposes that the stockholders ratify this appointment. Friedman LLP audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. We expect that representatives of Friedman LLP will be present at the annual meeting, will be able to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
In deciding to appoint Friedman LLP, the Audit Committee reviewed auditor independence issues and existing commercial relationships with Friedman LLP and concluded that Friedman LLP has no commercial relationship with the Company that would impair its independence for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 
The following table presents fees for professional audit services rendered by Friedman LLP for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and fees billed for other services rendered by Friedman LLP during those periods. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
​ ​ ​  2017   ​ ​  2016   ​ 
 Audit fees:(1)  ​ ​ ​ $ 80,340 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 72,100 ​ ​ 
 Audit related fees:(2)  ​ ​ ​ $ 28,387 ​ ​ ​ ​ $ 12,308 ​ ​ 
 Tax fees:  ​ ​ ​ ​ 0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 0 ​ ​ 
 All other fees:  ​ ​ ​ ​ 0 ​ ​ ​ ​ ​ 0 ​ ​ 
[END TABLE]
​
(1)
Audit fees consisted of audit work performed in the preparation of financial statements, as well as work generally only the independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, such as statutory audits. 
​
(2)
Audit related fees consisted principally of work relating to the filing of Company quarterly and annual reports and work relating to the filing of Company registration statements. 
​
The percentage of services set forth above in the category audit related fees, that were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) (relating to the approval of a de minimis amount of non-audit services after the fact but before completion of the audit), was 100%. 
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-audit Services of Independent Public Accountant 
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the Audit Committee has responsibility for appointing, setting compensation and overseeing the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the Audit Committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Prior to engagement of an independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit an aggregate of services expected to be rendered during that year for each of four categories of services to the Audit Committee for approval. 
1. Audit services include audit work performed in the preparation of financial statements, as well as work that generally only an independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably be expected to provide, including comfort letters, statutory audits, and attest services and consultation regarding financial accounting and/or reporting standards. 
2. Audit-Related services are for assurance and related services that are traditionally performed by an independent registered public accounting firm, including due diligence related to mergers and acquisitions, employee benefit plan audits, and special procedures required to meet certain regulatory requirements.  TABLE OF CONTENTS
3. Tax services include all services performed by an independent registered public accounting firm's tax personnel except those services specifically related to the audit of the financial statements, and includes fees in the areas of tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. 
4. Other Fees are those associated with services not captured in the other categories. The Company generally does not request such services from our independent registered public accounting firm. 
Prior to engagement, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted and the Audit Committee requires our independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage our independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Audit Committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging our independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
In the event the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Friedman LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee will reconsider its appointment. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF FRIEDMAN LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AND PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF SUCH RATIFICATION UNLESS A STOCKHOLDER INDICATES OTHERWISE ON THE PROXY. TABLE OF CONTENTS​
ADVISORY VOTE ON APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT  (Notice Item 4) 
We are seeking your advisory vote as required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, on the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as described in the compensation tables and related material contained in this proxy statement. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on our Compensation Committee or our Board of Directors. However, the Compensation Committee and the Board will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. We have determined to hold an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers annually, and the next such advisory vote will occur at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Our compensation philosophy is designed to align each executive's compensation with Neurotrope's short-term and long-term performance and to provide the compensation and incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who are crucial to our long-term success. Consistent with this philosophy, a significant portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives is directly related to performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic and operating plans, as well as our performance against that of our peer companies. 
In accordance with the rules of the SEC, the following resolution, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" vote, is being submitted for a stockholder vote at the 2018 annual meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the named executive officers of Neurotrope, Inc., as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the compensation tables and the related material disclosed in this proxy statement, is hereby APPROVED." 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the annual meeting is required to approve, on an advisory basis, this resolution. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AND PROXIES SOLICITED BY THE BOARD WILL BE VOTED IN FAVOR OF SUCH APPROVAL UNLESS A STOCKHOLDER INDICATES OTHERWISE ON THE PROXY. TABLE OF CONTENTS​​​
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS 
We have adopted a code of conduct and ethics that applies to all of our employees, including our chief executive officer and chief financial and accounting officers. The text of the code of conduct and ethics is posted on our website at www.neurotrope.com and will be made available to stockholders without charge, upon request in writing to Neurotrope, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10036. Disclosure regarding any amendments to, or waivers from, provisions of the code of conduct and ethics that apply to our directors, principal executive and financial officers will be included in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days following the date of the amendment or waiver, unless website posting or the issuance of a press release of such amendments or waivers is then permitted by the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board of Directors knows of no other business which will be presented to the annual meeting. If any other business is properly brought before the annual meeting, proxies will be voted in accordance with the judgment of the persons named therein. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS FOR DIRECTOR 
To be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement relating to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we must receive stockholder proposals (other than for director nominations) no later than 120 days prior to the date that is one year from this year's meeting date. To be considered for presentation at the 2019 Annual Meeting, although not included in the proxy statement, proposals (including director nominations that are not requested to be included in our proxy statement) must be received no earlier than 120 days prior to one year anniversary of meeting date and no later than 90 days prior to one year anniversary of meeting date, provided, however, that in the event that the 2019 Annual Meeting is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days before or after December 12, 2019, notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so received no earlier than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which notice of the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs. Proposals that are not received in a timely manner will not be voted on at the 2018 Annual Meeting. If a proposal is received on time, the proxies that management solicits for the meeting may still exercise discretionary voting authority on the proposal under circumstances consistent with the proxy rules of the SEC. All stockholder proposals should be marked for the attention of Neurotrope, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 1185 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor, New York, New York 10036.

The Committee shall have the authority to make equitable adjustments to the Performance Goals in recognition of unusual or non-recurring events affecting the Company or any Affiliate or the financial statements of the Company or any Affiliate, in response to changes in applicable laws or regulations, or to account for items of gain, loss or expense determined to be extraordinary or unusual in nature or infrequent in occurrence or related to the disposal of a segment of a business or related to a change in accounting principles provided that any such change shall at all times satisfy the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Code.

TABLE OF CONTENTS
work for the benefit of the Company or of an Affiliate and to provide additional incentive for them to promote the success of the Company or of an Affiliate. The Plan provides for the granting of ISOs, Non-Qualified Options, Stock Grants and Stock-Based Awards. 
3. SHARES SUBJECT TO THE PLAN.
(a) The number of Shares which may be issued from time to time pursuant to this Plan shall be the sum of: (i) 1,400,000 shares of Common Stock and (ii) any shares of Common Stock that are represented by awards granted under the Company's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan that are forfeited, expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares of Common Stock or which result in the forfeiture of shares of Common Stock back to the Company on or after March 9, 2017, or the equivalent of such number of Shares after the Administrator, in its sole discretion, has interpreted the effect of any stock split, stock dividend, combination, recapitalization or similar transaction in accordance with Paragraph 25 of this Plan; provided, however, that no more than 200,000 Shares shall be added to the Plan pursuant to subsection (ii). 
(b) If an Option ceases to be "outstanding", in whole or in part (other than by exercise), or if the Company shall reacquire (at not more than its original issuance price) any Shares issued pursuant to a Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award, or if any Stock Right expires or is forfeited, cancelled, or otherwise terminated or results in any Shares not being issued, the unissued or reacquired Shares which were subject to such Stock Right shall again be available for issuance from time to time pursuant to this Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Stock Right is exercised, in whole or in part, by tender of Shares or if the Company or an Affiliate's tax withholding obligation is satisfied by withholding Shares, the number of Shares deemed to have been issued under the Plan for purposes of the limitation set forth in Paragraph 3(a) above shall be the number of Shares that were subject to the Stock Right or portion thereof, and not the net number of Shares actually issued. However, in the case of ISOs, the foregoing provisions shall be subject to any limitations under the Code. 
4. ADMINISTRATION OF THE PLAN.
The Administrator of the Plan will be the Board of Directors, except to the extent the Board of Directors delegates its authority to the Committee, in which case the Committee shall be the Administrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors may not take any action that would cause any outstanding Stock Right that would otherwise qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code to fail to so qualify. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Administrator is authorized to: 
(a) Interpret the provisions of the Plan and all Stock Rights and to make all rules and determinations which it deems necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan; 
(b) Determine which Employees, directors and Consultants shall be granted Stock Rights; 
(c) Determine the number of Shares for which a Stock Right or Stock Rights shall be granted, provided, however, that in no event shall Stock Rights with respect to more than 400,000 Shares be granted to any Participant in any fiscal year; 
(d) Specify the terms and conditions upon which a Stock Right or Stock Rights may be granted, provided however, except in the case of death, disability, retirement or Change of Control, Stock Rights shall not vest, and any right of the Company to restrict or reacquire Shares subject to a Stock Grant shall not lapse, less than one (1) year from the date of grant, provided that time-based vesting may accrue incrementally over such one-year period; and provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Stock Rights may be granted to non-employee directors having time-based vesting of less than one (1) year from the date of grant so long as no more than ten percent (10%) of the Shares reserved for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Paragraph 3(a) above (as adjusted under Paragraph 25 of this Plan) may be granted in the aggregate pursuant to such awards; in addition no dividends or dividend equivalents shall be paid on any Stock Right prior to the vesting of the underlying shares; 
(e) Determine Performance Goals no later than such time as required to ensure that a Performance-Based Award which is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code so complies;
A-4
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(f) Amend any term or condition of any outstanding Stock Right, other than reducing the exercise price or purchase price or extending the expiration date of an Option, provided that (i) such term or condition as amended is not prohibited by the Plan; (ii) any such amendment shall not impair the rights of a Participant under any Stock Right previously granted without such Participant's consent or in the event of death of the Participant the Participant's Survivors; and (iii) any such amendment shall be made only after the Administrator determines whether such amendment would cause any adverse tax consequences to the Participant, including, but not limited to, the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d) of the Code and described in Paragraph 6(b)(iv) below with respect to ISOs and pursuant to Section 409A of the Code; 
(g) Make any adjustments in the Performance Goals included in any Performance-Based Awards provided that such adjustments comply with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code; and 
(h) Adopt any sub-plans applicable to residents of any specified jurisdiction as it deems necessary or appropriate in order to comply with or take advantage of any tax or other laws applicable to the Company, any Affiliate or to Participants or to otherwise facilitate the administration of the Plan, which sub-plans may include additional restrictions or conditions applicable to Stock Rights or Shares issuable pursuant to a Stock Right; 
provided, however, that all such interpretations, rules, determinations, terms and conditions shall be made and prescribed in the context of not causing any adverse tax consequences under Section 409A of the Code and preserving the tax status under Section 422 of the Code of those Options which are designated as ISOs and in accordance with Section 162(m) of the Code for all other Stock Rights to which the Committee has determined Section 162(m) is applicable. Subject to the foregoing, the interpretation and construction by the Administrator of any provisions of the Plan or of any Stock Right granted under it shall be final, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, if the Administrator is the Committee. In addition, if the Administrator is the Committee, the Board of Directors may take any action under the Plan that would otherwise be the responsibility of the Committee. 
To the extent permitted under applicable law, the Board of Directors or the Committee may allocate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any one or more of its members and may delegate all or any portion of its responsibilities and powers to any other person selected by it. The Board of Directors or the Committee may revoke any such allocation or delegation at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only the Board of Directors or the Committee shall be authorized to grant a Stock Right to any director of the Company or to any "officer" of the Company as defined by Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act. 
5. ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION.
The Administrator will, in its sole discretion, name the Participants in the Plan; provided, however, that each Participant must be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate at the time a Stock Right is granted. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may authorize the grant of a Stock Right to a person not then an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate; provided, however, that the actual grant of such Stock Right shall be conditioned upon such person becoming eligible to become a Participant at or prior to the time of the execution of the Agreement evidencing such Stock Right. ISOs may be granted only to Employees who are deemed to be residents of the United States for tax purposes. Non-Qualified Options, Stock Grants and Stock-Based Awards may be granted to any Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or an Affiliate. The granting of any Stock Right to any individual shall neither entitle that individual to, nor disqualify him or her from, participation in any other grant of Stock Rights or any grant under any other benefit plan established by the Company or any Affiliate for Employees, directors or Consultants.

6. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OPTIONS.
Each Option shall be set forth in writing in an Option Agreement, duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company, by the Participant. The Administrator may provide that Options be granted subject to such terms and conditions, consistent with the terms and conditions specifically required under this Plan, as the Administrator may deem appropriate including, without limitation, subsequent approval by the shareholders of the Company of this Plan or any amendments thereto. The Option Agreements shall be subject to at least the following terms and conditions:

7. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF STOCK GRANTS.
Each Stock Grant to a Participant shall state the principal terms in an Agreement duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company, by the Participant. The Agreement shall be in a form approved by the Administrator and shall contain terms and conditions which the Administrator determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the Company, subject to the following minimum standards: 
(a) Each Agreement shall state the purchase price per share, if any, of the Shares covered by each Stock Grant, which purchase price shall be determined by the Administrator but shall not be less than the minimum consideration required by the Nevada Revised Statutes, if any, on the date of the grant of the Stock Grant; 
(b) Each Agreement shall state the number of Shares to which the Stock Grant pertains; and 
(c) Each Agreement shall include the terms of any right of the Company to restrict or reacquire the Shares subject to the Stock Grant, including the time period or attainment of Performance Goals or such other performance criteria upon which such rights shall accrue and the purchase price therefor, if any. 
8. TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF OTHER STOCK-BASED AWARDS.
The Administrator shall have the right to grant other Stock-Based Awards based upon the Common Stock having such terms and conditions as the Administrator may determine, including, without limitation, the grant of Shares based upon certain conditions, the grant of securities convertible into Shares and the grant of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock awards or stock units. The principal terms of each Stock-Based Award shall be set forth in an Agreement, duly executed by the Company and, to the extent required by law or requested by the Company, by the Participant. The Agreement shall be in a form approved by the Administrator and shall contain terms and conditions which the Administrator determines to be appropriate and in the best interest of the Company. Each Agreement shall include the terms of any right of the Company including the right to terminate the Stock-Based Award without the issuance of Shares, the terms of any vesting conditions, Performance Goals or events upon which Shares shall be issued. Under no circumstances may the Agreement covering stock appreciation rights (a) have an exercise price (per share) that is less than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the date of grant or (b) expire more than ten years following the date of grant. 
The Company intends that the Plan and any Stock-Based Awards granted hereunder be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code or meet the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of subsection (a) of Section 409A of the Code, to the extent applicable, and be operated in accordance with 
A-7
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Section 409A so that any compensation deferred under any Stock-Based Award (and applicable investment earnings) shall not be included in income under Section 409A of the Code. Any ambiguities in the Plan shall be construed to effect the intent as described in this Paragraph 8. 
9. PERFORMANCE BASED AWARDS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, during any period when Section 162(m) of the Code is applicable to the Company and the Plan, Stock Rights granted under Paragraph 7 and Paragraph 8 may be granted by the Committee in a manner which is deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Code ("Performance-Based Awards"). A Participant's Performance-Based Award shall be determined based on the attainment of written Performance Goals, which must be objective and approved by the Committee for a performance period of between one and five years established by the Committee (I) while the outcome for that performance period is substantially uncertain and (II) no more than 90 days after the commencement of the performance period to which the Performance Goal relates or, if less, the number of days which is equal to 25% of the relevant performance period. The Committee shall determine whether, with respect to a performance period, the applicable Performance Goals have been met with respect to a given Participant and, if they have, to so certify and ascertain the amount of the applicable Performance-Based Award. No Performance-Based Awards will be issued for such performance period until such certification is made by the Committee. The number of shares issued in respect of a Performance-Based Award to a given Participant may be less than the amount determined by the applicable Performance Goal formula, at the discretion of the Committee. The number of shares issued in respect of a Performance-Based Award determined by the Committee for a performance period shall be paid to the Participant at such time as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion after the end of such performance period. Nothing in this Section shall prohibit the Company from granting Stock-Based Awards subject to performance criteria that do not comply with this Paragraph. 
10. EXERCISE OF OPTIONS AND ISSUE OF SHARES.
An Option (or any part or installment thereof) shall be exercised by giving written notice to the Company or its designee (in a form acceptable to the Administrator, which may include electronic notice), together with provision for payment of the aggregate exercise price in accordance with this Paragraph for the Shares as to which the Option is being exercised, and upon compliance with any other condition(s) set forth in the Option Agreement. Such notice shall be signed by the person exercising the Option (which signature may be provided electronically in a form acceptable to the Administrator), shall state the number of Shares with respect to which the Option is being exercised and shall contain any representation required by the Plan or the Option Agreement. Payment of the exercise price for the Shares as to which such Option is being exercised shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check; or (b) at the discretion of the Administrator, through delivery of shares of Common Stock held for at least six months (if required to avoid negative accounting treatment) having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of the exercise to the aggregate cash exercise price for the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised; or (c) at the discretion of the Administrator, by having the Company retain from the Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of the Option, a number of Shares having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of exercise to the aggregate exercise price for the number of Shares as to which the Option is being exercised; or (d) at the discretion of the Administrator, in accordance with a cashless exercise program established with a securities brokerage firm, and approved by the Administrator; or (e) at the discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of  (a), (b), (c) and (d) above or (f) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator shall accept only such payment on exercise of an ISO as is permitted by Section 422 of the Code. 
The Company shall then reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Option was exercised to the Participant (or to the Participant's Survivors, as the case may be). In determining what constitutes "reasonably promptly," it is expressly understood that the issuance and delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company in order to comply with any law or regulation (including, without limitation, state securities or "blue sky" laws) which requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance. The Shares shall, upon delivery, be fully paid, non-assessable Shares.

11. PAYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS AND ISSUE OF SHARES.
Any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award requiring payment of a purchase price for the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award is being granted shall be made (a) in United States dollars in cash or by check; or (b) at the discretion of the Administrator, through delivery of shares of Common Stock held for at least six months (if required to avoid negative accounting treatment) and having a Fair Market Value equal as of the date of payment to the purchase price of the Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award; or (c) at the discretion of the Administrator, by any combination of  (a) and (b) above; or (d) at the discretion of the Administrator, by payment of such other lawful consideration as the Administrator may determine. 
The Company shall when required by the applicable Agreement, reasonably promptly deliver the Shares as to which such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award was made to the Participant (or to the Participant's Survivors, as the case may be), subject to any escrow provision set forth in the applicable Agreement. In determining what constitutes "reasonably promptly," it is expressly understood that the issuance and delivery of the Shares may be delayed by the Company in order to comply with any law or regulation (including, without limitation, state securities or "blue sky" laws) which requires the Company to take any action with respect to the Shares prior to their issuance. 
12. RIGHTS AS A SHAREHOLDER.
No Participant to whom a Stock Right has been granted shall have rights as a shareholder with respect to any Shares covered by such Stock Right except after due exercise of an Option or issuance of Shares as set forth in any Agreement, tender of the aggregate exercise or purchase price, if any, for the Shares being purchased and registration of the Shares in the Company's share register in the name of the Participant. 
13. ASSIGNABILITY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF STOCK RIGHTS.
By its terms, a Stock Right granted to a Participant shall not be transferable by the Participant other than (i) by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or (ii) as approved by the Administrator in its discretion and set forth in the applicable Agreement provided that no Stock Right may be transferred by a Participant for value. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an ISO transferred except in compliance with clause (i) above shall no longer qualify as an ISO. The designation of a beneficiary of a Stock Right by a Participant, with the prior approval of the Administrator and in such form as the Administrator shall prescribe, shall not be deemed a transfer prohibited by this Paragraph. Except as provided above during the Participant's lifetime a Stock Right shall only be exercisable by or issued to such Participant (or his or her legal representative) and shall not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated in any way (whether by operation of law or otherwise) and shall not be subject to execution, attachment or similar process. Any attempted transfer, assignment, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of any Stock Right or of any rights granted thereunder contrary to the provisions of this Plan, or the levy of any attachment or similar process upon a Stock Right, shall be null and void. 
14. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR DEATH OR DISABILITY.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement, in the event of a termination of service (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate before the Participant has exercised an Option, the following rules apply: 
(a) A Participant who ceases to be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate (for any reason other than termination for Cause, Disability, or death for which events there are special rules in Paragraphs 15, 16, and 17, respectively), may exercise any Option granted to him or her to the extent that the Option is exercisable on the date of such termination of service, but only within such term as the Administrator has designated in a Participant's Option Agreement. 
(b) Except as provided in Subparagraph (c) below, or Paragraph 16 or 17, in no event may an Option intended to be an ISO, be exercised later than three months after the Participant's termination of employment. 
A-9
TABLE OF CONTENTS
(c) The provisions of this Paragraph, and not the provisions of Paragraph 16 or 17, shall apply to a Participant who subsequently becomes Disabled or dies after the termination of employment, director status or consultancy; provided, however, in the case of a Participant's Disability or death within three months after the termination of employment, director status or consultancy, the Participant or the Participant's Survivors may exercise the Option within one year after the date of the Participant's termination of service, but in no event after the date of expiration of the term of the Option. 
(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if subsequent to a Participant's termination of employment, termination of director status or termination of consultancy, but prior to the exercise of an Option, the Administrator determines that, either prior or subsequent to the Participant's termination, the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then such Participant shall forthwith cease to have any right to exercise any Option. 
(e) A Participant to whom an Option has been granted under the Plan who is absent from the Company or an Affiliate because of temporary disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1 hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated such Participant's employment, director status or consultancy with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the Administrator may otherwise expressly provide; provided, however, that, for ISOs, any leave of absence granted by the Administrator of greater than ninety days, unless pursuant to a contract or statute that guarantees the right to reemployment, shall cause such ISO to become a Non-Qualified Option on the 181st day following such leave of absence. 
(f) Except as required by law or as set forth in a Participant's Option Agreement, Options granted under the Plan shall not be affected by any change of a Participant's status within or among the Company and any Affiliates, so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or any Affiliate. 
15. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement, the following rules apply if the Participant's service (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for Cause prior to the time that all his or her outstanding Options have been exercised: 
(a) All outstanding and unexercised Options as of the time the Participant is notified his or her service is terminated for Cause will immediately be forfeited. 
(b) Cause is not limited to events which have occurred prior to a Participant's termination of service, nor is it necessary that the Administrator's finding of Cause occur prior to termination. If the Administrator determines, subsequent to a Participant's termination of service but prior to the exercise of an Option, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant's termination the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then the right to exercise any Option is forfeited. 
16. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR DISABILITY.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement: 
(a) A Participant who ceases to be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of Disability may exercise any Option granted to such Participant to the extent that the Option has become exercisable but has not been exercised on the date of the Participant's termination of service due to Disability; and in the event rights to exercise the Option accrue periodically, to the extent of a pro rata portion through the date of the Participant's termination of service due to Disability of any additional vesting rights that would have accrued on the next vesting date had the Participant not become Disabled. The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued in the current vesting period prior to the date of the Participant's termination of service due to Disability. 
(b) A Disabled Participant may exercise the Option only within the period ending one year after the date of the Participant's termination of service due to Disability, notwithstanding that the Participant might have been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares on a later date if 
A-10
TABLE OF CONTENTS
the Participant had not been terminated due to Disability and had continued to be an Employee, director or Consultant or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option. 
(c) The Administrator shall make the determination both of whether Disability has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a procedure for such determination is set forth in another agreement between the Company and such Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a physician selected or approved by the Administrator, the cost of which examination shall be paid for by the Company. 
17. EFFECT ON OPTIONS OF DEATH WHILE AN EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR OR CONSULTANT.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Option Agreement: 
(a) In the event of the death of a Participant while the Participant is an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate, such Option may be exercised by the Participant's Survivors to the extent that the Option has become exercisable but has not been exercised on the date of death; and in the event rights to exercise the Option accrue periodically, to the extent of a pro rata portion through the date of death of any additional vesting rights that would have accrued on the next vesting date had the Participant not died. The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued in the current vesting period prior to the Participant's date of death. 
(b) If the Participant's Survivors wish to exercise the Option, they must take all necessary steps to exercise the Option within one year after the date of death of such Participant, notwithstanding that the decedent might have been able to exercise the Option as to some or all of the Shares on a later date if he or she had not died and had continued to be an Employee, director or Consultant or, if earlier, within the originally prescribed term of the Option. 
18. EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS.
In the event of a termination of service (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate for any reason before the Participant has accepted a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award and paid the purchase price, if required, such grant shall terminate. 
For purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, a Participant to whom a Stock Grant or a Stock-Based Award has been issued under the Plan who is absent from work with the Company or with an Affiliate because of temporary disability (any disability other than a Disability as defined in Paragraph 1 hereof), or who is on leave of absence for any purpose, shall not, during the period of any such absence, be deemed, by virtue of such absence alone, to have terminated such Participant's employment, director status or consultancy with the Company or with an Affiliate, except as the Administrator may otherwise expressly provide. 
In addition, for purposes of this Paragraph 18 and Paragraph 19 below, any change of employment or other service within or among the Company and any Affiliates shall not be treated as a termination of employment, director status or consultancy so long as the Participant continues to be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or any Affiliate. 
19. EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE, DEATH or DISABILITY.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, in the event of a termination of service for any reason (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant), other than termination for Cause, death or Disability for which there are special rules in Paragraphs 20, 21, and 22 below, before all forfeiture provisions or Company rights of repurchase shall have lapsed, then the Company shall have the right to cancel or repurchase that number of Shares subject to a Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award as to which the Company's forfeiture or repurchase rights have not lapsed.
A-11
TABLE OF CONTENTS
20. EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR CAUSE.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following rules apply if the Participant's service (whether as an Employee, director or Consultant) with the Company or an Affiliate is terminated for Cause: 
(a) All Shares subject to any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award that remain subject to forfeiture provisions or as to which the Company shall have a repurchase right shall be immediately forfeited to the Company as of the time the Participant is notified his or her service is terminated for Cause. 
(b) Cause is not limited to events which have occurred prior to a Participant's termination of service, nor is it necessary that the Administrator's finding of Cause occur prior to termination. If the Administrator determines, subsequent to a Participant's termination of service, that either prior or subsequent to the Participant's termination the Participant engaged in conduct which would constitute Cause, then all Shares subject to any Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award that remained subject to forfeiture provisions or as to which the Company had a repurchase right on the date of termination shall be immediately forfeited to the Company. 
21. EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF TERMINATION OF SERVICE FOR DISABILITY.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following rules apply if a Participant ceases to be an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate by reason of Disability: to the extent the forfeiture provisions or the Company's rights of repurchase have not lapsed on the date of Disability, they shall be exercisable; provided, however, that in the event such forfeiture provisions or rights of repurchase lapse periodically, such provisions or rights shall lapse to the extent of a pro rata portion of the Shares subject to such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award through the date of Disability as would have lapsed had the Participant not become Disabled. The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued prior to the date of Disability. 
The Administrator shall make the determination both as to whether Disability has occurred and the date of its occurrence (unless a procedure for such determination is set forth in another agreement between the Company and such Participant, in which case such procedure shall be used for such determination). If requested, the Participant shall be examined by a physician selected or approved by the Administrator, the cost of which examination shall be paid for by the Company. 
22. EFFECT ON STOCK GRANTS AND STOCK-BASED AWARDS OF DEATH WHILE AN EMPLOYEE, DIRECTOR OR CONSULTANT.
Except as otherwise provided in a Participant's Agreement, the following rules apply in the event of the death of a Participant while the Participant is an Employee, director or Consultant of the Company or of an Affiliate: to the extent the forfeiture provisions or the Company's rights of repurchase have not lapsed on the date of death, they shall be exercisable; provided, however, that in the event such forfeiture provisions or rights of repurchase lapse periodically, such provisions or rights shall lapse to the extent of a pro rata portion of the Shares subject to such Stock Grant or Stock-Based Award through the date of death as would have lapsed had the Participant not died. The proration shall be based upon the number of days accrued prior to the Participant's date of death.

23. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT.
Unless the offering and sale of the Shares shall have been effectively registered under the Securities Act, the Company shall be under no obligation to issue Shares under the Plan unless and until the following conditions have been fulfilled: 
(a) The person who receives a Stock Right shall warrant to the Company, prior to the receipt of Shares, that such person is acquiring such Shares for his or her own account, for investment, and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, the distribution of any such Shares, in which event the person acquiring such Shares shall be bound by the provisions of the following legend (or a legend in substantially similar form) which shall be endorsed upon the certificate evidencing the Shares issued pursuant to such exercise or such grant of a Stock Right: 
"The shares represented by this certificate have been taken for investment and they may not be sold or otherwise transferred by any person, including a pledgee, unless (1) either (a) a Registration Statement with respect to such shares shall be effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or (b) the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel satisfactory to it that an exemption from registration under such Act is then available, and (2) there shall have been compliance with all applicable state securities laws." 
(b) At the discretion of the Administrator, the Company shall have received an opinion of its counsel that the Shares may be issued in compliance with the Securities Act without registration thereunder. 
24. DISSOLUTION OR LIQUIDATION OF THE COMPANY.
Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, all Options granted under this Plan which as of such date shall not have been exercised and all Stock Grants and Stock-Based Awards which have not been accepted, to the extent required under the applicable Agreement, will terminate and become null and void; provided, however, that if the rights of a Participant or a Participant's Survivors have not otherwise terminated and expired, the Participant or the Participant's Survivors will have the right immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation to exercise or accept any Stock Right to the extent that the Stock Right is exercisable or subject to acceptance as of the date immediately prior to such dissolution or liquidation. Upon the dissolution or liquidation of the Company, any outstanding Stock-Based Awards shall immediately terminate unless otherwise determined by the Administrator or specifically provided in the applicable Agreement. 
25. ADJUSTMENTS.
Upon the occurrence of any of the following events, a Participant's rights with respect to any Stock Right granted to him or her hereunder shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided, unless otherwise specifically provided in a Participant's Agreement. 
(a) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits.   If  (i) the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares or if the Company shall issue any shares of Common Stock as a stock dividend on its outstanding Common Stock, or (ii) additional shares or new or different shares or other securities of the Company or other non-cash assets are distributed with respect to such shares of Common Stock, each Stock Right and the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable thereunder shall be appropriately increased or decreased proportionately, and appropriate adjustments shall be made including, in the exercise or purchase price per share, to reflect such events. The number of Shares subject to the limitations in Paragraph 3(a) and 4(c) shall also be proportionately adjusted upon the occurrence of such events and the Performance Goals applicable to outstanding Performance-Based Awards. 
(b) Corporate Transactions.   If the Company is to be consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or the acquisition of all of the outstanding voting stock of the Company in a single transaction or a series of related transactions by a single entity other than a transaction to merely change the state of incorporation (a "Corporate Transaction"), the Administrator or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder (the "Successor Board"), shall, as to outstanding Options, either (i) make appropriate 
A-13
TABLE OF CONTENTS
provision for the continuation of such Options by substituting on an equitable basis for the Shares then subject to such Options either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock in connection with the Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor or acquiring entity; or (ii) upon written notice to the Participants, provide that such Options must be exercised (either (A) to the extent then exercisable or, (B) at the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options being made partially or fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph), within a specified number of days of the date of such notice, at the end of which period such Options which have not been exercised shall terminate; or (iii) terminate such Options in exchange for payment of an amount equal to the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such Option would have been exercisable (either (A) to the extent then exercisable or, (B) at the discretion of the Administrator, any such Options being made partially or fully exercisable for purposes of this Subparagraph) less the aggregate exercise price thereof. For purposes of determining the payments to be made pursuant to Subclause (iii) above, in the case of a Corporate Transaction the consideration for which, in whole or in part, is other than cash, the consideration other than cash shall be valued at the fair value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Corporate Transaction also constitutes a Change of Control, then all Options outstanding on the date of the Corporate Transaction shall automatically become fully vested and exercisable. 
With respect to outstanding Stock Grants, the Administrator or the Successor Board, shall make appropriate provision for the continuation of such Stock Grants on the same terms and conditions by substituting on an equitable basis for the Shares then subject to such Stock Grants either the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding Shares of Common Stock in connection with the Corporate Transaction or securities of any successor or acquiring entity. In lieu of the foregoing, in connection with any Corporate Transaction, the Administrator may provide that, upon consummation of the Corporate Transaction, each outstanding Stock Grant shall be terminated in exchange for payment of an amount equal to the consideration payable upon consummation of such Corporate Transaction to a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock comprising such Stock Grant (to the extent such Stock Grant is no longer subject to any forfeiture or repurchase rights then in effect or, at the discretion of the Administrator, all forfeiture and repurchase rights being waived upon such Corporate Transaction). 
In taking any of the actions permitted under this Paragraph 25(b), the Administrator shall not be obligated by the Plan to treat all Stock Rights, all Stock Rights held by a Participant, or all Stock Rights of the same type, identically. 
(c) Recapitalization or Reorganization.   In the event of a recapitalization or reorganization of the Company other than a Corporate Transaction pursuant to which securities of the Company or of another corporation are issued with respect to the outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Participant upon exercising an Option or accepting a Stock Grant after the recapitalization or reorganization shall be entitled to receive for the price paid upon such exercise or acceptance if any, the number of replacement securities which would have been received if such Option had been exercised or Stock Grant accepted prior to such recapitalization or reorganization. 
(d) Adjustments to Stock-Based Awards.   Upon the happening of any of the events described in Subparagraphs (a), (b) or (c) above, any outstanding Stock-Based Award shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the events described in such Subparagraphs. The Administrator or the Successor Board shall determine the specific adjustments to be made under this Paragraph 25, including, but not limited to the effect of any, Corporate Transaction and Change of Control and, subject to Paragraph 4, its determination shall be conclusive. 
(e) Modification of Options.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to Subparagraph (a), (b) or (c) above with respect to Options shall be made only after the Administrator determines whether such adjustments would (i) constitute a "modification" of any ISOs (as that term is defined in Section 424(h) of the Code) or (ii) cause any adverse tax consequences for the holders of Options, including, but not limited to, pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. If the Administrator determines that such adjustments made with respect to Options would constitute a modification or other adverse tax consequence, it may refrain from making such adjustments, unless the holder of an Option 
A-14
TABLE OF CONTENTS
specifically agrees in writing that such adjustment be made and such writing indicates that the holder has full knowledge of the consequences of such "modification" on his or her income tax treatment with respect to the Option. This paragraph shall not apply to the acceleration of the vesting of any ISO that would cause any portion of the ISO to violate the annual vesting limitation contained in Section 422(d) of the Code, as described in Paragraph 6(b)(iv). 
(f) Modification of Performance-Based Awards.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Performance-Based Award that is intended to comply as "performance based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, the Committee may adjust downwards, but not upwards, the number of Shares payable pursuant to a Performance-Based Award, and the Committee may not waive the achievement of the applicable Performance Goals except in the case of death or disability of the Participant. 
26. ISSUANCES OF SECURITIES.
Except as expressly provided herein, no issuance by the Company of shares of stock of any class, or securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, shall affect, and no adjustment by reason thereof shall be made with respect to, the number or price of shares subject to Stock Rights. Except as expressly provided herein, no adjustments shall be made for dividends paid in cash or in property (including without limitation, securities) of the Company prior to any issuance of Shares pursuant to a Stock Right. 
27. FRACTIONAL SHARES.
No fractional shares shall be issued under the Plan and the person exercising a Stock Right shall receive from the Company cash in lieu of such fractional shares equal to the Fair Market Value thereof. 
28. CONVERSION OF ISOs INTO NON-QUALIFIED OPTIONS; TERMINATION OF ISOs.
The Administrator, at the written request of any Participant, may in its discretion take such actions as may be necessary to convert such Participant's ISOs (or any portions thereof) that have not been exercised on the date of conversion into Non-Qualified Options at any time prior to the expiration of such ISOs, regardless of whether the Participant is an Employee of the Company or an Affiliate at the time of such conversion. At the time of such conversion, the Administrator (with the consent of the Participant) may impose such conditions on the exercise of the resulting Non-Qualified Options as the Administrator in its discretion may determine, provided that such conditions shall not be inconsistent with this Plan. Nothing in the Plan shall be deemed to give any Participant the right to have such Participant's ISOs converted into Non-Qualified Options, and no such conversion shall occur until and unless the Administrator takes appropriate action. The Administrator, with the consent of the Participant, may also terminate any portion of any ISO that has not been exercised at the time of such conversion. 
29. WITHHOLDING.
In the event that any federal, state, or local income taxes, employment taxes, Federal Insurance Contributions Act ("F.I.C.A.") withholdings or other amounts are required by applicable law or governmental regulation to be withheld from the Participant's salary, wages or other remuneration in connection with the issuance of a Stock Right or Shares under the Plan or for any other reason required by law, the Company may withhold from the Participant's compensation, if any, or may require that the Participant advance in cash to the Company, or to any Affiliate of the Company which employs or employed the Participant, the statutory minimum amount of such withholdings unless a different withholding arrangement, including the use of shares of the Company's Common Stock or a promissory note, is authorized by the Administrator (and permitted by law). For purposes hereof, the fair market value of the shares withheld for purposes of payroll withholding shall be determined in the manner set forth under the definition of Fair Market Value provided in Paragraph 1 above, as of the most recent practicable date prior to the date of exercise. If the Fair Market Value of the shares withheld is less than the amount of payroll withholdings required, the Participant may be required to advance the difference in cash to the Company or the Affiliate employer. The Administrator in its discretion may condition the exercise of an Option for less than the then Fair Market Value on the Participant's payment of such additional withholding.
A-15
TABLE OF CONTENTS
30. NOTICE TO COMPANY OF DISQUALIFYING DISPOSITION.
Each Employee who receives an ISO must agree to notify the Company in writing immediately after the Employee makes a Disqualifying Disposition of any Shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of an ISO. A Disqualifying Disposition is defined in Section 424(c) of the Code and includes any disposition (including any sale or gift) of such Shares before the later of  (a) two years after the date the Employee was granted the ISO, or (b) one year after the date the Employee acquired Shares by exercising the ISO, except as otherwise provided in Section 424(c) of the Code. If the Employee has died before such Shares are sold, these holding period requirements do not apply and no Disqualifying Disposition can occur thereafter. 
31. TERMINATION OF THE PLAN.
The Plan will terminate on March 9, 2027, the date which is ten years from the earlier of the date of its adoption by the Board of Directors and the date of its approval by the shareholders of the Company. The Plan may be terminated at an earlier date by vote of the shareholders or the Board of Directors of the Company; provided, however, that any such earlier termination shall not affect any Agreements executed prior to the effective date of such termination. Termination of the Plan shall not affect any Stock Rights theretofore granted. 
32. AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN AND AGREEMENTS.
The Plan may be amended by the shareholders of the Company. The Plan may also be amended by the Administrator; provided that any amendment approved by the Administrator which the Administrator determines is of a scope that requires shareholder approval shall be subject to obtaining such shareholder approval including, without limitation, to the extent necessary to qualify any or all outstanding Stock Rights granted under the Plan or Stock Rights to be granted under the Plan for favorable federal income tax treatment as may be afforded incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code and to the extent necessary to qualify the Shares issuable under the Plan for listing on any national securities exchange or quotation in any national automated quotation system of securities dealers and in order to continue to comply with Section 162(m) of the Code. Other than as set forth in Paragraph 25 of the Plan, the Administrator may not without shareholder approval reduce the exercise price of an Option or cancel any outstanding Option in exchange for a replacement option having a lower exercise price, any Stock Grant, any other Stock-Based Award or for cash. In addition, the Administrator not take any other action that is considered a direct or indirect "repricing" for purposes of the shareholder approval rules of the applicable securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system on which the Shares are listed, including any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles. Any modification or amendment of the Plan shall not, without the consent of a Participant, adversely affect his or her rights under a Stock Right previously granted to him or her. With the consent of the Participant affected, the Administrator may amend outstanding Agreements in a manner which may be adverse to the Participant but which is not inconsistent with the Plan. In the discretion of the Administrator, outstanding Agreements may be amended by the Administrator in a manner which is not adverse to the Participant. Nothing in this Paragraph 32 shall limit the Administrator's authority to take any action permitted pursuant to Paragraph 25. 
33. EMPLOYMENT OR OTHER RELATIONSHIP.
Nothing in this Plan or any Agreement shall be deemed to prevent the Company or an Affiliate from terminating the employment, consultancy or director status of a Participant, nor to prevent a Participant from terminating his or her own employment, consultancy or director status or to give any Participant a right to be retained in employment or other service by the Company or any Affiliate for any period of time. 
34. SECTION 409A.
If a Participant is a "specified employee" as defined in Section 409A of the Code (and as applied according to procedures of the Company and its Affiliates) as of his separation from service, to the extent any payment under this Plan or pursuant to the grant of a Stock-Based Award constitutes deferred compensation (after taking into account any applicable exemptions from Section 409A of the Code), and to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code, no payments due under this Plan or pursuant to a Stock-Based Award may be made until the earlier of: (i) the first day of the seventh month following the 
A-16
TABLE OF CONTENTS
Participant's separation from service, or (ii) the Participant's date of death; provided, however, that any payments delayed during this six-month period shall be paid in the aggregate in a lump sum, without interest, on the first day of the seventh month following the Participant's separation from service. 
The Administrator shall administer the Plan with a view toward ensuring that Stock Rights under the Plan that are subject to Section 409A of the Code comply with the requirements thereof and that Options under the Plan be exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, but neither the Administrator nor any member of the Board, nor the Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any other person acting hereunder on behalf of the Company, the Administrator or the Board shall be liable to a Participant or any Survivor by reason of the acceleration of any income, or the imposition of any additional tax or penalty, with respect to a Stock Right, whether by reason of a failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or otherwise. 
35. INDEMNITY.
Neither the Board nor the Administrator, nor any members of either, nor any employees of the Company or any parent, subsidiary, or other Affiliate, shall be liable for any act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination made in good faith in connection with their responsibilities with respect to this Plan, and the Company hereby agrees to indemnify the members of the Board, the members of the Committee, and the employees of the Company and its parent or subsidiaries in respect of any claim, loss, damage, or expense (including reasonable counsel fees) arising from any such act, omission, interpretation, construction or determination to the full extent permitted by law. 
36. CLAWBACK.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan, the Company may recover from a Participant any compensation received from any Stock Right (whether or not settled) or cause a Participant to forfeit any Stock Right (whether or not vested) in the event that the Company's Clawback Policy then in effect is triggered. 
37. GOVERNING LAW.
This Plan shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the law of the State of Nevada.
