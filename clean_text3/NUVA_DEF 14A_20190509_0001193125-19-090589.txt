PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
May  9, 2019 at 8:00 AM (local time) 
GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Why am I receiving these materials?  
[END TABLE]
We have made this proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") and the accompanying proxy materials available to you in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of NuVasive, Inc. (the "Company" or "NuVasive") of proxies to be voted at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on May 9, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"), and at any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders are being asked to vote on each of the following items of business at the Annual Meeting: (i) the election of three "Class III" Directors for terms expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; (ii) the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; (iii) non-binding advisory approval of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (the "Named Executive Officers") for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018; and (iv) any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Why did I receive a notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set  of proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
In accordance with rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we may furnish proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "2018 Annual Report"), to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet, as well as how you may submit your proxy on the Internet. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or your proxy card and to download printable versions of the proxy materials. If you would like to receive a paper or email copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  How do I access electronic copies of the proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
The proxy materials for the Annual Meeting are available electronically at www.proxydocs.com/NUVA. If you received a Notice, the Notice will provide you with instructions regarding how to access electronic copies of our proxy materials and how to vote your shares. The Notice will also indicate how you can elect to receive future proxy materials electronically. We encourage stockholders to consider choosing to receive future proxy materials electronically, as it will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of printing and mailing these materials on the environment. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
If you were a holder of shares of the Company's common stock at the close of business on March 19, 2019 (the "Record Date"), you are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. At the close of 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                      Page 1        
                      Page 1        
                      Page 1        
[END TABLE]
 business on the Record Date, there were 51,856,479 shares of our common stock outstanding. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares owned by "stockholders of record" and shares owned beneficially "in street name." In accordance with Delaware law, a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for 10 days prior to the Annual Meeting, Monday through Friday between the hours of 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM local time at our corporate headquarters located at 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  What does it mean to be a "stockholder of record"?  
[END TABLE]
You are a "stockholder of record" if your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. As a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting (subject to the satisfying the admission criteria) or vote by proxy. If you requested to receive printed proxy materials, we have enclosed or sent a proxy card for you to use. You may also vote by Internet or telephone, as described in the Notice and below under the heading "How do I vote my shares?" 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  What does it mean to beneficially own shares in "street name"?  
[END TABLE]
You are deemed to beneficially own your shares in "street name" if your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, trust, or other similar organization (we will refer to those organizations collectively as "broker"). If this is the case, the Notice was forwarded to you by your broker. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker on how to vote the shares in your account, and you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting; however, since you are not a stockholder of record, you may not vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you request and obtain a valid legal proxy from your broker giving you the right to vote the shares at the meeting. 
If you hold your shares in "street name" and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, your shares will not be voted on any proposals on which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote (a "broker non-vote"). Under the rules that govern brokers, brokers have the discretion to vote on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. The ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is a matter considered routine under applicable rules. Non-routine matters include the election of Directors and the advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
8.  How do I vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares by one of the following three methods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote via the Internet. Go to the web address www.proxypush.com/NUVA and follow the instructions for  Internet voting as shown on the proxy card mailed to you. If you vote via the Internet, you should be aware that there may be incidental costs associated with electronic access, such as your usage charges from your Internet access providers and  telephone companies, for which you will be responsible.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Telephone. Dial 1-866-217-7017 and follow the instructions for telephone voting shown on the proxy card mailed to you.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vote by Proxy Card Mailed to You. If you do not wish to vote via the Internet or by telephone, please  complete, sign, date and mail the proxy card in the envelope provided. If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, please do not mail your proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate your identity and to allow you to vote your shares for the matters before our stockholders as described in the proxy materials and confirm that your voting instructions have been properly recorded. 
If your shares are held through a broker (typically referred to as being held in "street name"), you will receive separate voting instructions from your broker. In these cases, you may provide your voting instructions by Internet, telephone or mail by submitting a voting instruction form. Your broker may vote your shares on the proposal to ratify our independent auditors, but will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to the other proposals before our stockholders as described in this Proxy Statement unless you provide instructions to your broker as to how to vote your shares for such other proposals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Page 2                    
        Page 2                    
        Page 2                    
[END TABLE]
Votes submitted via the Internet or by telephone for the matters before our stockholders as described in this Proxy Statement must be received by 11:59 PM Eastern Time on May 8, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  How does the Board recommend that I vote my shares?  
[END TABLE]
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE YOUR SHARES "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE "CLASS III" DIRECTOR NOMINEES, "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AND "FOR" THE NON-BINDING ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, IN EACH CASE AS FURTHER DESCRIBED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
Yes. If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by (a) delivering a proxy revocation or another duly executed proxy bearing a later date to the Secretary of the Company at 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121, or (b) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not revoke a proxy unless you actually vote in person at the Annual Meeting. If you beneficially hold shares in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker following the instructions provided by your broker, or, if you have obtained a legal proxy from your broker or other nominee giving you the right to vote your shares, by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  How are the votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Restated Bylaws, as amended (the "Bylaws") provide that a majority of all the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Votes for and against, abstentions, and "broker non-votes" will be counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. A "broker non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy card for your shares of common stock held in street name, but does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker has not received voting instructions from you and does not have the authority to vote on that matter without instructions. 
In the election of Directors and for proposals 2 and 3, you may vote "FOR", "AGAINST", or "ABSTAIN". A vote of "ABSTAIN" with respect to any such matter will not be voted, although it will be counted for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum. Accordingly, an abstention will have the effect of a negative vote. 
If no instructions are indicated, the shares will be voted as recommended by the Board unless you submit your proxy card through a broker and your broker does not indicate a vote on a particular matter because your broker has not received voting instructions from you. If the Company receives a proxy card with a broker non-vote, your proxy will be voted "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP and it will not be included as a vote with respect to the election of directors or the advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  What vote is needed to approve each of the proposals?  
[END TABLE]
Under the Bylaws, at any meeting of stockholders for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, each Director shall be elected by the vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director; provided, that in the event of a contested election, Directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast by the stockholders entitled to vote at the election. All other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes present in person or represented by proxy, unless otherwise required by applicable law, rule or regulation or the Company's organizational documents. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Is cumulative voting permitted for the election of Directors?  
[END TABLE]
No. You may not cumulate your votes for the election of Directors.

                      Page 3        
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  Who will count votes at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
We have engaged Mediant Communications to serve as the tabulator of votes and our Board has designated Nathaniel B. Sisitsky, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, to serve as the Inspector of Election. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  How do I attend the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
Admission to the Annual Meeting is limited to holders of Company common stock on the Record Date and a member of each attending stockholder's immediate family or their named representatives. If you are a "stockholder of record" you will need to present identification to be admitted to the Annual Meeting. If you are a stockholder who is an individual, you will need to present government-issued identification showing your name and photograph (e.g., a driver's license or passport), or, if you are representing an institutional investor, you will need to present government-issued photo identification and professional evidence showing your representative capacity for such entity. In each case, we will verify such documentation with our Record Date stockholder list. We reserve the right to limit the number of immediate family members or representatives who may attend the meeting. For stockholders holding shares "in street name," in addition to providing identification as outlined for record holders above, you will need a valid proxy from your broker or a recent brokerage statement or letter from your broker reflecting your stock ownership as of the Record Date. 
All purses, briefcases, bags, etc. that are brought into the facility may be subject to inspection. The use of mobile phones, pagers, recording or photographic equipment, tablets and/or computers is not permitted in the meeting room during the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Who pays the costs of the proxy solicitation?  
[END TABLE]
The Company will pay all of the costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to solicitation by mail, officers, Directors and Company Shareowners (our employees) may solicit proxies personally, or by telephone, without receiving additional compensation. The Company, if requested, will also pay brokers and other fiduciaries that hold shares of common stock for beneficial owners for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of forwarding these materials to stockholders. The Company has retained Georgeson LLC (with offices at 480 Washington Boulevard, 27th Floor, Jersey City, NJ 07310) to assist in the solicitation of proxies in connection with the Annual Meeting. The Company will pay such firm customary fees, expected to be no more than $7,500, plus expenses. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  Could other matters be decided in the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company is not aware of any matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting other than those stated in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, the persons named by the Board as proxy holders will have the discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by proxy on those matters. The Board has named Rajesh J. Asarpota (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer), Nathaniel B. Sisitsky (Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary), and Suzanne Hatcher (Vice President, Internal & External Affairs) as proxy holders. If, for any reason, any of the nominees are not available as a candidate for Director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.  Is it possible that the Annual Meeting may be postponed?  
[END TABLE]
The Annual Meeting may be adjourned or postponed, if needed, as provided by the Bylaws and pursuant to Delaware law. Unless a new record date is fixed, your proxy will still be valid and may be voted at any adjourned or postponed meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted at the reconvened or rescheduled meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
19.  Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish the final results by filing a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting.

PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
          OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH CLASS III DIRECTOR NOMINEE TO SERVE AS A DIRECTOR   
          OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH CLASS III DIRECTOR NOMINEE TO SERVE AS A DIRECTOR   
          OUR BOARD RECOMMENDS YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH CLASS III DIRECTOR NOMINEE TO SERVE AS A DIRECTOR   
[END TABLE]
If elected at the Annual Meeting, each of Messrs. Friel, Rosenberg and Wolterman will serve as Class III Directors until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and in each case until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. Information regarding the experience of each of Messrs. Friel, Rosenberg and Wolterman, including the qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board to nominate each as a Director, can be found below under the caption "Nominees for Election of Directors and Directors Continuing in Office." 
Messrs. Friel, Rosenberg and Wolterman have indicated that they are willing and able to serve as Directors. If any of the Board's nominees for Director declines to serve or becomes unavailable for any reason, or in the event of a Board vacancy, the Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee may seek out other potential Director candidates, and one or more of such candidates may be elected as a Director in accordance with the Company's organizational documents. 
As each of the nominees is an incumbent Director, if a nominee fails to receive "FOR" votes representing a majority of votes cast, the Director shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee of the Board would then be charged with making a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating, Corporate Governance and Compliance Committee, and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision. If the Board determines not to accept the resignation of the incumbent Director, the incumbent Director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. 
Vote Required and Board Recommendation 
Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. A majority of votes cast means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a nominee exceeds the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that nominee. Votes to "ABSTAIN" and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast with respect to that Director, and will have no direct effect on the outcome of the election of Directors. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" 
THE ELECTION OF EACH OF ROBERT F. FRIEL, DONALD J. ROSENBERG, ESQ. AND 
DANIEL J. WOLTERMAN AS A "CLASS III" DIRECTOR.

 requirements; the Fraud and Abuse Laws and other medical device laws; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the Anti-Kickback Statute and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.

Identification and Evaluation of Director Nominees 
The Nominating Committee believes the Company is well served by its current Directors. In the ordinary course, absent special circumstances or a material change in the criteria for Board membership, the Nominating Committee will re-nominate incumbent Directors who continue to be qualified for Board service and are willing to continue as Directors. From time to time, the Nominating Committee may also consider and evaluate potential new Director candidates who meet the criteria for selection as a Board nominee and have specific qualities or skills identified by the Board, and one or more of such candidates may be appointed as Directors as appropriate and in accordance with the Company's organizational documents. Director candidates will be selected based on input from members of the Board, senior management of the Company and, if the Nominating Committee deems appropriate, a third-party search firm. The Nominating Committee will evaluate each candidate's qualifications and check relevant references; in addition, such candidates will be interviewed by members of the Nominating Committee. Candidates meriting serious consideration will also meet other members of the Board. Based on this input, the Nominating Committee will evaluate which of the prospective candidates is qualified to serve as a Director and whether the Nominating Committee should recommend to the Board that this candidate be appointed to fill a vacancy on the Board, or presented for approval of the stockholders, as appropriate. 
In identifying and evaluating Director candidates for appointment or re-election to the Board, the Nominating Committee considers the appropriate balance of experience, skills and characteristics required of the Board, seeks to ensure that at least a majority of the Directors are independent under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), and that members of the Audit Committee meet the financial literacy and sophistication requirements under NASDAQ rules (including that at least one of them qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" under the rules of the SEC). Nominees for Director are selected on the basis of their depth and breadth of experience, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of the Company's business environment, and willingness to devote adequate time to Board duties. Additionally, the Nominating Committee will consider diversity in personal and professional backgrounds and seeks diverse individuals, such as women and individuals from minority groups, to include in the pool of candidates for Board nomination; however, there is no formal

                      Page 13        
[END TABLE]
 policy with respect to diversity considerations in identifying Director nominees. Further, the Nominating Committee will assess whether a Director candidate satisfies the retirement age policy under our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Company's retirement age policy provides that a Director may not stand for re-election after age 72, but need not resign until the end of his or her term. 
Over the course of the last year, our Board identified and recruited two new Directors, Mr. Huennekens and Mr. Barry, to bring additional skills and experience to the Board. As a result of our retirement age policy, two of our Directors did not stand for re-election at our 2018 Annual Meeting and retired as Directors immediately following the Annual Meeting, resulting in two vacancies, one of which was filled prior to the Annual Meeting by the election of Dr. DeFord in February 2018. In connection with the retirement of two of our Directors at the 2018 Annual Meeting, the Board engaged a director search firm to identify potential new Director candidates. After assessing the merits of recruiting an additional Director to join the Board, the Nominating Committee extended its engagement of the director search firm to fill the remaining vacancy. The Nominating Committee oversaw the continued Director search process, focusing its search on a director candidate with prior technology and product development experience at a medical technology company and, after identifying and considering a number of candidates, recruited Mr. Huennekens to join the Board. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board approved the election of Mr. Huennekens (elected in October 2018) to serve as a "Class II" Director until the 2021 Annual Meeting. In addition, in connection with his appointment as Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), the Board approved the election of Mr. Barry (elected in November 2018) to serve as a "Class II" Director until the 2021 Annual Meeting and increased the size of the Board from nine to ten. 
Robert F. Friel, Donald J. Rosenberg, Esq. and Daniel J. Wolterman have each been nominated for re-election to the Board at the Annual Meeting to serve as a "Class III" Director until 2022. The Nominating Committee and the Board believe that each of the Director nominees for election at the Annual Meeting brings a strong and unique set of qualifications, attributes and skills and provides the Board as a whole with an optimal balance of experience, leadership and competencies in areas of importance to our Company. Under "Proposal 1—Election of Directors," we provide an overview of each Director nominee's principal occupation, business experience and other directorships, together with other key attributes that we believe provide value to the Board, the Company and its stockholders. 
Stockholder Recommendations for Director Nominees 
In nominating candidates for election as a Director, the Nominating Committee will consider written proposals from stockholders for Director nominees. Any such nominations should be submitted to the Nominating Committee, care of the Secretary of the Company, and should include the following information: (a) all information relating to such nominee that is required to be disclosed pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including such person's written consent to being named in the Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if elected), and (b) all information required by the Company's Bylaws (including the names and addresses of the stockholders making the nomination and the appropriate biographical information and a statement as to the qualification of the nominee). For more information, see the discussion under the caption "Additional Information." 
The Company has never received a proposal from a stockholder to nominate a Director. Although the Nominating Committee has not adopted a formal policy with respect to stockholder nominees, the Nominating Committee expects that the evaluation process for a stockholder nominee would be similar to the process outlined above. 
Director Independence 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and NASDAQ rules, our Board is required to be comprised of a majority of independent Directors. The Nominating Committee evaluates our Directors' compliance with NASDAQ rules regarding independence, as well as other factors, in making a recommendation to the Board as to whether Directors can be considered independent. Under applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules, the existence of certain "related party" transactions between a Director and the Company with dollar amounts above certain thresholds are required to be disclosed and preclude a finding by the Board that the Director is independent. In addition to transactions required to be disclosed under SEC and NASDAQ rules, the Board considered certain other relationships in making its 
[BEGIN TABLE]
        Page 14                    
        Page 14                    
        Page 14                    
[END TABLE]
 independence determinations, and determined, in each case, that such other relationships did not impair the Director's ability to exercise independent judgment on behalf of the Company. Based on the recommendation of the Nominating Committee, the Board determined that the following eight Directors are independent under the NASDAQ rules and our Corporate Governance Guidelines: Vickie L. Capps, John A. DeFord, Robert F. Friel, R. Scott Huennekens, Leslie V. Norwalk, Michael D. O'Halleran, Donald J. Rosenberg, and Daniel J. Wolterman. Gregory T. Lucier, who served as our CEO through November 4, 2018, and who continues to provide consulting services to the Company, and J. Christopher Barry, our current CEO, are not considered independent. 
Role of Board in CEO Succession Planning 
A key responsibility of the Board is succession planning for the CEO. In 2018, the Board undertook a comprehensive leadership development and succession planning process, which included succession planning for the CEO. The Compensation Committee is charged with overseeing succession planning efforts for the CEO, and after discussions with Mr. Lucier, determined to engage an outside executive search firm to identify potential candidates to succeed Mr. Lucier as CEO. Working with the search firm, the Compensation Committee oversaw an executive assessment for potential internal candidates, as well as external executive benchmarking. After the Compensation Committee determined to proceed with an external search process, a special committee of independent Directors was formed to oversee the search process and consider external candidates. After a robust and competitive process, Mr. Barry was identified as the preferred candidate to succeed Mr. Lucier as CEO. The Compensation Committee then worked with its independent compensation consultant to develop parameters for a proposed employment offer for Mr. Barry. The Board, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the hiring and appointment of Mr. Barry as the Company's CEO in November 2018. In determining to appoint Mr. Barry to succeed Mr. Lucier as CEO, the Board considered Mr. Barry's executive experience in the medical technology industry, including his experience as a strategic operator who has led teams globally, managed complex research and development programs and driven commercial initiatives. 
Board Leadership Structure 
In connection with the appointment of Mr. Barry to succeed Mr. Lucier as the Company's CEO in November 2018, the Board determined to separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO, with Mr. Barry serving as the CEO and Mr. Lucier serving as the Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that there is no single, generally accepted leadership structure and maintains flexibility to determine which leadership structure best serves the interest of the Company based on circumstances and the evolving needs of the Company. Accordingly, although the Company believes that the separation of the Chairman of the Board and CEO roles is appropriate at this time based upon the current circumstances, the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines do not establish this approach as a policy. As such, our Board of Directors periodically reviews its leadership structure to confirm that it is an appropriate structure for the Company at such time. 
Our Board leadership structure also includes a Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director is elected by a majority of the independent Directors for a renewable term of two years and presides at meetings of the independent Directors, presides at all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present and performs such other functions as the Board may direct, including advising the Chairman with respect to Board meeting agendas. The Lead Independent Director also has other authority and responsibilities that are described in the charter of the Lead Independent Director. The full text of the charter for the Lead Independent Director can be accessed in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.nuvasive.com, by clicking the "Governance" link and then "Governance Documents". Mr. Rosenberg currently serves as the Lead Independent Director. 
Each of the Directors other than Mr. Barry and Mr. Lucier is independent, and the Board believes that the independent Directors provide effective oversight of management. Moreover, in addition to feedback provided during the course of Board meetings, the independent Directors have regular executive sessions. Following an executive session of independent Directors, the independent Directors communicate with the Chairman directly regarding any specific feedback or issues, provide the Chairman with input regarding agenda items for Board and Committee meetings, and coordinate with the Chairman

                      Page 15        
[END TABLE]
 regarding information to be provided to the independent Directors in performing their duties. The Board believes that this approach appropriately and effectively complements the current leadership structure of the Board. 
Role of Board in Risk Oversight Process 
The responsibility for the day-to-day management of risk lies with the Company's management, while the Board is responsible for overseeing the risk management process to ensure that it is properly designed, well-functioning and consistent with the Company's overall corporate strategy. Each year, the Company's management identifies what it believes are the top individual risks facing the Company. These risks are then discussed and analyzed with the Board. This enables the Board to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships. Information technology and cybersecurity is a key area of focus for the Company and our Board is actively involved in overseeing cybersecurity risk management activities. Specifically, the Nominating Committee meets frequently with members of management to review our information technology and data security policies and practices, and to assess current and projected threats, cybersecurity incidents, and related risks. Additionally, the Committees of the Board consider the risks within their areas of responsibility. The Audit Committee oversees the risks associated with financial reporting, accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing and related matters. The Compensation Committee oversees the risks associated with the succession planning for key management positions. In addition, the Compensation Committee determines whether any compensation practices create risk-taking incentives that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Nominating Committee oversees the Company's global risk assessment process, as well as the risks associated with regulatory affairs, quality assurance, information technology and cybersecurity, corporate governance and ethics, and compliance matters. 
The Board's risk oversight function complements the Company's leadership structure. The Company's CEO, who also serves as a Director, is able to promote open communication between management and Directors relating to risk as well as combine the operational focus of management with the risk oversight capabilities of the Board. 
Executive Sessions 
Executive sessions of independent Directors are held in connection with each regularly scheduled Board meeting and at other times as necessary, and are chaired by the Lead Independent Director. The Board's policy is to hold executive sessions without the presence of management, including the CEO and other non-independent Directors, if any. The Committees of our Board also generally meet in executive session at the end of each Committee meeting. 
Board and Committee Effectiveness 
On an annual basis, the Board and each of its Committees performs an annual self-assessment to evaluate their effectiveness in fulfilling their obligations. The Nominating Committee also oversees individual evaluations of Directors, the results of which are shared with such individual Director. The Board, Committee and individual Director evaluations cover a wide range of topics, including, among others, the fulfillment of the Board and Committee responsibilities identified in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for each Committee. 
Board and Committee Membership and Structure 
Our Board has three standing Committees, comprised of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating Committee. Each Committee acts pursuant to a written charter, each of which can be accessed in the "Investor Relations" section of our website at www.nuvasive.com, by clicking the "Governance" link and then "Governance Documents". Each Committee reviews its charter on an annual basis. In addition to the three standing Committees, the Board may approve from time to time the creation of special or ad hoc committees to assist the Board in carrying out its duties.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") and SEC rules, the Company's Directors, executive officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of equity security are required to file periodic reports of their ownership, and changes in that ownership, with the SEC. Based solely on the Company's review of copies of reports provided to the Company pursuant to Rule 16a-3(e) of the Exchange Act and representations to the Company by such reporting persons, the Company believes that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all such SEC filing requirements were satisfied, except for Form 4 filings that should have been made on behalf of certain of our executive officers relating to the February 7, 2018 certification by our Compensation Committee of the non-GAAP EPS performance hurdle for restricted stock unit awards granted to our executive officers in 2017. These Form 4 filings were not timely filed due to an administrative error, and Form 5 filings disclosing such certification were made on February 7, 2019 on behalf of each of Gregory T. Lucier, Rajesh J. Asarpota, Matthew W. Link, Peter M. Leddy, Joan B. Stafslien, and Carol A. Cox.

Audit Committee Report 
Under the guidance of a written charter adopted by the Board, the purpose of the Audit Committee is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and audits of its financial statements. The responsibilities of the Audit Committee include appointing and approving the services and related fees of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee currently consists of three members, each of whom meets the independence and qualification standards for audit committee membership set forth in the listing standards provided by NASDAQ. 
Management has primary responsibility for the system of internal controls and the financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm has the responsibility to express an opinion on the financial statements based on an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). The independent registered public accounting firm is also responsible for auditing the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee appointed Ernst & Young LLP to audit the Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of the related systems of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee is kept apprised of the progress of the documentation, testing and evaluation of the Company's system of internal controls over financial reporting, and provides oversight and advice to management. In connection with this oversight, the Audit Committee receives periodic updates provided by management and Ernst & Young LLP at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting. The Audit Committee also holds regular private sessions with Ernst & Young LLP to discuss their audit plan for the year, the financial statements and risks of fraud. At the conclusion of the process, management provides the Audit Committee with, and the Audit Committee reviews, a report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed the report of management contained in the Company's 2018 Annual Report filed with the SEC, as well as the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report.

The Audit Committee pre-approves all services to be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Pre-approval is required for audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. In some cases, the full Audit Committee provides pre-approval for up to one year, related to a particular defined task or scope of work and subject to a specific budget. In other cases, a designated member of the Audit Committee may have delegated authority from the Audit Committee to pre-approve additional services, and such pre-approval is later reported to the full Audit Committee. See "Principal Accountant Fees and Services" for more information regarding fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for services in fiscal years 2018 and 2017.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executive compensation programs are designed so that a significant portion of pay is variable or "at risk"  and to link the realized value of compensation with Company performance and the returns delivered to stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We require executives to maintain a significant level of equity ownership in NuVasive and provide a meaningful portion  of our executives' total compensation in the form of equity-based, long-term incentives, further driving the link between stockholder value and executive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We regularly monitor our executive compensation programs to ensure best practices against corporate governance standards  as well as competitiveness against pay programs at companies in our industry of similar size and complexity.  
[END TABLE]
As further discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, the Compensation Committee and the Board highly value the opinions of our stockholders and, in a continuing effort to better understand their views regarding executive compensation practices, the Company continued its stockholder outreach in 2018 and 2019. These outreach efforts continue to enable the Company to strengthen its executive compensation program. 
The vote on our "say-on-pay" proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our NEOs, as described in this Proxy Statement in accordance with the disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board and will not overrule any decision by the Board or require the Board to take any action. In addition, your vote will not create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the part of the Board and will not restrict or limit the ability of our stockholders to make proposals for inclusion in proxy materials related to executive compensation. However, the Compensation Committee values the opinion of our stockholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. 
Vote Required and Board Recommendation 
Approval of the non-binding advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's NEOs requires the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote. A vote to "ABSTAIN" will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" the resolution. Because broker non-votes are not counted as votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" this resolution, they will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL (ON A NON-BINDING 
ADVISORY BASIS) OF THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE 
OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis details NuVasive's executive compensation philosophy and programs, the decisions made by the Compensation Committee (for purposes of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the "Committee") under those programs, and the factors considered in making those decisions for the Company's Named Executive Officers (the "NEOs") in 2018. 
Executive Summary 
In 2018 NuVasive delivered global revenue of $1,101.7 million (an increase of 7.3% compared to 2017) and non-GAAP operating margin of 15.1% (a decrease of 130 basis points compared to 2017). While these results were below the goals we set at the beginning of the year, they were driven by our decision to invest in new products, new infrastructure, and new collaborations that we believe will position the Company for revenue growth and improved profitability in 2019 and beyond. In addition, we executed on our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") succession plans as outlined below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After a comprehensive leadership development and succession planning process, the Board named  Mr. J. Christopher Barry as Chief Executive Officer effective November 5, 2018. As an innovative global executive in the healthcare and medical device industry with a proven track record of successfully leading, growing  and transforming businesses, Mr. Barry is the right leader to take NuVasive into the next phase of growth.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Barry's 2019 target direct compensation of $5,800,000 is 7.8% less than the 2018 target  direct compensation of the Company's prior CEO ($6,287,500).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our 2018 NEO pay was aligned with performance:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     Annual cash incentive awards were earned at an average of 42% of target, primarily due to failure to achieve the  challenging goals established for revenue and non-GAAP operating margin.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     100% of the performance cash awards granted to NEOs in March 2016 will pay out at zero and be forfeited, due to  failure to achieve the challenging goal for non-GAAP operating margin.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ¡     100% of the performance restricted stock units granted to NEOs in March 2016 will pay out at 66% of target, based  on the Company's total stockholder return ("TSR") for the period March 1, 2016 – December 31, 2018 relative to the S&P 500 Index.

The collaboration with Biedermann Technologies, a world-class engineering design firm, allows NuVasive to integrate Biedermann's  proprietary screw innovations into our iGA® platform, helping to advance the development of our next-generation Reline® complex spine  system.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Investing in Infrastructure: During 2018, we launched a boundary model set fulfillment pilot program in Chicago,  Illinois that has decreased courier costs and increased asset utilization in the field. Additionally, our manufacturing facility in West Carrollton, Ohio improved throughput and absorption rates with 70% of our SKUs insourced by the end of 2018, in  line with our target. Our in-sourced manufacturing efforts are expected to help expedite product launches and support increased customer responsiveness and unit cost savings.

Christopher Barry – In determining the new hire compensation package for  Mr. Barry, the Committee recognized the importance of attracting an innovative global executive in the healthcare and medical device industry with a proven track record of successfully leading, growing and transforming businesses. The Committee  also recognized that, to induce a proven leader to leave his or her current employer, new hire compensation packages often involve one-time awards to replace similar awards forfeited at the former employer.  Further, the Committee received advice from its independent compensation consultant to design a competitive, market-based compensation package appropriate for a senior executive with Mr. Barry's skills and experience. The resulting  compensation package reflects a 2019 Target Direct Compensation opportunity approximating the 50th percentile of the Company's peer group, including $4,000,000 of long-term incentive  ("LTI") awards to be granted in March 2019. Additionally, Mr. Barry received one-time cash and LTI awards intended to replace approximately 80% of the value of short- and long-term  awards that Mr. Barry forfeited upon leaving his former employer. Mr. Barry's new hire LTI awards were comprised of $2,000,000 of time-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") and $2,500,000 of performance  restricted stock units ("PRSUs") subject to performance conditions based on annualized non-GAAP Earnings Per Share ("EPS") improvement over the 3-year performance period.

 including our CEO, regularly interact with stockholders throughout the year on several matters, including executive compensation. Through these and other outreach efforts, we can:

At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the advisory vote on the 2017 compensation of our NEOs (the "say-on-pay" vote) received 89.8% approval from our stockholders. Based on our stockholder outreach efforts, we believe this significant support reflects that stockholders are pleased with the core design features of the Company's executive compensation program. Leading up to the Annual Meeting, we communicated with stockholders representing approximately 90% of the shares outstanding and held follow-up conversations with all that expressed interest. 
Aligned with the feedback received from stockholders, the Committee retained the core design features in 2018 and implemented additional enhancements that built upon the Company's executive compensation and governance framework, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  We selected annual non-GAAP operating margin expansion and annual revenue  growth as the performance metrics for the 2018 LTI awards because they are aligned with the Companys operating plan and the financial objectives communicated with stockholders, which focus on above-market revenue growth while driving improved  profitability. We also believe that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value creation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  We removed TSR as a performance metric in the 2018 LTI award design to enhance our focus on operational metrics  directly under managements control and in recognition that the majority of our LTI awards are stock denominated such that TSR will inherently have a significant impact on the value of the final payouts.  
[END TABLE]
These actions demonstrate the Committee's commitment to listening to stockholders' views and taking stockholder feedback into account when reviewing the executive compensation program. In addition, our stockholders expressed satisfaction with the following components of our compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Focus on revenue growth and operating margin expansion as well as the robust target goal setting   
[END TABLE]

  ✓  Use of at least 50% performance-based long-term incentives

Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
Compensation Philosophy. The Company's executive compensation program is designed to promote long-term stockholder value creation and support its long-term strategy by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Profitably growing the business and prudently managing risk, while retaining key talent;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Linking a significant portion of our NEOs' target compensation to performance-based results; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Appropriately aligning compensation with both short- and long-term Company performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
The deep leadership expertise of each NEO makes our NEOs highly valuable to many of our competitors, making their retention a key priority. Because many of our competitors in the spine industry are divisions of much larger companies, there is a highly competitive market for executive talent. In addition, our NEO compensation must motivate strong performance and drive stockholder returns. For these reasons, the Committee believes NEO compensation should be set at competitive levels to retain a valuable team and attract talent, while placing a strong emphasis on successful attainment of Company performance goals.

Primary Elements of the Company's Executive Compensation Program 
The target total compensation opportunity for NEOs is comprised of both fixed (base salary) and variable (annual and long-term incentives) compensation. In addition, each NEO is eligible for benefits that are generally offered to Company employees (our "Shareowners"). 
Base Salary. Base salary for NEOs recognizes the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of each executive. Each year, base salary is evaluated against the peer group, general competitive practices, and an internal assessment of the NEO performance, both individually and relative to other officers. For newly hired executive officers, the Committee considers industry and other competitive hiring factors. The Committee typically reviews base salary once a year and may adjust each NEO's salary to reflect changes of responsibility, performance and competitive conditions. The Committee does not apply specific formulae to determine changes. If adjustments are made, they are typically made effective with the first pay period in March of each year. 
Annual Performance Bonus Plan. NEOs participate in an annual cash bonus plan intended to provide a financial incentive based on the achievement of specifically defined annual performance measures, including both Company-specific measures and individual performance measures. The Committee establishes an individual target bonus opportunity for each NEO expressed as a percentage of base salary. Target bonus percentages are established at the beginning of the fiscal year (or upon hiring for new hires) based on a review of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive market data for both target bonus opportunity and target total cash opportunity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The role of each executive, including ability to impact the Company's overall performance; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee's assessment of internal pay equity among executives.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee may adjust each NEO's target bonus opportunity during the year to reflect promotions or changes in level of responsibility, performance-based factors, and competitive conditions. The Committee evaluates the performance measures and targets under the plan each year to ensure they align with the Company's short-term strategy and its long-term objective of creating sustainable stockholder value.

                      Page 33        
[END TABLE]
Annual Long-Term Incentive Awards (LTI). LTI awards to our NEOs include grants of restricted stock units (RSUs), performance restricted stock units (PRSUs) and performance cash awards. RSUs and PRSUs enable our NEOs to feel invested in our business and to participate in the long-term success of our Company as reflected in stock price appreciation. Furthermore, LTI awards promote retention through vesting tied to an individual's continued employment. 
In determining each NEO's grant of LTI awards, the Committee considers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individual past performance and future potential; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive pay practices.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee evaluates the amount and value of unvested LTI awards held by NEOs to assess the retention value associated with previously granted LTI awards. It is the Committee's aim to provide significant levels of LTI compensation to NEOs as the Committee feels it is important to the Company's long-term growth prospects to incentivize, motivate and retain the Company's executive management team. 
Relationship Between Pay and Performance. The Committee monitors its pay-for-performance commitment by annually testing the alignment between pay and performance. In November 2018, the Committee reviewed the relationship between CEO "realizable pay" (defined below) and Company performance over Fiscal 2017 (1-Year CEO Realizable Pay) and Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2017 (3-Year CEO Realizable Pay), which was the period that both compensation and performance data was readily available for our peer group. The analysis compared our CEO's realizable pay with corporate performance versus those of peer group companies during the respective period. 
For this analysis, realizable pay is defined as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aggregate salary plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aggregate bonuses paid plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Realizable gains" of LTI awards granted in the relevant periods. Such "realizable gains" include in-the-money gains on stock options, the value of full-value shares and/or units (which includes the value of earned performance shares for performance periods that both began  and ended in the relevant periods), and the target value of any performance shares and/or units with yet-to-be concluded performance periods.  
[END TABLE]
The Company believes that realizable pay is a more relevant measure for analyzing pay-for-performance than grant date fair value or target compensation. Realizable pay focuses on the actual value of earned pay rather than pay opportunity by analyzing stock prices as of the most recent fiscal year end and actual payouts from short- and long-term incentives to provide an estimate of the actual compensation that executives realized during the period. 
Performance of each respective company reflects growth in sales, EPS, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and total stockholder return over each performance period, with each metric being weighted equally and then ranked to form an overall performance percentile ranking of the companies. Certain peers were excluded if their complete data was not available.

[END TABLE]
As illustrated in the charts below, NuVasive's pay-for-performance is in the target zone, with the area between the gray lines representing the alignment between pay and performance.  
For Fiscal 2017 (1-Year CEO Realizable Pay), realizable pay for our CEO ranked in the 40th percentile of the peer group used for 2018 compensation benchmarking, and our overall performance ranked in the 20th percentile. For Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2017 (3-Year CEO Realizable Pay), realizable pay for our CEO ranked in the 47th percentile of the peer group used for 2018 compensation benchmarking, and our overall performance ranked in the 33rd percentile. Based on this analysis, the Committee is satisfied with the alignment of realizable pay for our CEO with the performance of the Company during the period reviewed. The Committee expects to continue to periodically review the alignment of pay and performance. 
Process for Determining Named Executive Officer Compensation 
Except for compensation actions for the CEO, which require full Board approval, the Committee is ultimately responsible for decisions relating to compensation for our NEOs. In making its decisions, the Committee considers recommendations from, and discusses decisions with, its independent compensation consultant and the management team. 
Role of the Committee. The Committee has the ultimate responsibility and decision-making authority over all aspects of the executive compensation programs for our NEOs, other than the CEO as described above. The Committee seeks advice from its independent compensation consultant to assist in the assessment of executive pay elements in order to ensure that they are reasonable, aligned with stockholder interests and competitive and meet our key priorities. Additionally, the Committee considers stockholder feedback and recommendations of the CEO referenced below. For a more detailed description of the Committee's duties and responsibilities, please refer to the Committee's Charter, which can be found on the Company's website under the Governance section of the Company's Investor Relations section on www.nuvasive.com. 
Role of Management. The Committee has full access to the management team for assessing and acting on executive compensation matters. The CEO works closely with the management team to develop management's recommendations on the alignment of compensation with business strategy. The CEO does not make recommendations or participate in Committee deliberations on matters regarding his or her own compensation. While the Committee considers input from the CEO and management in making compensation decisions, its decisions may or may not reflect management's recommendations. 
Role of Consultants. The Committee retained an independent compensation consultant, Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), to advise the Committee on executive and non-employee Director compensation practices during 2018. The independent compensation consultant reports directly to the Committee and provides advice on program design, performs data and information analyses, and keeps the Committee apprised of changing trends and regulatory requirements in the executive pay arena. Representatives from FW Cook attended all Committee meetings during 2018. Additionally, the Committee engaged FW Cook to facilitate the CEO's performance assessment for 2017. The Committee believes utilizing an independent consulting firm to facilitate the process is consistent with best practices and will yield an objective, robust CEO evaluation. In 2018, the Committee concluded that the engagement of FW Cook raised no conflict of interest under applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules that would prevent FW Cook from independently providing services to the Committee.

                      Page 35        
[END TABLE]
Competitive Market Data. The Committee considers each element of compensation separately and the total compensation package as a whole to determine whether compensation is consistent with the Committee's compensation policies, is aligned with Company performance, and is competitive. The Committee considers peer group data, as well as published survey data. While the Committee considers this data in setting executive compensation, the Committee does not solely rely upon benchmarking in relation to a specific peer group. The Committee considers multiple factors in making individual pay decisions, allowing the Committee flexibility in determining the overall compensation (as opposed to being locked into a particular data set and/or percentile target). 
Peer Group. The Committee performs an annual assessment of the peer group for compensation benchmarking. In July 2017, the Committee reviewed our 2017 peer group to determine whether the companies included were appropriate for 2018. Criteria included size (based on revenue and market capitalization), industry, peer groups as listed by proxy advisors and available compensation data. No changes were made for 2018, resulting in a peer group of 15 companies, as set forth below (our "2018 Peer Group"): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2018  Peer Group   
 2018  Peer Group   
  Align Technology, Inc.     Illumina, Inc.     ResMed, Inc. 
  CONMED Corporation     Integer Holdings Corp     STERIS Plc 
  Globus Medical, Inc.     Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corp     Stryker Corporation 
  Haemonetics Corporation     Intuitive Surgical, Inc.     Wright Medical Group,  NV

  IDEXX  Laboratories, Inc.       Masimo Corporation       Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc.   
[END TABLE]
The 2018 Peer Group reflects primarily medical device companies with comparable revenue and market capitalization. When the Committee determined the 2018 Peer Group in July 2017, all but four companies (Illumina, Intuitive Surgical, Stryker and Zimmer Biomet) met the peer group size constraints that a well-known proxy advisory firm has established, with revenues between 0.4 to 2.5 times that of NuVasive and market capitalization between 0.25 and 4.0 times that of NuVasive. While Illumina (a local, San Diego headquartered biotechnology company), Intuitive Surgical (a manufacturer of minimally invasive surgical robotics), Stryker (a medical technology company) and Zimmer Biomet (an orthopedic products company) each have revenues and/or market capitalizations more than these size constraints, we compete with these companies for talent. Additionally, we compete directly with the spine divisions of Stryker and Zimmer Biomet, and we often find ourselves in competition with these companies for the recruitment and retention of top talent. As part of the annual peer group review process, the Committee reviewed the peer group again in July 2018 to establish the peer group for 2019 compensation benchmarking, and no changes were made for 2019. 
Additional Published Survey Sources. As noted above, the Committee does not rely upon a stated benchmarking percentile in relation to this specific peer group alone, but rather relies upon varied sources of data and other factors in making individual pay decisions. To supplement market data gathered from publicly disclosed filings of our specific peer group, the Committee also considers market information from the Radford Global Technology published compensation survey, which is reflective of the market in which we compete for talent. The identity of the companies comprising the survey data is not disclosed to, or considered by, the Committee in its decision-making process and the Committee does not consider the identity of the companies comprising the survey data to be material for this purpose. 
Determining Executive Compensation for 2018 
For 2018, the Committee (and the Board, in the case of the CEO) considered market pay-related data and other factors such as Company performance, individual goals and objectives, realizable pay data, and a multi-year look-back of total compensation through tally sheets, including annual cash compensation, LTI awards granted and earned, and benefits and perquisites. 
Executive goals and objectives reflected the Company's operating plan, but also included non-financial metrics and goals the Board believed were critical to the Company's ongoing success. Mr. Lucier reviewed his actual performance with the Board periodically during the year, and at the end 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 of 2017, he participated in a formal performance review process facilitated by the Committee's independent compensation consultant, FW Cook. FW Cook gathered feedback from Board members and CEO direct reports and compiled a report based on that feedback. The final report was reviewed by the Board and discussed with Mr. Lucier in February 2018. The Committee utilized this report, the CEO's self-assessment of his performance, actual financial performance results, as well as peer group and survey data in setting the CEO's 2018 base salary, target annual bonus and annual LTI award. For our remaining NEOs, our CEO prepared and presented to the Committee performance assessments and compensation recommendations, which the Committee considered in determining NEO compensation for 2018. 
2018 Base Salary. The table below sets forth base salary rates for the NEOs as of December 31, 2017 and 2018, and the percentage change:

2018 Annual Performance Bonus. In February 2018, the Committee approved the terms of the 2018 Annual Performance Bonus Plan (the "2018 Bonus Plan") under which our NEOs are eligible to receive a cash bonus (the "2018 NEO Cash Bonuses") based on the achievement of Company and individual performance goals. The Committee established an individual target bonus opportunity for each NEO based on peer group and survey data for similar positions, each executive officer's role, including their ability to impact the Company's overall performance, and internal pay equity among the executive officers. Consistent with the design of the 2017 Performance Bonus Plan, the Committee approved a maximum bonus opportunity under the 2018 Bonus Plan at 200% of target. 
The 2018 Bonus Plan was designed to be performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and comparable provisions of state and local tax codes. While U.S federal tax law reforms adopted in December 2017 repealed the qualified performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m), the Committee decided to maintain the performance-based structure of the 2018 Bonus Plan to maximize its ability to take advantage of applicable deductions under state and local tax codes that have not been conformed to new federal law. The Committee approved an overarching full-year non-GAAP EPS hurdle applicable to NEOs at the beginning of 2018, which had to be satisfied before any payout could be made under the 2018 Bonus Plan, regardless of the achievement of the performance metrics discussed below. As the non-GAAP EPS hurdle was met for 2018, it allowed the Committee (and the Board, in the case of the 2018 bonus payout to Mr. Lucier) to determine actual payouts based on achievement of the financial performance and individual contributions discussed below. 
At the beginning of the year, the Committee approves funding guidelines that include payout scenarios for various levels of Company financial performance. For 2018, the Committee selected revenue and non-GAAP operating margin as the performance metrics for the funding guidelines, each weighted equally, as the Committee believes these performance metrics closely align with both the Company's short-term strategy and its long-term objective of creating sustainable stockholder value (which is consistent with stockholder feedback). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                      Page 37

                      Page 37        
[END TABLE]
The Committee defined these metrics for purposes of the 2018 Bonus Plan as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, calculated from the  year-end financial statements, excluding the effect of currency fluctuations and financial impact of substantial acquisitions and divestitures that close after January 1, 2018 (except for the acquisition  of SafePassage, which closed in January 2018 and was taken into account in establishing the performance goal); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-GAAP operating margin for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018,  calculated from the year-end financial statements (which includes the cost of payouts under the 2018 Bonus Plan), excluding the financial impact of substantial acquisitions and divestitures that close after  January 1, 2018 (except for the acquisition of SafePassage, which closed in January 2018 and was taken into account in establishing the performance goal).  
[END TABLE]
The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure the measurement of performance reflects factors that management can directly control and that payout levels are not artificially inflated or impaired by factors unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business. The Committee feels these definitions appropriately measure core revenue and operating margin performance. 
Demonstration of Rigorous Performance Goal Setting: As shown in the chart below, the Committee set the threshold, target and maximum performance goals for the 2018 Bonus Plan significantly higher than prior year actual results.

In determining annual bonus payments for each NEO, the Committee considers individual and Company performance, as reflected in each executive's leadership, business unit or functional achievements and results against goals and objectives. The evaluation of an executive's performance relative to these considerations is inherently subjective and is not based on any mathematical calculation or formula; rather, it is based on the collective business experience and judgment of the Committee (and the Board, in the case of the CEO) to holistically consider the performance of each executive and his or her contribution to the overall success of the Company. 
In October 2018, the Board approved a payout for Mr. Lucier at 46% of target, based on actual Company performance relative to the revenue and non-GAAP operating margin goals during the period from January 1, 2018 to September 30, 2018 (the complete fiscal quarters in 2018 in which Mr. Lucier was CEO), without the application of an individual performance modifier. 
In February 2019, for the NEOs other than Mr. Lucier, the Committee reviewed the Company's performance relative to the revenue and non-GAAP operating margin goals under the 2018 Bonus Plan for the year ended December 31, 2018. For 2018, the Company achieved revenue of $1,101.7 million and non-GAAP operating margin of 15.1%. Based on the funding guidelines for the 2018 Bonus Plan and actual performance, the formulaic funding level was 42% of target. Given that the formulaic funding level was significantly below target, the Committee elected not to apply individual performance modifiers and approved bonus payouts to the NEOs eligible for a 2018 bonus (other than Mr. Lucier) at 42% of target, as set forth in the table below.

2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards – Annual Grant.  To directly align LTI awards with stockholder value creation while managing our burn rate and dilution, the Committee awarded 2018 LTI awards to NEOs in RSUs (50% of total target award value), PRSUs (25% of total target award value) and performance cash awards (25% of total target award value).

(1)  The LTI grant values represent the economic value on the date of grant, and for performance-based awards, assumes a  payout at target. It does not reflect the accounting value under FASB ASC Topic 718, which may differ. The LTI grant values computed in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 can be found in the Summary Compensation Table. The 2018 RSU and PRSU  awards were made pursuant to the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan of NuVasive, Inc. (the "2014 Equity Incentive Plan").

[END TABLE]
The Committee selected non-GAAP operating margin expansion and revenue growth as the performance metrics for the 2018 LTI awards because they are aligned with the Company's operating plan and the financial objectives communicated to stockholders, which focus on above-market revenue growth while driving improved profitability. The Committee also believes that they are important drivers of long-term stockholder value creation. Attainment of these two independent performance metrics is measured separately for each calendar year during the three-year measurement period, with each year weighted as follows: 2018 (50 percent); 2019 (30 percent); and 2020 (20 percent). 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Awards – New Hires / Promotions 
2018 Long-term Incentive Awards – J. Christopher Barry (New Hire). Mr. Barry joined NuVasive as CEO on November 5, 2018. In addition to the base salary and bonus opportunity described above, the Board granted Mr. Barry new hire LTI awards on November 5, 2018, comprised of RSUs and PRSUs with an aggregate grant date value of $4,500,000. Mr. Barry received a new hire RSU award with a grant date value of $2,000,000 that vests ratably on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date, subject to Mr. Barry's continued service with the Company and compliance with terms of the grant agreement. The Committee chose two-year ratable vesting to match the vesting schedule of awards that Mr. Barry forfeited from his prior employer (and, when combined with the new hire PRSU award, the combined vesting is back-end loaded over 3-years). Mr. Barry also received a new hire PRSU award with an economic value on the date of grant of $2,500,000 that cliff vests on November 5, 2021. Upon vesting, the PRSUs will be subject to payout between 0%—100% of the target number of shares based on year-over-year improvement in the Company's non-GAAP EPS during the three-year performance period, as calculated for the 12-month period ended on September 30 of each year. 
2018 Long-term Incentive Awards – Matthew W. Link (Promotion). In connection with Mr. Link's promotion to President, Strategy, Technology and Corporate Development effective November 5, 2018, Mr. Link was granted an RSU award with grant date value of $1,250,000 that cliff vests on December 3, 2021 subject to Mr. Link's continued service with the Company and compliance with terms of the grant agreement. Mr. Link also received a performance cash award with a target value of $1,250,000 that cliff vests on June 3, 2021. Upon vesting, the performance cash award will be subject to payout between 0%—100% of the target value based on achievement of operational goals during the eighteen-month performance period. When Mr. Link assumed the role of President in January 2019, he did not receive any additional LTI awards.

Vesting of 2016 Long-Term Incentive Awards 
In 2016, as part of the annual LTI award to NEOs, each of Messrs. Lucier, Link and Rozow and Dr. Leddy was granted a PRSU award with a performance condition based on the Company's three-year TSR relative to the S&P 500 Index and a performance cash award with a performance condition based on the Company's 2018 non-GAAP operating margin. The table below sets forth the performance goals and payout levels at threshold, target, and maximum.

(1)  Achievements between threshold and maximum are based on a linear interpolation between points along the funding curve.   
[END TABLE]
As the Company's TSR from March 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018 resulted in achieving the 43.2 percentile of the S&P 500 Index, the PRSUs funded at 66% of target. For each of Messrs. Lucier, Link and Rozow and Dr. Leddy, these PRSU awards vested on March 1, 2019. As the Company achieved non-GAAP operating margin for 2018 below the minimum performance threshold, the performance cash awards paid out at zero and were forfeited. 
Responsible Share Usage 
As illustrated in the chart below, the Company's annual share usage rate has remained below 2% since stockholders approved the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan.

(1)  Share Usage Rate is defined as the ratio of the target number of shares subject to equity awards granted in the  calendar year (i.e., the number of shares that would be issued at target level for performance-based equity incentives) to the weighted average shares outstanding (basic) at the end of such year.

Other Elements of the Executive Compensation Program 
Perquisites and Other Benefits. Our NEOs participate in our benefit plans on the same terms as our other Shareowners, which include the Company's 401(k) plan and medical and dental insurance. In addition to these benefits, executives may be provided with certain other incidental benefits (including participation in an executive healthcare program and financial planning benefit) that do not comprise a material portion of any executive's compensation package. We generally do not provide significant recurring perquisites to the executives that are not available to our other Shareowners. We do not provide tax gross-ups to our executives for perquisites or if excise taxes are incurred following a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control. 
We do not provide defined benefit pension arrangements or post-retirement health coverage for our U.S. executives or Shareowners. Our NEOs are eligible to participate in our 401(k) defined contribution plan. We do provide a company matching contribution up to 3.0% of compensation for all Shareowners, including our NEOs, to help attract and retain top talent as well as support our Shareowners' retirement readiness. We also offer participation in a Deferred Compensation Plan, which is a non-qualified defined contribution plan that provides for the voluntary deferral of cash compensation for individuals holding a position of Vice President or higher, as well as non-employee members of the Board. Eligible employees may defer up to 75% of base salary and/or up to 100% of their annual bonus into the plan, and contributions may be directed into a selection of underlying investment funds. Non-employee members of the Board may defer all or a portion of their cash retainer into the plan. None of our NEOs elected to participate in our Deferred Compensation Plan for 2018. 
Historically, our NEOs have participated in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which is available to all our Shareowners, pursuant to which they may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount to

 market prices (but within limits of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code). Additionally, our executive travel and expense policy sets forth guidelines for our NEOs with respect to reimbursable expenses and generally requires: (i) a business purpose for business meals reimbursed by the Company, and (ii) that personal aspects of business travel (other than incidental meals and other expenses) be paid by the executive. 
Attributed costs of the personal benefits described above for the NEOs for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, if required to be disclosed, are included in the column captioned "All Other Compensation" of the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Equity Grant Practices. The Company's practice is to grant annual equity awards to eligible Shareowners, including our NEOs, during the first quarter of the year. In the event of grants related to new hires or other off-cycle awards, the grants are generally made on the first trading day of the month following approval of the award. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. All of our non-employee Directors, our CEO, and individuals holding a position of Vice President or higher are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which form a part of our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The table below sets forth the 2018 stock ownership guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
As Messrs. Barry and Asarpota joined NuVasive in 2018 and 2017, respectively, they have several years to achieve their stock ownership targets. Mr. Link achieved his stock ownership target within five years of becoming eligible in accordance with the stock ownership guidelines. 
Holding Periods on Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) Purchases. Shares purchased through the ESPP by NEOs must be held for a minimum of six months. This policy applies to all ESPP purchases made after November 1, 2014 and is in addition to the share ownership guidelines described above. 
Clawback Policy. The Board has adopted the NuVasive Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, under which our Board has authority to recover excess executive officer incentive compensation cash and equity awards in the event of a material restatement of our financial statements. We believe that our strong financial controls provide a substantial safeguard against the risk of a financial restatement. However, if an extraordinary event were to occur and require a material restatement of the Company's financial performance, the Committee is authorized to seek recovery of executive officer compensation achieved based upon any misstated financial information. 
Trading Controls and Hedging, Short Sale and Pledging Policies. Executive officers, including our NEOs, are required to pre-clear transactions in Company securities with the Company's legal department. Generally, trading is permitted only during scheduled trading windows. Our NEOs may enter into a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These trading plans may be entered into only during an open trading window, must be approved by the Company's legal department and must include a waiting period prior to commencement of trading under the plan. The NEO bears the full responsibility if he or she violates the Company policy by permitting shares to be bought or sold without pre-clearance or when trading is restricted.

In addition, the Company prohibits its Directors, officers and other Shareowners from (i) purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of equity securities, or (ii) otherwise engage in transactions that are designed to or have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the market value of equity securities that are granted to a Shareowner or Director as compensation (or any designee of such Shareowner or Director) or held, directly or indirectly by, a Shareowner or Director. Further, the Company prohibits its Directors, officers and other Shareowners from pledging Company securities as collateral for margin loans. 
Annual Risk Assessment. The Committee oversees an annual risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs to determine whether such programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. For 2018, the Committee concluded that compensation programs were appropriately balanced to mitigate compensation-related risk with cash and stock elements, financial and non-financial goals, formal goals and discretion, and short-term and long-term rewards. The Company also has policies to mitigate compensation-related risk, including stock ownership guidelines, clawback provisions and prohibitions on employee pledging and hedging activities. Furthermore, the Committee believes the Company's policies on ethics and compliance along with its internal controls also mitigate against unnecessary or excessive risk taking. 
Employment Letters 
CEO Letter Agreement (J. Christopher Barry). On October 16, 2018, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the "Barry Agreement") with Mr. Barry to serve as the Company's CEO. The Barry Agreement set out certain terms of Mr. Barry's new hire employment package, including an initial annual base salary of $800,000 and a bonus target opportunity for 2019 equal to 125% of base salary. The Barry Agreement also provides for eligibility for 2019 LTI awards with an aggregate grant date value of $4,000,000. In addition, the Barry Agreement provides for a one-time cash award of $500,000 payable in April 2019 and a one-time new hire LTI award with an aggregate grant date value of $4,500,000, both of which are intended to replace a portion of the value of short- and long-term incentive awards that Mr. Barry forfeited upon leaving his former employer to join the Company. The one-time new hire LTI award was granted on November 5, 2018 and was comprised of (i) $2,000,000 of RSUs subject to two-year ratable vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant and (ii) $2,500,000 of PRSUs subject to cliff vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant. Upon vesting, the PRSUs will be subject to payout between 0%-100% of the target number of shares subject thereto based on the level of year-over-year improvement in the Company's non-GAAP EPS during the three-year performance period, as calculated for the 12-month period ended on September 30 of each year. Vesting of the PRSUs and RSUs will be subject to Mr. Barry's continued service with the Company and compliance with the terms of the grant agreements and the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan. The Barry Agreement also provides for standard relocation benefits, severance benefits, health and welfare benefits, and other benefits afforded to the Company's employees and executives. The cash award and relocation benefits are subject to a benefits repayment obligation in the event of Mr. Barry's voluntary termination other than for "good reason" or termination by the Company for "cause" prior to November 5, 2020. If such a termination event occurs during the first 12 months of employment, Mr. Barry will be obligated to repay 100% of such benefits, and if such a termination event occurs during the second 12 months of employment, Mr. Barry will be obligated to repay 50% of such benefits. The foregoing information is a summary of select terms from agreements entered into with Mr. Barry, is not complete, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent text of the pertinent agreements, copies of which have been filed with the SEC in Current Reports on Form 8-K or an exhibit to the respective Quarterly Filing on Form 10-Q, as appropriate. 
CEO Letter Agreement (Gregory T. Lucier). On May 22, 2015, the Company entered into a Letter Agreement (the "Lucier Agreement") with Mr. Lucier to serve as the Company's CEO and Chairman of the Board. On October 16, 2018, in connection with the hiring of Mr. Barry to succeed Mr. Lucier as CEO, the Company and Mr. Lucier entered into an amendment of the Lucier Agreement (the "Lucier Amendment"), as discussed further below. The Lucier Agreement set out certain terms of Mr. Lucier's employment package, including the grant of LTI awards to Mr. Lucier that the Board structured in a manner to be highly tied to the Company achieving specific financial and operational targets, including

                      Page 43        
[END TABLE]
 TSR performance, specific stock price hurdles, revenue growth, and growth in non-GAAP operating margins. The Lucier Agreement provided for annual 2015 LTI awards with a target economic grant value of $5,000,000, as well as a PRSU with a target economic grant value of $7,000,000 that will vest only if certain TSR performance is achieved relative to the S&P 500 Index over the four-year performance period beginning May 1, 2015 and ending April 30, 2019. If the Company's TSR performance relative to the S&P 500 Index is between the 35th percentile and the 100th percentile, these awards will cliff vest on May 22, 2019, ranging between 25%-200% of the target amount of PRSUs. Mr. Lucier was also granted a PRSU award that provided for a 1:1 share match, based on the number of shares purchased by Mr. Lucier and held through the five-year performance period. Mr. Lucier purchased 112,491 shares of Company common stock for an aggregate of approximately $5,000,000 (the "Purchased Shares") for purposes of the matching PRSU award. The PRSUs were granted based on a target number of shares (112,491 shares) and will only vest if (i) the Company's per share stock price achieves certain share price hurdles that range from $70—$100 per share at the end of the five-year performance period ending May 22, 2020 and (ii) Mr. Lucier holds such Purchased Shares for the duration of the five-year period. Achievement of a Company stock price of $100 per share or greater will result in Mr. Lucier receiving shares equal to 200% of the target amount of PRSUs. Conversely, Mr. Lucier would not receive any shares if the Company's stock price is below $70 per share. These matching PRSUs will be forfeited if Mr. Lucier sells, or otherwise disposes of the Purchased Shares prior to May 22, 2020. The Lucier Agreement provides these awards, and all future LTI awards granted to Mr. Lucier, shall be subject to accelerated vesting based on service and performance achieved if Mr. Lucier's employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, and for full accelerated vesting at target in the event of death or disability. 
On October 15, 2018, the Board approved the continued service of Mr. Lucier as the Chairman of the Board and the engagement of Mr. Lucier as a consultant to assist with the transition of his responsibilities to Mr. Barry. The Lucier Amendment provided for Mr. Lucier's continued service as an employee of the Company in a strategic advisory role during the period November 5, 2018 through December 1, 2018, after which he will serve as a consultant. From and after December 1, 2018, Mr. Lucier is considered a non-employee Director and accordingly, is eligible for the Company's non-employee Director compensation package. Mr. Lucier will not receive a separate retainer for performance of his duties as Chairman of the Board. Pursuant to the Lucier Amendment, Mr. Lucier received a pro-rated bonus for the 2018 performance year in the amount of $553,438, to be paid at such time that annual bonuses were paid to other senior executives for the 2018 performance year. The Lucier Amendment also specifies that Mr. Lucier's service as a consultant (as well as his service as a Director) will be recognized and credited as continued service under the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, such that Mr. Lucier's outstanding LTI awards will remain outstanding and continue to vest in accordance with their terms, as described above. If Mr. Lucier's service as a Director terminates because he is not nominated for re-election, he stands for re-election but is not re-elected, or he is removed as a Director other than for cause relating solely to his service as a Director, such termination of service will be treated as an involuntary termination without cause, and any LTI awards that are not then vested will be subject to pro-rata vesting, in accordance with the terms of Mr. Lucier's existing employment letter and the applicable award agreements. From and after December 1, 2018, Mr. Lucier is not eligible for severance benefits, and is not treated as an employee for purposes of any health and welfare benefits, and other benefits afforded to the Company's employees and executives. 
Letter Agreement (Matthew W. Link). On October 17, 2018, the Company entered into a letter agreement (the "Link Agreement") with Mr. Link to serve as the Company's President, Strategy, Technology and Corporate Development. The Link Agreement provides that Mr. Link's base salary will continue to be $500,000 per year and that Mr. Link will continue to be eligible to participate in the Company's annual bonus plan with a target bonus opportunity of 90% of base salary. Mr. Link received a one-time LTI award, granted on December 3, 2018, with an aggregate grant date value of $2,500,000, comprised of (i) $1,250,000 of time-based RSUs subject to cliff vesting on the third anniversary of the date of grant, and (ii) $1,250,000 of performance cash awards subject to cliff vesting on the 18-month anniversary of the date of grant. Upon vesting, the performance cash awards will be subject to payout between 0%-100% of target based on the level of achievement of performance conditions related to certain operational goals. Vesting of the RSUs and performance cash awards will be subject to Mr. Link's

 continued service with the Company and compliance with the terms of the grant agreements and the Company's 2014 Equity Incentive Plan and 2014 Executive Incentive Plan, respectively. Mr. Link will continue to be eligible for grants of LTI awards and other Company benefits. The Link Agreement was not amended when Mr. Link assumed the role of President in January 2019.

NuVasive, Inc. Executive Severance Plan 
The Company maintains the NuVasive, Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan"), which is designed to cover the CEO and all of the Company's other NEOs (as well as certain other executives as designated by the Committee). The Executive Severance Plan provides certain severance benefits upon an involuntary termination of employment by the Company that is not for cause (as defined in the Executive Severance Plan). Executive Severance Plan benefits are not provided in the event of termination of employment due to retirement, death or disability. Furthermore, no benefits are provided under the Executive Severance Plan in any situation in which the executive is provided with severance benefits under any change in control agreement in connection with such a transaction. As discussed above, Dr. Leddy, Mr. Rozow and Ms. Stafslien each entered into agreements providing for benefits under the Executive Severance Plan in connection with their departures from the Company in 2018. 
Pursuant to the Executive Severance Plan, benefits for plan-participating executives other than our CEO consist of customary outplacement assistance and a cash payment equal to the sum of (i) the executive's annual base salary and (ii) the after-tax cost of health benefits for a period of one year from the date of termination of employment. Severance benefits also include a pro-rata annual bonus payment for the year in which termination of employment occurs (based on service from the beginning of the year until the date of termination of employment) based on the lesser of his/her annual incentive bonus target for the year in which the termination of employment occurs or actual performance for the relevant performance period. The Executive Severance Plan provides benefits specific to the CEO that include customary outplacement assistance and a cash severance payment equal to the sum of: (i) two times the sum of his/her annual base salary and annual target incentive bonus in effect for the calendar year in which the termination of employment occurs and (ii) the after-tax cost of health benefits for a period of two years from the date of termination of employment. Severance benefits also include a pro rata annual bonus payment for the year in which termination of employment occurs (based on service from the beginning of the year until the date of termination of employment) based on actual performance for the relevant performance period. All severance benefits under the Executive Severance Plan are conditioned upon the executive providing an effective release of claims against the Company.

[END TABLE]
The specific amounts of compensation payable to each NEO upon the occurrence of different potential employment termination events are shown in the tables below under the caption "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Change in Control Arrangements 
We believe that severance protection for our executives following a change in control provides several important benefits to us: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• It permits an executive to evaluate a potential change in control while relatively free of concern for the  executive's own situation or the need to seek employment elsewhere;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in control transactions take time to unfold, and a stable management team can help preserve our operations either  to enhance the value delivered to a buyer in the transaction or, if no transaction is consummated, to ensure that our business will continue without undue disruption; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in control protections encourage management to consider, on an ongoing basis, whether a strategic transaction  might be advantageous to our stockholders, even one that would vest control of the Company in a third party.  
[END TABLE]
On May 13, 2014, the Committee approved and adopted a form of change in control agreement (the "Change in Control Agreement"), which was designed to cover the Company's CEO and the Company's other NEOs (as well as certain other executives as designated by the Committee). 
The Change in Control Agreement requires a "double-trigger" for the NEO to be eligible for benefits under the agreement. First, there must be a change in control of the Company (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement). Second, the executive's employment must be involuntarily terminated by the Company for reasons other than death, disability or cause (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) or by the executive for good reason (as defined in the Change in Control Agreement) either in contemplation of the change in control or within a period of 24 months following the change in control. The benefits for the NEOs under the Change in Control Agreement consist of (i) a lump-sum cash severance payment equal to the sum of (A) two times the sum of the executive's annual base salary plus the greater of the executive's target annual bonus for the year of termination or the highest of the three annual bonuses paid to the executive prior to the termination of employment; (B) a pro rata portion (based on the number of full and partial months in the calendar year prior to the executive's termination date but not exceeding six months' worth) of the highest grant date fair value of the long-term cash and/or equity awards granted to the executive over the three calendar year period prior to the calendar year of the termination of employment; (C) the after-tax cost of continued participation in the Company's benefit plans for a period of 24 months; and (D) a pro rata portion (based on the number of full and partial months in the calendar year prior to the executive's termination date) of the greater of the executive's target annual bonus for the year of termination or the highest of the three annual bonuses paid to the executive prior to the termination of employment; (ii) full vesting of all Company equity and long-term incentive awards granted to the executive to the extent vesting is based on service with the Company; and (iii) the right to exercise all outstanding stock options or stock appreciation rights until the later of 24 months following the executive officer's separation from service or such later date as may be applicable under the terms of the award agreement, but by no later than the end of the maximum full term of the award; provided, however, that, if any stock option or stock appreciation right is cashed-out in connection with a change in control, the executive officer will receive a lump-sum cash payment equal to the time value of the right to exercise those awards for that period (based on the Black Scholes option pricing model). 
The specific amounts of compensation, if any, payable to each applicable NEO upon a qualifying termination in connection with a change in control are shown in the tables below under the caption "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Effect of Tax and Accounting Considerations on Compensation Design 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"), historically limited the deductibility by the Company of compensation paid to certain executive officers that did not 
[BEGIN TABLE]
                      Page 47        
                      Page 47        
                      Page 47        
[END TABLE]
 qualify as "performance-based" to more than $1,000,000 paid in any one year. While U.S federal tax law reforms adopted in December 2017 repealed the qualified performance-based compensation exception to the Section 162(m) deduction limit, the Committee decided to maintain the performance-based structure of the 2018 Bonus Plan to maximize its ability to take advantage of applicable deductions under Section 162(m) and comparable provisions of state and local tax codes that have not been conformed to new federal law. While the Committee considers the deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Committee also looks at other factors in making its decisions, as noted above, and retains the flexibility to award compensation that it determines to be consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program even if the awards are not deductible by NuVasive for tax purposes. 
Because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) (or comparable provisions of state and local tax codes) in fact will. Further, the Committee reserves the right to modify compensation that was initially intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) and comparable provisions of state and local tax codes if it determines that such modifications are consistent with NuVasive's business needs. 
As a result of the U.S federal tax law reforms adopted in December 2017, the exemption from the Section 162(m) deduction limit for performance-based compensation has been repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on these reviews and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K or the annual meeting Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A.

(2)  Stock awards consist of restricted stock units ("RSUs") and performance restricted stock units  ("PRSUs"), as further described in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. Represents the grant date valuation of the awards computed in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 718 rather than an amount paid to or realized by the  NEO. The value of PRSUs is based on the target number of shares subject to the award. If the highest level of performance conditions are achieved, the value based on the maximum number of shares for each NEO is as follows: Mr. Barry –  $2,500,048, Mr. Lucier – $2,050,075, Mr. Asarpota – $600,102, Mr. Link – $600,102, Dr. Leddy – $600,102, Mr. Rozow – $375,024, Mr. Kiil – $600,102, and Ms. Stafslien – $600,102.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Under rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to disclose the ratio of CEO compensation to the compensation of their "median employee". For the 2018 fiscal year, the total compensation for our CEO, Mr. Barry, was $5,116,273 as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table (the "SCT") on page 49. Since Mr. Barry was hired on November 5, 2018, we annualized his total compensation to arrive at a value of $5,825,610 used for the CEO Pay Ratio calculation as follows:

   All  Other Compensation  $23,880  $25,524  Not annualized: $23,814 in taxable relocation benefits since they are not  recurring in  nature  Annualized: $66 in other taxable benefits that are recurring  in nature 
[END TABLE]
As permitted by SEC rules, we identified our median employee using "annualized cash compensation," which includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annualized base pay (which was calculated for both hourly or salaried employee based on the employee's standard  annual work hours, determined as of our December 31, 2018 determination date),  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annualized target cash incentives (excluding commissions), and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• actual commissions earned in 2018.  
[END TABLE]
As we do not employ a material seasonal workforce only employees employed on the determination date are used to determine the median employee. Additionally, for annualized base pay and annualized target cash incentives, only the values in effect as of the determination date are utilized to determine the median employee. We do not believe this assumption has a material impact on the median employee identified or the resulting CEO pay ratio. For all compensation paid in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, all values were converted to the U.S. Dollar using foreign currency exchange rates on December 31, 2018. 
After identifying our median employee, we then calculated compensation for such median employee using the same methodology used to calculate compensation for our NEOs in the SCT. On the SCT basis, the annual total compensation for the median employee for the 2018 fiscal year was $73,242. The median employee identified did not receive any stock-based compensation during the 2018 fiscal year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The CEO's annual total compensation for 2018, calculated as discussed above, was $5,825,610.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The resulting ratio of CEO pay to NuVasive's median employee pay is 80:1.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following tables reflect estimates of the amounts which would be paid out to our NEOs upon an applicable termination event (with different scenarios outlined on a column-by-column basis). The actual amounts to be paid out can only be determined at the time of such executive's separation from the Company. For purposes of the tables below, an effective date of December 31, 2018 was used and the target award amount was used for performance-based awards with performance periods not yet completed. For our NEOs for whom an applicable termination event has occurred, we have used actual amounts to be paid out following such termination event.

(2)  Ms. Stafslien entered into a General Consulting and Services Agreement effective as of June 28, 2018,  pursuant to which she agreed to provide consulting services to the Company through October 28, 2019. In accordance with the terms of the agreement and the terms of her LTI awards, Ms. Stafslien's outstanding LTI awards shall continue  to vest during the consulting term. These LTI awards are subject to accelerated vesting and payment in connection with a change in control of the Company. A change in control of the Company with an effective date of December 31, 2018, assuming  performance-based awards are paid out at target, would have resulted in the acceleration of vesting and payment of RSU, PRSU and performance cash awards with an aggregate value of $2,402,002 (based on a Company stock price of $49.56 per share, the  closing price on December 31, 2018).

Director Compensation 
NuVasive's Director compensation program for non-employee Directors includes cash retainers (paid quarterly) and an annual equity award. 
Cash Retainers.    The following table sets forth the cash retainers payable to our Directors in 2018 and 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Member Retainer      $70,000

   Audit Committee Chairperson*      $20,000   
   Compensation Committee  Chairperson*      $20,000

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Non-employee members of the Board may defer all or a portion of their cash retainer into NuVasive's Deferred Compensation Plan, a non-qualified defined contribution plan. 
Equity Awards.    The Director compensation program includes an annual RSU award (with one-year cliff vesting), which is designed to align with each year of service on the Board. For continuing non-employee Directors, the annual RSU award is granted on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. For newly-elected non-employee Directors, the annual RSU award is granted upon election

[END TABLE]
 to the Board, with a grant value pro-rated based on length of service prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders. In each case, the annual RSU award will vest on the earlier of the one-year anniversary of the grant date and the next annual meeting of stockholders. Effective November 8, 2017, there is no other inducement / initial RSU award other than the pro-rata annual RSU award. The following table sets forth the annual RSU award values for our Directors in 2018 and 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board Member Annual RSU Grant Value*        $160,000    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  The number of RSUs awarded is determined by dividing the RSU grant value by the closing stock price on the date of  grant.  
[END TABLE]
All RSU awards granted to Directors are settled upon the earlier of (i) the Director's separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A (as defined in the equity plan governing the RSU), or (ii) immediately prior to the consummation of a change in ownership or effective control of the Company or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets of the Company within the meaning of Section 409A; provided, however, that, the Directors have the option to make a deferral election for settlement of each RSU award on an earlier, specified date (no sooner than the vesting date). 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which includes the stock ownership guidelines, our non-employee Directors are required to hold a number of shares of the Company's common stock with a value equal to five times the annual cash retainer for Board service paid to non-employee Directors. Each non-employee Director is required to achieve this ownership guideline within five years of becoming a non-employee Director.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Stockholders Sharing the Same Address 
We have adopted "householding," a procedure approved by the SEC under which NuVasive stockholders who share an address will receive a single copy of the 2018 Annual Report, Proxy Statement or Notice, as applicable, or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This procedure reduces printing costs and mailing fees, while also reducing the environmental impact of the distribution. If you reside at the same address as another NuVasive stockholder and wish to receive a separate copy of the applicable materials, you may do so by contacting the bank, broker or other holder of record, or the Company by telephone at: (858) 909-1800 or by mail at 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121. 
Some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, please notify your broker directly. You may also call (800) 542-1061 or write to: Householding Department, Broadridge, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717, and include your name, the name of your broker or other nominee, and your account number(s). Any stockholders who share the same address and currently receive multiple copies of the Annual Report, Proxy Statement or Notice, as applicable, who wish to receive only one copy in the future may contact their bank, broker, or other holder of record, or the Company by telephone at: (858) 909-1800 or by mail at 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121.

Advance Notice for Proposals for Business to be Discussed at the 2020 Annual Meeting 
The Company's Bylaws state the procedures for a stockholder to bring a stockholder proposal or nominate an individual to serve as a Director of the Board. The Company's Bylaws provide that advance notice of a stockholder's proposal or nomination of an individual to serve as a Director must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices not earlier than the 120th day prior to the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders (i.e., January 10, 2020), nor later than the close of business on the 90th day prior to the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders (i.e., February 9, 2020). However, the Bylaws also provide that, in the event that no annual meeting was held in the previous year or the date of the annual meeting is changed by more than 30 days from the previous year's annual meeting as specified in the Company's notice of meeting, this advance notice must be given not earlier than the 120th day, nor later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day, prior to the date of such annual meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of such annual meeting, the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting is first made by the Company. In addition to meeting the advance notice provisions mentioned above, the stockholder in its notice must provide the information required by our Bylaws to bring a stockholder proposal or nominate an individual to serve as a Director of the Board. 
A copy of our Bylaws may be obtained by written request to the Corporate Secretary at 7475 Lusk Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92121. 
TRANSACTION OF OTHER BUSINESS 
At the date of this Proxy Statement, the only business the Board intends to present or knows that others will present at the Annual Meeting is as set forth above.

APPENDIX 
This Proxy Statement includes information regarding our non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS), which are performance metrics in our executive compensation program. These non-GAAP financial measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP and exclude amortization of intangible assets, business transition costs, purchased in-process research and development, one-time restructuring and related items in connection with acquisitions, investments and divestitures, non-recurring consulting fees, certain litigation expenses and settlements, certain European medical device regulation costs, gains and losses from strategic investments, and non-cash interest expense (excluding debt issuance cost). In this Proxy Statement, financial information is also presented that excludes the impact of foreign exchange currency fluctuations. The measure constant currency utilizes an exchange rate that eliminates fluctuations when calculating financial performance numbers. We believe the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides meaningful information regarding our operating performance for the reasons discussed in the Proxy Statement. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Set forth below are reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measure.
