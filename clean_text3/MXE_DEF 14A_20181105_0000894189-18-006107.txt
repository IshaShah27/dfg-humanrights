PROXY STATEMENT
FOR
ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 13, 2018
_______________________________
PROXY STATEMENT
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of The Mexico Equity and Income Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on December 13, 2018 at 9:00 AM, Central time, at the offices of U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, 777 East Wisconsin Avenue, 4th Floor, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, and at any and all adjournments or postponements thereof.  A form of proxy for each of the holders of shares of the Fund's common stock (the "Stockholders") is enclosed herewith.  This Proxy Statement and accompanying forms of proxy are being first mailed to Stockholders on or about November 5, 2018.
The presence, in person or by proxy, of Stockholders entitled to cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting (i.e., the presence of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Fund on the record date, October 18, 2018) is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve any of the proposals are not received, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting, or the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to a date not more than one hundred twenty (120) days after the original record date to permit further solicitation of proxies.  Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy.  A Stockholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if sufficient votes have been received and it is otherwise appropriate.  The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies that they are entitled to vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" any such proposal in their discretion.
Stockholders can vote by Internet by going to the following website address, www.proxyvote.com; by telephone, using the toll-free number listed on the proxy card; or by mail by completing the proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided.  If the enclosed proxy is executed and returned, or an internet or telephonic vote is delivered, that vote may nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written notification received by the Fund, by the execution of a later-dated proxy, by the Fund's receipt of a subsequent valid internet or telephonic vote, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.  To be effective, such revocation must be received by the Fund prior to the Meeting and must indicate the Stockholder's name and account number.  Unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the specifications therein and, unless specified to the contrary, will be voted "FOR" the election of the nominees for Class II Directors. 
In general, abstentions and broker non-votes (reflected by signed but unvoted proxies as to one or more proposals), as defined below, count for purposes of obtaining a quorum but do not count as votes cast with respect to any proposal where the broker does not have discretion.  With respect to a proposal requiring the affirmative vote of a majority of the Fund's outstanding shares of common stock, the effect of abstentions and broker non-votes is the same as a vote against such proposal.  Otherwise, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on a proposal requiring a majority of votes cast for approval (i.e., Proposal 1).  Broker non-votes occur when shares, held in the name of the broker or nominees for whom an executed proxy is received by the Fund, are not voted on a proposal because voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or persons entitled to vote and the broker or nominee does not have discretionary voting power.  Only holders of issued and outstanding shares of the Fund's common stock of record on the close of business on October 18, 2018 are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting.  Each such holder is entitled to one vote per share of common stock so held.  On October 18, 2018, there were 6,895,464 shares of the Fund's common stock issued and outstanding.  The Fund is a closed-end, management investment company.
A copy of the Fund's most recent annual report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 and semi-annual report for the period ended January 31, 2018 may be obtained by visiting the Fund's website at www.mxefund.com or may be ordered free of charge by any Stockholder by writing to the Fund c/o U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, 615 East Michigan Street, 4th Floor, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53202, or by telephone at (877) 785-0376.  These reports are also available on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") website at www.sec.gov.  The Fund's most recent annual report was mailed to Stockholders on or about October 1, 2018.
Required Vote for Adoption of Proposals.
Proposal 1 (to elect two Class II Directors to the Fund's Board of Directors) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast at the Meeting by the holders of the Fund's common stock voting in person or by proxy on such Proposal, provided a quorum is present. A "majority of the votes" cast means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a Director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that Director's election. For purposes of the election of Directors, (i) votes cast shall include direction to withhold authority and (ii) abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for quorum purposes, but otherwise will have no effect on the majority vote required for such Director.     
PROPOSAL 1:  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Fund's Articles of Incorporation, the terms of the Fund's Board of Directors are staggered.  The Board of Directors is divided into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III, each class having a term of three years.  Each year the term of office of one Class expires.  The effect of these staggered terms is to limit the ability of other entities or persons to acquire control of the Fund by delaying the replacement of a majority of the Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors has nominated Richard Abraham and Rajeev Das to be elected by the holders of the Fund's common stock to serve as Class II Directors of the Fund.  Each of Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das currently serves on the Board of Directors.
In the event that one or all of the nominees becomes unavailable for election for any presently unforeseen reason, the persons named in the form of proxy will vote for any successor nominee who shall be designated by the present Board of Directors.  Each Class II Director shall be elected by a majority of the shares voting at the Meeting.
At the Meeting, the holders of the Fund's common stock will be asked to vote for the election of Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das as Class II Directors.  If elected, Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das will each serve until the year the Fund's annual meeting of Stockholders in 2021 or until each of their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  If elected, Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das have each consented to serve as Director of the Fund until his successor is duly elected and qualified.
   The persons named in the accompanying forms of proxy intend to vote at the Meeting (unless directed not to vote) "FOR" the election of Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das.  The nominees named above have indicated that they will serve if elected, and the Board of Directors has no reason to believe that the nominees will become unavailable for election as Directors; however, if Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das should be unable to serve, the proxy will be voted for any other persons determined by the persons named in the accompanying forms of proxy in accordance with their judgment.
Required Vote.  Mr. Abraham and Mr. Das must be elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of shares of the Fund's common stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Meeting, provided a quorum is present.  A "majority of the votes" cast means that the number of shares voted "FOR" a Director's election exceeds 50% of the number of votes cast with respect to that Director's election. For purposes of the election of Directors, (i) votes cast shall include direction to withhold authority and (ii) abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as shares present for quorum purposes, but otherwise will have no effect on the majority vote required for such Director.

 Specific details regarding each Director's principal occupations during the past five years are included in the table above.  The summaries set forth above as to the experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills of the Directors do not constitute holding out the Board or any Director as having any special expertise or experience, and do not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board as a whole than would otherwise be the case.
Board Leadership Structure, Composition and Responsibilities.  The Board is responsible for overseeing the management of the Fund.  The Board also elects the Company's officers who conduct the daily business of the Fund.  The Board meets at least four times during the year to review the investment performance of the Fund and other operational matters, including policies and procedures with respect to compliance with regulatory and other requirements.  The Directors interact directly with the Chairman of the Board, each other as Directors and committee members, the Fund's officers, and senior management of the Adviser and other service providers of the Fund at scheduled meetings and between meetings, as appropriate.  Each Director was appointed to serve on the Board because of his experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills as described above.
Currently, the Board is comprised of five individuals, one of whom, Mr. Hellerman, is considered "interested person" of the Fund within the meaning of the 1940 Act.  The Chairman of the Board, Mr. Goldstein, is an Independent Director. 
The Board believes that its structure facilitates the orderly and efficient flow of information to the Directors from the Adviser and other service providers with respect to services provided to the Fund, potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships and other risks that the Fund may face.  The Board further believes that its structure allows all of the Directors to participate in the full range of the Board's oversight responsibilities.  The Board believes that the orderly and efficient flow of information and the ability to bring each Director's talents to bear in overseeing the Fund's operations is important, in light of the size and complexity of the Fund and the risks that the Fund faces.  Based on each Director's experience and expertise with closed-end funds the Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate and efficient. The Board and its committees review their structures regularly, to help ensure that they remain appropriate as the business and operations of the Fund, and the environment in which the Fund operates, changes. 
Currently, the Board has an Audit Committee, Nominating Committee and Valuation Committee.  The responsibilities of each committee and its members are described below.
Board's Role in Risk Oversight of the Fund.  The Board oversees risk management for the Fund directly and, as to certain matters, through its committees.  The Board exercises its oversight in this regard primarily through requesting and receiving reports from and otherwise working with the Fund's senior officers (including the Fund's President, Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer), portfolio management and other personnel of the Adviser, the Fund's independent auditors, legal counsel and personnel from the Fund's other service providers.  The Board has adopted, on behalf of the Fund, and periodically reviews with the assistance of the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, policies and procedures designed to address certain risks associated with the Fund's activities. In addition, the Adviser and the Fund's other service providers also have adopted policies, processes and procedures designed to identify, assess and manage certain risks associated with the Fund's activities, and the Board receives reports from service providers with respect to the operation of these policies, processes and procedures as required and/or as the Board deems appropriate.   
Compensation of Directors.  For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Fund paid each of its Directors who is not a director, officer or employee of the Adviser, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC, the administrator to the Fund (the "Administrator"), or any affiliate thereof a fee of $35,000 plus $500 for each special telephonic meeting attended.  As additional annual compensation, the Chairman of the Fund will receive $5,000, the Audit Committee Chairman and Valuation Committee Chairman will receive $3,000, and the Nomination Committee Chairman will receive $2,000.  For serving as the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, Mr. Hellerman received from the Fund a fee for annual compensation of $45,000.  In addition to the aforementioned fees paid to Directors, the Fund reimburses Directors for travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending meetings of the Board. The table below details the amount of compensation the Fund's Directors received from the Fund during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018.  The Fund does not have a bonus, profit sharing, pension or retirement plan.  No other entity affiliated with the Fund pays any compensation to the Directors.

Code of Ethics.  The Fund and the Adviser have each adopted a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act and Section 204A and Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, respectively, that establishes procedures for personal investments and restricts certain personal securities transactions.  Personnel subject to each code may invest in securities for their personal investment accounts, including securities that may be purchased or held by the Fund, so long as such investments are made pursuant to the code's requirements.  Copies of these codes are available for inspection at the Public Reference Room of the SEC in Washington, D.C.  Information regarding the operation of the Public Reference Room is available by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090.

Director Transactions with Fund Affiliates.  As of July 31, 2018, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family owned securities beneficially or of record in the Adviser or any of its affiliates.  Furthermore, over the past five years, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family have had any direct or indirect interest, the value of which exceeds $120,000, in the Adviser or any of its affiliates.  In addition, since the beginning of the last two fiscal years, neither the Independent Directors nor members of their immediate family have conducted any transactions (or series of transactions) or maintained any direct or indirect relationship in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and to which the Adviser or any of its affiliates was a party.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, RECOMMENDS THAT THE HOLDERS OF THE FUND'S COMMON STOCK VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF RICHARD ABRAHAM AND RAJEEV DAS AS CLASS II DIRECTORS OF THE FUND.  ANY SIGNED BUT UNMARKED PROXIES WILL BE SO VOTED "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES.  Additional Information about the Board of Directors
Board Meetings and Committees.
During the fiscal year ended July 31, 20187, each Director and nominee for Director attended, in person or by telephone, at least seventy-five (75%) percent of all meetings of the Board (including regularly scheduled and special meetings) and of the Committees of which he is a member, held since his respective election.
Audit Committee.  The Board has established an Audit Committee that acts pursuant to a written charter and whose responsibilities are generally: (i) to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Fund and its internal control over financial reporting; (ii) to oversee the quality and integrity of the Fund's financial statements and the independent audit thereof; and (iii) to approve, prior to the engagement of, the Fund's independent auditors and, in connection therewith, to review and evaluate the qualifications, independence and performance of the Fund's independent auditors.
Although the Audit Committee is expected to take a detached and questioning approach to the matters that come before it, the review of the Fund's financial statements by the Audit Committee is not an audit, nor does the Audit Committee's review substitute for the responsibilities of the Fund's management for preparing, or the independent auditors for auditing, the Fund's financial statements.  Members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Fund and, in serving on the Audit Committee, are not, and do not hold themselves out to be, acting as accountants or auditors.  As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews.  In discharging their duties, the members of the Audit Committee are entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, if prepared or presented by: (1) one or more officers of the Fund whom such Director reasonably believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented; (2) legal counsel, public accountants, or other persons as to matters the Director reasonably believes are within the person's professional or expert competence; or (3) a Board committee of which the Director is not a member.
The current members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Abraham, Das, Goldstein and Goodstein, each of whom is an Independent Director.  None of the members of the Audit Committee has any relationship to the Fund that may interfere with the exercise of his independence from management of the Fund, and each is independent as defined under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") applicable to closed-end funds.  During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Audit Committee met two times.
Nominating Committee.  The Board has established a Nominating Committee whose responsibilities are generally to seek and review candidates for consideration as nominees for Directors as is from time to time considered necessary or appropriate.
The current members of the Nominating Committee are Messrs. Abraham, Das, Goldstein and Goodstein.  None of the members is an "interested person" within the meaning of the 1940 Act, and each is independent as defined under listing standards of the NYSE applicable to closed-end funds.  During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Nominating Committee met one time. 
In nominating candidates, the Nominating Committee believes that no specific qualifications or disqualifications are controlling or paramount or that each candidate must possess specific qualities or skills.  In identifying and evaluating nominees for Director, the Nominating Committee takes into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate.  These factors may include: (i) whether or not such person is an "interested person" as defined in the 1940 Act, meets the independence and experience requirements of the NYSE applicable to closed-end funds and is otherwise qualified under applicable laws and regulations to serve as a member of the Board; (ii) whether or not such person has any relationships that might impair his or her independence, such as any business, financial or family relationships with Fund management, the Adviser or other service providers or their affiliates; (iii) whether or not such person is willing to serve, and willing and able to commit the time necessary for the performance of the duties of a Board member; (iv) such person's judgment, skill, diversity and experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity and size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight; (v) the interplay of such person's experience with the experience of other Board members; and (vi) the extent to which such person would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committees thereof.
 It is the policy of the Nominating Committee to consider nominees recommended by Stockholders and so long as the Stockholders properly submit their recommendations in accordance with the requirements contained in the section entitled "Stockholder Proposals" below.
Valuation Committee.  The Board has also established a Valuation Committee.  Its purpose is to (i) review all monthly reports and any other interim reports regarding the valuation of securities in the Fund's portfolio, and (ii) review and approve the valuation of all fair valued securities. This review shall include a review and discussion of an updated fair valuation summary with appropriate levels of representatives of the Adviser's management.  The Valuation Committee consists of the four Independent Directors, Messrs. Abraham, Das, Goldstein and Goodstein.  Although the Valuation Committee did not meet during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018, the Valuation Committee took action to ratify all fair value securities at each quarterly Board meeting.

       Audit Committee Pre-Approval.  The Audit Committee Charter contains the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies and procedures.  The Audit Committee Charter can be found on the Fund's website at http://www.mxefund.com/corporate_governance.html.  Reproduced below is an excerpt from the Audit Committee Charter regarding such policies and procedures:
The Audit Committee shall:
approve prior to appointment the engagement of the auditor to provide other audit services to the Fund or to provide non-audit services to the Fund, its investment adviser or any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser ("adviser affiliate") that provides ongoing services to the Fund, if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund.
Audit Committee Report.  The Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management of the Fund, the Administrator, and Tait Weller.  Tait Weller represented to the Audit Committee that the Fund's financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management of the Fund, the Administrator and Tait Weller.  The Audit Committee also discussed with Tait Weller matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16. 
Tait Weller also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence), and the Audit Committee discussed with Tait Weller its independence, in light of the services Tait Weller is providing.
Based upon the Audit Committee's discussion with management of the Fund, the Administrator and Tait Weller and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of the Administrator and the report of Tait Weller to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited financial statements in the Fund's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.
