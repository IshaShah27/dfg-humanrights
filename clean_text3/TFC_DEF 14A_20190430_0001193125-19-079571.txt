Dear Fellow Shareholder: 
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of BB&T Corporation at 11:00 a.m. (EDT) on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. This year's meeting will be held in Charleston, South Carolina at Hibernian Hall, 105 Meeting Street. Shareholders as of the record date of February 20, 2019 are invited to attend. 
We are again providing proxy materials to our shareholders through the Internet. This method significantly contributes to our sustainability efforts by lowering the cost of our annual proxy campaign and saving paper. We hope this continues to offer you a convenient way to access our proxy materials. Please read this proxy statement carefully because it contains important information about the matters we will vote on at our annual meeting. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, we would like to thank recently retired director Eric C. Kendrick for his service and support to our company. His business and governance experience has greatly contributed to our company during his sixteen years of service, beginning as a director of Branch Banking and Trust Company and later as a director of BB&T Corporation. We will miss his quality of character and commitment to our vision. 
As you probably are aware, on February 7, 2019, BB&T and SunTrust announced a merger of equals. We are very excited about this combination and the opportunities we believe it will provide to our clients, associates, communities and shareholders. We will ask you at another time to vote at a special meeting to approve the transaction. In the meantime, please be assured that our unwavering commitment to our Vision, Mission and Values will continue. 
Even if you plan to attend the meeting, we encourage you to vote your shares in advance by following the voting instructions provided. Every vote is important and we look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely, 
NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF 
BB&T CORPORATION

   In early 2017, the Compensation Committee made substantial  pay-for-performance enhancements to our executive compensation program, including:     the addition of performance share units and total shareholder return as  components to our long-term incentive awards, and     enhancing the percentage of long-term incentives being subject to robust performance criteria.   Since that time, our shareholders have strongly approved our  say-on-pay proposal with approximately 94% support in both 2018 and 2017.   Given this continued support and positive shareholder feedback, the Compensation Committee maintained the key features of our executive compensation  program with limited modification. In 2018, the Compensation Committee introduced a performance component to the Annual Incentive Award to assess strategic and other performance considerations.   In evaluating this years say-on-pay proposal, we believe shareholders should consider our strong financial performance, the alignment of our executive compensation program with our financial performance and our sound pay practices  that conform with our shareholders interests and the culture and values of BB&T.     CEO Target Total Direct Compensation Mix            86% of pay at risk, subject to robust performance criteria     60% of pay based upon achievement of long-term performance goals     Only 14%  fixed pay, commensurate with skills and experience.

Proposal 1—Election of Directors 
PROPOSAL 1—ELECTIONOF DIRECTORS 
We are asking you to elect each of the 15 director nominees listed below to serve on our Board of Directors for a one-year term expiring at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders in 2020. Each director nominee will require the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast to be elected. 
Although our Board of Directors expects that each of the nominees will be available for election, if a vacancy in the slate of nominees occurs, it is intended that shares of BB&T common stock represented by proxies will be voted for the election of a substitute nominee, designated by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of persons to be elected by the number of persons unable to serve. 
Each of our nominees has been identified as possessing good business acumen, strength of character, and an independent mind, as well as a reputation for integrity and the highest personal and professional ethics. Sound judgment and community leadership are also important characteristics that our Board members possess. Each nominee additionally brings to us a strong and unique background and set of skills, providing our Board with competence and experience in a wide variety of areas. 
One of our Board's goals is to include members with diverse backgrounds. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has historically included members both racially and gender diverse, with skills and characteristics that, taken as a whole, the Committee believes will help ensure a strong and effective governing body. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews the skillsets and composition of our Board to determine the appropriate skills, qualifications and backgrounds to match our Corporation's needs. 
At BB&T, we are proud of our long commitment to diversity among our associates, members of Executive Management and our Board of Directors. Of our 15 directors, 5 are women, representing 33% of our Board, and approximately 47% of our Board is represented by directors with diverse backgrounds. Moreover, women hold key leadership positions on our Board, such as our Lead Independent Director, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair and our Trust Committee Chair. 
We are proud of our directors' devotion to BB&T. Our Board invests a substantial amount of time, effort and energy in planning and executing our strategic plan, founded on our vision, mission and values. Each director is required to be sufficiently familiar with the business of BB&T, including our strategy, financial statements, capital structure, business risks and competition, to facilitate active and effective participation in such meetings. Our Board members have a diverse skillset that demonstrates a variety of expertise that is well suited to oversee the Corporation's strategy and closely ties to our financial institution and the banking industry as a whole. 
While each of our Board members has other professional commitments, no Board member is part of more than two other publicly-traded company boards. We believe that our Board's commitment to BB&T and diverse skillset helps promote our vision to "Create the Best Financial Institution Possible." The following chart shows the range of skillsets our directors provide to BB&T.

Shareholders may also request a copy of any of these documents by contacting our Secretary at: BB&T Corporation, 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide the framework for fulfillment of the Board's corporate governance duties and responsibilities, taking into consideration corporate governance best practices, recent developments and applicable laws and regulations. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address a number of matters applicable to directors, including director qualification standards and director independence requirements, share ownership guidelines, Board responsibilities, role of the independent Lead Director, retirement, meetings of non-management directors, and director compensation. 
Our Board of Directors is committed to maintaining objective, independent oversight of management in upholding its responsibilities to our shareholders and in carrying out the strategic objectives of the Corporation. The value placed on the independence of our directors is seen in our corporate governance documents, board committee charters, annual independence review of our Board members and the role of our lead independent director. 
In determining director independence, our Board considers the New York Stock Exchange's ("NYSE") bright-line independence criteria and the standards set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Consistent with NYSE rules, our Board of Directors also broadly considers all other relevant facts and circumstances that bear on the materiality of each director's relationship with BB&T, including the potential for conflicts of interest, when determining director independence. To assist it in making independence determinations, our Board of Directors has adopted categorical standards which are contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These director independence standards reflect, among other items, the NYSE independence requirements and other applicable laws and regulations related to director independence, and address certain relationships that the Board has determined affect a director's independence. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board by annually evaluating the independence of each prospective and incumbent director using the foregoing standards and such other factors as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee deems appropriate, and makes a recommendation to the Board regarding the independence of each such person. As a part of this evaluation process, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers each director's occupation, other publicly held company directorships, personal and affiliate transactions with BB&T and its subsidiaries, certain charitable contributions, relationships considered in accordance with our Related Person Transactions Policy, and other relevant direct and indirect relationships that may affect independence. Banking relationships with BB&T or any of its subsidiaries (including deposit, investment, lending and fiduciary) that are conducted in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms and conditions as otherwise available to nonaffiliated customers for comparable transactions are not considered material in determining independence. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    15 
Corporate Governance Matters 
After duly considering all such information, our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that of the 15 members of the Board, the following 13 directors have no disqualifying material relationships with BB&T or its subsidiaries and are independent: Messrs. Boyer, Graney, Lynn, Patton, Reuter, Rich, Skains and Thompson, and Mmes. Banner, Cablik, Henry, Maynard and Sears. The following two directors were deemed not independent due to certain disqualifying relationships with BB&T: Messrs. King and Qubein. Each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has been determined by the Board to be "independent" in accordance with the requirements of the NYSE and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
Our Board of Directors is led by the Chairman. Under our bylaws, the Chairman is elected by the Board and presides over each Board meeting and performs such other duties as may be incident to the office of Chairman. Our bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines each provide that the Chairman may also hold the position of Chief Executive Officer. BB&T's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is not permitted to serve as a member of any standing Board committee, other than the Executive Committee and the Risk Committee. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that when the position of Chairman of the Board is not held by an independent director, the Board will appoint an independent Lead Director. 
It is the Board's current belief that having a unified Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is appropriate and in the best interests of BB&T and our shareholders. The Board believes that combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles provides the following advantages to us: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our Chief Executive Officer is the director most familiar with our business and industry and is best situated to lead  discussions on important matters affecting the business of BB&T;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• combining the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman positions creates a firm link between management and the Board and  promotes both the development and implementation of corporate strategy; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• combining the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman contributes to a more efficient and effective Board.   
[END TABLE]
INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR 
Anna R. Cablik serves as the Board's Lead Director. The role of the Lead Director is to assist the Chairman and the remainder of the Board in ensuring effective governance in overseeing the direction and management of BB&T. The Lead Director serves a two-year term and may serve for one subsequent one-year term at the discretion of the Board. Our Board believes that the Lead Director serves an important corporate governance function by providing separate leadership for the non-management and independent directors. In addition to the formal list of duties performed by our Lead Director, she also meets with regulators, participates in shareholder engagement calls and attends meetings with senior management. A more fulsome discussion of our independent lead director's responsibilities is found in the following discussion.

With respect to each standing committee, the current members, the principal functions and the number of meetings held in 2018 are shown below. Also shown below are the responsibilities of our Lead Director.

Our Board currently consists of 15 directors. While the Board annually evaluates its size and structure, we believe the Board's current size provides us with certain advantages. Financial institutions face significant regulatory and economic pressure. As a result, substantial time commitments and other demands are required of our directors and executive officers. The size of our Board is an advantage when assigning an appropriate number of members to each committee in order to properly analyze and respond to increasingly complex developments, whether regulatory, economic, or otherwise. The diversity of viewpoints on each committee also allows for more effective challenge to proposals from management and directors. In addition, the number of independent directors aids in maintaining the requisite independence standards of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees. The Board believes that its current size and structure is appropriate to effectively represent the interests of our shareholders. 
GENERAL 
BB&T's shareholder engagement program is a robust, year-round process including outreach to shareholders, analysis of results of the annual meeting of shareholders, board deliberations and response, and re-engagement with shareholders. We listen closely to our shareholders to understand their views and address their concerns about, and support for, our executive compensation and corporate governance programs. Our shareholder engagement program encompasses a variety of initiatives, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Spring and fall telephonic meetings with our larger institutional shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Telephonic meetings with our largest shareholders, led by the Compensation Committee Chair, the Nominating and Corporate  Governance Committee Chair, or our Lead Director, and attended by members of Executive Management;

Corporate Governance Matters 
Our shareholder engagement program is complemented by our Investor Relations led investor events, including investor conferences and meetings, earnings calls and in 2018, an Investor Day where members of BB&T's executive management team gave presentations on financial performance and corporate strategies. 
The goals of our shareholder engagement program include, but are not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Obtaining shareholder insight into our corporate governance, executive compensation, and other policies and practices,  including shareholder perspectives and priorities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Communicating Board and management actions in response to shareholder feedback;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discussing current trends in corporate governance and executive compensation matters; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Providing insight into our current practices and enhancing communication with our largest shareholders.   
[END TABLE]
We believe that our shareholder engagement program allows Executive Management and the Board to gather information about investor views and priorities and make educated and deliberate decisions that are balanced and appropriate for our diverse shareholder base and that are in the best interests of BB&T. In the past few years, our shareholder engagement outreach helped lead to several executive compensation and corporate governance changes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the addition of performance share units and total shareholder return as components to our long-term incentive awards;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• enhancing the percentage of long-term incentives being subject to robust performance criteria;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the elimination of supermajority voting provisions in our bylaws;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amendments to our bylaws to permit shareholders owning 20% or more of our common stock to call a special meeting of  shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• adoption of a proxy access bylaw, which provides our shareholders the ability to include shareholder Board nominees in  BB&T's proxy statement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the publication of an annual Corporate Social Responsibility report.

2018 SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
In both the spring and fall of 2018, we contacted 48 of our 50 largest shareholders representing approximately 46% of our outstanding shares. Similar to prior years, one of the primary topics discussed was our executive compensation program and recent program improvements. Given strong say-on-pay approval votes and positive shareholder feedback received during engagement, the Compensation Committee maintained the key features of our executive compensation program with limited modification, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement. In addition to our executive compensation program, we heard from several of our shareholders on the following topics:

Corporate Governance Matters 
Our governance practices promote board effectiveness and shareholder interests as set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BB&T Corporate Governance Practices 
   Strong Board Refreshment Practices: Our Board  and Committees conduct self-assessments annually and committee rotation is considered annually. In addition, our mandatory retirement age for directors promotes further refreshment. Over a majority of our Board has a tenure of six years or less,  including two directors elected in 2018. In addition, our Board elected a new Lead Independent Director in 2019, as well as a new Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Chair and a new Trust Committee Chair.     Special Meetings: BB&Ts bylaws permit  shareholders owning 20% or more of our common stock to call a special meeting of shareholders.     Proxy Access: Our bylaws provide for proxy access that  allows a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders that has held at least 3% of our common stock for at least three years to nominate up to 25% of the Board (at least two directors) and have those nominees appear in our proxy statement, subject  to notice and other specific requirements in our bylaws.     Elimination of Supermajority Vote Provisions: In 2018, we  eliminated the supermajority vote requirements in our bylaws.     Independent Board of Directors: 13 of our 15 directors are  independent, and our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance committees are composed entirely of independent directors.     Independent Lead Director: Our Lead Director serves an  important governance function by providing strong leadership for non-management and independent directors.     Corporate Social Responsibility Report: We publish annually  on our website a Corporate Social Responsibility Report, highlighting our good stewardship of the natural resources entrusted to us, our promotion of our associates and communities well-being, and our strong corporate governance program.  Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and approves the Corporate Social Responsibility report annually and oversees culture and ethics within BB&T.     Comprehensive Board Training: Our Board Skills and Training  Program provides a formal framework designed to support the directors performance of their responsibilities as members of the Board and Board Committees.     Stock Ownership Guidelines: By requiring our CEO to own  stock equal to 6x his annual salary and directors to own stock equal to 5x their annual retainer, we effectively align their interests to those of our shareholders.     Pledging/Hedging of Shares: To reduce conflicts of  interest, we prohibit hedging and significantly restrict pledging of our common stock by directors and Executive Management members.     Majority Voting for Directors: All director nominees in  uncontested elections must be elected by an affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast.     Annual Elections: Each of our directors is elected for a one-year term expiring at the next Annual Meeting of Shareholders.     Clawbacks and Executive Risk Scorecard: We make all  executive awards (cash and equity) subject to recoupment and also may utilize our executive risk scorecard to reduce incentive compensation for negative risk outcomes.

Our Board oversees Executive Management's continual reinforcement of BB&T's culture, which occurs through a quarterly video, annual  regional in-person visits and other internal communication channels. We also have an internal Culture and Conduct Risk Committee, which serves as a consolidation point for existing efforts aimed at reputation  risk, sales practices risk, culture, ethics, and conduct.

GENERAL 
Ethics matter at BB&T. We believe the ultimate success of BB&T is directly related to the extent that each one of our associates lives and works every day by adhering to our BB&T values. We are keenly focused on always doing what is right in all interactions with our stakeholders—our clients, associates, senior leaders, directors, communities and shareholders. We also value and respect the opinions and insights of associates at all levels throughout the organization. Accordingly, we encourage associates to raise concerns with their managers, and we also provide other channels such as regional associate relations managers, a BB&T Ethics Hotline and our "Raise a Concern" web reporting form. Our Chief Ethics Officer provides reports to the Board of Directors and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and underscores our commitment to sound ethical practices. 
We maintain three separate Board-approved Codes of Ethics that apply to our associates, senior financial officers and Directors. These Codes govern our corporate conduct, and each Code is specifically tailored to recognize the importance of each of these groups in maintaining a strong culture based on our values and adherence to ethical business practices. Any waivers or substantive amendments of the Codes of Ethics applicable to our Directors and certain of our executive officers will be disclosed on our website. 
SALES PRACTICES 
A key tenet of BB&T's Mission statement is to help our clients achieve economic success and financial security. Our culture and sales practices are consistent with this philosophy. BB&T Corporation's risk culture heavily influences the design and emphasis of the sales management programs. Therefore, BB&T Corporation's compensation and incentive programs are based on balanced performance, with appropriate controls. Sales leaders are held accountable for setting this tone from the top and championing appropriate sales behaviors, and associates are held accountable for executing their daily responsibilities in accordance with BB&T's Code of Ethics. 
We understand it is important to our shareholders that we conduct our mission in a sustainable manner, promote positive social efforts, and implement transparent governance practices. As part of our commitment to this area of increasing interest to our shareholders and the communities we serve, in 2018 we appointed a Chief Corporate Social Responsibility Officer to help focus our efforts on these important issues.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for selecting as director candidates individuals who demonstrate the highest personal and professional integrity, have demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who are expected to be the most effective in serving the long-term interests of BB&T and its shareholders. 
Director nominees are recommended to the Board of Directors by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates submitted by directors and shareholders, subject to the requirements set forth below, and it may consider candidates submitted by a third-party search firm hired for the purpose of identifying director candidates. As evidenced by the composition of our Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to include director candidates who are racially and gender diverse, with skills and characteristics that, taken as a whole, will help ensure a strong and effective governing body. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts an extensive due diligence process to review potential director candidates and their individual qualifications, and all such candidates, including those submitted by shareholders, will be evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee using the Board membership criteria described below. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then reports to the Board its recommendations concerning each director nominee. The Board considers the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendations when appointing directors and selecting director nominees to be submitted by BB&T to shareholders for approval at the annual meeting of shareholders. 
DIRECTOR QUALIFICATIONS 
A director candidate is nominated to stand for election based on his or her professional experience, strategic insights, recognized achievement in his or her respective field, an ability to contribute to our business, experience in risk management, and the willingness to make the commitment of time and effort required of a BB&T director over an extended period of time. A director must be "financially literate," as defined by the Board, and should understand the intricacies of a public company. A director should possess good judgment, strength of character, and an independent mind, as well as a reputation for integrity and the highest personal and professional ethics. 
As evidenced by the composition of our Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is committed to diversity and considers a variety of factors to ensure that the overall composition of our Board is appropriate, such as occupational and geographic diversity, race, gender and age. An important goal of the Board is to include members with diverse backgrounds, skills, and characteristics that, taken as a whole, will help ensure a strong and effective governing body.

DIRECTOR CANDIDATES RECOMMENDED BY SHAREHOLDERS 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also will consider qualified director nominees recommended in writing by shareholders when such recommendations are submitted with the information set forth in Article II, Section 10 of the Corporation's bylaws and policies regarding director nominations. The written notice must include the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nominee's full name, age and residential address;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the principal occupation(s) of the nominee during the past five years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the nominee's previous and/or current memberships on all public company boards of directors and the amount of all  BB&T securities beneficially owned;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any agreements, understandings or arrangements between the nominee and any other person or persons with respect to the  nominee's nomination or service on the Board of Directors or the capital stock or business of BB&T;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any bankruptcy filings, criminal convictions, civil actions, actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission  ("SEC") or other regulatory agency or any violation of Federal or State securities law by and against the nominee or any affiliate of the nominee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a signed statement by the nominee consenting to serve as a director if elected.  
[END TABLE]
The written notice also must be submitted in accordance with the general procedures for shareholder nominations (including deadlines for the notice to be received by the Secretary), which are summarized under the caption "Voting and Other Information-Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders" below. Shareholders may submit, in writing, the names and qualifications of potential director nominees to the Secretary, BB&T Corporation, 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101, for delivery to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for consideration. 
Our articles of incorporation require each director to be elected by the majority of the votes cast at a meeting of shareholders. Under our Director Resignation Policy, any director nominee who receives a greater number of votes "against" than votes "for" such election shall tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances and recommend to the Board whether to accept, reject or otherwise act with respect to such resignation. The Board will act on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation within 130 days following certification of the shareholder vote and will publicly disclose its decision within this 130-day timeframe. A director whose resignation is under consideration will abstain from participating in any recommendation or decision regarding that resignation. If a director's resignation is not accepted, the director will continue to serve for the remainder of his or her term. 
Currently, pursuant to North Carolina law and our bylaws, an incumbent director who is not re-elected remains in office until the director's successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Our current Director Resignation Policy addresses this "holdover" issue by requiring any director who does not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election to tender his or her resignation to the Board. 
Our Board Skills and Training Program provides a formal framework designed to support the directors' performance of their responsibilities as members of the Board and Board Committees. The courses are provided by both in-house experts and outside consultants on a wide range of topics to enhance the directors' knowledge in areas important in carrying out their responsibilities as directors. Courses of general application are offered to the full Board while others are tailored to the specific requirements of the various Board Committees. The directors' participation is considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in its annual evaluation of their performance. The courses offered through our training program are in addition to courses in which our Board members regularly participate in order to maintain professional credentials, including courses related to ethics. 
Newly elected directors undergo an extensive Board and Committee orientation process. We view the Board and Committee orientation process as a means to impart substantive knowledge, and also to further our directors' understanding of our culture and the Board's role in determining the Corporation's culture and overseeing management's assurance of corporate integrity. Our Chief Corporate Governance Officer facilitates a detailed Board orientation session. These sessions 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    27 
Corporate Governance Matters review the Corporation's culture, including Codes of Ethics founded on our vision, mission and values, strategic objectives and planning, risk management matters, and our corporate governance program. Additional topics included in the orientation session include the Corporation's business structure, including regulatory oversight, laws governing directors' duties and conduct, securities law policies, and liability insurance coverage. Sessions to integrate the new director into the team structure of the Board are also provided. Additionally, new directors and rotating directors each attend an orientation of the Committee(s) on which they serve, which covers in detail the operation and duties of the relevant Committee as well as their substantive business. 
We have a strong record of Board refreshment, which is integral to effective governance. While we greatly value the insight of our longer tenured directors and their detailed understanding of BB&T's business and the banking industry, we do recognize the ongoing need to consider new director candidates who can provide new viewpoints. As a result, we believe that it is important to a board's oversight role to have an appropriate balance between experienced directors and less tenured directors. Since 2013, we have elected eleven new Board members, while seeing several directors retire from our Board voluntarily or as a result of our mandatory age limit. Currently, 53% of our directors have a tenure of six years or fewer, including two directors elected in 2018. This director refreshment has brought to the Board new capabilities, experience and perspectives. Over the next few years, we expect continued Board turnover, as our bylaws require directors to retire at the end of the year in which they turn 75 years of age, although a director may voluntarily elect to retire earlier. The average age of our director nominees is 65 years, and we currently have five director nominees who are at least 70 years old. The Board will continue to engage in regular discussion of upcoming vacancies and potential candidates in keeping with its governance responsibilities. 
In January 2019, the Board amended the Bylaws to increase the mandatory retirement age from 72 to 75. In doing so, the Board considered the ability to retain expertise and support continuity while maintaining the Board's strong diversity and independence, as well as public company trends regarding mandatory retirement ages and/or more flexible retirement policies, peer practice and shareholder feedback. The Board also encourages refreshment at the Committee level and annually considers Committee changes. In 2019, for example, new Committee Chairs include Jennifer S. Banner (Nominating and Corporate Governance) and I. Patricia Henry (Trust). New Committee members include Louis B. Lynn, Ph.D. (Audit); and Jennifer S. Banner, Patrick C. Graney III and Easter A. Maynard (Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance). We have also appointed Anna R. Cablik as our new independent Lead Director. 
BOARD SELF-EVALUATIONS
On an annual basis, our Board of Directors evaluates its effectiveness over the preceding year. Each director is expected to participate in the evaluation process. The evaluation process is managed by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with assistance from our Secretary. During our Board evaluation process, directors are presented with a written questionnaire designed to illicit constructive feedback from each director about his or her individual service and each committee to which that director is assigned. Responses received from each director are discussed with the full Board as well as each standing Committee in executive sessions. This feedback is used to improve procedures and policies and, as appropriate, is discussed with members of Executive Management to improve efficiencies and effectiveness. 
Management succession planning is a priority of the Board of Directors. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring that we have developed an Executive Management succession plan, including procedures for Chief Executive Officer selection in the event of an emergency or the retirement of the CEO. This plan is reviewed and evaluated by the Board at least annually. The Lead Director facilitates the Board's review and evaluation of our Executive Management succession plan. As part of the plan, our Chairman and CEO makes available his recommendations and evaluations of potential successors, along with a review of any development plans of such individuals. This process establishes procedures for planning and responding to events involving an absence of the CEO, whether for the short- or long-term, and allows the Board to exercise its judgment and discretion with regard to the selection of a new CEO. 
28    BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Corporate Governance Matters 
The Board of Directors oversees BB&T's political strategy, political contributions and lobbying expenses. BB&T periodically participates in policy debates on issues to support our interests and sponsors employee political action committees, or PACs, which allow associates to voluntarily pool their financial resources to support federal and state candidates who support legislation important to us, and our shareholders, clients and communities. All PAC expenditures are a matter of public record and are available for review on the websites of the Federal Election Commission and various state election offices. It is our policy not to use corporate funds to make contributions to political candidates, political parties or political committees organized for the advancement of political candidates, including Super PACs. 
The Audit Committee oversees a policy that governs the reporting of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• complaints regarding accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reports of:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• material violations by BB&T or any of our officers, directors, associates or agents, of federal or state securities  laws,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• material breaches of fiduciary duty arising under federal or state law, or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• suspected material violations of any other laws or regulations that govern the Corporation's actions.   
[END TABLE]
We have engaged an independent service provider to receive and track all such complaints. Any verified complaint is referred to our General Counsel, who is responsible for reviewing those complaints in accordance with our whistleblower procedures and reporting all relevant information regarding the nature of the complaint to the Audit Committee. The General Counsel investigates or causes to be investigated all matters referred pursuant to this policy and maintains a record of such complaints that includes the tracking of the receipt of their referral, investigation and resolution. Generally, if such a complaint is raised by an attorney in our legal department, then the complaint will be referred to our Chief Executive Officer. The General Counsel (or the Chief Executive Officer, as the case may be) periodically prepares a summary report of such complaints for the Audit Committee, which oversees the consideration of all reported complaints covered by this policy. The telephone number for reporting complaints as described in this section is 800-432-1911. 
One of the Board's most important and vital functions is to provide oversight, guidance and direction as to BB&T's long-term strategy. Accordingly, in the first quarter and third quarter of each year, management provides to the Board a detailed report on our strategic plan, goals and initiatives for the upcoming year and/or our progress on those initiatives. The process includes an independent risk assessment to ensure all strategic activities are consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite parameters. Before it is approved, the Board engages in thorough and detailed discussions and deliberations over the strategic plan. The plan also includes reporting on management's success in executing on the prior year's strategic plan to ensure accountability. 
Our vision, mission and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at BB&T and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. Our Risk Management Organization (RMO) provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. In keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, our RMO has established the following risk values which guide principles of associates' day-to-day activities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Managing risk is the responsibility of every associate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their business is the responsibility of our business units.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Measuring what is managed and managing what is measured.

• Realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ensuring there is appropriate return for the risk taken.  
[END TABLE]
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    29 
Corporate Governance Matters 
As illustrated below, we execute on our risk values through a risk management framework based on the following "three lines of defense:" 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• First Line of Defense: Risk management begins with the business units, the point at which risk is originated and  where risks must be managed. Business Unit Risk Managers in the first line identify, assess, control and report their group's risk profile compared to its approved risk limits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Second Line of Defense: The RMO provides independent oversight and guidance of risk-taking across the enterprise. The  RMO aggregates, integrates, and correlates risk information into a holistic picture of the corporation's risk profile and concentrations. The RMO establishes policies and limits and reports sources and amounts of risk to Executive Management  and the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Third Line of Defense: Audit Services (BB&T's internal audit function) evaluates the design and  effectiveness of the risk management framework and its results. Results are reported to Executive Management and the Board of Directors according to Audit Services Policy.  
[END TABLE]
Beginning in 2019, BB&T bolstered its three line of defense model with the introduction of 2nd Line of Defense Chief Risk Officers for each business segment and 1st Line of Defense Business Unit Risk Managers. The Chief Risk Officers for each business segment serve as the second line of defense independent oversight function to aggregate, integrate, and correlate all risks that occur within the business segments. As the centralized first line risk function for each Executive Manager, the Business Unit Risk Manager ensures focus for the business unit pertaining to risk and controls by providing oversight and governance regarding its control environment. 
We place significant emphasis on risk management and maintain a separate Board-level Risk Committee which oversees risk reporting to the Board of Directors and functions as a significant part of our risk management framework. Among its responsibilities, the Risk Committee monitors our risk profile, approves risk appetite statements, and provides input to management regarding our risk appetite and risk profile. 
The RMO is led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and is responsible for facilitating effective risk management oversight, measurement, monitoring, reporting, and consistency. The CRO has direct access to our Board of Directors and Executive Management to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise. The CRO also chairs the Risk Management Committee (RMC), which provides oversight on a fully integrated view of risks across our organization, including strategic, compliance, credit, liquidity, market, operational, and reputation risks. 
INFORMATION SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY 
We are committed to protecting personal and financial information, and our Board of Directors and Executive Management team devote a significant amount of time to information security and cybersecurity risks. Members of the Risk Committee of the Board receive regular reports from our CRO related to information technology and information security, including potential risks to our Company. The Risk Committee may retain these reports, meet throughout the year with risk management advisors, and discuss with Executive Management any recommendations received. In addition, two members of our Board of Directors (Ms. Banner and Mr. Boyer) have cybersecurity/technology experience. 
The Chief Information Security Officer meets at least quarterly with the Board to provide updates on cybersecurity and information security risk, and the Board annually reviews and approves our Information Security Program and Information Security Policy. The Information Security Committee is an internal committee created to ensure that members of Executive Management overseeing multiple business units actively understand information security protections and associated risks. The Information Security Committee engages in key decisions to help set direction for information security strategy, as well as understand and prioritize information security capabilities and associated risk remediation.

RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention and oversight of our independent registered public accounting firm. To execute on this responsibility, the Audit Committee engages in a comprehensive annual evaluation of the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications, performance and independence. The Audit Committee has carefully considered the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit and report on the consolidated financial statements of BB&T and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
SHAREHOLDER RATIFICATION 
Our shareholders are being asked to ratify the appointment of PwC for 2019 because we value our shareholders' views on our independent registered public accounting firm and as a matter of good corporate governance. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and are expected to be available to respond to questions posed by the shareholders. If shareholders do not ratify the decision of the Audit Committee to reappoint PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, the Audit Committee will reconsider its decision.

Audit-Related Fees. This category includes fees billed for assurance and other services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audits of our consolidated financial statements and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting that are not reported under the audit fees category above. These services consist of service organization control reports, other attestation engagements traditionally performed by the independent registered public accounting firm, pre-implementation assessments of new accounting standards, due diligence services related to mergers and acquisitions, and audits of our employee benefit plans. 
Tax Fees. This category includes fees billed for tax-related services, including tax compliance, tax planning, and tax advice. 
All Other Fees. This category includes fees billed for non-audit services and subscription-based services including software licenses, benchmarking services, training, and other advisory services. 
The Audit Committee considered the compatibility of the non-audit services performed by, and fees paid to, PwC in 2018 and determined that such services and fees are compatible with the independence of PwC. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    31 
Proposal 2—Ratification of the Appointment of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Under the terms of its charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all services (including the fees and terms of such services) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to a de minimis exception for permitted non-audit services that are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit and otherwise in accordance with the terms of applicable SEC rules. The Audit Committee may delegate authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, as long as the decisions of such subcommittee(s) to grant pre-approvals are presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. In 2018, all of the services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm were reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is currently composed of five independent directors and operates under a charter adopted by the Audit Committee on January 29, 2019. The SEC and the NYSE have established standards relating to audit committee membership and functions. With regard to such membership standards, the Board has determined that both Christine Sears and Charles A. Patton meet the requirements of an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the SEC. 
The primary duties and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are to monitor: (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Corporation; (ii) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; (iii) the performance of the Corporation's internal audit function and independent auditors; and (iv) compliance by the Corporation with legal and regulatory requirements. While the Audit Committee has the duties and responsibilities set forth above and those set forth in its charter, our management is responsible for the internal controls and the financial reporting process, and the independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an integrated audit of our financial statements and of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and issuing a report thereon. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has performed the duties required by its charter, including meeting and holding discussions with management, the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditor, and has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its views on fraud risks and how it demonstrates its independence and skepticism. Finally, the Audit Committee also has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees). 
The Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letters from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, as currently in effect, regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence. The Audit Committee also has considered whether the provision of any non-audit services by our independent registered public accounting firm is compatible with maintaining the independence of the auditors. 
Based upon a review of the reports by, and discussions with, management and the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019. 
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, whose current members are:

PROPOSAL 3—ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE BB&T'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Proposal 3 asks shareholders to approve our pay-for-performance executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that our executive compensation program, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, reflects a pay-for-performance culture at BB&T that is rooted in our values. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the executive compensation program is well designed and effective in aligning the interests of the executives with both the short-term and long-term interests of our shareholders, while reducing incentives for unnecessary and excessive risk taking. 
In making a decision on whether to approve our pay practices for our named executive officers, we ask that you consider the description of our executive compensation program provided in the following pages in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and the accompanying narratives. 
The Board strongly supports our executive pay practices and asks shareholders to support our executive compensation program through the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve BB&T's overall executive compensation program, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related narratives and other materials in this Proxy Statement." 
Your vote on this proposal, which is required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, is "advisory" and will serve as a non-binding recommendation to the Board. The Compensation Committee will seriously consider the outcome of this vote when determining future executive compensation arrangements.

The Compensation Committee regularly considers a variety of financial and non-financial metrics when evaluating performance and making compensation decisions. By assessing several quantitative and qualitative metrics over different time periods, the Compensation Committee is able to obtain a broad and accurate assessment of our performance against specific compensation goals and relative to our peer group. In particular, the Compensation Committee views the following metrics as key drivers of sustained and longer-term shareholder value and evaluates BB&T's performance in these metrics relative to our peer group:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
In addition, as outlined below, the Compensation Committee uses four metrics (return on assets, earnings per share, return on common equity and total shareholder return) directly in BB&T's short- and long-term incentive programs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   METRIC       PURPOSE 
   METRIC       PURPOSE 
 EARNINGS  PER SHARE ("EPS") AND RETURN ON ASSETS  ("ROA")       EPS and ROA are used in the Annual Incentive Award and measure growth, profitability and our return on investment. We have historically used EPS and ROA as the  performance measures for the Annual Incentive Award because the Compensation Committee believes EPS and ROA have a meaningful bearing on long-term increases in shareholder value and are valuable barometers for our performance. EPS and ROA have a  strong, long-term correlation with shareholder returns.

 RETURN ON COMMON EQUITY ("ROCE")       A three-year average ROCE is used to measure our long-term profitability for PSU and LTIP awards. The Compensation Committee believes that measuring ROCE over a  three-year period relative to the peer group provides a valuable measure of company performance over time.

The Compensation Committee believes that measuring ROCE over a  three-year period relative to the peer group provides a valuable measure of company performance over time.   
 TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN ("TSR")       We use relative TSR as a payment modifier for our PSU and LTIP awards. Payments under our 2018-2020 LTIP and 2018 PSUs are subject to a downward or upward adjustment  based on TSR percentile performance relative to our peer group TSR for the three-year performance period. Measuring relative TSR further aligns compensation to the performance of BB&T as compared to our peers.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
2018 Target Pay Program Mix 
The significant majority of our executive pay program is performance-based. Approximately 86% of our CEO's pay is based on performance and approximately 60% is based on long-term performance. In addition, two-thirds of our CEO's long-term incentive awards vest based on robust performance criteria. 
The charts below illustrate target compensation established for 2018 for our CEO, and the average target compensation for our other NEOs. Such compensation consists of base salary, the Annual Incentive Award, and PSU, LTIP, and RSU awards granted in 2018. The charts also show the large percentage of our NEO compensation that is variable and performance-based.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Our 2018 Compensation Program Updates 
In early 2018, the Compensation Committee made limited modifications to our executive compensation program. These modifications were the result of the Compensation Committee's comprehensive review of our executive compensation program with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant. In making limited modifications, the Compensation Committee also considered the strong support of our executive compensation program by our shareholders, who approved our say-on-pay proposal with approximately 94% support in 2018. As outlined below, the Compensation Committee's actions further align our compensation philosophy with shareholders' interest by placing additional emphasis on pay-for-performance.

Short-Term Incentives 
ANNUAL INCENTIVE AWARD 
Our Annual Incentive Award is a cash incentive based on the following three components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   EPS (48%)                  ROA (32%)                  Qualitative Performance (20%)   
   EPS (48%)                  ROA (32%)                  Qualitative Performance (20%)   
   EPS (48%)                  ROA (32%)                  Qualitative Performance (20%)   
[END TABLE]
The quantitative corporate performance goals are established annually by the Compensation Committee and include an EPS target goal based on our internal earnings plan and an ROA target goal based on our ROA performance relative to our peers. The qualitative performance component is based on the Compensation Committee's assessment of the attainment of key strategic priorities during the performance period. 
While payouts based upon the EPS component and the ROA component are independent from one another, a payout under the qualitative performance component requires the Company to meet threshold performance of either the EPS component or the ROA component. Although payouts under each component of our Annual Incentive Award range from 0% to 150%, the maximum combined amount that may be paid to NEOs is limited to 125% of the target award opportunity.

• Early in 2019, the Compensation Committee evaluated performance on the defined strategic priorities as well as other  considerations. Based on its assessment, the Compensation Committee felt strongly that 2018 was an extraordinary year for BB&T and determined the qualitative component was earned at 150% of target. The Compensation Committee recognized that due  to the overall award payment cap of 125% of target, the achievement of 150% of target for the qualitative component would not materially impact executive payouts; however, based on the Company's strong performance, the Compensation Committee  determined that a score of 150% of target for the qualitative component was appropriate.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• The primary strategic priorities and other factors that led to the Compensation Committee's decision are set forth  below; note that the Compensation Committee did not assign particular weights to any single category:    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhancements in Technology and Cybersecurity: Enhancing our digital capabilities to meet  tomorrow's challenges is critical to our success. In 2018, we continued to expand the implementation and utilization of robotics and automation technology, while also enhancing our cybersecurity and fraud detection capabilities.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Focus on the "Perfect Client Experience": We are committed to keeping the  customer first and foremost in decisions we make. In 2018, we launched our enterprise-wide Voice of the Client program, which provides us near real-time feedback from our clients. We also introduced our Financial Insights platform to perform  customized analysis for clients without in-house financial expertise. In addition, we successfully opened a state-of-the-art BB&T Leadership Institute facility, designed to help client executives lead more effectively.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievements in Financial Performance Measures and Market Results: We are focused on  providing excellent returns for our shareholders. In 2018, BB&T reported record annual earnings, and increased our 2018 relative TSR performance, as compared to 2017, by achieving the highest TSR performance in our peer group. Our strong results  met our profit plan and expense management goals.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Successful Risk and Compliance Initiatives and Results: The successful management of risk  is essential to achieving our vision and mission. In 2018, we continued enhancement of our Anti-Money Laundering controls. We optimized our risk management framework and managed overall risk levels within Board-approved risk appetite.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Corporate Events: We achieved several other milestones in 2018, including  successfully completing the acquisition of Regions Insurance Group. We utilized our "Disrupt to Thrive" initiative to assist with organizational simplification and improved diversity and inclusion through corporate initiatives, including  new internal business resource groups. Through programs such as our Lighthouse Project and BB&T Financial Foundations, we continued to strengthen the communities we serve.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Long-Term Incentives 
BB&T's long-term incentive program provides compensation awarded under the BB&T Corporation 2012 Incentive Plan, as amended (the "2012 Incentive Plan"). For 2018, these awards reflected a mix of cash and equity and included: (i) PSUs, (ii) our LTIP Program and (iii) RSUs, each as discussed below. 
PERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS (PSUS) 
PSUs have been a component to our executive compensation program since 2017. The Compensation Committee chose PSUs to increase the emphasis on performance in our long-term incentive program by linking payouts to relative three-year average ROCE performance and relative TSR performance. PSUs also align NEO compensation with appreciation of BB&T's stock price over the long-term. 
Our 2018 PSUs include the following features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Period: Three years.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting Requirements and Forfeiture: Three-year cliff vesting, to be paid out in March 2021, with 100%  of the award being subject to reduction or forfeiture if there is an aggregate operating loss for the performance period or if a significant negative risk outcome occurs as determined by the Compensation Committee.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Metric: Return on Common Equity ("ROCE"), with payouts based on  BB&T's ROCE performance over the three-year performance period. BB&T must first meet or exceed an average ROCE of 3% for the performance period. If this criterion is met, payouts will be based on BB&T's ROCE relative to our  peer group as follows:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
LTIP PROGRAM 
LTIP awards reward performance using both an absolute ROCE performance threshold and a relative ROCE performance goal over a three-year cycle. The performance goals and payout range are established at the beginning of the cycle. LTIP awards have historically been paid in cash, but at the discretion of the Compensation Committee, may be paid in shares of BB&T common stock, cash or both. The Compensation Committee believes that with approximately 67% of the NEOs' long-term incentive compensation currently consisting of equity, it was appropriate to pay the 2016-2018 LTIP awards in cash, especially in light of the substantial BB&T common stock holdings of each of the NEOs. 
2018-2020 LTIP Cycle (Payable in 2021) 
The 2018-2020 LTIP awards will continue to measure and reward BB&T's ROCE performance relative to the Corporation's peer group over the three-year performance period, subject to BB&T meeting or exceeding an average ROCE of 3% for the performance period. The entire award is subject to reduction or forfeiture if there is an aggregate operating loss for the performance period or if a significant negative risk outcome occurs as determined by the Compensation Committee. The 2018-2020 LTIP awards also are subject to a TSR modifier based on our TSR percentile performance relative to our peer group for the three-year performance period, with an overall payment cap of 125% of the target award:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee retains discretion to make adjustments to our performance, as well as the reported results from members of our peer group, for purposes of making performance-based compensation awards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Throughout the year, the Compensation Committee reviews projected results and items for possible adjustment. In February,  the Compensation Committee receives final performance information for the prior year, and historically has made adjustments to our reported results (e.g., net income) to ensure that the applicable compensatory plans fairly compensate participants  for core BB&T performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee may also make adjustments to the reported performance of peer group members for awards that  measure our performance relative to the peer group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A reconciliation of adjustments that the Compensation Committee made for the purposes of certifying 2018 performance is  included in Annex A to this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
Unless otherwise indicated, discussions of 2018 performance for compensation purposes in this proxy statement include these adjustments made by the Compensation Committee. 
Our NEOs receive limited perquisites and other personal benefits that the Compensation Committee believes are reasonable and consistent with our overall executive compensation program. Such perquisites generally include residential security services, executive physical wellness examinations, occasional use of sports tickets, and spousal participation in limited corporate events. Our NEOs do not receive perquisites such as personal club memberships, corporate housing or automobile allowances. 
PENSION PLAN 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide the BB&T Corporation Pension Plan, a tax-qualified defined benefit  retirement plan for eligible associates (the "Pension Plan"). We are among the few remaining companies that offer a traditional pension plan for our employees. This is a benefit we believe provides a competitive advantage for attracting  and retaining talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We also provide the BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (the  "Excess Plan"), to augment the benefits payable under the Pension Plan to the extent that such benefits are curtailed by application of certain tax limitations. The Compensation Committee believes that the benefits provided by the Excess  Plan ensure that we will receive the executive retention benefits of the Pension Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan are broad-based benefits, and the NEOs participate in both plans on the same basis as  other similarly situated associates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Pension Plan and the Excess Plan provide retirement benefits based on length of service and salary level prior to  retirement with benefits generally increasing substantially as a participant approaches retirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe the retirement benefits provided by the Pension Plan are meaningful to all associates, but especially to those  who devote substantial service to BB&T. Five of the six active NEOs have spent substantially all of their professional careers at BB&T and have built up significant benefits under the Pension Plan. For example, Mr. King has 46 years of  service at BB&T.  
[END TABLE]
Moreover, we view the Pension Plan and the Excess Plan as important retention tools for the NEOs and other highly compensated associates. These retirement benefits could not easily be replicated upon the associate's departure from BB&T prior to retirement. The Compensation Committee believes that while the overall retirement benefits provided to the NEOs are reasonable relative to those provided by its peer group, the Pension Plan and Excess Plan provide us with a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining talent in light of the high number of companies that have frozen or abandoned traditional pension plans in recent years. 
ASSOCIATE BENEFIT PLANS 
During 2018, we maintained various associate benefit plans that constitute a portion of the total compensation package available to the NEOs and all eligible associates of BB&T. These plans consist of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the BB&T Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan, which in 2018 permitted associates to contribute up to 50% of their cash  compensation, on a tax-deferred, or after tax basis, within certain IRS compensation deferral amount limits applicable to tax-qualified retirement plans, with BB&T  matching deferrals up to 6% of their compensation;  
[END TABLE]
46    BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan, which is designed  to augment the benefits under the BB&T Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan to the extent such benefits are curtailed by the application of certain limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (during 2018, eligible participants in the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan were permitted to defer up to 50% of their cash compensation with certain participants eligible to receive a matching contribution of up to 6% of their compensation);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a medical plan that provides coverage for all eligible associates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• disability insurance which, in the event of disability, pays an associate 50% of his or her monthly compensation, subject to  a cap of $35,000 per month, however, if the coverage percentage exceeds the monthly cap, we would provide supplemental payments to a member of Executive Management to bring the monthly payment up to the percentage coverage level; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• certain other welfare benefits (such as sick leave, vacation, dental and vision coverage, etc.).  
[END TABLE]
The associate benefits for the NEOs discussed in this subsection are determined by the same criteria applicable to all of our associates. In general, benefits are designed to provide a safety net of protection against the financial catastrophes that can result from illness, disability or death, and to provide a reasonable level of retirement income based on years of service with BB&T. These benefits are part of the strong value proposition we offer our associates in furtherance of our mission, and help keep us competitive in attracting and retaining associates. We believe that our associate benefits are generally on par with benefits provided by our peer group and consistent with industry standards. 
Section 4—BB&T's Executive Compensation Process 
The Compensation Committee administers BB&T's compensation program for Executive Management, including each of the NEOs, in a manner consistent with our mission, vision and values. The Compensation Committee's authority and responsibilities are set forth in its charter and include, but are not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer, the remaining NEOs and other members of Executive  Management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selecting and approving the performance metrics and goals for the executive compensation program and evaluating performance  at the end of each performance period; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving Annual Incentive Award opportunities, PSUs, RSUs and LTIP award opportunities.  
[END TABLE]
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee uses several resources and tools, including the services of the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"). The Compensation Committee also considers summary analyses of total compensation delineating each compensation element ("tally sheets"), an executive risk scorecard provided by our Chief Risk Officer, competitive benchmarking and other analyses, as further described below. 
The Compensation Committee periodically receives reports from our Chief Risk Officer regarding our risk environment and risk management practices, from our Chief Compliance Officer regarding compliance and risk matters, and from our General Auditor, the head of our internal audit function, regarding our internal controls. In addition, the Compensation Committee regularly reviews the minutes of the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The purpose of these reports and review is to allow the Compensation Committee to evaluate our current risk environment and internal control positions relevant to incentive compensation, and to take these issues into consideration when determining incentive compensation. 
The Chief Executive Officer is also involved in compensation determinations for members of Executive Management, other than himself, including compensation for each of the NEOs, and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee on base salary and the other compensation elements. We believe that the Chief Executive Officer is in the best possible position to assess the performance of the other members of Executive Management, and accordingly, he plays an important role in the compensation setting process. Ultimately, however, decisions about individual compensation elements and total compensation of all members of Executive Management are made by the Compensation Committee, based primarily on the executive officer's performance and our overall performance, with consideration of the business environment in which the results were achieved.

The Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to provide market reference perspective and serve as an advisor. The independent compensation consultant serves at the request of, and reports directly to, the Compensation Committee. Further, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to approve the independent compensation consultant's fees and other retention terms, including the authority to limit the amount of fees the independent compensation consultant may earn from other services provided to BB&T. The Compensation Committee has retained Meridian to act as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. In this capacity, Meridian performed a review of our executive compensation programs, provided peer group analyses, and advised on regulatory developments, corporate governance and best practice trends. 
The Compensation Committee determined that, based on its review, Meridian is independent and that its engagement did not present any conflicts of interest. In making this determination, the Compensation Committee noted that Meridian (a) provides no other services to BB&T other than compensation consulting, (b) has no personal or business relationships with 
48    BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis members of our Board or executive officers, (c) does not directly own any shares of BB&T stock, and (d) retains a written policy designed to avoid conflicts of interest that may arise. Meridian also determined that it was independent from our management and confirmed this in a written statement delivered to the Chair of the Compensation Committee. 
During 2018, the compensation consultant provided the following services to the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed our company's total compensation philosophy for reasonableness and appropriateness;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed overall compensation levels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed our total executive compensation program relative to peers and advised the Compensation Committee of plans or  practices that may be changed to improve effectiveness;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provided market and peer data and recommendations on Executive Management compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed, and advised the Compensation Committee on, the composition of our peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewed public disclosure on compensation, including the draft Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related tables and  compensation disclosures for our proxy statement; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• advised the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation of outside directors.  
[END TABLE]
In order for a compensation consultant to provide effective advice, the Compensation Committee expects them to interact with our management from time to time. These interactions generally involve, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• obtaining compensation and benefits data, as well as other relevant information that is not available from public sources;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• working with management to understand the scope of the various executive jobs in order to provide accurate benchmarking; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conferring with management so that factual and data analyses are accurate and up-to-date.  
[END TABLE]
This process enables the compensation consultant to identify any areas where further research or analysis may be necessary, while allowing it to discuss any changes to the executive compensation program or refine recommendations before finalizing its reports to the Compensation Committee. 
The Compensation Committee uses a peer group to perform competitive assessments of executive compensation as well as to measure performance under our annual and long-term incentive plans. The Compensation Committee approves a group of publicly-traded banks or financial services holding companies each year to serve as the peer group. In evaluating our peer group, the Compensation Committee considered a number of factors, including asset size and market capitalization, and determined that, for 2018, no changes were needed. Given the limited number of banks of our size and market cap, we are among the largest of our peers, and positioned near the 75th percentile of our peer group on both measures. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 v Citizens Financial         v PNC 
 v Comerica         v Regions v Fifth Third         v SunTrust v Huntington         v U.S. Bancorp v KeyCorp         v Wells Fargo v M&T         v  Zions 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee determined that this group would be used for the relative performance comparisons in our Annual Incentive Award (ROA) and our PSUs and LTIP (ROCE, TSR). The Compensation Committee also reviewed the incentive plan design practices of this group when evaluating potential changes to our program for 2018. 
The compensation structure for Executive Management, which includes the NEOs, emphasizes variable pay based on performance. We generally compare each element of compensation as well as total compensation relative to the peer group. Our shareholders have told us that they prefer that compensation opportunities generally not be targeted above the median of the peer group, irrespective of our relative size. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee considers the peer compensation practices with a goal of targeting market median, while giving consideration for each executive's performance, experience and responsibilities. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    49 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
In addition to the external peer group analysis, the Compensation Committee also reviews detailed tally sheets for each executive and reviews the total compensation for each member of the Executive Management team, relative to one another. This practice is consistent with our compensation philosophy of rewarding our associates based upon their level of responsibility within the Corporation. 
2019 PEER GROUP CHANGES 
For 2019, as part of its annual review of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee replaced the two members of our peer group below $100 billion in assets with two larger financial institutions by making the following changes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Outgoing Peers     Incoming Peers 
 Comerica     Capital One 
 Zions     Bank of America 
[END TABLE]
In making these changes, the Compensation Committee considered that the addition of the two larger financial institutions will position BB&T closer to the median of our peer group in terms of asset size and market capitalization. Under the updated peer group, as of December 31, 2018, BB&T would be positioned at approximately the 58th percentile in both asset size and market capitalization. As noted earlier, shareholders we contacted were supportive of these changes. 
We utilize an executive risk scorecard which the Compensation Committee may use to adjust, if necessary, the short-term and long-term incentive compensation of each member of Executive Management (including the NEOs). The executive risk scorecard: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• allows for evaluation of both corporate and individual results that can be compared to stated risk appetites in all risk  categories;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presents the positive and negative risk outcomes that have influenced each risk category, if necessary, and includes  recommended actions with respect to significant negative outcomes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is used in conjunction with the recommendations of the Chief Risk Officer, the CEO and the Compensation Committee's own  insight and evaluation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is included as part of our risk review process in which 100% of each Executive Manager's short-term and long-term  compensation for 2018 was subject to potential adjustment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• was developed by our senior Risk and Compliance Officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• is reviewed by the independent compensation consultant.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that the executive risk scorecard is an important element to ensure that incentive compensation at the Executive Management level is risk-balanced. The use of this risk scorecard has been discussed with our regulators as an additional way to conform to incentive compensation guidance and best practices. 
REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS IN SETTING COMPENSATION 
Banking regulators have provided input on and influenced the compensation practices and incentive compensation at the largest financial institutions in the United States, focusing on the risks intrinsic to the design and implementation of compensation plans as well as the reasonableness of each element of compensation. While we have focused our compensation philosophy on performance-based compensation, regulatory guidance has influenced past decisions with respect to our executive compensation programs. The Compensation Committee continues to assess our pay practices to balance risks with our commitment to link NEO pay to our performance while maintaining executive compensation programs that are market competitive and shareholder aligned. 
Section 5—Other Aspects of BB&T's Executive Compensation Program and Governance Practices 
In addition to the key components of our executive compensation program described above, other significant policies, plans and factors influence executive compensation, including the compensation of the NEOs. These policies and practices ensure strong governance of our executive compensation program and promote alignment of our executives' interests with those of shareholders. 
50    BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee believes that members of Executive Management, including the NEOs, should accumulate meaningful equity stakes in BB&T over time to further align their economic interests with the interests of shareholders, thereby promoting our objective of increasing shareholder value. 
The table below summarizes the stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs. Each of our NEOs currently exceeds these guidelines.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee annually considers whether our executive compensation program encourages unnecessary or excessive risk taking. In reviewing the program for risk, the goal of the Compensation Committee is to design an executive compensation program to encourage prudent risk management and discourage inappropriate risk-taking by granting a diverse portfolio of compensation to our NEOs that is expected to reward the creation of shareholder value over time. To help achieve this goal, the Compensation Committee considers the risk profile of the primary compensation elements. In addition, the Compensation Committee meets twice annually in a joint session with the Audit and Risk Committees. 
The Compensation Committee believes that having market-competitive fixed base salaries discourages inappropriate risk-taking. In addition, executives have a significant proportion of compensation provided in the form of equity awards that have performance and vesting features that extend over several years, as well as stock ownership requirements; this ensures our executives have significant value tied to long-term stock price performance which discourages imprudent risk-taking. Additionally, LTIP and PSU awards are based on our performance over a three-year period, encouraging our NEOs to focus on long-term performance in addition to annual results, further reducing risk-taking that is likely to produce only short-term benefits and allowing sufficient time for risk outcomes to emerge. Our clawback and forfeiture provisions, discussed below, also discourage imprudent risk-taking. 
Our Board believes that the current structure of BB&T's incentive compensation recoupment practices is appropriate, effective, provides a balanced approach to risk management, and properly aligns the interests of our Executive Management and shareholders. 
Our 2012 Incentive Plan and award agreements contain broad language regarding clawbacks and make all awards under the 2012 Incentive Plan subject to recoupment, forfeiture or reduction to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee. Any and all amounts payable or paid under the 2012 Incentive Plan are subject to clawback, forfeiture, and reduction to the extent determined by the Compensation Committee as necessary to comply with applicable law and/or policies adopted by BB&T. When determining incentive compensation and consistent with regulatory guidance, the Compensation Committee evaluates our current risk environment and internal control positions relevant to incentive compensation and reviews an executive risk scorecard and other reports provided by our Chief Risk Officer and our Chief Compliance Officer. The Compensation Committee also receives reports from our General Auditor, the head of BB&T's internal audit function, regarding the effectiveness of our overall system of internal controls. 
Generally, the timing of our regular annual equity awards is determined months in advance of the actual grants in order to coincide with the regular February meetings of the Board and the Compensation Committee. The grant date is established 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    51 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis when the grants and all key terms are approved by the Board or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be. For the 2018 PSU and RSU awards, the Compensation Committee used the closing price of our common stock on the grant date to determine the number of PSU and RSU awards. In addition, the 2012 Incentive Plan includes prohibitions on the repricing of stock options without shareholder approval. We are required to recognize the expense of all share-based awards (such as PSUs and RSUs) in our income statement over the award's minimum required service period. 
Our Codes of Ethics and Insider Trading Policy prohibit all associates, including our directors and members of Executive Management, from speculative trading in BB&T common stock (including prohibitions on buying call options and selling put options for our common stock) and place limitations on a director's or NEO's ability to conduct short-term trading, thus encouraging long-term ownership of common stock. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain a similar restriction and also prohibit directors and Executive Management members from entering into hedging strategies that protect against downside risk in our common stock. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors and Executive Management members may only pledge shares held in excess of each individual's share ownership requirements. In addition, the Corporate Governance Guidelines contain a grandfather provision that permits any pledge that existed prior to December 1, 2013. 
Prior to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Cut Act"), our compensation philosophy and policies were generally intended to comply with Section 162(m) to the extent the Compensation Committee determined appropriate. Section 162(m) generally disallowed a federal income tax deduction for compensation over $1 million paid for any fiscal year to the Chief Executive Officer and the three other highest paid executive officers other than the Chief Financial Officer (referred to as "covered employees"). 
For taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2018, the Tax Cut Act generally eliminated the "performance-based" compensation exception under 162(m). The Tax Cut Act also expanded the $1 million per covered employee annual limitation on deductibility to a larger group of named executive officers. In addition, the Tax Cut Act also provided that any named executive officer who was a covered employee in taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2017, will continue to be a covered employee for all subsequent taxable years (including taxable years after his or her death). 
As a result of the Tax Cut Act, we expect that the Corporation may no longer take an annual deduction for any compensation paid to any of its covered employees in excess of $1 million per executive officer. We also expect that equity awards granted under arrangements entered into or materially modified after November 2, 2017 generally will not be deductible to the extent they result in compensation to our covered employees that exceeds $1 million in any one year for any such officer. 
Due to the continued importance and benefit to the Corporation and our shareholders of awarding compensation that is structured to properly incentivize our executive officers, the Compensation Committee believes that it is in our best interests to retain the flexibility in awarding compensation that is not subject to limitations imposed by the tax laws, even if some awards may be non-deductible compensation expenses to the Corporation. 
BB&T and the Compensation Committee review all elements of our executive compensation program for the NEOs, including a tally sheet for each NEO delineating each element of the NEO's compensation. In designing the various elements of the total executive compensation program, we have taken great care to select elements that are performance-based and to use a variety of performance metrics that, on the whole, will encourage the achievement of short-term and long-term shareholder value while enabling us to retain our talented executives. We believe the total compensation for each NEO is reasonable, and we continue to improve upon our program so that its components and features are consistent with shareholder expectations, market standards and comparable programs of the peer group. The executive compensation program for the NEOs is based on our financial performance and links executive performance to our annual financial and operational results and the long-term financial interests of the shareholders. We further believe that our compensation philosophy is consistent with our corporate culture and objectives and has served, and will continue to serve, as a reasonable basis for administering our total executive compensation program, both for the NEOs and for all of our associates, for the foreseeable future.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee is composed entirely of non-employee directors, each of whom has been determined in the Board's business judgment to be independent based on the categorical standards for independence adopted by the Board, which include the applicable NYSE independence standards. The Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight and review of our compensation and benefit plans, including administering our executive incentive plan, fixing the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and reviewing and approving the compensation for the other members of Executive Management. 
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement is management's report on BB&T's executive compensation program and, among other things, explains the material elements of the compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer and the other NEOs. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement with management. Based on this review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Submitted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, whose current members are: 
The directors who constituted the Compensation Committee during some or all of 2018 were Anna R. Cablik, Patrick C. Graney III, Louis B. Lynn, Ph.D., Eric C. Kendrick, Easter A. Maynard and Thomas N. Thompson. None of the individuals who served as a member of the Compensation Committee during 2018 was at any time an officer or an employee of BB&T or any of its subsidiaries had any relationship with us requiring disclosure under SEC regulations.

NARRATIVE TO 2018 PENSION BENEFITS TABLE 
We maintain the BB&T Corporation Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") and the BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan (the "Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan"). For a discussion of the valuation methods and material assumptions applied in quantifying the present value of the current accrued benefit under each of these plans, as set forth in the table above, please refer to Note 12 "Benefit Plans" in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and filed with the SEC on February 26, 2019. A discussion of each of these plans is set forth below. 
Tax-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan. The Pension Plan is a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan for eligible associates. Most associates of BB&T and its subsidiaries who have attained age 21 are eligible to participate in the Pension Plan after completing one year of service. Our contributions to the Pension Plan are computed on an actuarial basis. No participant contributions are permitted. A participant's annual normal retirement benefit under the Pension Plan at age 65 is an amount equal to 1.0% of the participant's final average compensation plus 0.5% of the participant's final average compensation in excess of Social Security covered compensation, multiplied by the number of years of creditable service completed up to a maximum of 35 years. A participant's final average compensation is his or her average annual cash compensation, including salary, wages, overtime, bonuses and incentive compensation, for the five consecutive years in the last ten years in which he or she receives compensation that produces the highest average. 
Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan. The Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan is an excess benefit plan designed to provide supplemental pension benefits for certain highly compensated associates, including the NEOs, to the extent that their benefits under the Pension Plan are curtailed due to IRS compensation and benefit limitations. Benefits under the Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan are included in the table above. 
Retirement. Mr. King, Mr. Henson, Mr. Starnes, Mr. Bible and Ms. Goodrich have met the requirements for retirement under the Pension Plan and the Non-Qualified Defined Benefit Plan; Ms. Duck currently is not eligible for retirement. Associates with at least 10 years of service who have attained age 55 are eligible to retire and begin receiving a reduced pension immediately. If an associate begins pension payments prior to normal retirement age, the payments are reduced based on a plan-specified reduction schedule.

NARRATIVE TO 2018 NON-QUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE 
The BB&T Corporation Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan (the "Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan") is an excess benefit plan that provides supplemental benefits to certain highly-compensated associates, including the NEOs, to the extent that their benefits under the BB&T Corporation 401(k) Savings Plan are curtailed due to the application of certain IRS benefit and compensation limitations. During 2018, eligible associates were permitted to defer up to 50% of their cash compensation under the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan, with certain participants, including each NEO, eligible to receive a matching contribution up to 6% of his or her compensation. All cash compensation is eligible for deferral unless prohibited under Code Section 409A. Plan participants may select deemed investment funds under the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan that are identical to the investment funds offered under the 401(k) Plan with the exception that no deemed investments of BB&T common stock are permitted. Participants make an election upon entering the Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan regarding the timing of plan distributions. The two allowable distribution elections are distribution upon termination or distribution upon reaching age 65. The Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan also allows for an in-service hardship withdrawal based on facts and circumstances that meet Internal Revenue Service guidelines. The Non-Qualified Defined Contribution Plan also provides participants in our incentive compensation plans with an effective means of electing to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of the payments that they are entitled to receive under such plans.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL 
The potential payments to the NEOs pursuant to existing plans and arrangements in the event of their termination or a change of control at December 31, 2018 are shown in the table below. BB&T has entered into employment agreements with each member of Executive Management, including each of the NEOs. Several of the important provisions of these employment agreements are discussed below, including the noncompetition and nonsolicitation conditions, which generally are a prerequisite to receiving termination payments under the employment agreements.

[END TABLE]
NARRATIVE TO POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL TABLE 
Amounts shown in the table above and in the discussion below assume the NEO terminates employment on December 31, 2018, and are estimates of the amounts the NEO would receive upon termination. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of a NEO's termination of employment. The amounts reported above do not include amounts that would be provided to a NEO under plans and arrangements that are generally available to all salaried associates. The amounts listed above also do not include amounts reported in the "2018 Pension Benefits" and "2018 Non-qualified Deferred Compensation" tables. 
Voluntary Termination or Retirement. Upon voluntary termination by a NEO, any unvested awards and benefits (that are not subject to acceleration due to the NEO's retirement eligibility) would be forfeited. Messrs. King, Henson, Starnes, Bible and Ms. Goodrich, are over 55 years of age, have more than 10 years of service with the Corporation and are "retirement eligible." Therefore, upon the end of their employment with the Corporation each would generally be entitled to accelerated vesting of outstanding unvested equity awards. 
Termination for Just Cause. If the Corporation or Branch Bank terminates a NEO's employment for "Just Cause," the NEO will not have the right to receive any compensation or other benefits under the employment agreement for any period after 
62    BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation of Executive Officers such termination other than compensation that is earned but unpaid, unreimbursed expenses, and accrued and vested benefits. 
Payments Made Upon Death or Disability. In the event of the death or disability, and subsequent termination, of any of our NEOs, the Corporation and Branch Bank will use their best efforts to accelerate vesting of any unvested benefits to which the NEO may be entitled under any stock-based or other benefit plan or arrangement to the extent permitted by the terms of such plans. The Corporation generally does not terminate associates as a result of disability. 
Termination for Other than Just Cause or Voluntary Termination for Good Reason. If a NEO's employment is terminated either (i) through voluntary termination by a NEO for "Good Reason" or (ii) by the Corporation or Branch Bank other than for "Just Cause," he or she will be entitled to receive monthly payments of cash compensation (including salary and bonuses) equal to one-twelfth of the highest annual amount of such compensation over the past three years, for officers other than Mr. King, and the officer will also receive associate welfare benefits, including health care, and outplacement services, for the full three year term (or, for officers other than Mr. King, until age 65 if that is a shorter period). For Mr. King, the amount of severance benefits due, if any, is determined by reference to Mr. King's average annual cash compensation for the three years prior to the year of termination rather than by reference to the highest such year of cash compensation. 
In addition, the Corporation and Branch Bank will use their best efforts to accelerate vesting of any unvested benefits to which the NEO may be entitled under any stock-based or other benefit plan or arrangement to the extent permitted by the terms of such plans. The receipt by any of the NEOs of payments and other benefits under his employment agreement is subject to compliance with the noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions of the applicable employment agreement, which are described below. 
Change of Control. The employment agreements of NEOs, other than Mr. King, provide that if a NEO's employment is terminated by the NEO or the Corporation for any reason (other than for "Just Cause" or on account of the death of the NEO) within twelve months after a "Change of Control" of the Corporation, the NEO will be entitled to receive the termination compensation and the other benefits described above under column titled, "Change of Control" in the table above. However, in the event of a termination in connection with a "Change of Control," the NEO generally will not be required to comply with the noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions of the applicable employment agreement. Mr. King's employment agreement requires, in reference to "Change of Control," that a termination by Mr. King be a termination for "Good Reason" or that a termination by the Corporation or Branch Bank be without "Just Cause" in order for Mr. King to receive such compensation and benefits. 
A "Change of Control" is generally deemed to have occurred under the employment agreements if: 
In addition, for the NEOs other than Mr. King, the Corporation's Board of Directors can determine, in its discretion, that a transaction constitutes a "Merger of Equals," even though one or more of the above definitions of a "Change of Control" is met, and, upon such determination, the applicable individual will not be entitled to terminate his or her employment agreement voluntarily and receive continued salary and benefits unless "Good Reason" exists. 
Employment Agreements. The following discussion is as of December 31, 2018. We have entered into employment agreements with each NEO to secure the services of key talent within the highly competitive financial services industry. Generally, the employment agreements are structured to carefully balance the individual financial goals of the executives relative to the needs of BB&T and its shareholders. The employment agreements provide that the NEOs are guaranteed minimum annual salaries equal to their current annual base salaries and continued participation in incentive compensation plans that BB&T or Branch Bank may from time to time extend to its similarly situated officers. During the term of the employment agreements, each NEO is entitled to participate in and receive, on the same basis as other similarly situated officers of BB&T and Branch Bank, pension and welfare benefits and other benefits such as sick leave, vacation, group disability and health, life and accident insurance and similar non-cash compensation that BB&T or Branch Bank may from time to time extend to its officers. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    63 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
The employment agreements for the NEOs provide that, under certain circumstances upon leaving the employment of BB&T and Branch Bank, the executive may not compete in the banking business, directly or indirectly, against the Corporation, Branch Bank and their affiliates. This prohibition generally precludes the NEO from working for a direct competitor with a banking presence within the continental United States. Additionally, the employment agreements for the NEOs prohibit the executive from soliciting or assisting in the solicitation of any of our depositors, customers, or affiliates, or inducing any of our associates to terminate their employment with BB&T or its affiliates. These noncompetition and nonsolicitation provisions generally will be effective until the one-year anniversary of the NEO's termination. These noncompetition provisions generally are not effective if the NEO terminates employment after a "Change of Control." 
The employment agreements have terms of 36 months that automatically extend monthly by an additional month, absent contrary notice by either party. The term of any employment agreement ends when such NEO reaches age 65, with the exception of Mr. King, whose employment agreement does not contain that provision. The Compensation Committee believes that a three-year term provides appropriate incentives for retention, protections against unjustified terminations, and is in line with other financial services companies. The employment agreements provide for reductions in payments to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding the limits established by Section 280G of the Code. Payments in excess of these limits are often referred to as "excess parachute payments," and exceeding the Section 280G limits generally triggers an excise tax on the payments.

Compensation of Directors 
NARRATIVE TO 2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing, on an annual basis, the compensation paid to our directors and making recommendations to the Board. Working with our compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee annually assesses the competitiveness of BB&T's director compensation program relative to our peers. In making this assessment, the Compensation Committee reviews (i) the individual pay components of our program relative to the pay components for directors at our peers, (ii) the average total compensation of board members, and (iii) our total board cost as compared to our peer group. Based on the Compensation Committee's recommendation and assessment for 2018, the Board increased the annual retainer from $60,000 to $65,000, the annual retainer for the Lead Director and the Chairs of the Audit, Compensation, Executive, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Risk Committees from $15,000 to $20,000 and the equity awards from $110,000 to $125,000. 
The director compensation shown in the table above reflects total compensation paid to each director for service as a joint member on the Boards of BB&T and Branch Bank. A director who is also an associate of BB&T or its subsidiaries is not eligible to receive any retainer or fees for service on the Board of Directors. 
In 2018, our non-management directors received the following fees:

Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. We maintain the BB&T Amended and Restated Non-Employee Directors' Deferred Compensation Plan. This plan permits participating non-employee directors to defer 50% or 100% of their retainer or meeting fees into a deferred savings account. Deferrals are fully vested at all times and are payable in cash upon termination of the director's service on the Board. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines. BB&T requires non-employee directors to hold or control an amount of common stock equal to 5x his or her annual retainer. All non-employee directors are expected to meet this ownership requirement by the later of (i) five years following his or her initial appointment as a director, or (ii) such period of time as it may take to reach the ownership requirement threshold by holding shares or RSUs granted by BB&T pursuant to our equity compensation arrangements.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
SEC rules require us to disclose the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, Kelly King, to the median employee's (associate's) annual total compensation. For 2018, Mr. King's annual total compensation was $8,600,690 and the median associate's annual total compensation was $68,778. These amounts include the value of certain non-discriminatory benefits. Based upon this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. King to the median associate was 125 to 1. 
As permitted by SEC rules, we are using the same median associate we identified in the "Pay Ratio Disclosure" section of our 2018 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement because there has been no change to our associate population or associate compensation arrangements that we believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure in this Proxy Statement. For the 2018 Annual Meeting Proxy Statement, we examined our associate population, excluding our CEO, as of December 31, 2017. The median associate was determined by reviewing wages, tips and other compensation on payroll records for our associate population, as reported to the IRS on Form W-2. 
In determining to use the same median associate, we considered a small decrease in the total number of our U.S. associates (both higher and lower compensated), and concluded that this change would not result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. The change in our pay ratio, as compared to last year, results from the decrease in 2018 compensation as compared to 2017 compensation for both Mr. King and the median associate, which is primarily a result of the increase in the discount rate that was used to value pension benefits. 
The pay ratio identified above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. Pay ratios that are reported by our peers may not be directly comparable to ours because of differences in the composition of each company's workforce, as well as the assumptions and methodologies used in calculating the pay ratio, as permitted by SEC rules.

Stock Ownership Information 
Under the federal securities laws, our directors and executive officers subject to Section 16 ("Section 16") of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), are required to report their beneficial ownership of BB&T stock and any changes in that ownership to the SEC. Specific deadlines for such reporting have been established by the SEC. Based solely on a review of copies of such reports, and written representations from each reporting person that no other reports are required, we believe that for 2018 all reporting persons filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16, except that Charles A. Patton inadvertently filed one late Form 4 with respect to one transaction in connection with a trust in which he has beneficial ownership.

Related Person Transactions 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Pursuant to our Related Person Transactions Policy, it is our policy to approve or ratify related person transactions only when the Board, acting through the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, determines that the related person transaction in question is consistent with the best interests of BB&T and its shareholders. 
The term "related person transaction," under the Policy, generally means a transaction where the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which a related person has a direct or indirect material interest. A "related person" under the Policy generally means (a) a director, director nominee or executive officer of BB&T; (b) a person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our common stock; and (c) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, which means any child, stepchild, parent, stepparent, spouse, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law or sister-in-law of the director, executive officer, nominee, or more than five percent beneficial owner, and any person (other than a tenant or employee) sharing the household of such director, executive officer, nominee, or more than five percent beneficial owner. The transactions described under this caption are "related person transactions" and have been approved and ratified in accordance with our Policy. 
To help the Board assess whether a material relationship exists for both independence and related person transactions purposes, our Board adopted guidance with regards to charitable contributions. Under this guidance, a related person who serves as an executive officer, director or trustee of a charitable or non-profit organization that receives a contribution from BB&T will not be deemed to have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Within the past three years, the aggregate amount of all such contributions during any single fiscal year of the charitable  or non-profit organization did not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of the charitable or non-profit organization's consolidated gross revenues for that  fiscal year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The charitable or non-profit organization is not a family foundation created by the  related person or an immediate family member of the related person.  
[END TABLE]
A number of our directors, members of Executive Management, including our NEOs, and their affiliates are customers of our bank subsidiary. All extensions of credit made to them are made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to the lender, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to the lender. Other than as described below, since January 1, 2018, there have been no related party transactions that were required either to be approved or ratified under our related party transaction guidelines or reported under the SEC's related party transaction rules. 
Donna Goodrich is a member of our Executive Management. Her spouse, Carlos Goodrich, and son-in-law, Christian Corts, are both employed at Branch Bank. For the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. Goodrich's and Mr. Cort's total compensation was approximately $366,000 and $437,000, respectively. These compensation arrangements are consistent with those made available to associates of Branch Bank with similar years of experience and positions within the company. Messrs. Goodrich and Corts each also participate in company benefit plans available to all other associates in similar positions. 
Dr. Qubein has executed a separate consulting agreement with us to provide business development consulting services for a period of ten years following his retirement from our Board. He will receive a sum equal to the annual retainer paid to our directors in effect at the time he begins such service. During the time he serves as our consultant, he has agreed not to serve as a director of, or an adviser to, a competing business.

We encourage you to vote via the Internet or by telephone. Voting in this manner will result in cost savings for us. If you vote via the Internet or by telephone, please do not return your proxy card. Shareholders who vote via the Internet may incur costs, such as telephone and Internet access charges, for which the shareholder is responsible. The Internet and telephone voting facilities for eligible shareholders of record will close at 11:59 p.m., EDT, on Monday, April 29, 2019. If you have questions or need assistance in voting your shares, please call our proxy solicitors, Georgeson LLC at (888) 613-3524 (toll free). 
Shareholders who hold shares in "street name," or beneficial owners that hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, should instruct their nominee to vote their shares by following the instructions provided by the nominee. 
A proxy that is properly signed and dated, but which does not contain voting instructions, will be voted in accordance with our Board's recommendations for each proposal. Three of our executives, Kelly S. King, Christopher L. Henson and Robert J. Johnson, Jr., have been designated as the proxies to cast the votes of our shareholders at the annual meeting. 
Your vote as a shareholder is important. Please vote as soon as possible to ensure that your vote is recorded. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    71 
Voting and Other Information 
Approval of each proposal other than the election of directors requires a majority of votes cast voting for the proposal. For the election of directors, each director must receive a majority of votes cast in order to be elected. 
A broker or other nominee may generally vote your shares without instruction on routine matters but not on non-routine matters. A broker "non-vote" occurs when your broker submits a proxy for your shares but does not indicate a vote for a particular "non-routine" proposal (Proposals 1 and 3) because your broker does not have authority to vote on that proposal and has not received specific voting instructions from you. Broker non-votes, as well as abstentions, are not counted as votes cast for or against any of the proposals, and therefore will not affect the outcome of the vote. Holders of our common stock do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors. 
The proxy may be revoked by a shareholder at any time before it is exercised by filing with the Secretary of BB&T an instrument revoking it, filing a duly executed proxy bearing a later date (including a proxy given over the Internet or by telephone), or by attending the meeting and electing to vote in person. Even if you plan to attend the annual meeting, you are encouraged to vote your shares by proxy. 
We deliver proxy materials primarily through the Internet, in accordance with SEC rules. In addition to reducing the amount of paper used in producing these materials, this method lowers the costs associated with mailing the proxy materials to shareholders. Shareholders who own BB&T common shares directly and not through a bank, broker or intermediary ("record holders"), will have proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials delivered directly to their mailing address or electronically if they have previously consented to that delivery method. Shareholders whose shares are held for them by banks, brokerages or other intermediaries ("beneficial holders"), will have the proxy materials or the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials forwarded to them by the intermediary that holds the shares. 
If you received only a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless you request a copy by following the instructions on the notice. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also contains instructions for accessing and reviewing the proxy materials over the Internet and provides directions for submitting your vote over the Internet. 
To reduce the expenses of delivering duplicate proxy materials to shareholders, we rely on SEC rules that permit us to deliver only one set of applicable proxy materials to multiple shareholders who share an address, unless we receive contrary instructions from any shareholder at that address. All shareholders sharing an address will continue to receive separate proxy cards based on their registered ownership of BB&T common stock. Any shareholder sharing such an address who does not receive an individual proxy statement, our 2018 Annual Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K, may write or call BB&T's transfer agent as specified below and we will promptly deliver the materials at no cost. For future meetings, a registered shareholder may request separate copies of our proxy materials or request that we only send one set of these materials if the shareholder is receiving multiple copies, by telephoning our transfer agent at 1-800-213-4314, or writing the transfer agent at: Computershare Trust Company N.A., P.O. Box 505005, Louisville, KY 40233-5005. If your shares are held in "street name," you may contact Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc., Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 or by calling 1-866-540-7095. 
A shareholder may obtain a copy of our 2018 Annual Report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (including the financial statements and financial statement schedules), without charge by contacting Computershare at the address above, or their bank, broker or other nominee. 
All expenses incurred in this solicitation will be paid by BB&T. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, over the Internet and by telephone, our directors, officers and associates, may solicit proxies on behalf of BB&T without additional compensation. We have engaged Georgeson LLC, to act as our proxy solicitor and have agreed to pay it approximately $20,000 plus reasonable expenses for such services. Banks, brokerage houses and other institutions, nominees and fiduciaries are requested to forward the proxy materials to beneficial holders and to obtain authorization for the execution of proxies. Upon request, we will reimburse these parties for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial holders.

Voting and Other Information 
Shareholder proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement. Under SEC Rule 14a-8, a shareholder desiring to make a proposal to be included in the proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must present such proposal to the following address: Secretary, BB&T Corporation, 200 West Second Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101. Proposals must be received no later than the close of business on November 20, 2019, and must comply with SEC Rule 14a-8 in order for the proposal to be considered for inclusion in the Corporation's proxy statement. 
Director nominations for inclusion in our proxy statement (Proxy Access). As set forth in our bylaws, a shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders that has held at least 3% of our company's stock for at least three years is able to submit director nominees for up to 25% of the Board (at least two directors) for inclusion in our proxy statement if the shareowner(s) and nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws and notice is received between 150 and 120 days before the anniversary of the date the proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting was released to shareholders. In order for a nominee to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, a shareholder must deliver timely notice in writing to the Secretary (at the address above) no earlier than October 21, 2019, and no later than November 20, 2019. The notice must contain the specific information required by Article II, Section 14 of our bylaws. 
Shareholder proposals and director nominations—Generally. Under our bylaws, for business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a shareholder a shareholder must deliver timely notice in writing to our Secretary (at the address above) at least 120 days, but no more than 150 days (no earlier than October 21, 2019 and no later than November 20, 2019), in advance of the first anniversary of the notice date of our proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting. The notice must contain the notice and informational requirements described under Article II, Section 10 of the bylaws and applicable SEC proxy rules. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge or introduce any shareholder proposal or nomination if notice thereof is not received within the applicable deadlines or does not comply with the bylaws. 
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board does not know of any other matter to be presented for consideration at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders other than the items referred to in this proxy statement. In the event that any other matter requiring a vote of the shareholders is properly brought before the meeting for shareholder action, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying proxy to vote such proxy in accordance with their best judgment. 
BB&T Corporation | 2019 Proxy Statement    73 
Annex A—Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
ANNEX A—NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
As previously described, for the purposes of certifying BB&T's performance under BB&T's compensation plans, the Compensation Committee typically makes adjustments to BB&T's GAAP results to ensure that the participants are compensated for BB&T's core performance. For 2018, the Compensation Committee made adjustments to BB&T's GAAP net income, as set forth in the tables below ("Adjusted Net Income"). Typically, the Compensation Committee adjusts BB&T's GAAP net income for gains or losses on sales of businesses, merger-related and restructuring charges and similar non-core performance items, on a pre-tax basis, provided the adjustment is not solely a tax-related item. These adjustments are made so that participants are compensated for BB&T's core performance and are neither penalized nor rewarded for non-core charges, unusual gains, or similar non-core events. Executive Management also uses these financial measures in evaluating BB&T's financial performance. To the extent practicable, the Compensation Committee also makes similar adjustments to the reported performance of peer group members for awards that measure BB&T's performance relative to the peer group. 
The adjustments for 2018 impact the Annual Incentive Award's performance metrics, earnings per share and return on assets, and the three-year average ROCE for LTIP purposes. BB&T derives each of these non-GAAP performance metrics from its Adjusted Net Income, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and accordingly, each of these adjusted financial measures is determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. 
The adjusted earnings per share and return on assets measures are each calculated in the same manner as their GAAP counterparts, except that Adjusted Net Income for the applicable performance metric is substituted for its GAAP counterpart in each calculation. Please refer to the adjustments table and accompanying narratives for additional detail on the ROCE calculations and GAAP reconciliation.
