The information provided in this Proxy Statement relates to Security Federal Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Security Federal Bank.  Security Federal Corporation may also be referred to as "Security Federal" and Security Federal Bank may also be referred to as the "Bank."  References to "we," "us" and "our" refer to Security Federal and, as the context requires, Security Federal Bank.
 INFORMATION ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING  
Our annual meeting will be held as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Date:  Thursday, April 18, 2019  
 Time:  11:00 a.m., Eastern time  
 Place:  Newberry Hall, located at 117 Newberry Street, SW, Aiken, South Carolina  
[END TABLE]
Matters to Be Considered at the Annual Meeting
At the meeting, you will be asked to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal 1.  The election of four directors to each serve for a three-year term and one director to serve for a one-year term.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal 2:  An advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
We also will transact any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting.  As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other business to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than the matters described in this Proxy Statement.
Who is Entitled to Vote?
We have fixed the close of business on March 6, 2019 as the record date for shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at our annual meeting.  Only holders of record of Security Federal's common stock on that date are entitled to notice of and to vote at the annual meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each share of Security Federal common stock you own.  On the record date, there were 2,955,357 shares of Security Federal common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting.
How Do I Vote at the Annual Meeting?
Proxies are solicited to provide all shareholders on the voting record date an opportunity to vote on matters scheduled for the annual meeting and described in these materials.  This question provides voting instructions for shareholders of record.  You are a shareholder of record if your shares of Security Federal common stock are held in your name.  If you are a beneficial owner of Security Federal common stock held by a broker, bank or other nominee (i.e., in "street name"), please see the instructions in the following question.
Shares of Security Federal common stock can only be voted if the shareholder is present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting.  To ensure your representation at the annual meeting, we recommend you vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the annual meeting.  You can always change your vote at the meeting if you are a shareholder of record.
Voting instructions are included on your proxy card.  Shares of Security Federal common stock represented by properly executed proxies will be voted by the individuals named on the proxy card in accordance with the shareholder's instructions.  Where properly executed proxies are returned to us with no specific instruction as how to vote at the annual meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the shares FOR the election of each of our director nominees and FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.  If any other matters are properly presented at the annual meeting for action, the persons named in the enclosed proxy and acting thereunder will have the discretion to vote on these matters in accordance with their best judgment.  We do not currently expect that any other matters will be properly presented for action at the annual meeting.
You may receive more than one proxy card depending on how your shares are held.  For example, you may hold some of your shares individually, some jointly with your spouse and some in trust for your children.  In this case, you will receive three separate proxy cards to vote.
What if My Shares Are Held in Street Name?
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in street name by a broker, your broker, as the record holder of the shares, is required to vote the shares in accordance with your instructions.  If your common stock is held in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker that you must follow in order to have your shares voted.  Your broker may allow you to deliver your voting instructions via the telephone or the Internet.  Please see the instruction form that accompanies this Proxy Statement.  If you do not give instructions to your broker, your broker may nevertheless vote the shares with respect to discretionary items, but will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to non-discretionary items, pursuant to current industry practice.  In the case of non-discretionary items, the shares not voted will be treated as "broker non-votes."  Both of the proposals included in this Proxy Statement are non-discretionary items; therefore, you must provide instructions to your broker in order to have your shares voted with respect to the proposals.
If your shares are held in street name and you wish to change your voting instructions after you have returned your voting instruction form to your broker, you must contact your broker.  If your shares are held in street name, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the annual meeting.  A recent brokerage statement or letter from the record holder of your shares are examples of proof of ownership.  If you want to vote your shares of common stock held in street name in person at the annual meeting, you will have to get a written proxy in your name from the broker, bank or other nominee who holds your shares.
How Many Shares Must Be Present to Hold the Meeting?
A quorum must be present at the meeting for any business to be conducted.  The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Security Federal common stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting as of the record date will constitute a quorum.  Proxies received but marked as abstentions or broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of shares considered to be present at the meeting.
What if a Quorum Is Not Present at the Meeting?
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the meeting, a majority of the shareholders present or represented by proxy may adjourn the meeting until a quorum is present.  The time and place of the adjourned meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken, and no other notice will be given unless the meeting is adjourned for more than 30 days or a new record date is set.  An adjournment will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the meeting.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 1: Election of Directors
Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting by holders of Security Federal common stock.  Accordingly, the five nominees for election as directors who receive the highest number of votes actually cast will be elected.  Pursuant to our Articles of Incorporation, shareholders are not permitted to cumulate  their votes for the election of directors.  Votes may be cast for or withheld from each nominee.  Votes that are withheld will have no effect on the outcome of the election because the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the election of each of its director nominees.
Vote Required to Approve Proposal 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation
The advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast, in person or by proxy, at the annual meeting.  Abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute votes cast and therefore will have no effect on approval of the proposal.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.
May I Revoke My Proxy?
You may revoke your proxy before it is voted by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• submitting a new proxy with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• notifying the Secretary of Security Federal in writing before the annual meeting that you have revoked your proxy; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Any written notice revoking a proxy should be delivered to Robert E. Alexander, Secretary, Security Federal Corporation, 238 Richland Avenue, NW, Aiken, South Carolina 29801.
If you plan to attend the annual meeting and wish to vote in person, we will give you a ballot at the annual meeting.  However, if your shares are held in street name, you must bring a validly executed proxy from the nominee indicating that you have the right to vote your shares.
 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT  
The following table sets forth, as of March 6, 2019, the voting record date, information regarding share ownership of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• those persons or entities (or groups of affiliated persons or entities) known by management to beneficially own more than five percent of Security Federal's common stock, other than directors and executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each director and director nominee of Security Federal;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each executive officer of Security Federal or the Bank named in the Summary Compensation Table appearing under "Executive Compensation" below (known as "named executive officers"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all current directors and executive officers of Security Federal and the Bank as a group.  
[END TABLE]
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of five percent of Security Federal's common stock are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and provide a copy to us, reports disclosing their ownership pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  To our knowledge, no other person or entity, other than those set forth below, beneficially owned more than five percent of the outstanding shares of Security Federal's common stock as of the close of business on the voting record date.
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  In accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of common stock if  he or she has voting and/or investment power with respect to those shares.  Therefore, the table below includes shares owned by spouses, other immediate family members in trust, shares held in retirement accounts or funds for the benefit of the named individuals, and other forms of ownership, over which shares the persons named in the table may possess voting and/or investment power.  In addition, in computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, shares of common stock that may be acquired within 60 days of the  voting record date through the conversion of Security Federal senior convertible debentures are included in the number of shares beneficially owned by the person and are deemed outstanding for the purpose of calculating the person's percentage ownership.  These shares, however, are not deemed outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

  PROPOSAL 1 – ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  
Our Board of Directors consists of eleven members and is divided into three classes.  Approximately one-third of the directors are elected annually to serve for a three-year period or until their respective successors are elected and qualified.  The table below sets forth information regarding each director of Security Federal and each nominee for director.  In October 2018, the Board of Directors appointed Jessica T. Cummins as a director.  On February 21, 2019, Gasper L. Toole, III announced his intention to retire from the Board effective as of the annual meeting of shareholders.  In connection with the retirement of Gasper L. Toole, III, the Board determined to nominate Frampton W. Toole, III.  Ms. Cummins and Mr. Toole were each recommended for nomination by independent directors.
The Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors selects nominees for election as directors.  The Nominating Committee has nominated Thomas L. Moore, J. Chris Verenes, Richard T. Harmon and Frampton W. Toole, III each to serve for a term of three years and Jessica T. Cummins  to serve for a term of one year.  With the exception of Mr. Toole, all of our nominees currently serve as directors of Security Federal and Security Federal Bank.  Each nominee has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and has agreed to serve if elected.  If a nominee is unable to stand for election, the Board of Directors may either reduce the number of directors to be elected or select a substitute nominee.  If a substitute nominee is selected, the proxy holders will vote your shares for the substitute nominee, unless you have withheld authority.  At this time, we are not aware of any reason why a nominee might be unable to serve if elected.
The Board of Directors recommends a vote FOR the election of Thomas L. Moore, J. Chris Verenes, Richard T. Harmon, Frampton W. Toole, III and Jessica T. Cummins.

  MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS
AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS  
Board of Directors
The Boards of Directors of Security Federal and the Bank conduct their business through Board and committee meetings.  During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Security Federal Board of Directors held 12 regular meetings.  The Board of Directors of the Bank generally meets on a monthly basis and during the year ended December 31, 2018, met 25 times.  No director attended fewer than 75% of the total meetings of the Boards and committees on which he served during this period.
Committees and Committee Charters
Security Federal's Board of Directors has standing Executive, Audit, Compensation, Proxy and Nominating Committees. The Bank's Board of Directors has standing Executive, Audit, Compensation, Loan and Review  Committees.  Security Federal's Audit and Nominating Committees have adopted written charters and copies of these charters are available on our website at www.securityfederalbank.com.
Committees of the Security Federal Board of Directors
The Executive Committee, comprised of Directors Simmons (Chairman), Toole, Alexander, Weeks, Verenes Lindburg, Harmon, Thomas and Cummins, meets on an as needed basis to handle matters arising between Board meetings.  This Committee did not meet during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Audit Committee, comprised of Directors Moore (Chairman), Clyburn, Alexander, Simmons and Thomas assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.  This Committee is responsible for reviewing our annual audited financial statements and any financial statements submitted to the public, appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm and monitoring the independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditing department.  The Board of Directors has determined that there is no "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the SEC; however, the Board believes that the current members of the Audit Committee are qualified to serve based on their collective experience and background.  Directors Moore, Clyburn, Alexander and Thomas are "independent," pursuant to the rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq") governing audit committee membership.  Director Simmons is not independent for purposes of audit committee membership.  Although Security Federal's common stock is not listed on Nasdaq, it has chosen to apply Nasdaq's definition of independence, as permitted by the SEC.  This Committee met 12 times during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Compensation Committee, which also serves as the Stock Option Committee, is comprised of Directors Simmons (Chairman), Toole, Alexander and Weeks.  This Committee meets on an as needed basis and makes recommendations to the Board regarding annual contributions to certain benefit plans and salaries for officers and employees.  This Committee also determines certain minor administrative matters related to certain employee benefit plans.  Each member of the Committee is "independent," as defined by Nasdaq, with the exception of Mr. Simmons.  This Committee met once during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Proxy Committee, which is composed of Directors Simmons (Chairman), Toole, Alexander, Weeks, Moore and Clyburn, is responsible for voting the proxies of Security Federal's shareholders.  The Committee met once during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Nominating Committee, consisting of Directors Simmons (Chairman), Toole, Alexander, Weeks, Moore and Clyburn was formed to ensure that we maintain the highest standards and best practices in all critical areas relating to the management of our business.  This Committee also selects nominees for the election of directors and develops a list of nominees for board vacancies.  Each member of the Committee is "independent," as defined by Nasdaq.  The Committee met twice during the year ended December 31, 2018.
Only those nominations made by the Committee or properly presented by shareholders will be voted upon at the meeting.  In its deliberations for selecting candidates for nominees as director, the Nominating Committee considers the candidate's knowledge of the banking business and involvement in community, business and civic affairs, and also considers whether the candidate would provide for adequate representation of the Bank's market area.  Any nominee for director made by the Committee must be highly qualified with regard to some or all these attributes.  In searching for qualified director candidates to fill vacancies in the Board, the Committee solicits its current Board of Directors for names of potentially qualified candidates.  Additionally, the Committee may request that members of the Board of Directors pursue their own business contacts for the names of potentially qualified candidates.  The Committee would then consider the potential pool of director candidates, select the candidate the Committee believes best meets the then-current needs of the Board, and conduct a thorough investigation of the proposed candidate's background to ensure there is no past history that would cause the candidate not to be qualified to serve as a director of Security Federal.  The Committee will consider director candidates recommended by Security Federal's shareholders.  If a shareholder submits a proposed nominee, the Committee would consider the proposed nominee, along with any other proposed nominees recommended by members of Security Federal's Board of Directors, in the same manner in which the Committee would evaluate its nominees for director.  For a description of the proper procedure for shareholder nominations, see "Shareholder Proposals and Nominations" in this Proxy Statement. As noted above, the Nominating Committee considers a number of criteria when selecting new members of the Board.  Those criteria as well as viewpoint, skill, gender, race and national origin are considered to provide for diversity on our Board of Directors.  These diversity factors are considered when the Nominating Committee and Board are seeking to fill a vacancy or new seat on the Board.
Committees of the Security Federal Bank Board of Directors
The Executive Committee is composed of Directors Verenes (Chairman), Toole, Alexander, Weeks, Simmons, Lindburg, Harmon, Thomas and Cummins.  To the extent authorized by the Board of Directors and by the Bank's Bylaws, this Committee exercises all of the authority of the Board of Directors between Board meetings and formulates recommendations for presentation to the full Board.  All actions of this Committee are reviewed and ratified by the entire Board.  The Executive Committee met 17 times during the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Loan Committee is composed of Directors Verenes (Chairman), Toole, Alexander, Weeks Simmons, Lindburg, Thomas and Cummins.

Leadership Structure and Board Involvement in Risk Management Process
The positions of Board Chairman and of President and Chief Executive Officer are held by two persons.  This has been the case since 1994.  Our Board of Directors is chaired by Timothy W. Simmons, who is a non-executive director.  The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for the day-to-day performance of Security Federal while the Chairman of the Board provides guidance, sets the agenda for Board meetings and presides over meetings of the full Board.  The Board believes that having a non-executive Chairman is the best structure under current circumstances.
The Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect Security Federal.  This oversight is accomplished in part through the Executive, Audit and Nominating Committees of the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors satisfies its risk oversight responsibility through full reports by each committee regarding its considerations and actions, as well as through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within Security Federal and through internal and external audits.  Risks relating to the direct operations of Security Federal Bank are further overseen by the Bank's Board of Directors, who are the same individuals who serve on the Board of Directors of Security Federal.  The Board of Directors of the Bank also has additional committees including Loan, Trust and Investment Committees that conduct risk oversight separate from Security Federal.  Further, the Board of Directors oversees risks through the establishment of policies and procedures that are designed to guide daily operations in a manner consistent with applicable laws, regulations and risks acceptable to the organization. Corporate Governance
We are committed to establishing and maintaining high standards of corporate governance.  The Board of Directors is cognizant of its responsibility to comply with the provisions contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations of the SEC adopted thereunder.  The Board and its committees will continue to evaluate and improve our corporate governance principles and policies as necessary and as required.
Code of Ethics.  The Board of Directors has adopted a written Code of Ethics for Principal Executive Officers and Senior Financial Officers, and requires individuals to maintain the highest standards of professional conduct.  The Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.securityfederalbank.com.
Communication with the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors maintains a process for shareholders to communicate with the Board of Directors.  Shareholders wishing to communicate with the Board of Directors should send any communication to the Secretary, Security Federal Corporation, P.O. Box 810, Aiken, South Carolina 29802.  Any communication must state the number of shares beneficially owned by the shareholder making the communication.  The Secretary will forward such communication to the full Board of Directors or to any individual director or directors to whom the communication is directed unless the communication is unduly hostile, threatening, illegal or similarly inappropriate, in which case the Secretary has the authority to discard the communication or take appropriate legal action.
Annual Meeting Attendance by Directors.  We do not have a policy regarding Board member attendance at annual meetings of shareholders.  All members of the Board of Directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, with the exception of Mr. Toole.
Director Independence.  Although our common stock is not listed on Nasdaq, we have chosen to apply Nasdaq's definition of "independence," as permitted by the SEC.  Robert E. Alexander, William Clyburn, Thomas L. Moore, Timothy W. Simmons, Frank M. Thomas, Jr., Gasper L. Toole, III and Harry O. Weeks, Jr. are all independent.  J. Chris Verenes, Roy G. Lindburg, Richard T. Harmon and Jessica T. Cummins are executive officers of Security Federal and accordingly, are not independent.  Director nominee Frampton W. Toole, III is independent.
Family Relationships.  Director nominee Frampton W. Toole, III is the nephew of retiring director Gasper L. Toole, III.
Related Party Transactions.  Applicable law and regulations require that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors must be made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons (unless the loan or extension of credit is made under a benefit program generally available to all employees and does not give preference to any insider over any other employee) and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. The Bank has adopted a policy to this effect.  At December 31, 2018, loans to all employees, officers and directors of the Bank totaled approximately $3.1 million, or 3.9% of Security Federal's total shareholders' equity.  These loans (1) were made in the ordinary course of business, (2) were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the Bank's other customers and (3) did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features when made, other than those made under the Bank's employee loan program, which is discussed below.  All loans to directors and executive officers are required to be reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer and the Loan Committee and reported to the Board.  Loans and aggregate loans of $500,000 or greater are reviewed and approved by the Bank's Board of Directors, pursuant to Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board.  All loan approval and review procedures are governed by written policies.
The Bank also offers an employee loan program to all employees to assist employees with loans for a variety of personal, family or household credit needs, or for the purchase, construction or refinancing of a home which is the employee's primary residence.  All loans offered to employees are closed on the same terms as those available to members of the general public.  Following closing, the terms of employee loans are modified to reflect a preferential interest rate.  Existing loans may be modified to conform to the terms of the employee loan program.  The employee loan rates are modified on January 1 of each year to reflect the Bank's cost of funds.  If an employee terminates employment at the Bank, the interest rate on the loan reverts to the original rate for the general public.  No director or executive  officer had indebtedness and principal payable thereon pursuant to the employee loan program that exceeded $120,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
The general formula for calculating a participant's incentive for the plan year is the base annual salary of the participant, multiplied by the percentage base award, multiplied by the sum of the basic formula percentage for each performance measure applicable to the participant's position, multiplied by the position level multiplier, multiplied by the individual performance adjustment.  For any incentive to be paid under the Incentive Plan, the Bank must meet a predefined minimum level of performance.  The performance measures for incentives are the key operating ratios, plus  other pertinent measures of total Bank performance, on which the participants will be evaluated.  The position level multiplier is a multiplier used to recognize the impact that each senior-level officer has on overall Bank performance.  The individual performance adjustment gives the Board some subjective discretion in the determination of the final incentive award for each participant.  In addition, the Board may take into account any extraordinary occurrences, consisting of those events which in the Board's option are outside the significant influence of participants and would cause a significant unintended effect (whether positive or negative) on the Bank's operating and financial performance results.
For 2018, the named executive officers' incentives were based primarily on net operating income.  Other performance measures included loan growth, deposit growth, non-performing assets and referrals made.  The Bank's net operating income was the threshold performance factor for the payment of incentives for 2018.  The Incentive Plan provides that no incentive awards will be granted for 2018, regardless of performance on individual goals, if the Bank's net operating income is less than an approved minimum for the fiscal year.  The Bank met the minimum for 2018; therefore, the named executive officers received annual cash incentive payments in 2019 for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Outstanding Equity Awards
The named executive officers did not have any equity awards outstanding at December 31, 2018.
Potential Payments Upon Termination
We have entered into agreements with the named executive officers that provide for potential payments upon termination of employment.  The following table shows, as of December 31, 2018, the value of potential payments and benefits following a termination of employment under a variety of scenarios.

These agreements provide an annual supplemental retirement benefit which begins on the last day of the year in which the executive attains age 65, or upon  executive's separation from service, if later.  The benefit equals 20% of the executive's final pay, payable in monthly installments over 15 years.  An executive's final pay is the highest of his annual base salary over the five year period ending with the year he separates from service.
The agreements also provide an early termination benefit if the executive terminates employment with the Bank prior to his attaining age 65.  The early termination benefit is an annual benefit based on the executive's vested accrued balance under the agreement, determined when he separates from service from the Bank, adjusted monthly by an interest factor until the executive's attainment of age 65.  The rate at which the executive vests in his early termination benefit is set forth in his agreement, with the vesting rate ranging from between 10% per year to 25% per year, depending on the executive.  As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Verenes, Lindburg and Harmon were 100% vested. The early termination benefit is payable in monthly installments over 15 years, commencing on the first day of the month after the executive attains age 65.  During the payout period, the remaining accrued balance will be credited monthly by an interest factor.  The agreements also provide a disability termination benefit if the executive terminates employment with the Bank on account of disability prior to his attaining age 65.  The disability termination benefit is the same as the early termination benefit, except that the executive becomes 100% vested in his benefit upon his disability while actively employed.
In the event of a change in control, followed by a separation from service, the executive will receive an annual change in control benefit equal to 20% of the executive's projected final pay.  An executive's projected final pay is his final pay, as defined above, adjusted at a rate of 4% per year until the executive attains age 65.  The annual change in control benefit will be paid in monthly installments over 15 years, commencing on the first day of the month after the executive attains age 65.
Nondistributed benefits will be forfeited if within 24 months of the executive's termination of employment the executive violates the noncompetition, nondisclosure or nonsolicitation provisions described in the agreement.  This forfeiture provision does not apply if there is a change in control.
If the executive dies while in the active service of the Bank but before he attains age 65, his beneficiary will receive a lump sum benefit based on the executive's accrued balance that is paid within 60 days of his death.  If the executive dies after his benefit has commenced, the remaining benefits will be paid to the executive's beneficiaries at the same time and the same amounts they would have been paid to the executive.  If the executive dies after he has become entitled to a benefit, but before the benefit commences, the benefit will commence to be paid to his beneficiaries within 30 days following the date the Bank or its successor receives a copy of the executive's death certificate.  In addition to the death benefit described above, the executive will receive under a split dollar agreement an additional death benefit, equal to 50% of the "net death proceeds."  The net death proceeds is the death benefit received by the Bank under a life insurance policy taken out on the life of the executive, reduced by the greater of the cash surrender value of the policy or the aggregate premiums paid by the Bank on the policy.
In the event an executive becomes disabled, he is entitled to his accrued account balance.  That amount, plus interest until age 65, would be paid to the executive upon reaching age 65 over a 15-year period.
Change in Control Severance Agreements.  On March 29, 2018, Security Federal and the Bank entered into change in control severance agreements with each of the named executive officers.  The agreements provide an initial term until December 31, 2018 and will be extended for one year on each anniversary date, provided that the Board of Directors of has not given the executive notice of non-renewal.  If, within six months before or 24 months following a change in control, the officer experiences an involuntary termination, the Company and the Bank will pay to the officer, a lump sum cash payment equal to 2.4 times the officer's annual base salary.
For purposes of the change in control severance agreements, "change in control" means: (1) an offeror other than Security Federal purchases shares of stock of Security Federal or the Bank pursuant to a tender or exchange offer; (2) an event that results in the acquisition of control of Security Federal or the Bank within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 or requires the filing of a change of control notice with the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; (3) any person that is or becomes the beneficial owner directly or indirectly of securities of Security Federal or the Bank representing 35% or more of the combined voting power of Security Federal's or the Bank's outstanding securities; (4) the members of the incumbent Board of Directors cease to constitute at least  a majority of the directors, subject to limited exception; or (5) consummation of a plan of reorganization, merger, acquisition, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Security Federal or a similar transaction in which Security Federal is not the resulting entity.  "Involuntary termination" means the termination of an executive's employment: (i) by Security Federal or the Bank, without the executive's express written consent; or (ii) by the executive by reason of a material diminution of or interference with the executive's duties, responsibilities or benefits, including any of the following unless consented to by the executive: (1) a requirement that the executive be based at any place not within a radius of 30 miles of the executive's current location, except for reasonable travel Security Federal or Bank business; (2) a material demotion of the executive; (3) a material reduction in the number or seniority of personnel reporting to the executive, other than as part of a company-wide reduction in staff; (4) a reduction in the executive's salary other than as part of an overall program applied uniformly to all members of senior management; (5) a material permanent increase in the required work hours or workload of the executive; or (6) any purported termination of the executive's employment.
Compensation Policies and Risk
The Compensation Committee meets at least annually and reviews the compensation of its officers and has determined that the risks arising from Security Federal's compensation policies and practices for all employees are not likely to have a material adverse effect on Security Federal.
 PROPOSAL 2 – ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION  
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act"), we are required to include in this Proxy Statement and present at the meeting a non-binding shareholder resolution to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives shareholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation of Security Federal's executives as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.  The proposal will be presented at the annual meeting in the form of the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve the compensation of Security Federal Corporation's named executive officers, as disclosed in the compensation tables and related material in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders.
This vote will not be binding on our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee and may not be construed as overruling a decision by the Board or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty on the Board.  It will also not affect any compensation paid or awarded to any executive.  The Compensation Committee and the Board may, however, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
Our executive compensation policies are designed to establish an appropriate relationship between executive pay and the annual and long-term performance of Security Federal and Security Federal Bank, to reflect the attainment of short- and long-term financial performance goals, to enhance our ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers, and to align to the greatest extent possible the interests of management and shareholders.  Our Board of Directors believes that our compensation policies and procedures achieve these objectives.  The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR approval of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement.

Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.  Based solely on a review of the reports and written representations provided to us by these persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our reporting officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were properly and timely complied with during the year ended December 31, 2018.
