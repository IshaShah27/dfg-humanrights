NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
To Be Held Monday,  December 31, 2018
To the Stockholders of Centric Brands Inc.:
Notice is hereby given that the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Centric Brands Inc. (formerly Differential Brands Group Inc.,  the "Company," "we" or "us") will be held at the offices of Dechert LLP located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York 10036 at 9 am Eastern Standard Time, for the following purposes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.      To reelect eight directors to serve until the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or until their respective successors are elected and qualified. 
    2.      To ratify the appointment of CohnReznick LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. 
    3.      To transact such other business as may properly come before the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
[END TABLE]
These proposals are described more fully in the enclosed proxy statement, which we urge you to read in its entirety.
The board of directors has fixed the close of business on November 7, 2018 as the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the meeting and any of its adjournments or postponements.
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting in person. You must be a stockholder of record at the close of business on November 7, 2018 to vote at the Annual Meeting.
YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT. Whether or not you plan to attend the 2018 annual meeting in person, we strongly encourage you to vote. Please vote as soon as possible, even if you plan to attend the 2018 annual meeting in person. If you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting in person you are requested to complete, date and sign the enclosed proxy card and return it promptly in the pre-addressed envelope provided so that it is received by us at least 24 hours before the Annual Meeting or vote by telephone or over the Internet if your voting instruction form describes such voting methods. Your proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted if you return a later-dated proxy card or if you vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting if you are the record holder of the shares and can provide a copy of a certificate(s) evidencing your shares.
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker has discretionary voting authority to vote your shares only on routine matters, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. Your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on non-routine matters without instructions from you, in which case a "broker non-vote" will occur and your shares will not be voted on such matters. The only routine matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the ratification of the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal No. 2). The only non-routine matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the election of directors (Proposal No. 1).

EXPLANATORY NOTE
We are a "smaller reporting company," as defined in Item 10 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and have elected to provide in this proxy statement certain scaled disclosures permitted under the Exchange Act for smaller reporting companies. As a result of being a smaller reporting company, we do not provide pay for performance, compensation and risk and compensation ratio disclosures and compensation committee interlocks disclosures, a compensation discussion and analysis or a compensation committee report, among other disclosures. We will remain a "smaller reporting company" until such time as our public float as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is at least $250 million.

PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
To Be Held Monday,  December 31, 2018
GENERAL INFORMATION AND VOTING RIGHTS
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING
When and where is the Annual Meeting being held?
This proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors (the "Board" or the "Board of Directors") of Centric Brands Inc. (formerly Differential Brands Group Inc.) (the "Company," "we" or "us"), a Delaware corporation, for use at the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held at the offices of Dechert LLP located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas on Monday,  December 31, 2018 at 9 am Eastern Standard Time, and any adjournments or postponements thereof.
Who may attend the Annual Meeting?
Any stockholder, and certain other permitted attendees, may attend the Annual Meeting. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we ask that you also complete and return the reservation form attached to the end of the Proxy Statement. Please note that space limitations make it necessary to limit attendance to stockholders and one guest. Admission to the Annual Meeting will be on a first-come, first-served basis. Proof of the Company's stock ownership as of the record date, along with photo identification, will be required for admission. The "street name" holders will need to bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting their stock ownership as of the record date. No cameras, recording equipment, electronic devices, use of cell phones or other mobile devices, large bags or packages will be permitted at the Annual Meeting.
Who is entitled to vote?
Only holders of record of our common stock at the close of business on November 7, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting on the proposals described in this Proxy Statement. On the Record Date, there were 58,030,131 shares of common stock outstanding. On all matters to come before the Annual Meeting, each holder of record of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock. The shares of common stock held in our treasury, which are not considered outstanding, will not be voted.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and holding shares in "street name"? Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy?
Stockholders of Record. If your shares are registered in your name, you are a stockholder of record. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to direct the voting of your shares by returning the enclosed proxy card to us or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. We encourage you to vote by proxy so that your shares will be represented and voted at the Annual Meeting even if you cannot attend.
Beneficial Owners With Shares Held in "Street Name." If your shares are held in "street name" at a bank, broker or other similar organization or other nominees, the organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct your nominee holder on how to vote your shares and to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the Annual Meeting unless you receive a valid proxy from your bank, broker or other nominee holder. To obtain a valid proxy, you must make a special request of your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not make this request, you may still vote by following the instructions in the voting instruction card, which your bank, broker or other nominee has enclosed for you to use in directing such bank, broker or nominee on how to vote your shares. All Stockholders. All shares entitled to vote and represented by properly executed proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting, and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions indicated on those proxies. If no instructions are indicated on a properly executed proxy, the shares represented by that proxy will be voted as recommended by the Board of Directors.
How do I vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
· You may vote by mail. You can do this by completing your proxy card (as a stockholder of record) or voting instruction card (as a beneficial owner holding in "street name") and returning it in the enclosed, prepaid and addressed envelope. If you return a signed card but do not provide voting instructions, your shares will be voted as recommended by the Board. 
· You may vote in person. Ballots will be passed out at the Annual Meeting to anyone who wants to vote at the Annual Meeting. If you choose to do so, please bring the enclosed proxy card or proof of identification. If your shares are held directly in your name, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. However, if your shares are held in "street name" (that is, through a bank, broker or other nominee), you must first obtain a properly executed proxy from the stockholder of record (that is, your bank, broker or other nominee) and vote. 
· "Street name" holders may also vote by phone or through an Internet website. If you hold your shares in "street name" (e.g., through a broker, bank or other nominee), then you received this Proxy Statement from the nominee, along with the nominee's voting instruction card, which includes voting instructions (including voting by phone or through an Internet website) and instructions on how to change your vote. Your vote will be based on your instructions to the bank, broker or other nominee on how to vote the ordinary shares. 
[END TABLE]
If I vote by proxy, can I change my vote or revoke my proxy?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting either by filing with the Secretary of the Company at our principal offices a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and expressing a desire to vote your shares in person. If you hold your shares in street name, you may change your vote by submitting new voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. You must contact your bank, broker or other nominee to find out how to do so.
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we do not know of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement.
If any other matters are properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, including, among other things, consideration of a motion to adjourn the meeting to another time or place in order to solicit additional proxies in favor of the nominees to the Board of Directors, the persons named as proxies and acting thereunder will have discretion to vote on these matters according to their best judgment to the same extent as the person delivering the proxy would be entitled to vote. As of the date of this notice, we have not received notice of any other matters that may be properly presented at the Annual Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum?
Pursuant to our existing Amended and Restated Bylaws, adopted as of July 6, 2015 and as amended as of November 7, 2016 (the "Bylaws"), in order for us to conduct the Annual Meeting, the holders of shares of common stock outstanding representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares entitled to vote as of the Record Date of November 7, 2018, must be present at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. This is referred to as a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the number of shares present at the Annual Meeting for determining the presence of a quorum. What happens if a quorum is not present?
Pursuant to our Bylaws, if a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will be adjourned to such day and at such time and place as the Chairman of the Annual Meeting may determine. At the adjourned meeting the stockholders may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting will be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting, but otherwise notice of the adjournment is not required.
How will votes be counted?
For Proposal No. 1 (the election of directors), you may vote "FOR" all of the nominees or your vote may be "WITHHELD" for one or more of the nominees. For the other items of business (Proposal No. 2), you may vote "FOR",  "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN." Broker non-votes and abstentions will have the effect as described in each of the proposals as described below.
Proposal No. 1: To Reelect Eight Directors to Serve on the Board of Directors Until the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or Until Their Respective Successors Are Elected and Qualified: Pursuant to our Bylaws, the nominees for reelection to the Board of Directors who receive a plurality of "FOR" votes cast by holders of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be elected. "WITHHELD" votes will be counted as present for the purposes of this vote, but will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal. Brokers, banks and other financial institutions cannot vote your stock on your behalf for this proposal if you have not provided instructions on your voting instruction form; for your vote to be counted, you must submit your voting instructions to your broker or custodian. Broker non-votes will not be counted as present and are not entitled to vote on this proposal.
Proposal No. 2: To Ratify the Appointment of CohnReznick LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2018: Ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions will not be counted in determining whether this proposal has been approved. Broker non-votes will be counted as present and are entitled to vote on the proposal. If you hold your shares in street name and do not provide voting instructions to your broker, the shares may be voted on this proposal at the discretion of your broker.
How will my shares be voted if I do not provide instructions on the proxy card?
Stockholders of Record. If you hold your shares directly in your own name, your shares will not be voted if you do not vote them or provide a proxy. If you hold your shares directly in your own name and you sign and return your proxy card (including over the internet or by telephone) but do not include voting instructions, your proxy will be voted as the Board of Directors recommends on each proposal.
Beneficial Owners. If you hold your shares in "street name" and do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, your broker may vote your shares on "routine" matters even if you do not provide a proxy. The only routine matter to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018 (Proposal No. 2). If a bank, broker or other nominee votes your shares on these matters in accordance with these rules, your shares will count as present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of establishing a quorum and will count as "FOR" vote, abstention or "AGAINST" vote, as the case may be, depending on how the broker votes. If a brokerage firm signs and returns a proxy on your behalf that does not contain voting instructions, your shares will count as present at the Annual Meeting for quorum purposes and will be voted in connection with the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, but will not count as a "FOR" vote for any other matter, including the election of the nominees for directors. Because banks, brokers and other nominees require their customers' direction to vote on non-routine matters, it is critical that the stockholders provide their banks, brokers and other nominees with voting instructions with respect to the proposal involving non-routine matters (Proposal No. 1). What is a broker non-vote?
A  "broker non-vote" occurs when a beneficial owner of shares held by a broker, bank or other nominee fails to provide the stockholder of record with voting instructions on any non-routine matters brought to a vote at the meeting. SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
We will bear the expense of soliciting proxies. Our directors, officers and other employees may solicit proxies in person, by telephone, by mail or by other means of communication, but such persons will not be specially compensated for such services. While we presently intend that solicitations will be made only by directors, officers and employees of the Company, we may also retain outside brokers, banks, custodians, nominees and other fiduciaries to assist in the solicitation of proxies. Any reasonable charges and expenses incurred in connection with the use of such outside solicitors will be paid by the Company.
HOUSEHOLDING
To reduce the expense of delivering duplicate proxy materials to our stockholders, we are relying on the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")  rules that permit us to deliver only one set of proxy materials, including our proxy statement, our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017  and the notice of annual meeting, to multiple stockholders who share an address unless we receive contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. This practice, known as "householding," reduces duplicate mailings, thus saving printing and postage costs as well as natural resources. Each stockholder retains a separate right to vote on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you wish to receive a separate copy of the Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 or other proxy materials, free of charge, or if you wish to receive separate copies of future annual reports or proxy materials, please mail your request to Centric Brands Inc.,  350 5th Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10118, attention: Corporate Secretary, or call us at +1 (646)  582‑6000.
STOCKHOLDER LIST
For at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting, a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, showing the address of and number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder, will be open for examination by any stockholder, for any purpose related to the Annual Meeting, during ordinary business hours at our principal executive offices located at 350 5th Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10118. The list will also be available for examination at the Annual Meeting.
VOTING RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING
Voting results will be published in a Current Report on Form 8‑K issued by us within four business days following the Annual Meeting and will be reported on our website at http://www.centricbrands.com/ by posting the Current Report on Form 8‑K. PROPOSAL NO. 1 — TO REELECT EIGHT DIRECTORS TO SERVE ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNTIL THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS OR UNTIL THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS ARE ELECTED AND QUALIFIED
Background of the Proposal
Upon recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, our Board of Directors has nominated eight directors to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2019 (the "2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders") and until their successors have been elected and qualified. Pursuant to our Bylaws, each member of our Board of Directors is elected at the annual meeting of stockholders and serves until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor has been elected and qualified or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. Additionally, our Bylaws provide that the number of directors of the Company shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board, which is currently eight. All eight nominees listed below currently serve on our Board.
As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018,  on October 29, 2018, we completed the acquisition (the "GBG Acquisition")  of a significant part of Global Brands Group Holding Limited's ("GBG") and its subsidiaries' North American business, including the wholesale, retail and e-commerce operations, comprising all of their North American kids business, all of their North American accessories business and a majority of their West Coast and Canadian fashion businesses. In connection with the completion of the GBG Acquisition, Michael Buckley, Andrew Tarshis and Kelly Hoffman resigned from the Board of Directors, Mr. Hoffman resigned from the audit committee of the Board of Directors (the "Audit Committee"), and Mr. Tarshis resigned from the compensation and stock option committee of the Board of Directors. Additionally, the Board voted to increase the size of the Board of Directors from seven to eight directors, effective on the closing date of the GBG Acquisition. On such date, the Board of Directors also appointed Glenn Krevlin, Randall Kessler, Robert Petrini and Jason Rabin as members of the Board of Directors. In connection therewith, Mr. Krevlin was also appointed to the Audit Committee.
Also, on December 11, 2018, Matthew Eby and Kent Savage resigned from the Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors and Robert Petrini and Walter McLallen were appointed as their replacements with Mr. McLallen as the chairman of such committee.
Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for the nominees named above. If any nominee is unable or unwilling to serve as a director at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for such other nominee(s) as shall be designated by the then current Board of Directors to fill any vacancy. In accordance with Article III of our Bylaws, vacancies are filled by a majority vote of the remaining Board of Directors or by a sole remaining director. We have no reason to believe that the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected as directors.
As set forth in our Bylaws, the election of directors to the Board is determined by a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present and entitled to vote. This means that the seven nominees receiving the highest numbers of "FOR" votes cast at the Annual Meeting will be elected as directors.
Messrs. Sweedler, Eby, Kessler and Petrini are members of the Board of Directors pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement (as defined below). See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence—Reportable Related Party Transactions—Agreements Related to the GBG Acquisition—Stockholder Agreement" below for additional details. The table and biographies below set forth information as of the date of this Proxy Statement with respect to the director nominees, all of whom are currently directors of the Company.

BOARD MEETINGS AND BOARD COMMITTEE INFORMATION
Board Meetings
Our Board of Directors manages us through board meetings and through its committees. During our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017  ("fiscal 2017") our Board of Directors held five meetings, including eight meetings by unanimous written consent. Each director who was a director during fiscal 2017 attended at least 75% of all the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which such director served. Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders, we attempt to accommodate the schedules of each member of our Board of Directors in choosing a date for our annual meeting of stockholders and our annual meeting of our Board of Directors. Directors are generally in attendance at the annual meeting of stockholders. The Chairman of our Board of Directors and one other member of our Board of Directors serving on the Board of Directors at the time of our annual meeting of stockholders in 2017 (the "2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders")  attended the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in person or telephonically.
Non-management directors also meet as needed in executive sessions without management present, with at least one such meeting a year attended only by independent directors. The Chairman of the Board presides over these executive sessions. During fiscal 2017, our non-management met four times in executive session, all of which meetings were comprised of only independent directors.
Committees and Committee Charters
The Board of Directors has established a separately designated audit committee (the "Audit Committee"), compensation and stock option committee (the "Compensation and Stock Option Committee") and nominating and governance committee (the "Nominating and Governance Committee") of the Board of Directors.

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is currently comprised of Messrs. Krevlin, McLallen and Savage.  Mr. Savage serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee met or acted through written consent a total of 11 times in fiscal 2017.
The principal responsibility of the Audit Committee is to oversee our accounting and financial reporting processes and the audits of our financial statements. In that regard, the Audit Committee assists our Board of Directors in monitoring (1) our accounting, auditing, and financial reporting processes generally, including the qualifications, independence and performance of the independent auditor (including pre-approval of audit and non-audit services to be performed by the independent auditor), (2) the integrity of our financial statements, (3) our systems of internal control regarding finance and accounting and (4) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Our Audit Committee is also responsible for reviewing with management our major risk exposures and our risk assessment and risk management programs. As discussed above, the Audit Committee has a charter that details its duties and responsibilities, which was most recently amended and restated by our Board of Directors on October 25, 2018.
Currently, all Audit Committee members are "independent" under applicable Nasdaq listing standards and rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 10A‑3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the Company's financial statements to serve on the Audit Committee and is financially literate within the meaning of Nasdaq listing standards as interpreted by the Board.

The Compensation and Stock Option Committee met or acted through written consent a total of seven times in fiscal 2017.

Additionally, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee reviews and approves incentive compensation and equity-based plans, as well as compensation plans, policies and benefit programs applicable to employees generally, and administers our equity-based compensation plans. In connection with its deliberations, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee seeks the views of management with respect to appropriate compensation levels of the other officers and directors and may recruit compensation consultants, outside counsel and other advisers as it deems necessary to provide independent advice regarding market trends and other  Table of Contents competitive considerations, and has the sole authority to compensate and oversee the work of such consultants, outside counsel and other advisers. During fiscal 2017, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee did not retain the services of compensation consultants to determine or recommend the amount or form of executive and director compensation. As discussed above, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee has a charter that details its duties and responsibilities, which was most recently amended and restated by our Board of Directors on October 25, 2018.
In setting the level of cash and equity compensation, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee considers various factors, including our overall performance and the individual's performance during the year, the uniqueness and relative performance of the executive's skill set, the expected future contribution to us and competitive conditions. In addition, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee considered the affirmative "say on pay" vote at our annual meeting of stockholders held in 2011 and again at our annual meetings of stockholders held in 2014 and 2017, as well as the affirmative golden parachute "say on pay" vote at our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and continued to apply the same principles in determining the amounts and types of executive compensation. In addition, our Compensation and Stock Option Committee reviews compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and considers the recommendation by the Chief Executive Officer for the other Named Executive Officers (as defined below) other than the Chief Executive Officer. As set forth in our Compensation and Stock Option Committee's charter, the Chief Executive Officer may not be present during voting or deliberations on his compensation.
Currently, all Compensation and Stock Option Committee members are "independent" under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, including the enhanced independence requirements applicable to members of compensation committees.

In that regard, the Nominating and Governance Committee also has primary responsibility to recommend to our Board of Directors the director nominees for election by the stockholders at meetings of stockholders and for filling any vacancies and newly created directorships, to periodically review and make recommendations regarding the composition and size of our Board of Directors and committees, to review and make recommendations to our Board of Directors with respect to director compensation, to lead the Board's annual self-evaluation process, to annually recommend to the Board the chairpersons and members of the Board's committees and to oversee director orientation and continuing education programs.

Director Nominations
Directors may be nominated by the Board or stockholders in accordance with the Company's Bylaws. The Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible for developing criteria for the selection of, and recommending to the Board candidates for, new directors for election at stockholder meetings and nominees for vacancies and for reviewing such director candidates, including those nominated by stockholders. The Board's and Nominating and Governance Committee's methods for choosing candidates for election to the Board of Directors (other than those formally nominated by our stockholders, as discussed below) include the solicitation of ideas for possible candidates from a number of sources, including existing members of the Board of Directors, executive officers, individuals personally known to the members of the Board of Directors and other research. We may also from time to time retain one or more third-party search firms to identify suitable candidates.
In evaluating the suitability of candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee may take into account many factors, including the potential candidate's judgment, experience, independence, character, business acumen and such other factors as the Nominating and Governance Committee concludes are pertinent in light of the current needs of our Board of Directors, including an incumbent's past performance, attendance at meetings and participation in and contributions to the activities of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes that each candidate should be an individual who has demonstrated integrity and ethics in such candidate's personal and professional life, has an understanding of elements relevant to the success of a publicly-traded company and has established a record of professional accomplishment in such candidate's chosen field. Each candidate should be prepared to participate fully in our Board of Directors' activities, including attendance at and active participation in meetings of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has no stated specific minimum qualifications that must be met by a candidate for a position on our Board of Directors.
We have no formal policy on diversity; however, our Board of Directors believes that its membership should reflect a diversity of experience, gender, race, ethnicity and age. To date, no more specific criteria has been developed other than that set forth in the charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee.
There is no specific procedure outlined in the charter for the Nominating and Governance Committee to consider recommendations by common stockholders for candidates on our Board of Directors, but such recommended candidates will be considered in accordance with the principal responsibilities of the Nominating and Governance Committee, our Bylaws, and all applicable rules and regulations relating to such nominations by our common stockholders. Any recommendations by stockholders for nominations to our Board of Directors are evaluated in a manner similar to how the Nominating and Governance Committee considers all directors.
Messrs. Sweedler, Eby, Kessler and Petrini are members of the Board of Directors pursuant to the Stockholder Agreement. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions and Director Independence—Reportable Related Party Transactions—Agreements Related to the GBG Acquisition—Stockholder Agreement" below for additional details.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Board of Directors is led by our Chairman of the Board and our Company is led by our Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors believes that whether to have the same person occupy the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be decided by the Board of Directors, from time to time, in its business judgment after considering relevant circumstances. We currently separate the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.
We believe that, under normal circumstances, separating the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer promotes balance between the oversight function of the Board of Directors and our operational and strategic direction undertaken by our Chief Executive Officer. We believe that this separation also balances the leadership in the boardroom and at the Company in its day-to-day operational activities. Our Board of Directors will periodically make a determination as to the appropriateness of this policy, including in connection with the recruitment and succession of the Chairman and/or Chief Executive Officer. In addition, all of our committees have separate committee chairpersons that act as the presiding chair at the particular committee meetings. All members are free to request items for inclusion on the agenda at meetings and have an opportunity to bring up any items of discussion at any time among the Board of Directors or with management.
Compensation of Directors and Officers
The Compensation and Stock Option Committee determines the compensation to be paid to our officers and directors, with recommendations from management as to the amount and/or form of such compensation. The Nominating and Governance Committee also makes recommendations to our Board regarding director compensation.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
Our Board of Directors adopted an amended and restated Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for all of our directors, officers and employees on October 25, 2018 with an effective date of October 29, 2018. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.centricbrands.com in the section titled "Investor Information—Governance—Governance Documents," or you may request a free copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics from our Chief Compliance Officer at our principal executive offices located at Centric Brands Inc.,  350 5th Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10118 or by calling us at +1 (646) 582‑6000. You may also find a copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics filed as Exhibit 14 to our Current Report on Form 10‑K filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018.
To date, there have been no waivers under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We intend to disclose any amendments to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and any waiver granted from a provision of such code on our website at www.centricbrands.com within the same time frame that would otherwise be required by a Current Report on Form 8‑K.
Stockholder Nominations
Our Bylaws provide that nominations of persons for election as directors at a meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected may be made by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or by a stockholder, as set forth below.
For a stockholder to properly bring before an annual meeting a nomination or nomination(s) for election to the Board of Directors, the stockholder must have given timely notice including all of the information regarding the nominee(s) and the stockholder giving the notice, as mandated by our Bylaws, must have been a stockholder of record on the date of giving notice, and must be entitled to vote for the election of directors at the annual meeting. To be timely, such notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company at our principal executive offices located at Centric Brands Inc., 350 5th Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10118 not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, under the terms of our Bylaws, notice by the stockholder must be (i) no earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the annual meeting and (ii) not later than the later of the close of business on the 90th day before the annual meeting or the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the Company first publicly announces the date of the annual meeting.
For a stockholder to properly bring before a special meeting a nomination or nomination(s) for election to the Board of Directors, the stockholder's notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company at our principal executive offices at the address referenced above (i) not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day prior to the meeting and (ii) not later than the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the Company first publicly announces the date of the special meeting.
Because this Annual Meeting is not being held more than 30 days before the anniversary date of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, written notice from stockholders was required to be received by the close of business on September 1, 2018, which was the 90th day prior to the anniversary of the 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If the number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting is greater than the number of directors whose terms expire on the date of the annual meeting, and the Company does not publicly announce the names of the nominees for the additional directorships before the close of the 90th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a stockholder's notice will be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships, if the notice is received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company at the address referenced above by the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which the Company first publicly announces the nominees for additional directorships.
Director Independence
Currently, the following seven out of eight members of our Board of Directors are considered "independent" under Nasdaq listing standards and as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Matthew Eby; 
· Walter McLallen; 
· Kent Savage; 
· William Sweedler; 
· Glenn Krevlin; 
· Randall Kessler; and 
· Robert Petrini. 
[END TABLE]
In making its determination that the foregoing directors are independent, the Board of Directors considered all relevant facts and circumstances. As required under Nasdaq listing standards, in making its determination of independence, the Board of Directors considered whether the director had a relationship with the Company which, in the opinion of the Company's Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. In addition, the Nasdaq definition of independent director includes a series of objective tests which were considered by the Board. Specifically, a member of the Board of Directors may be considered independent if such member:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a director who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by the Company; a director who accepted, or who has a family member who accepted, any compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during any period of twelve consecutive months within the three years preceding the determination of independence, other than compensation for board or board committee service, compensation paid to a family member who is an employee (other than an executive officer) of the Company, benefits under a tax-qualified retirement plan, or non-discretionary compensation; 
· a director who is a family member of an individual who is, or at any time during the past three years was, employed by the Company as an executive officer; 
· a director who is, or has a family member who is, a partner in, or a controlling stockholder or an executive officer of, any organization to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments for property or services in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipient's consolidated gross revenues for that year, or $200,000, whichever is more, other than payments arising solely from investments in the Company's securities or payments under non-discretionary charitable contribution matching programs; 
· a director who is, or has a family member who is, employed as an executive officer of another entity where at any time during the past three years any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or

· a director who is, or has a family member who is, a current partner of the Company's outside auditor, or was a partner or employee of the Company's outside auditor who worked on the Company's audit at any time during any of the past three years. 
[END TABLE]
There are no current transactions with members of the Board of Directors that needed to be considered for any impact on the respective member's independence. All current members of our Audit Committee, Compensation and Stock Option Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee are considered to be independent based on the applicable rules of Nasdaq and the SEC. The remaining member of our Board, Mr. Rabin, is not considered independent because he is employed by the Company as its Chief Executive Officer.
Communications with the Board of Directors
Stockholders may contact an individual director, the Board of Directors as a group, or a specified Board of Directors committee or group, including the independent directors as a group, by mail, addressed to our corporate office at Centric Brands Inc., 350 5th Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10118 or by email addressed to board@centricbrands.com. Each communication should specify the applicable addressee(s) to be contacted, as well as the general topic of the communication. The Secretary will initially receive and process communications before forwarding them to the addressee.
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Our Board of Directors oversees our risks in an enterprise-wide approach to understand our material enterprise risks, including operational, financial, strategic, compliance and reputational risks. First, we have a fully independent Audit Committee that is primarily responsible for reviewing with management our major risk exposures and our risk assessment and risk management programs, including our financial risks. Our Audit Committee meets on a quarterly basis and as needed with management and our internal audit consultants to review and discuss these matters. In addition, at the invitation of the Audit Committee, other members of the Board of Directors and management team are also present at these meetings to participate in the discussion on our most significant risks and exposure to risks and the evaluation of these matters to ensure consensus and mutual understanding between our Board of Directors and management. Finally, each of our committees considers their own particular set of risks associated with its responsibilities. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Historically, our non‑employee directors have been compensated for service through an equity grant or on a cash basis. Our non‑employee directors are not compensated in any other manner; however, they are reimbursed for travel and business expenses associated with attending our annual meeting or other in person meetings.
On January 13, 2017, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors approved a cash payment of $50,000 and a stock award with a fair market value of $50,000 to each of the non-employee independent directors, excluding William Sweedler, Matthew Eby and Andrew Tarshis, for their service in 2017.
The following table provides certain information concerning the compensation for services rendered in all capacities by each director serving on our Board of Directors during fiscal 2017. For the compensation of our employee director during fiscal 2017  (our former Chief Executive Officer Mr. Buckley) see "Executive Compensation—Summary Compensation Table."

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Overview
This Executive Compensation section focuses on the following: (1) the objectives of the executive compensation policies and practices; (2) the objectives that the executive compensation program is designed to reward; (3) each element of executive compensation; (4) the rationale for each element of executive compensation; (5) the methodologies utilized by us in determining the amounts to pay for each element; and (6) how an element of executive compensation and our rationale for each element fit together within our overall executive compensation objectives. This discussion relates to our Chief Executive Officer and certain current executive officers, or collectively, our Named Executive Officers.
For our fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, our "Named Executive Officers," consisting of (i) our former principal executive officer, and (ii) our two most highly compensated executive officers other than our principal executive officer for such fiscal year, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Michael Buckley, Former Chief Executive Officer 
· Bob Ross, Former Chief Financial Officer 
· Peter Kim, Former Chief Executive Officer of and current Founder and Vice Chairman of Hudson Clothing LLC ("Hudson"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company 
[END TABLE]
In connection with the completion of the GBG Acquisition,  Michael Buckley resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, effective October 29, 2018, and the Board of Directors appointed Jason Rabin as Chief Executive Officer in his place.  Also, Bob Ross resigned as our Chief Financial Officer, effective November 5, 2018, and the Board of Directors appointed Anurup S. Pruthi as our Chief Financial Officer in his place. Mr. Ross remains an employee of the Company. On January 26, 2017, Hamish Sandhu resigned as our Chief Financial Officer and the Board of Directors appointed Bob Ross as our Chief Financial Officer.  On June 16, 2017, we entered into an amendment with Peter Kim with respect to his employment agreement whereby his title and duties were modified to reflect his change from Chief Executive Officer to Founder and Vice Chairman of our Hudson subsidiary board.
"Say on Pay" Vote
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders held on November 30, 2017, our stockholders were asked to consider and vote on a resolution approving the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, commonly referred to as "say on pay." A substantial majority of our stockholders approved the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, with approximately 99 percent of the votes cast in favor of that "say on pay" resolution. While we were pleased with our stockholder support in 2017, we will continue to actively evaluate our executive compensation program.
"Say on Pay Frequency" Vote
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders held on November 30, 2017, our stockholders were also asked to consider and vote on a resolution approving the frequency of the "say on pay" vote, commonly referred to as the "say on frequency" vote. A substantial majority of our stockholders approved the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, with approximately 96 percent of the votes cast in favor of a "say on pay frequency" vote to occur once every three years.  In light of the results of the say on frequency vote, our Board of Director has determined that we will hold an advisory vote on named executive officer compensation every third year until the next required vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on named executive officer compensation is held at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2023.
Compensation Philosophy
Our executive compensation program is designed to provide proper incentive to management to maximize performance in order to encourage creation of stockholder value and achievement of strategic corporate objectives, attract and retain qualified, skilled and dedicated executives on a long‑term basis, reward past performance and provide incentives for future performance. In keeping with these objectives, our goal is to (1) align the interests of the executive officers with the interests of our stockholders, (2) ensure the long‑term commitment of our management team, and (3) ensure accountability for both our overall performance and the individual's performance and contribution.
In setting the level of cash and equity compensation, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of our Board of Directors considers various factors, including our overall performance and the individual's performance during the year, the uniqueness and relative performance of the executive's skill set, the expected future contribution to us and competitive conditions. In addition, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee considered our stockholders' affirmative "say on pay" vote at our annual meeting in October 2011 and in May 2014 and, again, at our November 2017 meeting and continued to apply the same principles in determining the amounts and types of executive compensation. In addition, our Compensation and Stock Option Committee reviews compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, and considers the recommendation by the Chief Executive Officer for the other Named Executive Officers other than the Chief Executive Officer.
Elements of Compensation
Our compensation structure for our Named Executive Officers consists of a combination of (1) base salary, (2) long‑term incentive awards primarily through grants of restricted stock and restricted stock units pursuant to our stock incentive plans, (3) company paid benefits, including medical insurance, dental insurance, 401(k) Plan, disability insurance, life insurance and flexible spending accounts, and (4) discretionary cash bonuses for our Named Executive Officers based on our achievement of certain EBITDA targets. The Compensation and Stock Option Committee also takes into account certain change in control provisions available to our Named Executive Officers.

The following table provides certain summary information concerning the compensation earned by our Named Executive Officers for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (rounded to the nearest thousand).

Employment Contracts and Termination of Employment and Change in Control Arrangements
Change in Control Provisions
Each of Mr. Buckley's and Mr. Kim's employment agreements contain certain change in control provisions.  These provisions provide each person with certain compensation arrangements in the event that a change in control occurs prior to its termination.

For more information, see "—Peter Kim" and "—Michael Buckley" "—Bob Ross" below. In the event of a change in control under our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the Board of Directors or the Compensation and Stock Option Committee has the discretion to accelerate vesting on all or any portion of a particular outstanding award. For more information on our equity incentive plans, see "Compensation Plan Information" below.
Michael Buckley
On January 28, 2016, in connection with the transactions (the "RG Merger") contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of September 8, 2015 (the "RG Merger Agreement"), by and among RG Parent LLC, JJ Merger Sub, LLC and us, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Buckley. Pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement, Mr. Buckley serves as Chief Executive Officer, reporting to our Board of Directors, for an initial three‑year term with automatic, one‑year renewal terms, unless we or Mr. Buckley gives notice of non-renewal 180 days prior to the end of the then‑current term.
The employment agreement provides that we will pay Mr. Buckley an annual base salary of $600,000 and that Mr. Buckley will be eligible to receive an annual bonus of up to 150% of his base salary, based on our achievement of annual EBITDA targets set by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors after consultation with Mr. Buckley.
Pursuant to his employment agreement, on January 28, 2016, we granted Mr. Buckley (i) RSUs in respect of 433,764 shares of common stock (the "Buckley RSU Award") and (ii) PSUs in respect of 347,011 shares of common stock that are to be earned over a three-year performance period subject to Mr. Buckley's continuous employment (the "Buckley PSU Award"). The Buckley RSU Award vests in annual installments over a three‑year period with the first installment vesting on December 31, 2016, subject to Mr. Buckley's continued employment through the applicable vesting dates. The three-year performance period began on January 28, 2016 and ends on December 31, 2018, and one‑third of the Buckley PSU Award is eligible to vest each year starting on December 31, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2018, based on the achievement of EBITDA targets set by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee at the beginning of the applicable year. Both the Buckley RSU Award and Buckley PSU Award vest under and are governed by the terms of our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. The employment agreement further provides that the Buckley RSU Award and the Buckley PSU Award will be settled in cash in the event that there are insufficient shares of the Company's common stock available  Table of Contents to settle the applicable award in our common stock. The performance criteria are as follows: for target EDBITA at (1) less than 80%, 0% of the shares will vest, (2) 80%, 50% of the shares will vest, (3) 90%, 75% of the shares will vest and (4) 100%, 100% of the shares will vest. To the extent that the subsequent year EBITDA target is exceeded and the excess is sufficient to make up for a prior year shortfall, unvested portions of the Buckley PSU Award in any completed year will be eligible for vesting in subsequent years. Upon a "change in control" (as defined in the employment agreement), any unvested portions of the Buckley RSU Award and Buckley PSU Award will immediately vest.
In the event of a termination of Mr. Buckley's employment by us without "cause" or in the event that Mr. Buckley resigns for "good reason" (each as defined in the employment agreement), in either case, prior to the expiration of the agreement's then‑current term, we are required to pay Mr. Buckley severance equal to 3.75 times his base salary, payable in a full lump sum. Upon such termination or resignation, Mr. Buckley and his dependents will receive continued coverage under our group health insurance plans for a period of up to 18 months, any unvested portion of the Buckley RSU Award will immediately vest, 50% of the unvested portion of the Buckley PSU Award will immediately vest and 50% of the unvested portion of the Buckley PSU Award will remain outstanding through completion of the applicable performance period and vest based on actual achievement of the performance metrics. In the event such resignation or termination occurs following our first fiscal quarter of any year, the employment agreement provides that Mr. Buckley will also be entitled to a prorated annual bonus for the year in which his employment terminates. Our obligation to provide the foregoing severance benefits is subject to Mr. Buckley's execution and non‑revocation of a release of claims.
The employment agreement also contains customary provisions relating non‑disclosure and non‑disparagement. In addition, the employment agreement includes 12‑month post‑termination non‑competition and non‑solicitation provisions.
On October 29, 2018, the Company entered into a separation and release agreement with Mr. Buckley, pursuant to which Mr. Buckley resigned as a director on the Board of Directors and from all positions with us and any of our subsidiaries, effective as of October 29, 2018. Pursuant to this separation agreement, Mr. Buckley received (i) continuation of his base salary due under his employment agreement through December 31, 2018, (ii) a lump sum cash payment of $200,000 to be paid as soon as practicable following October 29, 2018, (iii) full payment towards the cost of COBRA continuation coverage for himself and any covered dependents for 18 months following October 29, 2018 (unless he becomes eligible to receive substantially similar coverage from another employer), (iv) accelerated vesting of 144,588 restricted stock units and (v) accelerated vesting of 150,000 performance stock units.
Peter Kim
On September 8, 2015, we entered into a new three‑year employment agreement with Mr. Kim to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of Hudson that replaced his previous employment agreement as of January 28, 2016. This employment agreement was amended on June 16, 2017 to change Mr. Kim's title to Founder and Vice Chairman, provide for a new three-year term of employment and change certain language in his employment agreement to reflect his change in title. Mr. Kim's annual base salary is $600,000 and Mr. Kim is eligible to receive an annual discretionary bonus targeted at 50% of his base salary, based on the satisfaction of criteria and performance standards as established in advance by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee after consulting with Mr. Kim. The employment agreement also provides Mr. Kim with certain other benefits and the reimbursement of certain expenses. Pursuant to his employment agreement on January 28, 2016, we granted Mr. Kim (i) RSUs in respect of 166,667 shares of common stock that vest and become transferable in three equal, annual installments beginning on January 28, 2017, subject to Mr. Kim's continuous employment (the "Kim RSU Award") and (ii) PSUs in respect of 166,667 shares of common stock that are to be earned over a three‑year performance period subject to Mr. Kim's continuous employment (unless Mr. Kim is terminated without "cause" or for "good reason," as provided below) (the "Kim PSU Award"). The three-year performance period began on January 28, 2016 and ends on January 28, 2019, and one‑third of the Kim PSU Award is eligible to vest each year starting on January 28, 2017 and ending on January 28, 2019 based on the attainment of annual performance metrics established by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee at the beginning of the applicable year. The performance criteria are as follows: for target EDBITA at (1) less than 80%, 0% of the shares will vest, (2) 80%, 50% of the shares will vest, (3) 90%, 75% of the shares will vest and (4) 100%, 100% of the shares will vest. To the extent that the subsequent year EBITDA target is exceeded and the excess is sufficient to make up for a prior year shortfall, unvested portions of the Kim PSU Award in any completed year will be eligible for vesting in subsequent years. Both the Kim RSU Award and Kim PSU Award vest under and are governed by the terms of our 2016 Stock Incentive Plan. Mr. Kim will also be entitled to  Table of Contents participate in all regular long‑term incentive programs maintained by us or Hudson on the same basis as similarly‑situated employees.

Additionally, any unvested portion of the Kim RSU Award will immediately vest and become transferable and any unvested portion of the Kim PSU Award will continue to vest without regard to Mr. Kim's continued employment. We have agreed to also pay for the COBRA premiums (to the extent they exceed applicable active employee rates and subject to Mr. Kim timely electing continuation coverage under COBRA) on our group medical plan for Mr. Kim and his spouse and dependents for the shorter of the first 12 months of such coverage or his period of COBRA eligibility.

Mr. Rabin's employment agreement provides for an inducement grant of 4,100,000 RSUs with respect to our common stock and 500,000 PSUs with respect to our common stock. This inducement grant was made as an inducement award and was not granted under our 2016 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan, but is subject to the same terms and conditions as provided in the 2016 Stock Incentive Compensation Plan.
Thirty percent (30%) of the RSUs will vest on December 31, 2019, thirty percent (30%) will vest on December 31, 2020, and the remaining forty (40%) percent will vest on December 31 2021, subject to Mr. Rabin's continued employment with us through the applicable vesting date; provided, if Mr. Rabin's employment is terminated by us without "cause" (and not due to his death or disability) or by him for "good reason" (each such term as defined in his employment agreement), then any unvested portion of the RSUs will accelerate and become fully vested on the date of termination. Any vested RSUs will be settled through the issuance of our common stock.
Thirty-three and a third percent (33.33%) of the PSUs will vest on each of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The PSUs will vest based on our selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses being below a certain target amount for each fiscal year in which the PSUs are scheduled to vest, in all events, subject to Mr. Rabin's continued employment with us; provided that, if Mr. Rabin's employment is terminated by us without "cause" (and not due to his death or disability) or by him for "good reason" (each such term as defined in the Rabin Agreement) then any unvested portion of the PSUs with respect to periods not yet ending before the date of termination will become fully vested on the date of termination. Any vested PSUs will be settled through the issuance of Common Stock.

Any vested RSUs will be settled through the issuance of our common stock. Upon a change in control of us, all of Mr. Pruthi's unvested RSUs will vest immediately.
Upon a termination of Mr. Pruthi's employment without cause or a resignation by Mr. Pruthi for good reason (as such terms are defined in his employment agreement), in addition to acceleration of the RSUs as described above, subject to the execution and non-revocation of a general release and covenant not to sue, we will provide Mr. Pruthi with (i) an amount equal to Mr. Pruthi's base salary, which will be payable pursuant to our standard payroll procedures for twelve months;  (ii) any annual bonus earned but unpaid for a prior year, payable in full in a lump sum payment; (iii) in the event that such resignation or termination occurs following our first fiscal quarter of any year, a pro-rata portion of his bonus for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs based on actual results for such year, payable at the time his bonus would have been paid if his employment had not terminated; (iv) the full cost of COBRA continuation coverage for Mr. Pruthi and his eligible dependents until the earlier of (a) when Mr. Pruthi becomes eligible for coverage under another employer's health plan, or (b) eighteen (18) months following the date of termination of Mr. Pruthi's employment.

Agreements Related to the Joe's Asset Sale and the RG Merger
Hudson Convertible Notes
We issued convertible notes in connection with the acquisition of Hudson with different interest rates and conversion features for Hudson's management stockholders, including Mr. Kim, and for our significant stockholder Fireman Capital CPF Hudson Co-Invest LP ("Fireman"), respectively. On September 8, 2015, we entered into a rollover agreement (the "Rollover Agreement") with the holders of convertible notes originally issued in connection with the  Table of Contents
Hudson acquisition, pursuant to which, on January 28, 2016, the holders of the notes contributed the notes to the Company in exchange for the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· 1,167,317 shares of common stock; 
· a cash payment of approximately $8.6 million, before expenses; and 
· an aggregate principal amount of approximately $16.5 million of modified convertible notes (the "Modified Convertible Notes"). 
[END TABLE]
The Modified Convertible Notes are structurally and contractually subordinated to our senior debt and will mature on July 28, 2021. The Modified Convertible Notes accrue interest quarterly on the outstanding principal amount at a rate of 6.5% per annum (increased to 7% as of October 1, 2016 with respect to the Modified Convertible Notes issued to Fireman), which is payable 50% in cash and 50% in additional paid-in-kind notes; provided, however, that the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to pay 100% of such interest in cash. Beginning on January 28, 2016, the Modified Convertible Notes are convertible by each of the holders into, at our election, shares of our common stock, cash, or a combination of cash and common stock.
If we elect to issue only shares of common stock upon conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes, each of the Modified Convertible Notes would be convertible, in whole but not in part, into a number of shares equal to the conversion amount divided by the market price. The conversion amount is (a) the product of (i) the market price, multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (A) the principal amount, divided by (B) the conversion price, minus (b) the aggregate optional prepayment amounts paid to the holder. The market price is the average of the closing prices for our common stock over the 20 trading day period immediately preceding the notice of conversion. If we elect to pay cash with respect to a conversion of the Modified Convertible Notes, the amount of cash to be paid per share will be equal to the conversion amount. We will have the right to prepay all or any portion of the principal amount of the Modified Convertible Notes at any time so long as we make a pro rata prepayment on all of the Modified Convertible Notes.
RG Stock Purchase Agreement
In connection with the RG Merger, we entered into the RG Stock Purchase Agreement with TCP Denim, LLC, one of our significant stockholders, pursuant to which we issued and sold to TCP Denim, LLC an aggregate of 50,000 shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $50 million in cash (the "RG Stock Purchase Agreement"). The proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred Stock were used to consummate the RG Merger. Under the form of certificate of designation for the Series A Preferred Stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock entitled the holder thereof to receive cumulative cash dividends, payable quarterly, at an annual rate of 10%, plus accumulated and accrued dividends thereon through such date. Additionally, if our Board of Directors declares or pays a dividend on the common stock, then each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive a cash dividend on an as-converted basis.
Each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock was entitled to vote on an as-converted basis and together with the holders of common stock as a single class, subject to certain limitations. For so long as a to-be-determined percentage of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock were outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, exclusively and as a separate class, were entitled to elect three members of the board of directors, each of whom may only be removed without cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock had separate class voting rights with respects to certain matters affecting their rights. Upon any liquidation event, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock were entitled to receive the greater of the liquidation preference on the date of determination and the amount that would be payable to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock had such holders converted their shares of Series A Preferred Stock into shares of common stock immediately prior to such liquidation event. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock was convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder, at an initial conversion price of $11.16 (after taking into account the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below)). All of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock was converted into shares of our common stock in accordance with its terms on October 29, 2018. See "Agreements Related to the GBG Acquisition—Conversion" below. Registration Rights Agreement
On the closing date of the RG Merger, we entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Tengram Registration Rights Agreement") with TCP Denim, LLC and certain of its affiliates, who are one of our significant stockholders, the noteholders party to the Rollover Agreement (including Mr. Kim) and Michael Buckley, our former Chief Executive Officer.

SWIMS® Transaction
On July 18, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding share capital of Norwegian private limited company (aksjeselskap) SWIMS AS ("SWIMS"). SWIMS® is a Scandinavian lifestyle brand known for its range of fashion-forward, water-resistant footwear and sportswear. To finance the acquisition, we issued the following to one of our significant stockholders, Tengram Capital Partners Fund II, L.P.  ("Tengram Fund II"): (i) a warrant for the purchase of 500,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $3.00 per share; and (ii) a convertible promissory note in an original principal amount of $13.0 million convertible into up to 4,500,000 shares of our newly issued Class A‑1 Preferred Stock bearing interest at the rate of 3.75% per annum and which matured on January 18, 2018 (the "SWIMS Convertible Note"). On such date, the SWIMS Convertible Note automatically converted into newly issued shares of our Series A‑1 Preferred Stock, at a conversion price of $3.00 per share. The outstanding balance of the SWIMS Convertible Note, together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon, converted into 4,587,964 shares of Series A‑1 Preferred Stock. Upon the issuance of such shares of Series A‑1 Preferred Stock by us to Tengram II, the SWIMS Convertible Note was settled in its entirety.
On October 29, 2018, 4,587,964 shares of the Company's  Series A‑1 Preferred Stock were converted at the election of the holders thereof into 4,951,177 newly issued shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the Series A‑1 Preferred Stock.

Director Independence
See "Corporate Governance Matters—Director Independence" above. REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
In accordance with the written charter of the Audit Committee, as amended and restated by our Board of Directors on October 25, 2018, the Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the quality and integrity of our accounting, auditing, and financial reporting practices. In addition, the Audit Committee recommends to the full Board of Directors the selection of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee's function is one of oversight, recognizing that the Company's management is primarily responsible for the Company's financial statements as well as the Company's financial reporting processes, principles and internal controls, and that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, issuing a report relating to its audit and expressing an opinion as to the conformity of such financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles. CohnReznick LLP ("CohnReznick") audited our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and included a report thereon in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Currently, all Audit Committee members are "independent" under Nasdaq listing standards and as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC, and Mr. Savage has also been designated to be an "audit committee financial expert" as such term is defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.
In performing its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017, and the audit of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017, with management and CohnReznick. The Audit Committee also discussed with CohnReznick all matters required by the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including those described in Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, and, with and without management present, discussed and reviewed the results of CohnReznick's examination of the financial statements.
The Audit Committee obtained from the independent auditors a formal written statement required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding CohnReznick's independence and discussed such independence with CohnReznick.
Based on the above-mentioned review and discussions with management and the independent auditors, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that our audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017  for filing with the SEC.
After conducting a process to determine the audit firm that would serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2016, on July 6, 2016, the Audit Committee dismissed Moss Adams LLP ("Moss Adams") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Moss Adams's reports on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles; provided, however, that the report for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 included an explanatory paragraph related to the existence of substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014 and in the interim period from January 1, 2016 through July 6, 2016, (i) there were no disagreements with Moss Adams on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which subject matter of the disagreements, if not resolved to Moss Adams's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K. The Company provided Moss Adams with a copy of the foregoing disclosures and requested that Moss Adams furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the above statements made by the Company. A copy of Moss Adam's letter, dated July 8, 2016, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on July 8, 2016.
Contemporaneous with the determination to dismiss Moss Adams, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of CohnReznick as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2016 with immediate effect. During the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014, which were audited by Moss Adams, and during the interim period from January 1, 2016 through July 6, 2016, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted with CohnReznick regarding the Company's financial statements, with  Table of Contents respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that CohnReznick concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Audit Committee has selected CohnReznick as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, and has asked the stockholders to ratify the appointment.

 PROPOSAL NO. 2 — TO RATIFY THE APPOINTMENT OF COHNREZNICK AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018
In July 2016, our Audit Committee determined it to be in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders to select CohnReznick to replace Moss Adams as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2016, and subsequently approved such appointment. Moss Adams served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 and for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 ("fiscal 2014"), after it replaced Ernst & Young LLP ("Ernst & Young"), our previous independent registered public accounting firm for the first three quarters of fiscal 2014. Moss Adams also audited our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014.
We have been advised by CohnReznick that it is an independent registered public accounting firm with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and complies with the auditing, quality control and independence standards and rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
While the Audit Committee retains CohnReznick as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of CohnReznick to our stockholders for ratification upon recommendation to do so by the Audit Committee and as a matter of good corporate governance.
Unless contrary instructions are given, shares represented by proxies solicited by the Board of Directors will be voted for the ratification of the selection of CohnReznick as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. If the selection of CohnReznick is not ratified by affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal, the Audit Committee will review its future selection of an independent registered public accounting firm in the light of that vote result. Even if the selection of CohnReznick is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change is in our best interests.
CohnReznick has no financial interest of any kind in the Company, except the professional relationship between auditor and client. Representatives of CohnReznick will be invited to attend the Annual Meeting. If a representative of CohnReznick does attend the Annual Meeting, the representative will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so chooses, and will be available to respond to questions from stockholders.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy which requires the Audit Committee's pre‑approval of audit and non‑audit services performed by the independent auditor to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee approves such services on an ongoing basis prior to the incurrence of any such audit and non-audit services. The Audit Committee pre-approved all of the audit and non-audit services rendered by Moss Adams prior to their dismissal in July 2016 and CohnReznick listed above.
The Audit Committee has determined that the services provided by Moss Adams and CohnReznick were compatible with maintaining both Moss Adams and CohnReznick's independence.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF COHNREZNICK AS OUR INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2018. CHANGES IN INDEPENDENT AUDITOR
Change from Moss Adams to CohnReznick
As previously reported, on July 6, 2016, the Audit Committee dismissed Moss Adams as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Moss Adams's reports on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles; provided, however, that the report for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2014 included an explanatory paragraph related to the existence of substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Additionally, during the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014 and in the interim period from January 1, 2016 through July 6, 2016, (i) there were no disagreements with Moss Adams on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which subject matter of the disagreements, if not resolved to Moss Adams's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Contemporaneous with the determination to dismiss Moss Adams, the Audit Committee approved the engagement of CohnReznick as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the years ending December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. During the Company's fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014, which were audited by Moss Adams, and during the interim period from January 1, 2016 through July 6, 2016, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted with CohnReznick's regarding the Company's financial statements, with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company or oral advice was provided that CohnReznick concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Company provided Moss Adams with a copy of certain of the foregoing disclosures and requested that Moss Adams furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with such statements made by the Company. A copy of such letter, dated July 8, 2016, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on July 8, 2016.
Change of Accountant in Connection with RG Merger Accounting Purposes
As further discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10‑Q, on January 28, 2016, the Company completed the RG Merger, which, for accounting purposes, was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization, with RG deemed the accounting acquirer. In addition, as part of the RG Merger, the Company adopted RG's fiscal year of December 31, changing from the Company's previous fiscal year of November 30. Prior to the RG Merger, Citrin Cooperman & Company, LLP ("Citrin") was RG's independent public registered accounting firm and audited its financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and Moss Adams was the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and audited its financial statements for the fiscal years ended November 30, 2015 and November 30, 2014. Insofar as RG was considered the accounting acquirer for accounting purposes, the Company's continued use of Moss Adams as its independent registered public accounting constituted a change in accountants reportable for purposes of Item 304 of Regulation S-K.
Thus, as previously reported, on May 12, 2016, the Audit Committee: (i) formally dismissed Citrin from its role as independent registered public accounting firm, effective May 12, 2016; and (ii) formally approved the engagement of Moss Adams as the post-RG Merger Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, effective May 12, 2016. Although the Audit Committee was required to appoint Moss Adams as a formal matter due to changes resulting from the RG Merger, Moss Adams did not resign or decline to stand for re-election and was not dismissed from its position as the Company's principal accountant until its later dismissal in July 2016. Citrin's reports on RG's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 did not contain an adverse opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. Additionally, during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and in the interim period between January 1, 2016 and May 12, 2016, (i) there were no disagreements with Citrin on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which subject matter of the disagreements, if not resolved to Citrin's satisfaction, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with its report, and (ii) there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.
Amendment No. 1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016 included in Exhibit 99.1 certain financial statements of RG audited by Citrin for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, which preceded the RG Merger consummated on January 28, 2016. Citrin is not, and has never been, associated with the financial statements of the post-RG Merger Company.
During RG's fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, periods over which RG's financial statements were audited by Citrin, and during the interim period between January 1, 2016 and May 12, 2016, neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf consulted with Moss Adams regarding RG's financial statements, with respect to: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on RG's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to RG or oral advice was provided that Moss Adams concluded was an important factor considered by RG in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or a reportable event (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).
The Company provided Citrin with a copy of certain of the foregoing disclosures and requested that Citrin furnish a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with such statements made by the Company. A copy of such letter, dated May 16, 2016, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8‑K filed with the SEC on May 16, 2016. OTHER PROPOSALS
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any other matters that may be presented for action at the Annual Meeting and we do not intend to bring any other matters before the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will, in the absence of contrary instructions, have discretionary authority to vote the shares represented by such proxy according to their best judgment.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC on a timely basis. Directors, officers and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are required by the SEC's regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on a review of copies of such forms furnished to us and certain of our internal records, or upon written representations from officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners that no Form 5 was required, we believe that during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors, officers and greater than ten percent beneficial owners were satisfied on a timely basis, except as follows: except each of William Sweedler and Matthew Eby filed, and Tengram Capital Partners Fund II, L.P. and Tengram Capital Associates II, LLC jointly filed a Form 4 on January 24, 2017 reporting the issuances of the SWIMS Warrant and the SWIMS Convertible Note made on July 18, 2016.
