KBL MERGER CORP. IV  527 Stanton Christiana Rd.  Newark, Delaware 19713
NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  TO BE HELD ON MARCH 5, 2019
TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF KBL MERGER CORP. IV:
You are cordially invited to attend the special meeting, which we refer to as the "Special Meeting", of stockholders of KBL Merger Corp. IV, which we refer to as "we", "us", "our", "KBL" or the "Company", to be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 5, 2019 at the offices of Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10105. The accompanying proxy statement, which we refer to as the "Proxy Statement", is dated February 20, 2019, and is first being mailed to stockholders of the Company on or about February 21, 2019. The sole purpose of the Special Meeting is to consider and vote upon the following proposals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a proposal to amend the Company's  amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as the "charter", in the form set forth in Annex  A to the accompanying Proxy Statement, which we refer to as the "Extension Amendment" and such proposal the  "Extension Amendment Proposal", to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock  exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more  businesses, which we refer to as a "business combination", (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such  business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase 100% of the Company's common stock included as part of the units sold  in the Company's initial public offering that was consummated on June 7, 2017, which we refer to as the "IPO",  from March 7, 2019 to June 7, 2019 (or September 9, 2019 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for a business combination  by June 7, 2019) or such earlier date as determined by the Board, which we refer to as the "Extension", and such later  date, the "Extended Date"; and 
[END TABLE]
Each of the Extension Amendment Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal is more fully described in the accompanying Proxy Statement.
The purpose of the Extension Amendment is to allow the Company more time to complete its initial business combination. While we are currently in discussions regarding various business combination opportunities, our board of directors (the "Board") currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before March 7, 2019 to complete a business combination. Accordingly, the Board believes that in order to be able to consummate an initial business combination, we will need to obtain the Extension. Therefore, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to extend the date that the Company has to consummate a business combination to the Extended Date in order that our stockholders have the opportunity to participate in our future investment. In the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the Special Meeting, the Company will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding shares of common stock issued in our IPO, which shares we refer to as the "public shares", and which election we refer to as the "Election", regardless of whether such public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders, the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their public shares when the proposed business combination is submitted to the stockholders, subject to any limitations set forth in our charter as amended by the Extension Amendment. In addition, public stockholders who do not make the Election would be entitled to have their public shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Date. KBL IV Sponsor LLC, which we refer to as our "Sponsor", owns 2,875,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the "Founder Shares", that were issued to the Sponsor prior to our IPO and 377,500 units, which we refer to as the "Placement Units", that were purchased by the Sponsor in a private placement which occurred simultaneously with the completion of the IPO.
To exercise your redemption rights, you must affirmatively vote either "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal and demand that the Company redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, and tender your shares to the Company's transfer agent at least two business days prior to the Special Meeting (or March 1, 2019). A redemption demand may be made by checking the box on the proxy card provided for that purpose and returning the proxy card in accordance with the instructions provided, and, at the same time, ensuring your bank or broker complies with the requirements identified elsewhere herein. You may tender your shares by either delivering your share certificate to the transfer agent or by delivering your shares electronically using the Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system. If you hold your shares in street name, you will need to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to withdraw the shares from your account in order to exercise your redemption rights.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, our Sponsor or its designees has agreed to loan to us (i) $0.09 for each public share that is not redeemed (the "Initial Loan") plus (ii) $0.03 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month commencing on June 7, 2019, and on the 7th day of each subsequent month, or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination from June 7, 2019 until the Extended Date (the "Additional Loans" and, collectively with the Initial Loan, the "Loans"). For example, if the Company takes until September 9, 2019 to complete its business combination, which would represent six calendar months, our Sponsor or its designees would make aggregate Loans of approximately $0.18 (assuming no public shares were redeemed). Assuming the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, the Initial Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account promptly following the Special Meeting. Each Additional Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account within three calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof). Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented and the Company takes the full time through the Extended Date to complete the initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or the Company's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.48 per share, in comparison to the current redemption amount of $10.30 per share (assuming no public shares were redeemed). The Loans are conditioned upon the implementation of the Extension Amendment. The Loans will not occur if the Extension Amendment is not approved or the Extension is not completed. The amount of the Loans will not bear interest and will be repayable by us to our Sponsor or its designees upon consummation of an initial business combination. If our Sponsor or its designees advises us that it does not intend to make the Loans, then the Extension Amendment and the Adjournment Proposal will not be put before the shareholders at the Special Meeting and we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with our charter. Our Sponsor or its designees will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional calendar months until the Extended Date and if our Sponsor determines not to continue extending for additional calendar months, its obligation to make Additional Loans following such determination will terminate.
Based upon the current amount in the Trust Account, the Company anticipates that the per-share price at which public shares will be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $10.30 at the time of the Special Meeting. The closing price of the Company's common stock on February 19, 2019 was $10.22. The Company cannot assure stockholders that they will be able to sell their shares of the Company's common stock in the open market, even if the market price per share is higher than the redemption price stated above, as there may not be sufficient liquidity in its securities when such stockholders wish to sell their shares.
The Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow our Board to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of proxies. The Adjournment Proposal will only be presented to our stockholders in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by March 7, 2019, as contemplated by our IPO prospectus and in accordance with our charter, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the public stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to our rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up. In the event of a liquidation, our Sponsor will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of its ownership of the Founder Shares or the Placement Units.
Subject to the foregoing, the affirmative vote of at least 65% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, including the Founder Shares and shares underlying the Private Units, will be required to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal. The approval of the Extension Amendment is essential to the implementation of our Board's plan to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination. Notwithstanding stockholder approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, our Board will retain the right to abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment at any time without any further action by our stockholders.
Approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders represented in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting.
Our Board has fixed the close of business on February 14, 2019 as the date for determining the Company stockholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of the Company's common stock on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof.
You are not being asked to vote on a proposed business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, provided that you are a stockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination, you will retain the right to vote on a proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash in the event a business combination is approved and completed or we have not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board has determined that the Extension Amendment Proposal and, if presented, the Adjournment Proposal are advisable and recommends that you vote or give instruction to vote "FOR" such proposals.
Under Delaware law and the Company's bylaws, no other business may be transacted at the Special Meeting.
Enclosed is the Proxy Statement containing detailed information concerning the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Adjournment Proposal and the Special Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Special Meeting, we urge you to read this material carefully and vote your shares.
Your vote is important. If you are a stockholder of record, please sign, date and return your proxy card as soon as possible to make sure that your shares are represented at the Special Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record, you may also cast your vote in person at the Special Meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm or bank, you must instruct your broker or bank how to vote your shares, or you may cast your vote in person at the Special Meeting by obtaining a proxy from your brokerage firm or bank. Your failure to vote or instruct your broker or bank how to vote will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal, and an abstention will have the same effect as voting "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal.

SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS  TO BE HELD ON MARCH 5, 2019
PROXY STATEMENT
The special meeting, which we refer to as the "Special Meeting", of stockholders of KBL Merger Corp. IV, which we refer to as the "we", "us", "our", "KBL" or the "Company", will be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 5, 2019 at the offices of Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas,11th Floor, New York, New York 10105, for the sole purpose of considering and voting upon the following proposals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a proposal to amend the Company's          amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as the "charter", in the form set forth in Annex          A, which we refer to as the "Extension Amendment" and such proposal the "Extension Amendment Proposal",          to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,          reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, which we refer to as a "business          combination", (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase          100% of the Company's common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company's initial public offering that          was consummated on June 7, 2017, which we refer to as the "IPO", from March 7, 2019 to June 7, 2019 (or September 9,          2019 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by June 7, 2019) or such earlier date as determined          by the Board, which we refer to as the "Extension", and such later date, the "Extended Date"; and   
● a proposal to amend the Company's          amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which we refer to as the "charter", in the form set forth in Annex          A, which we refer to as the "Extension Amendment" and such proposal the "Extension Amendment Proposal",          to extend the date by which the Company must (i) consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase,          reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses, which we refer to as a "business          combination", (ii) cease its operations if it fails to complete such business combination, and (iii) redeem or repurchase          100% of the Company's common stock included as part of the units sold in the Company's initial public offering that          was consummated on June 7, 2017, which we refer to as the "IPO", from March 7, 2019 to June 7, 2019 (or September 9,          2019 if the Company has executed a definitive agreement for a business combination by June 7, 2019) or such earlier date as determined          by the Board, which we refer to as the "Extension", and such later date, the "Extended Date"; and   
[END TABLE]
The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to the overall implementation of the plan of the board of directors, which we refer to as the "Board", to extend the date by which the Company has to complete an initial business combination. The purpose of the Extension Amendment is to allow the Company more time to complete its initial business combination. In the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the Special Meeting, the Company will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension. In addition, we will not proceed with the Extension if the number of redemptions or repurchases of our shares of common stock issued in our IPO, which shares we refer to as the "public shares", causes us to have less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (which would occur if there are redemptions or repurchases of more than 10,778,788 of our public shares) following approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal. In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which election we refer to as the "Election", regardless of whether such public stockholders vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved by the requisite vote of stockholders, the remaining holders of public shares will retain their right to redeem their public shares when the proposed business combination is submitted to the stockholders, subject to any limitations set forth in our charter as amended by the Extension Amendment. In addition, public stockholders who do not make the Election would be entitled to have their public shares redeemed for cash if the Company has not completed a business combination by the Extended Date. KBL IV Sponsor LLC, which we refer to as our "Sponsor", owns 2,875,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the "Founder Shares", that were issued to the Sponsor prior to our IPO and 377,500 units, which we refer to as the "Placement Units", that were purchased by the Sponsor in a private placement which occurred simultaneously with the completion of the IPO.
To exercise your redemption rights, you must affirmatively vote either "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal and demand that the Company redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, and tender your shares to the Company's transfer agent at least two business days prior to the Special Meeting (or March 1, 2019). A redemption demand may be made by checking the box on the proxy card provided for that purpose and returning the proxy card in accordance with the instructions provided, and, at the same time, ensuring your bank or broker complies with the requirements identified elsewhere herein. You may tender your shares by either delivering your share certificate to the transfer agent or by delivering your shares electronically using the Depository Trust Company's DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) system. If you hold your shares in street name, you will need to instruct your bank, broker or other nominee to withdraw the shares from your account in order to exercise your redemption rights.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, our Sponsor or its designees has agreed to loan to us (i) $0.09 for each public share that is not redeemed (the "Initial Loan") plus (ii) $0.03 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month commencing on June 7, 2019, and on the 7th day of each subsequent month, or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination from June 7, 2019 until the Extended Date (the "Additional Loans" and, collectively with the Initial Loan, the "Loans"). For example, if the Company takes until September 9, 2019 to complete its business combination, which would represent six calendar months, our Sponsor or its designees would make aggregate Loans of approximately $0.18 (assuming no public shares were redeemed). Assuming the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, the Initial Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account promptly following the Special Meeting. Each Additional Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account within three calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof). Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented and the Company takes the full time through the Extended Date to complete the initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or the Company's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.48 per share, in comparison to the current redemption amount of $10.30 per share (assuming no public shares were redeemed). The Loans are conditioned upon the implementation of the Extension Amendment. The Loans will not occur if the Extension Amendment is not approved or the Extension is not completed. The amount of the Loans will not bear interest and will be repayable by us to our Sponsor or its designees upon consummation of an initial business combination. If our Sponsor or its designees advises us that it does not intend to make the Loans, then the Extension Amendment and the Adjournment Proposal will not be put before the shareholders at the Special Meeting and we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with our charter. Our Sponsor or its designees will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional calendar months until the Extended Date and if our Sponsor determines not to continue extending for additional calendar months, its obligation to make Additional Loans following such determination will terminate.
The withdrawal of funds from the Trust Account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the Trust Account following the Election, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be only a small fraction of the approximately  $118,165,948 that was in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2018. In such event, the Company may need to obtain additional funds to complete an initial business combination, and there can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms acceptable to the parties or at all. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we do not consummate a business combination by March 7, 2019, as contemplated by our IPO prospectus and in accordance with our charter, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the public stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law.
There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to the Company's rights or warrants, which will expire worthless in the event of our winding up. In the event of a liquidation, KBL IV Sponsor LLC, which we refer to as our "Sponsor", will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of its ownership of 2,875,000 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the "Founder Shares", that were issued to the Sponsor prior to our IPO and 377,500 units, which we refer to as the "Placement Units", that were purchased by the Sponsor in a private placement which occurred simultaneously with the completion of the IPO. As a consequence, a liquidating distribution will be made only with respect to the public shares.
If the Company liquidates, the Sponsor has agreed to indemnify us to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or any claims by a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into an acquisition agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.10 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to our Trust Account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, which we refer to as the "Securities Act". Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. We cannot assure you, however, that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Based upon the current amount in the Trust Account, we anticipate that the per-share price at which public shares will be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $10.30. Nevertheless, the Company cannot assure you that the per share distribution from the Trust Account, if the Company liquidates, will not be less than $10.10, plus interest, due to unforeseen claims of creditors.
Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, which we refer to as the "DGCL", stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder's pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Because the Company will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL as described in our prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the "SEC", on June 2, 2017, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations have been limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers or investment bankers) or prospective target businesses. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, the Company, pursuant to the terms of the investment management trust agreement, dated June 1, 2017, by and between the Company and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company (the "Trust Agreement"), will (i) remove from the Trust Account an amount, which we refer to as the "Withdrawal Amount", equal to the number of public shares properly redeemed multiplied by the per-share price, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares and (ii) deliver to the holders of such redeemed public shares their portion of the Withdrawal Amount. The remainder of such funds shall remain in the Trust Account and be available for use by the Company to complete a business combination on or before the Extended Date. Holders of public shares who do not redeem their public shares now will retain their redemption rights and their ability to vote on a business combination through the Extended Date if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved.
Our Board has fixed the close of business on February 14, 2019 as the date for determining the Company stockholders entitled to receive notice of and vote at the Special Meeting and any adjournment thereof. Only holders of record of the Company's common stock on that date are entitled to have their votes counted at the Special Meeting or any adjournment thereof. On the record date of the Special Meeting, there were 14,877,500 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding, including 11,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock issued in our IPO, 2,875,000 Founder Shares and an aggregate of 502,500 shares included in the Private Placement Units held by the Sponsor and the underwriters of the IPO. The Company's rights and warrants do not have voting rights in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal or the Adjournment Proposal.
This Proxy Statement contains important information about the Special Meeting and the proposals. Please read it carefully and vote your shares.
We will pay for the entire cost of soliciting proxies from our working capital. We have engaged Advantage Proxy to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. We have agreed to pay Advantage Proxy a fee of $5,500. We will also reimburse Advantage Proxy for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Advantage Proxy and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses. In addition to these mailed proxy materials, our directors and officers may also solicit proxies in person, by telephone or by other means of communication. These parties will not be paid any additional compensation for soliciting proxies. We may also reimburse brokerage firms, banks and other agents for the cost of forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. While the payment of these expenses will reduce the cash available to us to consummate an initial business combination if the Extension is approved, we do not expect such payments to have a material effect on our ability to consummate an initial business combination.
This Proxy Statement is dated February 20, 2019 and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about February 21, 2019. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETING
These Questions and Answers are only summaries of the matters they discuss. They do not contain all of the information that may be important to you. You should read carefully the entire document, including the annexes to this Proxy Statement. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     While we are currently in  discussions regarding business combination opportunities, we have not yet executed a definitive agreement for a business combination.  There is no assurance that the Company will enter into such an agreement with any prospective target, and even if the Company  enters into such an agreement, it may not be able to consummate such a business combination given the actions that must occur  prior to closing.

If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, what happens next?    We are continuing our efforts to execute          a definitive agreement for a business combination with one or more targets.   If the Company executes such an agreement,          we will seek to complete the business combination, which will involve:● completing          proxy materials;● establishing          a meeting date and record date for considering such proposed business combination, and distributing proxy materials to stockholders;          and● holding          a special meeting to consider such proposed business combination.

BACKGROUND
We are a blank check company formed in Delaware on September 9, 2016, for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
There are currently 14,877,500 shares of common stock of the Company issued and outstanding, consisting of 11,500,000 shares originally sold as part of the units issued in our IPO, 2,875,000 Founder Shares and an aggregate of 502,500 shares included in the Private Placement Units held by the Sponsor and the underwriters of the IPO. In addition, we issued rights to receive 1,150,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 5,750,000 shares of common stock (in each case, originally sold as part of the units issued in our IPO) as part of our IPO, along with an aggregate of 502,500 Private Placement Units issued to our Sponsor and the underwriters of our IPO in a private placement simultaneously with the consummation of our IPO. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of common stock, one right to receive one-tenth of one share of the Company's common stock upon consummation of a business combination and one warrant. Each right entitles its holder to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon the consummation of the business combination. Each warrant entitles its holder to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock at an exercise price of $5.75 per half share, to be exercised only for a whole number of shares of our common stock. The warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of our initial business combination and expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding warrants at a price of $0.01 per warrant, if the last sale price of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading day period ending on the third business day before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. The warrants included in the Private Placement Units, however, are non-redeemable so long as they are held by our Sponsor or its permitted transferees.
Net proceeds of $115,000,000 from our IPO and the simultaneous sale of the Private Units in a private placement transaction, including $4,025,000 of deferred underwriting commissions, are being held in our Trust Account in the United States maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee, invested in U.S. "government securities", within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which we refer to as the "1940 Act", with a maturity of 180 days or less or in any open ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by us meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the 1940 Act, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a business combination or (ii) the distribution of the proceeds in the Trust Account as described below.
The amount of proceeds not deposited in the Trust Account was approximately  $555,000 at the closing of our IPO. In addition, interest income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations. As of December 31, 2018, approximately  $118,166,000 was in the Trust Account. The mailing address of the Company's principal executive office is 527 Stanton Christiana Rd., Newark, Delaware 19713.
We are currently in discussions to complete a business combination that will qualify as an initial business combination under our charter. In the event that the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a business combination prior to the Special Meeting, we will issue a press release and file a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission announcing the proposed business combination.
You are not being asked to vote on a proposed business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, provided that you are a stockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination, you will retain the right to vote on a proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash in the event a business combination is approved and completed or we have not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date. THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL
The Company is proposing to amend its charter to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination to the Extended Date.
The Extension Amendment Proposal is essential to the overall implementation of the Board's plan to allow the Company more time to complete a business combination. Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal is a condition to the implementation of the Extension.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we have not consummated a business combination by March 7, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the public stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law.
The Board believes that, given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on finding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider a business combination.
A copy of the proposed amendment to the charter of the Company is attached to this Proxy Statement in Annex A.
Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal 
The Company's IPO prospectus and charter provide that the Company has until March 7, 2019 to complete the purposes of the Company including, but not limited to, effecting a business combination under its terms. While we are currently in discussions regarding business combination opportunities, our Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before March 7, 2019 to complete a business combination. The Company's IPO prospectus and charter provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of all outstanding shares of common stock, including the Founder Shares and shares underlying the Private Units, is required to extend our corporate existence, except in connection with, and effective upon, consummation of a business combination. Additionally, our IPO prospectus and charter provide for all public stockholders to have an opportunity to redeem their public shares in the case our corporate existence is extended as described above. Because we continue to believe that a business combination would be in the best interests of our stockholders, and because we will not be able to conclude a business combination within the permitted time period, the Board has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which we have to complete a business combination beyond March 7, 2019 to the Extended Date. We intend to hold another stockholder meeting prior to the Extended Date in order to seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination. We believe that the foregoing charter provision was included to protect Company stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter. We also believe, however, that given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on finding a business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider a business combination.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is Not Approved
The approval of the Extension Amendment is essential to the implementation of our Board's plan to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination. Therefore, our Board will abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment unless our stockholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved and we have not consummated a business combination by March 7, 2019, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the public stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law.
There will be no distribution from the Trust Account with respect to the Company's rights or warrants which will expire worthless in the event we wind up. In the event of a liquidation, our Sponsor will not receive any monies held in the Trust Account as a result of its ownership of the Founder Shares or the Placement Units.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal Is Approved
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, the Company will file an amendment to the charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in the form set forth in Annex A hereto to extend the time it has to complete a business combination until the Extended Date. The Company will remain a reporting company under the Exchange Act and its units, common stock, rights and warrants will remain publicly traded. The Company will then continue to work to consummate a business combination by the Extended Date.
Notwithstanding stockholder approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, our Board will retain the right to abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment at any time without any further action by our stockholders.
You are not being asked to vote on a proposed business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, provided that you are a stockholder on the record date for a meeting to consider a business combination, you will retain the right to vote on a proposed business combination when it is submitted to stockholders and the right to redeem your public shares for cash in the event a business combination is approved and completed or we have not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, and the Extension is implemented, the removal of the Withdrawal Amount from the Trust Account in connection with the Election will reduce the amount held in the Trust Account. The Company cannot predict the amount that will remain in the Trust Account if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, and the amount remaining in the Trust Account may be only a small fraction of the approximately  $118,166,000 that was in the Trust Account as of December 31, 2018. We will not proceed with the Extension if redemptions or repurchases of our public shares cause us to have less than $5,000,001 of net tangible assets (which would occur if there are redemptions or repurchases of more than 10,778,788 of our public shares) following approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal. Redemption Rights
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, and the Extension is implemented, each public stockholder may seek to redeem his public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Holders of public shares who do not elect to redeem their public shares in connection with the Extension will retain the right to redeem their public shares in connection with any stockholder vote to approve a proposed business combination, or if the Company has not consummated a business combination by the Extended Date.
If the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, our Sponsor or its designees has agreed to loan to us (i) $0.09 for each public share that is not redeemed plus (ii) $0.03 for each public share that is not redeemed for each calendar month commencing on June 7, 2019, and on the 7th day of each subsequent month, or portion thereof, that is needed by the Company to complete an initial business combination from June 7, 2019 until the Extended Date. For example, if the Company takes until September 9, 2019 to complete its business combination, which would represent six calendar months, our Sponsor or its designees would make aggregate Loans of approximately $0.18 (assuming no public shares were redeemed). Assuming the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved, the Initial Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account promptly following the Special Meeting. Each Additional Loan will be deposited in the Trust Account within three calendar days from the beginning of such calendar month (or portion thereof). Accordingly, if the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved and the Extension is implemented and the Company takes the full time through the Extended Date to complete the initial business combination, the redemption amount per share at the meeting for such business combination or the Company's subsequent liquidation will be approximately $10.48 per share, in comparison to the current redemption amount of $10.30 per share (assuming no public shares were redeemed). The Loans are conditioned upon the implementation of the Extension Amendment. The Loans will not occur if the Extension Amendment is not approved or the Extension is not completed. The amount of the Loans will not bear interest and will be repayable by us to our Sponsor or its designees upon consummation of an initial business combination. If our Sponsor or its designees advises us that it does not intend to make the Loans, then the Extension Amendment and the Adjournment Proposal will not be put before the shareholders at the Special Meeting and we will dissolve and liquidate in accordance with our charter. Our Sponsor or its designees will have the sole discretion whether to continue extending for additional calendar months until the Extended Date and if our Sponsor determines not to continue extending for additional calendar months, its obligation to make Additional Loans following such determination will terminate.
TO EXERCISE YOUR REDEMPTION RIGHTS, YOU MUST AFFIRMATIVELY VOTE EITHER "FOR" OR "AGAINST" THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT PROPOSAL, CHECK THE BOX ON THE PROXY CARD PROVIDED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND RETURN THE PROXY CARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED, SUBMIT A REQUEST IN WRITING THAT WE REDEEM YOUR PUBLIC SHARES FOR CASH TO CONTINENTAL STOCK TRANSFER & TRUST COMPANY AT THE ADDRESS BELOW, AND, AT THE SAME TIME, ENSURE YOUR BANK OR BROKER COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED ELSEWHERE HEREIN, INCLUDING DELIVERING YOUR SHARES TO THE TRANSFER AGENT PRIOR TO THE VOTE ON THE EXTENSION AMENDMENT.
In connection with tendering your shares for redemption, prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 1, 2019 (two business days before the Special Meeting), you must elect either to physically tender your stock certificates to Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the Company's transfer agent, at Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State Street Plaza, 30th Floor, New York, New York 10004, Attn: Mark Zimkind, mzimkind@continentalstock.com, or to deliver your shares to the transfer agent electronically using DTC's DWAC system, which election would likely be determined based on the manner in which you hold your shares. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 1, 2019 (two business days before the Special Meeting) ensures that a redeeming holder's election is irrevocable once the Extension Amendment Proposal is approved. In furtherance of such irrevocable election, stockholders making the election will not be able to tender their shares after the vote at the Special Meeting. Through the DWAC system, this electronic delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not it is a record holder or its shares are held in "street name," by contacting the transfer agent or its broker and requesting delivery of its shares through the DWAC system. Delivering shares physically may take significantly longer. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholder's broker and/or clearing broker, DTC, and the Company's transfer agent will need to act together to facilitate this request. There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC system. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and the broker would determine whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. It is the Company's understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. The Company does not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, and it may take longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. Such stockholders will have less time to make their investment decision than those stockholders that deliver their shares through the DWAC system. Stockholders who request physical stock certificates and wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for tendering their shares before exercising their redemption rights and thus will be unable to redeem their shares.
Certificates that have not been tendered in accordance with these procedures prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 1, 2019 (two business days before the Special Meeting) will not be redeemed for cash held in the Trust Account on the redemption date. In the event that a public stockholder tenders its shares and decides prior to the vote at the Special Meeting that it does not want to redeem its shares, the stockholder may withdraw the tender. If you delivered your shares for redemption to our transfer agent and decide prior to the vote at the Special Meeting not to redeem your public shares, you may request that our transfer agent return the shares (physically or electronically). You may make such request by contacting our transfer agent at the address listed above. In the event that a public stockholder tenders shares and the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved, these shares will not be redeemed and the physical certificates representing these shares will be returned to the stockholder promptly following the determination that the Extension Amendment Proposal will not be approved. The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension Amendment. The transfer agent will hold the certificates of public stockholders that make the election until such shares are redeemed for cash or returned to such stockholders.
If properly demanded, the Company will redeem each public share for a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. Based upon the current amount in the Trust Account, the Company anticipates that the per-share price at which public shares will be redeemed from cash held in the Trust Account will be approximately $10.30 at the time of the Special Meeting. The closing price of the Company's common stock on February 19, 2019 was $10.22.
If you exercise your redemption rights, you will be exchanging your shares of the Company's common stock for cash and will no longer own the shares. You will be entitled to receive cash for these shares only if you properly demand redemption and tender your stock certificate(s) to the Company's transfer agent prior to 5:00 p.m. Eastern time on March 1, 2019 (two business days before the Special Meeting). The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension Amendment. UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following discussion is a summary of certain United States federal income tax considerations for holders of our common stock with respect to the exercise of redemption rights in connection with the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal. This summary is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the "Code", the regulations promulgated by the U.S. Treasury Department, current administrative interpretations and practices of the Internal Revenue Service, which we refer to as the "IRS", and judicial decisions, all as currently in effect and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change, possibly with retroactive effect. No assurance can be given that the IRS would not assert, or that a court would not sustain a position contrary to any of the tax considerations described below. This summary does not discuss all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may be important to particular investors in light of their individual circumstances, such as investors subject to special tax rules (e.g., financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, pension plans, S corporations, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect mark-to-market treatment, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, trusts and estates, partnerships and their partners, and tax-exempt organizations (including private foundations)) and investors that will hold common stock as part of a "straddle," "hedge," "conversion," "synthetic security," "constructive ownership transaction," "constructive sale," or other integrated transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, investors subject to the alternative minimum tax provisions of the Code, U.S. Holders (as defined below) that have a functional currency other than the United States dollar, U.S. expatriates, investors that actually or constructively own 5 percent or more of the common stock of the Company, and Non-U.S. Holders (as defined below, and except as otherwise discussed below), all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ materially from those summarized below. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state, local, or non-United States tax considerations, any non-income tax (such as gift or estate tax) considerations, alternative minimum tax or the Medicare tax. In addition, this summary is limited to investors that hold our common stock as "capital assets" (generally, property held for investment) under the Code.
If a partnership (including an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner in such partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our common stock, you are urged to consult your tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of a redemption.
WE URGE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK CONTEMPLATING EXERCISE OF THEIR REDEMPTION RIGHTS TO CONSULT THEIR OWN TAX ADVISORS CONCERNING THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN INCOME AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES THEREOF.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Holders
This section is addressed to U.S. Holders of our common stock that elect to have their common stock of the Company redeemed for cash. For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner that so redeems its common stock of the Company and is: Redemption of Common Stock
In the event that a U.S. Holder's common stock of the Company is redeemed, the treatment of the transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as a sale of the common stock under Section 302 of the Code. Whether the redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the U.S. Holder (including any stock constructively owned by the U.S. Holder as a result of owning warrants) relative to all of our shares both before and after the redemption. The redemption of common stock generally will be treated as a sale of the common stock (rather than as a distribution) if the redemption (i) is "substantially disproportionate" with respect to the U.S. Holder, (ii) results in a "complete termination" of the U.S. Holder's interest in us or (iii) is "not essentially equivalent to a dividend" with respect to the U.S. Holder. These tests are explained more fully below.
In determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied, a U.S. Holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder, but also shares of our stock that are constructively owned by it. A U.S. Holder may constructively own, in addition to stock owned directly, stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the U.S. Holder has an interest or that have an interest in such U.S. Holder, as well as any stock the U.S. Holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option, which would generally include common stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants. In order to meet the substantially disproportionate test, the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately following the redemption of common stock must, among other requirements, be less than 80% of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder immediately before the redemption. There will be a complete termination of a U.S. Holder's interest if either (i) all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed or (ii) all of the shares of our stock actually owned by the U.S. Holder are redeemed and the U.S. Holder is eligible to waive, and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules, the attribution of stock owned by certain family members and the U.S. Holder does not constructively own any other stock. The redemption of the common stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a U.S. Holder's conversion results in a "meaningful reduction" of the U.S. Holder's proportionate interest in us. Whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a U.S. Holder's proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances. However, the IRS has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a "meaningful reduction."
If none of the foregoing tests are satisfied, then the redemption will be treated as a distribution and the tax effects will be as described below under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Holders —  Taxation of Distributions."
U.S. Holders of our common stock considering exercising their redemption rights should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the redemption of their common stock of the Company will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code.
Gain or Loss on a Redemption of Common Stock Treated as a Sale
If the redemption qualifies as a sale of common stock, a U.S. Holder must treat any gain or loss recognized as capital gain or loss. Any such capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder's holding period for the common stock so disposed of exceeds one year. Generally, a U.S. Holder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (i) the amount of cash received in such redemption (or, if the common stock is held as part of a unit at the time of the disposition, the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the common stock based upon the then fair market values of the common stock and the warrant included in the unit) and (ii) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in its common stock so redeemed. A U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in its common stock generally will equal the U.S. Holder's acquisition cost (that is, the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of common stock or the U.S. Holder's initial basis for common stock received upon exercise of a warrant) less any prior distributions treated as a return of capital. Long-term capital gain realized by a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deduction of capital losses is subject to limitations. Taxation of Distributions
If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of common stock, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a distribution. In general, any distributions to U.S. Holders generally will constitute dividends for United States federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. Distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce (but not below zero) the U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in our common stock. Any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the common stock and will be treated as described under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Holders — Gain or Loss on a Redemption of Common Stock Treated as a Sale". Dividends we pay to a U.S. Holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied. With certain exceptions, and provided certain holding period requirements are met, dividends we pay to a non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will constitute "qualified dividends" that will be taxable at a reduced rate.
U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to Non-U.S. Holders
This section is addressed to Non-U.S. Holders of our common stock that elect to have their common stock of the Company redeemed for cash. For purposes of this discussion, a "Non-U.S. Holder" is a beneficial owner (other than a partnership) that so redeems its common stock of the Company and is not a U.S. Holder.
Redemption of Common Stock
The characterization for United States federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a Non-U.S. Holder's common stock generally will correspond to the United States federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a U.S. Holder's common stock, as described under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to U.S. Holders".
Non-U.S. Holders of our common stock considering exercising their redemption rights should consult their own tax advisors as to whether the redemption of their common stock of the Company will be treated as a sale or as a distribution under the Code.
Gain or Loss on a Redemption of Common Stock Treated as a Sale
If the redemption qualifies as a sale of common stock, a Non-U.S. Holder generally will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale of its common stock of the Company, unless: Taxation of Distributions
If the redemption does not qualify as a sale of common stock, the U.S. Holder will be treated as receiving a distribution. In general, any distributions we make to a Non-U.S. Holder of shares of our common stock, to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits (as determined under United States federal income tax principles), will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States, we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of 30%, unless such Non-U.S. Holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate. Any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing (but not below zero) the Non-U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis in its shares of our common stock and, to the extent such distribution exceeds the Non-U.S. Holder's adjusted tax basis, as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the common stock, which will be treated as described under "U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations to Non-U.S. Holders —  Gain on Sale, Taxable Exchange or Other Taxable Disposition of Common Stock". Dividends we pay to a Non-U.S. Holder that are effectively connected with such Non-U.S. Holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States generally will not be subject to United States withholding tax, provided such Non-U.S. Holder complies with certain certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to United States federal income tax, net of certain deductions, at the same graduated individual or corporate rates applicable to U.S. Holders (subject to an exemption or reduction in such tax as may be provided by an applicable income tax treaty). If the Non-U.S. Holder is a corporation, dividends that are effectively connected income may also be subject to a "branch profits tax" at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty).
Taxation of Common Stock Held Through Foreign Accounts
A 30% withholding tax applies with respect to certain payments on, and gross proceeds from a sale or disposition of, our common stock in each case if paid to a foreign financial institution or a non-financial foreign entity (including, in some cases, when such foreign financial institution or entity is acting as an intermediary), unless (i) in the case of a foreign financial institution, such institution enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to withhold on certain payments, and to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding U.S. account holders of such institution (which includes certain equity and debt holders of such institution, as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners), (ii) in the case of a non-financial foreign entity, such entity certifies that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity, or (iii) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. Under certain circumstances, a holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country or future Treasury Regulations may modify these requirements.
Non-U.S. Holders are encouraged to consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of such withholding tax.
As previously noted above, the foregoing discussion of certain material U.S. federal income tax consequences is included for general information purposes only and is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, legal or tax advice to any stockholder. We once again urge you to consult with your own tax adviser to determine the particular tax consequences to you (including the application and effect of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign income or other tax laws) of the receipt of cash in exchange for shares in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. THE SPECIAL MEETING
Overview
Date, Time and Place.  The Special Meeting of the Company's stockholders will be held at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 5, 2019 at the offices of Ellenoff Grossman & Schole LLP, located at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, 11th Floor, New York, New York 10105.
Voting Power; Record Date.  You will be entitled to vote or direct votes to be cast at the Special Meeting, if you owned the Company's common stock at the close of business on February 14, 2019, the record date for the Special Meeting. You will have one vote per proposal for each share of Company common stock you owned at that time. The Company rights and warrants do not carry voting rights.
Votes Required.  Approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal will require the affirmative vote of holders of at least 65% of the Company's common stock outstanding on the record date, including the Founder Shares and shares underlying the Private Units. If you do not vote or you abstain from voting on a proposal, your action will have the same effect as an "AGAINST" vote. Broker non-votes will have the same effect as "AGAINST" votes.
At the close of business on the record date of the Special Meeting, there were 14,877,500 outstanding shares of the Company's common stock, each of which entitles its holder to cast one vote per proposal.
If you do not want the Extension Amendment Proposal approved, you must abstain, not vote, or vote "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment. You will be entitled to redeem your public shares for cash in connection with this vote only if you vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" the Extension Amendment Proposal and elect to redeem your public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds available in the Trust Account in connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal. If you abstain from voting on the Extension Amendment Proposal, then you will not be eligible to redeem your public shares. The Company anticipates that a public stockholder who tenders shares for redemption in connection with the vote to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal would receive payment of the redemption price for such shares soon after the completion of the Extension Amendment Proposal.
Proxies; Board Solicitation; Proxy Solicitor.  Your proxy is being solicited by the Board on the proposals being presented to stockholders at the Special Meeting. The Company has engaged Advantage Proxy to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. No recommendation is being made as to whether you should elect to redeem your public shares. Proxies may be solicited in person or by telephone. If you grant a proxy, you may still revoke your proxy and vote your shares in person at the Special Meeting if you are a holder of record of the Company's common stock. You may contact Advantage Proxy at (877) 870-8565 (toll free) or by email at ksmith@advantageproxy.com. Required Vote
The affirmative vote by holders of at least 65% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock, including the Founder Shares and shares underlying the Private Units, is required to approve the Extension Amendment Proposal. If the Extension Amendment Proposal is not approved, the Extension Amendment will not be implemented and the Company will be required by its charter to (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares in consideration of a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to $50,000 of such net interest to pay dissolution expenses), by (B) the total number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish rights of the public stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any) and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Board in accordance with applicable law, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and other requirements of applicable law. The approval of the Extension Amendment is essential to the implementation of our Board's plan to extend the date by which we must consummate our initial business combination. Therefore, our Board will abandon and not implement such amendment unless our stockholders approve the Extension Amendment Proposal. Notwithstanding stockholder approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal, our Board will retain the right to abandon and not implement the Extension Amendment at any time without any further action by our stockholders.
Our Sponsor and all of our directors, executive officers and their affiliates are expected to vote any common stock owned by them in favor of the Extension Amendment. On the record date, our Sponsor, directors and executive officers of the Company and their affiliates beneficially owned and were entitled to vote an aggregate of 3,252,500 shares of the Company's common stock, representing approximately 21.9% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Our Sponsor and our directors, executive officers and their affiliates do not intend to purchase shares of common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in connection with the stockholder vote on the Extension Amendment.
Interests of our Sponsor, Directors and Officers
When you consider the recommendation of our Board, you should keep in mind that our Sponsor, executive officers and members of our Board have interests that may be different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. These interests include, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the fact that, as of December 31, 2018,          the Company had outstanding advances from the Sponsor amounting to $203,030, which advances may be formalized into a promissory          note and become convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit;   
● the fact that, as of December 31, 2018,          the Company had outstanding advances from the Sponsor amounting to $203,030, which advances may be formalized into a promissory          note and become convertible into units of the post-Business Combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit;   
[END TABLE]
The Board's Reasons for the Extension Amendment Proposal and Its Recommendation
As discussed below, after careful consideration of all relevant factors, our Board has determined that the Extension Amendment are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Our Board has approved and declared advisable adoption of the Extension Amendment Proposal, and recommends that you vote "FOR" such proposal. Our IPO prospectus and charter provide that the Company has until March 7, 2019 to complete the purposes of the Company including, but not limited to, effecting a business combination under its terms. While we are currently in discussions regarding business combination opportunities, our Board currently believes that there will not be sufficient time before March 7, 2019 to complete a business combination. The Company's IPO prospectus and charter state that if the Company's stockholders approve an amendment to the Company's charter that would affect the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to redeem 100% of the Company's public shares if it does not complete a business combination before March 7, 2019, the Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon such approval at a per share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. We believe that this charter provision was included to protect the Company stockholders from having to sustain their investments for an unreasonably long period if the Company failed to find a suitable business combination in the timeframe contemplated by the charter.
In addition, the Company's IPO prospectus and charter provide that the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of all outstanding shares of common stock, including the Founder Shares and shares underlying the Private Units, is required to extend our corporate existence, except in connection with, and effective upon the consummation of, a business combination. We believe that, given the Company's expenditure of time, effort and money on the potential business combination, circumstances warrant providing public stockholders an opportunity to consider a business combination. Because we continue to believe that a business combination would be in the best interests of our stockholders and because we will not be able to conclude a business combination within the permitted time period, the Board has determined to seek stockholder approval to extend the date by which we have to complete a business combination beyond March 7, 2019 to the Extended Date.
The Company is not asking you to vote on any proposed business combination at this time. If the Extension is implemented and you do not elect to redeem your public shares, you will retain the right to vote on any proposed business combination in the future and the right to redeem your public shares at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, in the event a business combination is approved and completed or the Company has not consummated another business combination by the Extended Date.
After careful consideration of all relevant factors, the Board determined that the Extension Amendment is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Our Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal. THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
Overview
The Adjournment Proposal, if adopted, will allow our Board to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of proxies. The Adjournment Proposal will only be presented to our stockholders in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal. In no event will our Board adjourn the Special Meeting beyond March 7, 2019.
Consequences if the Adjournment Proposal is Not Approved
If the Adjournment Proposal is not approved by our stockholders, our Board may not be able to adjourn the Special Meeting to a later date in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Amendment Proposal.
Vote Required for Approval
The approval of the Adjournment Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the majority of the votes cast by stockholders represented in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting. Accordingly, if a valid quorum is otherwise established, a stockholder's failure to vote by proxy or in person at the Special Meeting will have no effect on the outcome of any vote on the Adjournment Proposal. Abstentions will be counted in connection with the determination of whether a valid quorum is established but will have no effect on the outcome of the Adjournment Proposal.
Recommendation of the Board
Our Board unanimously recommends that our stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of the Adjournment Proposal. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES

Such proposals must be received by the Company at its offices at 527 Stanton Christiana Rd., Newark, Delaware 19713 no later than July 31, 2019.
In addition, our bylaws provide notice procedures for stockholders to nominate a person as a director and to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. Notice of a nomination or proposal must be delivered to us not less than 90 days and not more than 120 days prior to the date for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 45 days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the opening of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of  (x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by us.

HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this Proxy Statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family.

However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions: WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION
