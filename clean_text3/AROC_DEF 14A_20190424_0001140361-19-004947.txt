[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote?
Owners of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, as of the close of business on the record date of March 1, 2019, are entitled to receive notice of and to vote           at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 1, 2019, there were 130,414,438 shares of common stock outstanding. Each share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote at the Annual Meeting and           any adjournment or postponement of the meeting.  A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote will be available for examination at the meeting and for at least 10 days prior to the meeting at our corporate offices located at 9807 Katy           Freeway, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77024.
How do I vote?
Stockholder of Record. If you are a stockholder of record, you may           vote over the telephone, by Internet, by mailing in a proxy card, in person at the Annual Meeting or you can give a proxy to be voted at the meeting. Please refer to the specific voting instructions set forth on the Notice of Internet           Availability of Proxy Materials.
Street Name Holder. If, like most of our stockholders, you hold           your shares through a bank, broker or other nominee (in "street name"), you must vote your shares in the manner prescribed by your bank, broker or other nominee. Your broker or other nominee will either explain how to vote your stock or enclose a           voting instruction card for you to use in directing the broker or other nominee how to vote your stock. If you are a street name holder, you may vote your stock in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a signed proxy from your broker or           other nominee giving you a right to vote the stock.
Archrock, Inc. | 1
Table of Contents
How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?
A quorum of stockholders is necessary for a valid meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common           stock will constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Under our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended, and under Delaware law, abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present in determining whether the quorum requirement is           satisfied.
What are "broker non-votes" and what affect do they have on the Annual Meeting?
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the broker does not have discretionary           voting power for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"), brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote shares in connection with non-routine matters           without instructions from the beneficial owner. Therefore, if you hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker or other nominee, for your vote to be counted on any of the proposals other than Proposal 2, you will need to communicate your voting           decisions to your bank, broker or other nominee before April 24, 2019.
Each proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting is described in this Proxy Statement, as is the vote required to approve each proposal. For any other matters that           may be properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will have discretion to vote on those matters according to their best judgment to the same extent as the person delivering the proxy would be entitled           to vote. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we do not anticipate that any other matters will be properly presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting.
How can I change my vote?
A proxy may be revoked at any time before it is voted by sending written notice of revocation to our Secretary, by delivering a later-dated proxy (by one of the           methods described above) or by voting in person at the meeting. The Secretary may be contacted at the following address: Archrock, Inc., 9807 Katy Freeway, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77024, Attention: Secretary.  If you hold your shares in street name, you should follow the directions provided by your broker or other nominee regarding how to revoke your proxy.
Who will count the votes?
Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. will provide a representative to tabulate and certify the vote results and act as the inspector of election for the Annual           Meeting.
Who is paying the cost to solicit votes?
This solicitation is made on behalf of the Board of Directors, and we will pay the cost of soliciting proxies.  In addition to solicitations by mail, our directors,           officers and employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies on the Company's behalf in person, by telephone, or by electronic communication. We must also pay brokerage firms, banks, broker-dealers and other similar organizations           representing beneficial owners certain fees associated with:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Forwarding the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to beneficial owners;  
• Forwarding printed proxy materials by mail to beneficial owners who specifically request them; and  
• Obtaining beneficial owners' voting instructions.  
[END TABLE]
How can I obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials or change the way I receive these materials in the future?
Instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy           Statement, form of proxy card and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, we have elected to provide access to such documents on the Internet.  Most stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless they request them, in           which case printed copies of the proxy materials will be provided at no charge.  Our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials was first mailed to stockholders of record and beneficial owners on or about March 14, 2019.  Any stockholder           may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by e-mail for this year and on an ongoing basis by following the instructions set forth in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.

Table of Contents
What is "householding"?
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules regarding the delivery of the notice of internet availability, proxy statements and annual reports permit us, in           specified circumstances, to deliver a single set of these reports to any address at which two or more stockholders reside. This method of delivery, often referred to as householding, will reduce the amount of duplicative information that security           holders receive and lower printing and mailing costs for us. Each stockholder will continue to receive a separate proxy card.
We have delivered only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to eligible stockholders who share an address, unless we received contrary instructions           from any such stockholder prior to the mailing date. We will deliver promptly, upon written or oral request, a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of           such document was delivered. Any stockholder who would like to receive a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, now or in the future, should submit this request to our Secretary. The Secretary may be contacted at           the following address: Archrock, Inc., 9807 Katy Freeway, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77024, Attention: Secretary. Beneficial owners sharing an address who receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and who           would like to receive a single copy of such materials in the future will need to contact their broker, bank or other nominee to request that only a single copy of such document be mailed to all stockholders at the shared address in the future.

PROPOSAL 1
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Eight directors are nominated to be elected to the Board of Directors (the "Board") at the Annual Meeting, to hold office until our next annual meeting of           stockholders or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. Each nominee has consented to serve as a director if elected.
Board of Directors' Recommendation
The Board recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the election           of each of the nominees to the Board as set forth in this proposal.
Vote Required
With respect to the election of directors, you may vote "for" or withhold authority to vote for each director nominee. A plurality of the votes present in person or           by proxy and entitled to vote is required to elect each director nominee, meaning that the eight director nominees who receive the highest number of shares voted "for" their election are elected; however, our Corporate Governance Principles           require that any nominee who receives a greater number of "withheld" votes than "for" votes must submit his or her resignation for consideration by our Board. Broker non-votes will not have any effect on the election of directors.
Nominees for Director
The following biographical information is furnished with respect to each director nominee, together with a discussion of each nominee's experience, qualifications           and attributes or skills that were considered in their nomination to the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The executive summary to this Proxy Statement provides highlights of our corporate governance practices.  The Board is committed to responsible and responsive           corporate governance policies and practices that serve the interests of all stockholders.  The full Board, at the direction of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, routinely reviews best practices in corporate governance.  During           2018, our senior management attended eight energy investor conferences and several non-deal road shows to communicate our mission and vision with our stockholders and receive feedback on the issues they consider most important as an investor in           Archrock.
We Power America, by providing compression services for the gathering and distribution of a cleaner burning fuel, natural gas.  At Archrock, doing so with respect           for people, safety, the environment and our communities is just good business.  It means creating critical jobs even in the most remote parts of the country, making sure our people come home safely at the end of each day, minimizing our impact on           the environment for future generations and being good citizens by making a difference in the communities where we operate.   More information can be found at www.archrock.com.                       The following provides more detailed information regarding our corporate governance practices.
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Our Code of Business Conduct requires all employees, officers and non-employee directors to avoid situations that may impact their ability to carry out their duties in an independent and objective fashion. Any circumstance that has the potential to compromise their ability to perform independently must be disclosed. This policy is made available to all employees. In addition, we distribute director and officer questionnaires at least annually to elicit related-party information. The questionnaire requires that responses be updated throughout the year to the extent circumstances change. 
 The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses director independence each year by considering all direct and indirect business relationships between Archrock and each director (including his or her immediate family), as well as relationships with other for-profit concerns and charitable organizations. With the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation, the Board makes a determination relating to the independence of each member, which is based on applicable laws, regulations, our Corporate Governance Principles and the rules of the NYSE.

      The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that all Board candidates should be selected for their                        character, judgment, ethics, integrity, business experience, time commitment and acumen. The Board, as a whole, through its individual members, seeks to have competence in areas of particular importance to us such as finance,                        accounting, energy industry and relevant technical expertise. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers issues of diversity in the director identification and nomination process. While the Nominating and                        Corporate Governance Committee does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, it seeks nominees with a broad diversity of experience, professions, skills, education and backgrounds. The Nominating and Corporate Governance                        Committee does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is necessarily applicable to all prospective nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that backgrounds and                        qualifications of the directors, considered as a group, should provide a significant composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow the Board to fulfill its responsibilities. Nominees are not discriminated                        against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin, citizenship, veteran status, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, genetic information or any other basis proscribed by law. 
[END TABLE]
Directors must be committed to enhancing the long-term interests of our stockholders as a whole and should not be biased toward the interests of any particular           segment of the stockholder or employee population. Board members should also be prepared to travel to personally attend meetings of the Board and its committees and should be ready to dedicate sufficient time to prepare in advance of such           meetings to allow them to make an effective contribution to the meetings. Further, Board members should ensure that they are not otherwise committed to other activities which would make a commitment to the Board impractical or unadvisable and           should satisfy the independence, qualification and composition requirements of the Board and its committees, as required by applicable law, regulation and the rules of the NYSE, our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws and our Corporate           Governance Principles.

THE BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT
The Board has an active role, as a whole and through its committees, in overseeing management of the Company's risks. The Board's role in the risk oversight process           includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to us, including those listed in the chart below. Also, the involvement of the Board in reviewing, approving and monitoring our fundamental financial           and business strategies, as contemplated by our Corporate Governance Principles, is important to the determination of the types and appropriate levels of risk we undertake. The Board's committees, all comprised solely of independent directors,           assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Full Board    Ø  Strategic, financial and execution risk associated with the annual performance plan and long-term plan, including major operational initiatives  
  Ø  Risks associated with capital management, including financing, dividends and capital expenditures  
  Ø  Mergers, acquisitions and divestitures  
  Ø  Major litigation, disputes and regulatory matters  
  Ø  Management succession planning  
  Ø  Cybersecurity risk and prevention  
  Ø  Risks associated with safety and environmental, sustainability and social issues

[END TABLE]
While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through           committee reports about such risks. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
Messrs. Hall, Brooks, Honeybourne and Lytal served on the Compensation Committee in 2018; former director Mark A. McCollum served on the Compensation Committee           through April 25, 2018. There are no matters relating to interlocks or insider participation that we are required to report.
MANAGEMENT SUCCESSION PLANNING
Succession planning is a critical board function.  The Board considers our business strategy in evaluating the skills and experience necessary for us to achieve our           objectives.  With input from our Chief Executive Officer, the Board routinely reviews management talent and leadership development and is actively engaged in succession planning.  In 2018, two internal candidates were selected to fill the role           vacated by our former Chief Operating Officer.  In addition, in 2018 the Board adopted a new succession policy in the event of an unanticipated vacancy in the Chief Executive Officer position.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending non-employee director compensation to the full Board for approval.  Director compensation is designed to           ensure the Company can attract and retain outstanding directors who meet the qualifications outlined in the Board's Corporate Governance Principles, ensure alignment with long-term stockholder interests and recognize the substantial time           commitments associated with service on the Board.
Non-employee members of the Board are compensated in cash and equity. In his position as Chairman of the Board, Mr. Hall received additional compensation to reflect           this role. Mr. Childers, who is both a director and our employee, does not receive additional compensation for his service on the Board.
Cash Compensation
As reflected in the table below, each non-employee director earned an annual cash retainer (the "Base Retainer") for his or her service during 2018. The Chairman of           the Board and the chairs of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee each received an additional retainer for their services. All retainers are paid in arrears in equal quarterly installments.           Directors are also reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred to attend Board and committee meetings.  As indicated in the chart below, effective October 1, 2018, the Board approved an increase in director compensation.  The increase was based           on market data provided by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and it positions our directors' compensation relative to our peer group in the 40th percentile of annual individual director compensation.

Equity-Based Compensation
On March 2, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of restricted stock to each currently-serving non-employee director with a grant date value equal to           approximately $125,000. The number of shares awarded was determined based on the market closing price of our common stock on the grant date ($9.50) and resulted in the award of 13,158 restricted shares to each non-employee director.  The 2018           equity award was one-quarter vested on the grant date, with the remaining three-quarters vesting ratably on each of June 1, September 1 and December 1, 2018.  On July 25, 2018, the date of his election to the Board, the Compensation Committee           approved the grant of 4,883 shares of restricted stock to Mr. Segner valued at $62,500, with the number of shares based on the market closing price of our common stock on the grant date ($12.80).  Mr. Segner's award was one-third vested on the           grant date and the remaining two-thirds vested ratably on each of September 1 and December 1, 2018.
In consideration of his nine years of service on the Board and leadership as chair of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee approved the acceleration of           the 6,579 shares of unvested restricted stock held by Mr. McCollum as of his effective date of resignation, July 25, 2018.  The restricted stock was originally scheduled to vest ratably on each of September 1, 2018 and December 1, 2018.
Stock Ownership Requirements
Our stock ownership policy requires each director to own an amount of our common stock equal to at least five times the Base Retainer amount (which currently equals           $450,000 of our common stock) within five years of his or her election to the Board. We measure the stock ownership of our directors annually on each June 30.  All directors are in compliance with our stock ownership policy.

Director Stock and Deferral Plan
Under our Directors' Stock and Deferral Plan (the "Directors' Plan"), directors may elect to receive all or a portion of their cash compensation for Board service in           the form of our common stock and may defer their receipt of common stock. No director elected to participate in the Directors' Plan during 2018.
Total Compensation
The following table shows the total compensation paid to each non-employee director for his or her service during 2018.  As shown below, excluding our Chairman of           the Board, the equity (at-risk) portion of compensation is greater than 50% of each director's total compensation.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our directors and officers are required to file reports of holdings and           transactions in Archrock stock with the SEC on a timely basis. Based on our records and other information, we believe that in 2018 our directors and our officers who were subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act met all the applicable filing           requirements.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
We recognize that transactions with related persons can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that decisions are based on           considerations other than the best interests of us and our stockholders. Therefore, our Audit Committee has adopted a written policy on related party transactions to provide guidance and set standards for the approval and reporting of           transactions between us and individuals with a direct or indirect affiliation with us and to ensure that those transactions are in our best interest. Any proposed related-party transaction must be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval           prior to entering into the transaction. Additionally, our policy requires that our subsidiaries report all related party transactions to the Financial Reporting Department on a quarterly basis. In the event a senior officer becomes aware of any           pending or ongoing related party transaction that has not been previously approved or ratified, the transaction must be promptly submitted to the Audit Committee or its Chair for ratification, amendment or termination of the related party           transaction. If a related party transaction is ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for management and will annually assess the relationship with such related party.
In reviewing a proposed or ongoing related-party transaction, the Audit Committee will consider, among other things, the following factors to the extent relevant to           the related-party transaction:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  whether the terms of the transaction are fair to the Company and would apply on the same basis if the transaction did not involve a related party;  
  Ø  whether there are any compelling business reasons for the Company to enter into the transaction;  
  Ø  whether the transaction would impair the independence of an otherwise independent director; and  
  Ø  whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer of the Company, taking into account, among other factors the Audit                        Committee deems relevant, the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the director, executive officer or other related party, that person's interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed                        relationship.  
[END TABLE]
During 2018, Archrock and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business and at competitive terms and prices, made sales to or purchases from corporations of           which certain non-management directors are executive officers and/or directors.  The Audit Committee does not consider the transactions to be material to its business, to the business of the other corporation or to the interests of the directors           concerned.

PROPOSAL 2
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee           has selected Deloitte as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. We are submitting the selection of Deloitte for stockholder ratification at the Annual Meeting.
Representatives of Deloitte attended all meetings of the Audit Committee in 2018 as well as our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. For additional information           concerning the Audit Committee and its activities with Deloitte, see "Pre-Approval Policy" and "Report of the Audit Committee" following this proposal description. We expect that a representative of Deloitte will attend the Annual Meeting, and           the representative will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she so chooses. The representative will also be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION
The Board recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the           ratification of the reappointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP.
VOTE REQUIRED
Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as our independent registered accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes           cast in favor of or against the proposal, which means that the number of shares voted "for" ratification must exceed the number of shares voted "against" ratification. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the           vote.
Our organizational documents do not require that our stockholders ratify the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. We are requesting such           ratification because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If our stockholders do not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to retain Deloitte. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in           its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of us and our stockholders.
FEES PAID TO THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by Deloitte and its member firms and respective affiliates on our behalf for calendar years 2018           and 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Total fees:     $   2,598       $   1,778    
[END TABLE]
 1 Audit fees include fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm related to audits and reviews of financial statements we are required to file           with the SEC, audits of internal control over financial reporting, including issuance of comfort letters and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC.
2  Audit-related             fees for 2018 include fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm primarily related to new accounting standards not yet adopted during 2018, and issuance of comfort letters and assistance with and review of documents filed           with the SEC in connection with the Partnership Merger.
3 Tax fees for 2018 include fees           billed by our independent public accounting firm primarily related to tax compliance and consulting services.

Table of Contents
In considering the nature of the services provided by Deloitte, the Audit Committee determined that such services are compatible with the provision of independent           audit services. The Audit Committee discussed these services with Deloitte and our management to determine that they are permitted under the rules and regulations concerning auditor independence promulgated by (i) the SEC to implement the           Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and (ii) the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
PRE-APPROVAL POLICY
The Audit Committee has adopted policies and procedures relating to the approval of all audit and non-audit services that are to be performed by our independent           registered public accounting firm. This policy generally provides that we will not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to render audit or non-audit services, and will not engage any other independent registered public           accounting firm to render audit services, unless the service is specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee's practice is to consider for approval, at its regularly scheduled meetings, all audit and non-audit services proposed to be provided by our           independent registered public accounting firm. In situations where a matter cannot wait until the next regularly scheduled committee meeting, the chair of the Audit Committee has been delegated authority to consider and, if appropriate, approve           audit and non-audit services. Approval of services and related fees by the Audit Committee chair is reported to the full Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting. All services performed by our independent registered public           accounting firm in 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in its general oversight of Archrock's financial reporting, internal controls and audit           functions. The Audit Committee Charter describes in greater detail the full responsibilities of the Audit Committee and is available on Archrock's website at www.archrock.com.
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements and management's assessment and report on internal controls over financial           reporting with management and Deloitte, Archrock's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also reviewed and discussed with Deloitte its review and report on Archrock's internal control over financial reporting.           Archrock published these reports in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which it filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of financial           statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. Deloitte is responsible for performing an independent audit of Archrock's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company           Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and issuing a report thereon, as well as expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Archrock's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors these processes.
The Audit Committee members are not professional accountants or auditors, and their functions are not intended to duplicate or to certify the activities of           management or the independent auditors. The Audit Committee serves a board-level oversight role, in which it provides advice, counsel and direction to management and the independent auditors on the basis of the information it receives,           discussions with management and the independent auditors, and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business, financial and accounting matters. In accordance with law, the Audit Committee has ultimate authority and responsibility for           selecting, compensating, evaluating, and, when appropriate, replacing Archrock's independent auditors. The Audit Committee has the authority to engage its own outside advisers, including experts in particular areas of accounting, as it determines           appropriate, apart from counsel or advisers hired by management.
Archrock, Inc. | 22
Table of Contents
In this context, the Audit Committee discussed with Archrock's internal auditors and Deloitte the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit           Committee met with the internal auditors and Deloitte, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of Archrock's internal controls, and the overall quality of Archrock's financial           reporting. Management represented to the Audit Committee that Archrock's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and the Audit Committee reviewed and           discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and Deloitte, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles applied, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of           disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with Deloitte the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication with Audit Committees), as currently in effect.
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with Deloitte its independence, considered the compatibility of non-audit services with the auditors' independence and           received the written disclosures and letter required by Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions with Audit Committees), as currently in effect.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to Archrock's Board of Directors, and the Board has concurred, that (i) the           audited financial statements be included in Archrock's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission; (ii) Deloitte meets the requirements for independence; and           (iii) the appointment of Deloitte for 2019 be submitted to the stockholders for ratification.

PROPOSAL 3
ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS          
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our stockholders are provided the opportunity to vote to approve, on a nonbinding, advisory basis, the compensation of           our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This proposal gives stockholders the opportunity to approve, reject or abstain from voting with respect to the compensation provided to our Named Executive Officers for 2018, as           described this Proxy Statement.
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement, our executive compensation program is designed to attract and retain           individuals with the level of expertise and experience needed to help achieve the business objectives intended to drive both short- and long-term success and stockholder value. You are encouraged to read the detailed information concerning our           executive compensation program and policies contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis following this proposal description, as well as the compensation-related tabular and other disclosure following the Compensation Discussion and           Analysis.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS' RECOMMENDATION
The Board has determined to hold a "say on pay" advisory vote every year. In accordance with this determination and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, the Board           recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Archrock, Inc. approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to its Named Executive Officers for 2018, as disclosed in           this Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal 3 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast in favor of or against the proposal, which means that the number           of shares voted "for" approval must exceed the number of shares voted "against" approval. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
Because the vote on this proposal is advisory in nature, the outcome will not be binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee and will not affect           compensation already paid or awarded. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future compensation arrangements for our Named           Executive Officers.
Consistent with the results of our stockholders' most recent vote on the frequency of future "say on pay" votes, our Board has determined to hold future "say on pay"           advisory votes on executive compensation on an annual basis.  Unless the Board modifies its determination of the frequency of future "say on pay" advisory votes, the next "say on pay" advisory vote will be held at our 2020 Annual Meeting of           Stockholders.

In addition, it provides information on our compensation objectives and policies, each element of compensation, and how each element of compensation           relates to our compensation objectives and policies and ultimately ties to our corporate strategy to strengthen our performance and generate stockholder value.  Our 2018 Named Executive Officers were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer     Title

Mr. Guba was not an employee of the Company and, as such, Mr. Guba was not compensated by Archrock.  We paid an hourly           fee to Tatum for Mr. Guba's services and Mr. Guba was directly compensated by Tatum.  The Tatum services agreement is described below under "Service Agreement – Raymond K. Guba."  Mr. Clawges was appointed an executive officer in October 2018,           following Mr. Rice's resignation from his position as Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company in September 2018.
2018 SAY ON PAY VOTE
Our 2017 executive compensation program received a stockholder approval rating of 94% at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Compensation Committee took           into consideration the overwhelming stockholder support of our executive compensation program and evaluated the effectiveness of the program.  Based on these considerations, the Compensation Committee determined to adopt the 2018 executive           compensation program, materially unchanged from the 2017 program.
Our Compensation Committee values the feedback it has received from our stockholders and, based on that feedback, has made the following enhancements from 2017           through recent decisions regarding the 2019 executive compensation program:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  improved disclosure regarding the mechanics of our annual Incentive Program;  
  Ø  increased over the past two years the percentage of the total LTI Award value granted to our Chief Executive Officer that is based on performance metrics;  
  Ø  moved from a one year to a three year performance period for 2019 long-term incentive awards based on cash available for distribution; and  
  Ø  established a performance metric for the 2019 Incentive Program based on Adjusted EBITDA while the metrics for long-term incentive awards are based on total shareholder return and                        cash available for distribution over a three year performance period.

The Compensation Committee remains committed to the ongoing evaluation of our executive compensation program, market best practices and adjustments as necessary to           reflect industry conditions, our performance and feedback received from stockholders.
OUR BEST PRACTICES
The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation program provides balanced incentives and does not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a           material adverse effect on us. The Compensation Committee has incorporated a number of stockholder-aligned compensation governance practices into our executive compensation program, including:

Components of our Named Executive Officers' 2018 Compensation
The following shows the breakdown of 2018 compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and our Named Executive Officers as a group (excluding Messrs. Aron and           Clawges, who became executive officers later in 2018, and Mr. Guba, who was not an employee). The chart illustrates that the long-term equity incentive awards and performance-based components of our executive compensation program are the           predominant components of our executive officers' total compensation, and we are committed to continuing a compensation program that is more heavily weighted to performance-based compensation.

Financial  Performance In 2018, Adjusted EBITDA (described in our discussion of our STI and LTI Program performance factors) increased by 26% over 2017, our                    dividend increased by 10% and operating horsepower grew by 8.5%.  Further, we were selective in deploying growth capital, focusing on the highest returns during this growth cycle.  We remained highly focused on maintaining first-in-class                    field services, not only in the Permian Basin, which was marked with exceptional growth, but in every operating region in the U.S, and we strategically partnered with customers who were well-equipped to operate effectively in challenging                    conditions.

Strategic  Initiatives In April 2018, we completed the Partnership Merger that was immediately accretive to our stockholders.  This transaction simplified our capital structure, improved                    our dividend coverage and positioned us to focus on future growth opportunities.   
Operational  Performance We simplified our management structure and consolidated from 8 to 6 geographic business units, and we restructured our after-market                    services business to improve efficiencies.  In addition, we planned in 2018 and launched in early 2019 an initiative that will ultimately streamline and modernize virtually every aspect of our business, from accounting processes to human                    resource systems and from inventory management to field service operations.

Company  Culture We rolled out a new branding campaign in 2018, which communicates to our employees and customers our vision, mission and values.  We                    continued to focus on our number one asset: Our People. We enhanced our medical benefits with a fully paid premium for employee-only coverage.  For the 8th                    year in a row, we surveyed employee satisfaction using the Gallup® survey.  We partnered with colleges and trade schools and we are committed to providing                    training and mentorship unequaled in our industry.

DISCUSSION OF OUR FISCAL 2018 EXECUTIVE             COMPENSATION PROGRAM
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Pay  Competitively To attract, retain and motivate an effective management team with the level of expertise and experience needed to achieve consistent                    growth, profitability and return for our stockholders, our Compensation Committee believes that Named Executive Officers' total compensation should be competitive with that of comparably-sized companies within the oilfield services sector                    and, where applicable, across a variety of industries, as further described below in "How Our Compensation Committee Determines Executive Compensation."

Pay for  Performance Emphasis on performance-based, variable compensation is a critical component of our overall compensation philosophy. As shown in the                    graphs in our executive summary, 84% of our Chief Executive Officer's 2018 target total direct compensation and approximately 67% of our other Named Executive Officers' 2018 target total direct compensation was variable, with realized                    value primarily dependent upon annual financial performance or long-term stock price performance.  
Stockholder  Alignment Our Compensation Committee believes that alignment between our Named Executive Officers' compensation and our stockholders' expectations                    is essential to our long-term success. The Compensation Committee believes that a competitive base salary ensures that the Company can attract and retain the level of managerial talent necessary to achieve consistent growth and                    profitability and is, therefore, aligned with our stockholders' interest.  Emphasis on equity-based compensation and share ownership encourages executives to act strategically to drive sustainable long-term performance and enhance                    long-term stockholder value.

HOW OUR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and overseeing compensation programs that are consistent with our compensation philosophy. In carrying out           this role, the Compensation Committee considers such factors as they deem relevant, including the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 External Factors     Internal Factors  
 Data and analysis provided by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant     Current and past total compensation, including an annual review of base salary, short-term incentive pay and the value of LTI Awards                    received  
 Feedback provided from our stockholders and the results of our advisory say-on-pay vote     Company performance and operating unit performance (where applicable), as well as each executive's impact on performance  
     Our Chief Executive Officer's recommendations (other than with respect to his own compensation)  
     Each executive's relative scope of responsibility and potential  
     Individual goal setting, performance and demonstrated leadership  
     Internal pay equity considerations  
[END TABLE]
Role and Independence of Compensation Consultant. For 2018, the           Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer, an independent third-party compensation consultant, to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  provide data and analysis to inform the Compensation Committee in selecting an appropriate peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  provide a review of market trends in executive compensation, including base salary, annual incentives, LTI Awards and total direct compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  provide information on how trends in best practices, new rules, regulations and laws impact executive and director compensation practice and administration.  
[END TABLE]
For 2018, Pearl Meyer provided analysis of data derived from (i) proxy statements filed by the companies in our peer group, as further described below, and (ii)           surveys of the compensation practices of companies in the oilfield services industry, the broader energy industry and across a variety of industries, in each case with annual revenues comparable to Archrock.  In performing its compensation           analysis, Pearl Meyer generally placed more weight on the proxy compensation data for Named Executive Officers at our peer companies than on the information derived from the broader compensation surveys, where sufficient data was available.
Following review and consultation with Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee has determined that Pearl Meyer is independent and that no conflict of interest,           either currently or during 2018, results from this engagement. The Compensation Committee continues to monitor the independence of its compensation consultant on a periodic basis.
2018 Peer Group.  Our 2018 peer group did not change from the peer group selected in 2017, and it included a diverse group of oilfield services and related companies with primarily domestic operations and reported 2017 revenues           ranging from roughly $270 million to $6 billion.  Archrock ranked between the 40th and 60th           percentile for revenue, market capitalization and assets relative to this group.  The Compensation Committee believes this peer group includes companies with which we may compete for technical and managerial talent and provides an appropriate           reference point for assessing the competitiveness of our executive compensation program.  In addition, the Compensation Committee believes that the number of companies included in the peer group provides a blend of data that is useful both for           determining the general positioning of our executive compensation and for assessing our performance based on relative total stockholder return over a multi-year period.  The Compensation Committee annually reviews the composition of the peer           group, based on input from its compensation consultant, and will modify it as circumstances, including industry consolidation and other competitive forces, warrant.

[END TABLE]
Pearl Meyer also provided input to the Compensation Committee in their review and determination of the appropriate types and mix of long-term incentive awards and           the performance factors for performance-based compensation awarded in 2018.
Role of Management.  The most significant aspects of management's,           including our Chief Executive Officer's, role in the compensation-setting process are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  recommending compensation programs, compensation policies, compensation levels and incentive opportunities that are based on analysis provided by our independent compensation                        consultant and are consistent with our business strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  preparing and distributing materials for Compensation Committee review and consideration;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  recommending corporate performance goals on which performance-based compensation will be based; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Ø  assisting in the evaluation of employee performance.  
[END TABLE]
Our Chief Executive Officer annually reviews the individual performance of our Named Executive Officers and recommends salary adjustments, annual cash incentives and           LTI Awards for executives other than himself, which the Compensation Committee considers along with the other factors discussed above.
RISK ASSESSMENT RELATED TO OUR COMPENSATION STRUCTURE
We believe our compensation practices reflect sound risk management practices and are not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on us. For           example, our Compensation Committee and management set performance goals in light of past performance, future expectations and market conditions that they believe do not encourage the taking of unreasonable risks. Our Compensation Committee           believes its practice of considering non-financial and other qualitative factors in determining compensation awards discourages excessive risk taking and encourages good judgment. In addition, we believe executive compensation is allocated           between cash and equity-based awards, between fixed and variable awards, and between short-term and long-term focused compensation in a manner that encourages decision-making that balances short-term goals with long-term goals and thereby reduces           the likelihood of excessive risk taking. Finally, our Compensation Committee has established (a) short-term incentives that balance various Company objectives and provide for maximum payouts, and (b) LTI Awards with, minimally, three-year vesting           periods, and we believe these program features further balance short- and long-term objectives and encourage employee behavior designed to achieve sustained profitability and growth.
BASE SALARY
Based on the competitive positioning of our Named Executive Officers' base salaries as compared to the data provided by our independent compensation consultant,           market conditions, individual performance and increased responsibilities in 2018 of Ms. Hildebrandt and Messrs. Ingersoll and Clawges, the Compensation Committee approved the base salary for our executive officers as indicated below.

ANNUAL PERFORMANCE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
During the first quarter of each year, the Compensation Committee adopts a program to provide the short-term cash incentive element of our Named Executive Officers'           compensation for that year. In February 2018, the Compensation Committee adopted the short-term incentive program for 2018 (the "2018 Incentive Program"). Each Named Executive Officer's cash incentive target was a specified percentage of his or           her base salary based on actual earnings. The table below presents each Named Executive Officer's 2018 cash incentive target as a specified percentage of his or her base salary, as well as a potential payout assuming the achievement of results at           100%.

Each Named Executive Officer's potential cash payout under the 2018 Incentive Program ranged from 0% to 200% of his or her incentive target.  No payouts would be made             unless Company results, as shown below, exceeded 50% of target performance.  Under the 2018 Incentive Program, the Compensation Committee determined payouts to the Named Executive Officers using the following formula:
Company Results.  As shown in the table below, Company results were achieved at a performance payout factor of 127%.

[END TABLE]
 1 In the discretion of           the Compensation Committee, the performance achievement was reduced by approximately $12 million due to the exclusion of certain non-recurring benefits and expenses.
2           Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) excluding loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, long-lived asset impairment, restatement and other           charges, restructuring and other charges, corporate relocation costs, debt extinguishment loss, merger-related costs, indemnification (income) expense, net, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other items.

We have not disclosed our specific performance targets with respect to the achievement of these operating unit performance factors because they are derived from internal           analyses reflecting our business strategy and will not otherwise be publicly disclosed. We believe their disclosure would provide our competitors, customers and other third parties with significant insights regarding our confidential business           strategies that could cause us substantial competitive harm.
Individual Performance.  In early 2018, the Compensation Committee approved individual performance objectives for Mr. Childers related to the Company's financial and operational performance, strategic initiatives, leadership             goals and initiatives focused on the Company's culture.
Upon conclusion of fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee met with Mr. Childers to discuss his performance relative to the approved individual objectives.              Thereafter, the Compensation Committee met in executive session and reported their assessment to the full Board.  The Board delivered its evaluation to Mr. Childers, the results of which are summarized under "2018 Performance Highlights" on             page 27 of this Proxy Statement
With input from Mr. Childers, the Compensation Committee also considered each Named Executive Officer's individual contribution toward Company and/or operating             unit performance during 2018 including, as individually applicable, increased responsibilities in 2018, implementation of operational improvements, contribution toward Company performance goals and initiatives and demonstrated leadership. In             addition, the Compensation Committee considered the significant efforts of each of Ms. Hildebrandt and Messrs. Aron, Ingersoll and Clawges to continue to achieve a high level of operating performance during a period of significant growth in the             midstream and infrastructure market that challenged the Company's capital allocation strategy for the achievement of maximum returns, and created pressure on selling, general and administrative expenses.
Following such assessments, the Compensation Committee determined that each of Ms. Hildebrandt and Messrs. Childers, Aron, Ingersoll and Clawges met or exceeded             expectations and, accordingly, achieved at least 100% of their respective individual performance levels for 2018.  The Compensation Committee did not assess the performance of Mr. Guba, who terminated his assignment with us in August 2018 and             was not eligible to participate in our 2018 Incentive Program, or of Mr. Rice, who resigned prior to year-end.
2018 Incentive Program Payments.  Following the end of fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee calculated the individual cash payments under the 2018 Incentive Program by multiplying the Named Executive Officers' target             cash incentives by the achievement percentages for the applicable Company, operating unit and individual performance factors described above.

Long-Term Incentive Plans.  Grants of restricted stock and             performance awards during calendar year 2018 were made under the Archrock, Inc. 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the "2013 Stock Incentive Plan"), which was approved by our stockholders in April 2013. The 2013 Stock Incentive Plan is             administered by the Compensation Committee.
In anticipation of the Partnership Merger, no Partnership phantom unit awards were granted from the Archrock Partners, L.P. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the             "Partnership Plan") during 2018.  Pursuant to the Partnership Merger, all phantom units previously awarded under the Partnership Plan and outstanding at the time of the merger were converted at the rate of 1:1.4 (according to the terms of the             Partnership Merger) into restricted stock units (the "Converted RSUs"), to be settled in shares of our common stock.  The Converted RSUs were not materially modified and are subject to the same terms and conditions as the original award.
Timing of Awards.  The Compensation Committee generally             establishes its schedule for making annual LTI Awards several months in advance, and does not make such awards based on knowledge of material nonpublic information. This practice results in awards typically being granted on a regular,             predictable cycle. Equity-based awards are occasionally granted at other times during the year, such as upon the hiring of a new employee or following the promotion of an employee. LTI Awards are granted and valued based on the market closing             price of our common stock on the date of approval by the Compensation Committee.

Named Executive Officers' 2018 LTI Awards.  In determining the             grant of 2018 LTI Awards, the Compensation Committee considered the factors discussed above under "How Our Compensation Committee Determines Executive Compensation," and also reviewed share utilization with respect to the 2013 Stock Incentive             Plan, potential overhang and burn rate under various award scenarios. The Compensation Committee also considered the retention aspect of awards as well as performance metrics that balance short-term and long-term objectives.  The following             chart provides the total value of each Named Executive Officer's 2018 LTI Award and the number of shares and units awarded (in the case of performance-based units, listed at target payout).  Because they were appointed executive officers later             in 2018, Messrs. Aron and Clawges' 2018 LTI Awards did not include performance-based awards.

2018 Performance-based Long-Term Incentive Awards.
CAD Performance Units.  CAD Performance Units may be earned based upon our cash             available for distribution during 2018 (the "CAD Performance Units"), with payout ranging from 0% to 200% of the total units granted.  The percentage of each award of CAD Performance Units that was earned at the conclusion of fiscal year 2018             was based on the achievement of the performance factor as indicated in the chart below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Factor  Target  Achievement (100%)Performance  Achieved  Payout  Factor  
 Performance Factor  Target  Achievement (100%)Performance  Achieved  Payout  Factor

2018 Cash Available for Dividend 1 Adjusted EBITDA,2 minus maintenance and other capital expenditures, minus cash tax (payment)/refund, minus cash interest expense $ 171 million   $ 189.8 million       154%  
[END TABLE]
2 Adjusted EBITDA, a             non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income (loss) excluding loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, long-lived asset impairment, restatement and other charges, restructuring             and other charges, corporate relocation costs, debt extinguishment loss, merger-related costs, indemnification (income) expense, net, non-cash stock-based compensation expense and other items.
Following the conclusion of fiscal year 2018, earned CAD Performance Units are subject to a time-based vesting schedule pursuant to which one-third of the earned             CAD Performance Units subject to the award will vest on each of August 20, 2019, August 20, 2020 and August 20, 2021, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date.  In addition, the award is subject to accelerated vesting             as described below under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control".   Earned CAD Performance Units are payable in cash based on the market closing price of our common stock on the applicable vest date.

TSR Performance Units.  TSR Performance Units may be earned based upon our             three-year total stockholder return (the "TSR Performance Units"), with payout ranging between 0% and 200% of the units granted.  The percentage of each award of TSR Performance Units that will be earned will be determined following the             three-year performance period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020, based on the Company's TSR performance rank relative to the companies in our 2018 peer group (the "Comparator Group").

Total Stockholder Return The Average Fair Market Value1 at the end of the period plus dividends paid over the performance period divided by the Average Fair Market Value at the beginning of the performance period  TSR rank = 16th  TSR rank = 9th 2  TSR rank = 1st
[END TABLE]
1 Average Fair Market             Value as of any given date is the average fair market value of a share of Archrock common stock during the 20 consecutive trading dates ending on and including such date.
2 Payout at target             assumes no changes in the Comparator Group.  In the event a company in the Comparator Group becomes insolvent or liquidates, that company shall remain in the Comparator Group, but will be moved to the lowest rank in the Comparator Group.  In             the event a company is acquired or merged into another company and is not the surviving company, or as a result of any other corporate transaction, such company shall be removed from the Comparator Group and the percentile payouts shall be             ratably adjusted.
As discussed above, based on our ordinal rank in the Comparator Group at the conclusion of the three-year performance period, a number of TSR Performance Units             ranging from 0% to 200% of the total number of TSR Performance Units granted will become earned.   If the Company's TSR rank falls between the levels specified in the chart, the percentage of TSR Performance Units that will be earned will be             determined using straight-line interpolation between such levels. No payout will be earned if the Company's TSR rank is below the threshold level. The earned TSR Performance Units are also subject to three-year cliff vesting on August 20, 2021,             subject to continued employment through the vesting date.  In addition, the award is subject to accelerated vesting as described below under "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control". Each earned TSR Performance Unit is payable             as a share of common stock upon vesting.
Inducement Restricted Stock Award.    In connection with the commencement of his employment with us on August 13, 2018, Mr. Aron was granted a one-time restricted stock award with a grant-date value of $500,000. The terms and             conditions of this restricted stock award are described in more detail below under "Agreements with Executive Officers – Executive Employment Letters" and as set forth in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.
RETIREMENT SAVINGS, HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS
Our Named Executive Officers participate in our company-sponsored benefit programs on generally the same basis as other salaried employees. These benefits are             designed to provide retirement income and protection against the financial hardship that can result from illness, disability or death.
Retirement Savings Plan.  The Archrock 401(k) Plan allows certain             employees who are U.S. citizens, including our Named Executive Officers, to defer a portion of their eligible salary, up to the Code maximum deferral amount, on a pre-tax basis or on a post-tax (Roth) basis. Participants make contributions to             an account maintained by an independent trustee and direct how those contributions are invested. We match 100% of a participant's contribution up to a maximum of 5% of his or her annual eligible compensation. Participants vest in our matching             contributions after two years of employment.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan.  The Archrock, Inc. Employee Stock             Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") provides our eligible employees, including our Named Executive Officers, the opportunity to purchase our common stock through payroll deductions and is designed to comply with Section 423 of the Code. Our Compensation             Committee, which administers the ESPP, has the discretion to set the purchase price at 85% to 100% of the fair market value of a share of our common stock on one of the following dates: (i) the offering date, (ii) the purchase date or (iii) the             offering date or the purchase date, whichever is lower. For 2018, employees who elected to participate in the ESPP could purchase a share of our common stock at the lesser of (i) 95% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the             offering date or (ii) 95% of the fair market value of a share of common stock on the purchase date. Offering periods consist of three-month periods, or such other periods as may be determined from time to time by our Compensation Committee. A             total of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock has been authorized and reserved for issuance under the ESPP. At December 31, 2018, approximately 871,203 shares remained available for purchase under the ESPP.

Deferred Compensation Plan.  The Archrock Deferred Compensation             Plan (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") allows certain key employees who are U.S. citizens, including our Named Executive Officers, to defer receipt of their compensation, including up to 100% of their salaries and bonuses, and be credited with             Company contributions designed to serve as a make-up for the portion of the employer-matching contribution that cannot be made under the Archrock 401(k) Plan due to Code limits. Participants generally must make elections relating to             compensation deferrals and plan distributions in the year preceding that in which the compensation is earned. Contributions to the Deferred Compensation Plan are self-directed investments in the various funds available under the plan. There are             thus no interest calculations or earnings measures other than the performance of the investment funds selected by the participant. Participants direct how their contributions are invested and may change these investment elections at any time.
Health and Welfare Benefit Plans.  We maintain a standard             complement of health and welfare benefit plans for our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, which provide medical, dental and vision benefits, employee assistance, health savings and flexible spending accounts, short-term and             long-term disability insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance and life insurance coverage. These benefits are provided to our Named Executive Officers on the same terms and conditions as they are provided to our other employees.
Perquisites.  As in prior years, the only perquisite provided to             our Named Executive Officers was tax preparation and planning services, which is a taxable benefit.  This perquisite was provided due to the complexity of tax reporting associated with Partnership equity held by our executive officers, and with             the Partnership Merger, it has been eliminated effective as of year-end 2019.  Thereafter, the Company will provide no perquisites to its executive officers.
AGREEMENTS WITH EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
Executive Employment Letters.  Each of our Named Executive Officers (excluding Mr. Guba) entered into employment letters with us which set forth the applicable executive's title, reporting relationship and initial             compensation (the "Employment Letters").  Under the Employment Letters, each such Named Executive Officer is eligible for an annual base salary, annual short-term incentive target and annual equity award value, which are subject to annual             review by our Compensation Committee. In addition, each Employment Letter provides that the applicable executive is eligible to participate in all employee benefit plans maintained by the Company for the benefit of its executives generally.             Pursuant to his Employment Letter, Mr. Aron received a one-time grant of restricted stock with a grant date value of $500,000 as an inducement to commencement of employment with us, which is subject to three-year ratable vesting and continued             employment through the applicable vesting date.
Severance Benefit Agreements and Change of Control Arrangements.  We                       have entered into severance benefit agreements and change of control agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers (except for Messrs. Clawges and Guba).  Our Compensation Committee believes that severance and change of control             agreements are necessary to attract and retain executive talent and are, therefore, a customary part of executive compensation. Our change of control agreements are structured as "double trigger" agreements. In other words, the change of             control alone does not trigger benefits; rather, benefits are paid only if the executive incurs a qualifying termination of employment within six months before or 18 months following a change of control. See "Potential Payments upon Termination             or Change of Control," below, for a description of the terms of the change of control agreements and the severance benefit agreements with our Named Executive Officers during 2018, as well as estimates of the potential payouts under those             agreements.

In             connection with the Partnership Merger, during 2018, we entered into Letter Agreements to amend all outstanding Award Notices and Agreements and change of control agreements, as applicable to our Named Executive officers, to provide that the             consummation of the Partnership Merger would not constitute a change of control of Archrock or the Partnership.
Service Agreement - Raymond K. Guba.  We entered into an interim services agreement (the "Service Agreement") with Tatum pursuant to which Mr. Guba provided services as our Interim Chief Financial Officer from December 12, 2017             through August 3, 2018.  As such, Mr. Guba did not receive a salary, was not eligible for bonuses or equity and did not have an employment agreement, severance agreement or change of control agreement with Archrock. Under the terms of the             Service Agreement, the Company paid Tatum an hourly rate of $345 for Mr. Guba's services. In addition, the Service Agreement provided for the reimbursement of Mr. Guba's reasonable and customary business expenses. The amount of professional             fees paid to Tatum corresponding to Mr. Guba's service as Interim Chief Financial Officer in fiscal 2018 was $555,379, the amount of expenses covered or reimbursed during this time period was $5,387 and we were refunded a security deposit of             $41,400. We had no prior nor have we had a subsequent relationship with Tatum.
EQUITY PLANS
All outstanding awards granted to employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are structured as "double trigger" arrangements, that is, the grantee is only             entitled to accelerated vesting in connection with a change of control if the grantee incurs a qualifying termination of employment on or within 18 months following the change of control.  See "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of             Control," below, for more information about equity vesting under various circumstances.
OTHER POLICIES AND CONSIDERATIONS
Stock Ownership Requirements.  The Compensation Committee believes             that stock ownership requirements closely align our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders by ensuring our executive officers have a meaningful ownership stake in our Company.  Our Chief Executive Officer is required to             hold an aggregate amount of our common stock with a market value of at least five times his annual base salary (two times annual base salary in the case of our other Named Executive Officers).  Our Compensation Committee reviews the stock             ownership of our Named Executive Officers annually as of June 30.  As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all Named Executive Officers subject to the stock ownership guidelines were in compliance with the guidelines.
Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging.  Company policy prohibits key             employees and directors from entering into any transaction designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of our equity securities, including purchasing financial instruments (such as variable forward contracts, equity swaps,             collars or exchange funds), or otherwise trading in market options (such as puts or calls), warrants, or other derivative instruments of our equity securities.  In addition, our Named Executive Officers and directors may not pledge, hypothecate             or otherwise encumber shares of the Company's common stock as collateral for indebtedness.
Tax and Accounting Considerations.
Section 162(m) of the Code.  Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows the             deductibility of certain compensation expenses in excess of $1,000,000 to certain executive officers within a fiscal year. Compensation that is "performance-based" with respect to taxable years beginning on or before December 31, 2017 and             payable pursuant to a binding written agreement in effect on November 2, 2017 is excluded from this limitation. For compensation to be "performance-based," it must meet certain criteria, including performance goals approved by our stockholders             and, in certain cases, objective targets based on performance goals approved by our stockholders. We believe that maintaining the discretion to evaluate the performance of our executive officers through the use of performance-based compensation             is an important part of our responsibilities and benefits our stockholders, even if it may be non-deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code. The Compensation Committee, in coordination with management, has historically assessed the potential             application of Section 162(m) of the Code on incentive compensation awards and other compensation decisions and expects to continue to do so for performance-based compensation with respect to taxable years beginning on or prior to December 31,             2017.  In light of the repeal of the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m) of the Code for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Compensation Committee expects in the future to approve compensation that is             non-deductible for income tax purposes.

Section 280G of the Code.  Section 280G of the Code disallows a tax deduction for             excess parachute payments to certain executives of companies that undergo a change of control. In addition, Section 4999 of the Code imposes a 20% excise tax on the individual with respect to the excess parachute payment. Parachute payments are             compensation linked to or triggered by a change of control and may include, but are not limited to, bonus payments, severance payments, certain fringe benefits, and payments and acceleration of vesting from LTI plans including stock options and             other equity-based compensation. Excess parachute payments are parachute payments that exceed a threshold determined under Section 280G of the Code based on the executive's average prior compensation. Since 2009, we have had a policy of             prohibiting tax gross-ups on income attributable to change of control agreements and other executive benefit agreements, which is discussed further in "Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control," below.
Section 409A of the Code.  Section 409A of the Code requires that "nonqualified             deferred compensation" be deferred and paid under plans or arrangements that satisfy the requirements of the statute with respect to the timing of deferral elections, timing of payments and certain other matters. Failure to satisfy these             requirements can expose employees and directors to accelerated income tax liabilities, substantial additional taxes and interest on their vested compensation under such plans. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is our intention to design and             administer our compensation and benefit plans and arrangements for all of our employees and directors, including our Named Executive Officers, so that they are either exempt from, or satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A of the Code.
Accounting for Stock-Based and Unit-Based Compensation.  We have followed Financial             Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification 718, "Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718") in accounting for stock-based and unit-based compensation awards. ASC 718 requires companies to calculate the grant date "fair value" of their             stock-based and unit-based awards using a variety of assumptions. ASC 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based and unit-based awards in their income statements over the period that an employee is             required to render service in exchange for the award. We expect that we will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award             plans and programs. As accounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT

Under our Deferred Compensation Plan, eligible employees are permitted to defer receipt of up to 100% of their base salary and annual bonus. We also make certain             employer matching contributions designed to serve as a make-up for the portion of the employer matching contributions that cannot be made under our 401(k) Plan due to Code limits. The amounts deferred under each participant's Deferred             Compensation Plan account are deemed to be invested in investment alternatives chosen by the participant from a range of choices established by the plan administrator. The balances of participant accounts are adjusted to reflect the gains or             losses that would have been obtained if the participant contributions had actually been invested in the applicable investment alternatives.
Participants may elect to defer the distribution of their account balances until the occurrence of a specified future date or event, including: (i) a future date             while the participant is employed by us, as specified by the participant, (ii) the participant's separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code), including due to death, or (iii) the participant's disability.             Participants may also elect whether to receive distributions of their account balances in a single lump-sum amount or in annual installments to be paid over a period of two to ten years.
Payment of a participant's account will be made or commence, as applicable, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· for lump sum payments, on the earlier of: (x) in the case of a specified in-service date, January 1 of such year and (y) in the case of a separation from service or disability, the                          date of the participant's separation of service or, if earlier, disability and

The Deferred Compensation Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee. The Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded plan for tax purposes and for purposes             of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. We have also established a "rabbi trust" to satisfy our obligations under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL
Severance Benefit Agreements
We have entered into a severance benefit agreement with each of our Named Executive Officers (other than Messrs. Clawges and Guba). Each such agreement provides             that if the executive's employment is terminated by us without cause or by the executive for good reason at any time through the term of the agreement (one year, to be automatically renewed for successive one-year periods until notice of             non-renewal is given by either party), he or she will receive a lump sum payment in cash on the 35th day after the termination date equal to the sum of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· his or her annual base salary then in effect plus the target annual incentive bonus opportunity; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a pro-rated portion of his or her target annual incentive bonus opportunity for the termination year based on the length of time during which he or she was employed during such                          year; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any earned but unpaid annual incentive award for the fiscal year ending prior to the termination date; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a payment equal to twelve months of the portion of the monthly premiums that would be payable by us under our group health plan had the executive's employment not terminated, based                          on the executive's elections as in effect on the termination date, together with the monthly administrative fee that would be assessed under COBRA.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the executive would be entitled to the accelerated vesting as of the termination date of that portion of his or her outstanding unvested Archrock             equity, equity-based or cash awards that was scheduled to vest on the next vesting date immediately following the termination date.
[BEGIN TABLE]
· In the case of outstanding performance shares or units which are based in common stock of Archrock and subject to ratable three year vesting based on a one-year performance period                          (including the CAD Performance Units), such shares or units shall vest based on the actual number of units earned, the determination of which will be made by the Committee upon conclusion of the performance period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· In the case of outstanding performance shares or units which are based in common stock of Archrock and subject to time-based cliff vesting at the end of a three-year performance                          period (including the TSR Performance Units), such shares or units shall vest as follows:  if the termination date occurs in the first year of the performance period, one-third of the performance units payable at target;  if the                          termination date occurs in the second year of the performance period, two-thirds of the performance units payable at target; or if the termination date occurs in the third year of the performance period, depending on whether                          performance has been determined, (i) 100% of the performance units payable at target or (ii) a percentage of the performance units payable at target based on actual performance.  
[END TABLE]
Each executive's entitlement to the payments and benefits under his or her severance benefit agreement is subject to his or her execution (and non-revocation) of a             waiver and release for our benefit. In addition, each executive is subject to non-disparagement restrictions following termination.
Change of Control Agreements
We have entered into a change of control agreement with each of our Named Executive Officers (other than Messrs. Clawges and Guba). Each such agreement provides             that if the executive's employment is terminated by us other than for cause, death or disability, or by the executive for good reason (in each case, a "Qualifying Termination"), within six months before or 18 months following a change of             control (as defined in the change of control agreements), he or she would receive a cash payment within 60 days after the termination date equal to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· two times (three times in the case of Mr. Childers) his or her current annual base salary plus two times (three times in the case of Mr. Childers) his or her target annual                          incentive bonus opportunity for that year; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a pro-rated portion of the target annual incentive bonus opportunity for the termination year based on the length of time during which the executive was employed during such year;                          plus  
[END TABLE]
Archrock, Inc. | 46
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any earned but unpaid annual incentive award for the fiscal year ending prior to the termination date; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· two times the total of the Company contributions that would have been credited to him or her under the Archrock 401(k) Plan and any other deferred compensation plan had he or she                          made the required amount of elective deferrals or contributions during the twelve months immediately preceding the termination month; plus  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a lump-sum cash payment equal to twenty-four months of the portion of the monthly premiums that would be payable by us under our group health plan had the executive's employment                          not terminated, based on the executive's elections as in effect on the termination date, together with the monthly administrative fee that would be assessed under COBRA.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the executive would be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· any amount previously deferred, or earned but not paid, by him or her under the incentive and nonqualified deferred compensation plans or programs as of the termination date; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· the accelerated vesting of all his or her unvested LTI Awards.  
[END TABLE]
Our change of control agreements do not provide for tax gross-ups.  Instead, the agreements include a Section 280G "best pay" provision pursuant to which in the             event any payments or benefits received by the executive would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code, the executive will receive either the full amount of his or her payments or a reduced amount such that no portion of the             payments is subject to the excise tax (whichever results in the greater after-tax benefit to the executive).
Each executive's entitlement to the payments and benefits under his or her change of control agreement is also subject to his or her execution (and non-revocation)             of a waiver and release for our benefit. In addition, in the event an executive receives payments from the Company under his or her change of control agreement, such executive will be subject to confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation             and non-competition restrictions for two years following a termination of his or her employment.
Vesting of Equity-Based Incentives
Upon a Change of Control.  The award agreements for all outstanding equity awards provide that no portion of the award shall be subject to accelerated vesting solely upon a change of control. Instead, such awards will be             subject to accelerated vesting only if a termination of the applicable executive's employment by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason occurs on or within eighteen months following a change of control.  Performance units             will accelerate in full based on (i) the achievement of the applicable performance measures as determined by the Compensation Committee in good faith as of the date of termination or (ii) if the Compensation Committee cannot reasonably             determine the achievement percentage, then achievement at the target performance level.
Upon a Termination Due to Death or Disability.  The award             agreements for all outstanding equity awards provide that, upon a termination due to death or disability, the award will accelerate in full.  Performance units will accelerate in full based on (i) the achievement of the applicable performance             goals if such goals have been determined by the Compensation Committee in good faith as of the date of termination or (ii) achievement at the target performance level if the applicable performance goals have not been determined by the             Compensation Committee as of the date of termination.
Potential Payments.  The following tables show the potential             payments to the Named Executive Officers upon a theoretical termination of employment or change of control (as applicable) occurring on December 31, 2018. The amounts shown assume an Archrock common stock value of $7.49 per share, the December             31, 2018 market closing price. The actual amount paid out to an executive upon an actual termination or change of control can only be determined at the time of such event.  Mr. Guba, who was not an employee of the Company and Mr. Rice, who             resigned in September 2018, are not included in the tables below.

CEO PAY RATIO
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following             information regarding the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Childers, our Chief Executive Officer.  We consider the pay ratio specified below to be a reasonable estimate,             calculated in a manner that is intended to be consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
Mr. Childers had an annual total compensation of $5,949,212 in 2018 as reflected in the "Total" column of our Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy             Statement. With respect to the annual total compensation of the median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K,             resulting in annual total compensation for 2018 of $72,135.  As a result, we estimate that Mr. Childers' 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 82 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees             (other than the CEO).
In determining the median employee, Archrock prepared a listing of all employees (including full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees) as of December             31, 2017 and the total compensation of each such employee for fiscal year 2017.  The median employee was selected from this list and did not change for 2018.  The Compensation Committee believes this is reasonable on the basis there has been no             significant change in its employee population, employee compensation arrangements, or the compensation of the median employee.
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described             above. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and             to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and             compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
