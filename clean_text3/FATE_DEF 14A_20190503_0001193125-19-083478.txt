[END TABLE]
The Annual Meeting will be held at the offices of the Company, 3535 General Atomics Court, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121. On or about March 22, 2019, we intend to mail to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") containing instructions on how to access this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Annual Report"). 
Solicitation 
This solicitation is made on behalf of the Board of Directors. We will bear the costs of preparing, mailing, online processing and other costs of the proxy solicitation made by our Board of Directors. Certain of our officers and employees may solicit the submission of proxies authorizing the voting of shares in accordance with the Board of Directors' recommendations. Such solicitations may be made by telephone, facsimile transmission or personal solicitation. No additional compensation will be paid to such officers, directors or regular employees for such services. We will reimburse banks, brokerage firms and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in sending proxy materials to stockholders. 
Important Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials 
In accordance with rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), instead of mailing a printed copy of our proxy materials to each stockholder of record, the Company may furnish proxy materials via the internet. Accordingly, all of the Company's stockholders will receive a Notice, to be mailed on or about March 22, 2019.  On the date of mailing the Notice, stockholders will be able to access all of the proxy materials on the website at www.astproxyportal.com/ast/18615. The proxy materials will be available free of charge. The Notice will instruct you as to how you may access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials (including the Annual Report) over the internet or through other methods specified on the website. The website contains instructions as to how to vote by internet or over the telephone. The Notice also instructs you as to how you may request a paper or email copy of the proxy card. If you received a Notice and would like to receive printed copies of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials included in the Notice. 
Voting Rights and Outstanding Shares 
Only holders of record of our common stock as of the close of business on March 6, 2019 are entitled to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting. Each holder of common stock will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 6, 2019, there were 65,032,012 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. 
A quorum of stockholders is necessary to take action at the Annual Meeting. Stockholders representing a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock (present in person or represented by proxy) will constitute a quorum. We will appoint an inspector of elections for the meeting to determine whether or not a quorum is present and to tabulate votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions, withheld votes and broker non-votes (which occur when a broker, bank or other nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular matter because such broker, bank or other nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner) are counted as present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. 
Votes Required for Each Proposal 
To elect our directors and approve the other proposals being considered at the Annual Meeting, the voting requirements are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal   Vote Required   Discretionary Voting Permitted? 
 Election of Directors   Plurality   No 
 Ratification of Ernst & Young LLP   Majority   Yes 
 Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of  Our Named Executive Officers   Majority   No 
 Non-Binding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Non-Binding Votes to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers   Highest Number of Affirmative Votes   No 
[END TABLE]
"Discretionary Voting Permitted" means that brokers will have discretionary voting authority with respect to shares held in street name for their clients, even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from their client. 
"Majority" means a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such matter. 
"Plurality" means a plurality of the votes properly cast on such matter. For the election of directors, the two nominees receiving the plurality of votes entitled to vote and cast will be elected as directors.  The vote required and method of calculation for the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting are as follows: 
Proposal One—Election of Directors. If a quorum is present, the director nominees receiving the highest number of votes, in person or by proxy, will be elected as directors. You may vote "FOR" all nominees, "WITHHOLD" for all nominees, or "WITHHOLD" for any nominee by specifying the name of the nominee on your proxy card. Withheld votes and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election of the directors. 
Proposal Two—Approval of the Ratification of Ernst &Young LLP as Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such matter. You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on this proposal. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your shares will not be counted as "votes cast" with respect to such matter, and the abstention will have no effect on the proposal. This proposal is considered to be a discretionary item, and your broker will be able to vote on this proposal even if it does not receive instructions from you. Accordingly, we do not anticipate that there will be any broker non-votes on this proposal; however, any broker non-votes will not be counted as "votes cast" and will therefore have no effect on the proposal. 
Proposal Three— Non-Binding Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers. Approval of this advisory non-binding proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes properly cast for and against such matter. You may vote "FOR," "AGAINST" or "ABSTAIN" from voting on this proposal. If you abstain from voting on this matter, your shares will not be counted as "votes cast" with respect to such matter, and the abstention will have no effect on the proposal. This proposal is not considered to be a discretionary item, so if you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this proposal, your broker may not vote on this proposal, and those votes will be counted as broker "non-votes." Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
Proposal Four— Non-Binding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Non-Binding Votes to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers. The frequency of "one year," "two years" or "three years" that receives the highest number of affirmative votes properly cast on this proposal will be deemed the preferred frequency with which we hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. You may vote "ONE YEAR," "TWO YEARS," "THREE YEARS," or "ABSTAIN" from voting on this proposal. If you abstain from voting on this proposal, your shares will not be counted as "votes cast" with respect to this proposal, and the abstention will have no effect on this proposal. This proposal is not considered to be a discretionary item, so if you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to this proposal, your broker may not vote on this proposal, and those votes will be counted as broker "non-votes." Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
We request that you vote your shares by proxy following the methods as instructed by the Notice: over the Internet, by telephone or by mail. If you choose to vote by mail, your shares will be voted in accordance with your voting instructions if the proxy card is received prior to or at the Annual Meeting. If you sign and return your proxy card but do not give voting instructions, your shares will be voted FOR (i) the election of each of the Company's two (2) nominees as Class III directors; (ii) the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; (iii) the approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers; (iv) the frequency of "one year" as the preferred frequency with which we hold a non-binding, advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers; and (v) as the proxy holder deems advisable, in his or her discretion, on other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting. 
Voting by Proxy over the Internet or by Telephone 
Stockholders whose shares are registered in their own names may vote by proxy by mail, over the Internet or by telephone. Instructions for voting by proxy over the Internet or by telephone are set forth on the Notice. The   Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, May 2, 2019. The Notice will also provide instructions on how you can elect to receive future proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail. If you choose to receive future proxy materials electronically, you will receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to the proxy materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials electronically or in printed form by mail will remain in effect until you terminate such election. 
If your shares are held in street name, the voting instruction form sent to you by your broker, bank or other nominee should indicate whether the institution has a process for beneficial holders to provide voting instructions over the Internet or by telephone. A number of banks and brokerage firms participate in a program that also permits stockholders whose shares are held in street name to direct their vote over the Internet or by telephone. If your bank or brokerage firm gives you this opportunity, the voting instructions from the bank or brokerage firm that accompany this Proxy Statement will tell you how to use the Internet or telephone to direct the vote of shares held in your account. If your voting instruction form does not include Internet or telephone information, please complete and return the voting instruction form in the self-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided by your broker. Stockholders who vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone need not return a proxy card or voting instruction form by mail, but may incur costs, such as usage charges, from telephone companies or Internet service providers. 
Revocability of Proxies 
Any proxy may be revoked at any time before it is exercised by filing an instrument revoking it with the Company's Secretary or by submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date prior to the time of the Annual Meeting. Stockholders who have voted by proxy over the Internet or by telephone or have executed and returned a proxy and who then attend the Annual Meeting and desire to vote in person are requested to notify the Secretary in writing prior to the time of the Annual Meeting. We request that all such written notices of revocation to the Company be addressed to Cindy R. Tahl, Secretary, c/o Fate Therapeutics, Inc., at the address of our principal executive offices at 3535 General Atomics Court, Suite 200, San Diego, CA 92121. Our telephone number is (858) 875-1800. Stockholders may also revoke their proxy by entering a new vote over the Internet or by telephone. 
Stockholder Proposals to be Presented at the Next Annual Meeting 
Any stockholder who meets the requirements of the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), may submit proposals to the Board of Directors to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting. Such proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and be submitted in writing by notice delivered or mailed by first-class United States mail, postage prepaid, to our Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above no later than November 23, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy materials to be disseminated by the Board of Directors for such annual meeting. If the date of the 2020 annual meeting is moved by more than 30 days from the date contemplated at the time of the previous year's proxy statement, then notice must be received within a reasonable time before we begin to print and send proxy materials. If that happens, we will publicly announce the deadline for submitting a proposal in a press release or in a document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). A proposal submitted outside the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act will be considered untimely if received after February 6, 2020. 
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws") also provide for separate notice procedures to recommend a person for nomination as a director or to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. To be considered timely under these provisions, the stockholder's notice must be received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above no earlier than January 4, 2020 and no later than February 3, 2020. Our Bylaws also specify requirements as to the form and content of a stockholder's notice.  The Board of Directors, a designated committee thereof or the chairman of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder proposal if it is not made in compliance with the applicable notice provisions.  PROPOSAL 1

Board of Directors' Role in Risk Management 
Risk is inherent with every business, and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. We face a number of risks, including risks relating to our financial condition, development and commercialization activities, operations and intellectual property. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks we face, while our Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, our Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. 
The role of our Board of Directors in overseeing the management of our risks is conducted primarily through committees of the Board of Directors, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees below and in the charters of each of the committees. The full Board of Directors (or the appropriate board committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) discusses with management our major risk exposures, their potential impact on our company, and the steps we take to manage them. When a board committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of a particular risk or risks, the chairman of the relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full Board of Directors during the committee reports portion of the next board meeting. This enables our Board of Directors and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.  Compensation Risk Assessment 
We believe that although a portion of the compensation provided to our executive officers and other employees is performance-based, our executive compensation program does not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk taking. This is primarily due to the fact that our compensation programs are designed to encourage our executive officers and other employees to remain focused on both short-term and long-term strategic goals, in particular in connection with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy. As a result, we do not believe that our compensation programs are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Board of Directors and Committees of the Board 
During 2018, the Board of Directors held a total of four meetings. During the year ended December 31, 2018, each of the directors then in office attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the number of Board of Directors meetings and the number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which such director served. Our Board of Directors has determined that all of our directors, except for Mr. Wolchko, are independent, as determined in accordance with the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ") and the SEC. In making such independence determination, the Board of Directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances that the Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. In considering the independence of the directors listed above, our Board of Directors considered the association of our directors with the holders of more than 5% of our common stock. There are no family relationships among any of our directors or executive officers. 
The Board of Directors has a standing Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is composed entirely of independent directors in accordance with current NASDAQ listing standards. Furthermore, our Audit Committee meets the enhanced independence standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rulemaking of the SEC. Copies of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charters and our corporate governance guidelines are available, free of charge, on our website at http://ir.fatetherapeutics.com/corporate-profile. 
Audit Committee 
Mr. Coughlin, Dr. Rastetter and Dr. Epstein currently serve on the Audit Committee, which is chaired by Mr. Coughlin.

[BEGIN TABLE]

• administering and, if determined to be necessary, amending our 401(k) plan, deferred compensation plan, and any  other material non-equity-based compensation plan; provided that the Compensation Committee may delegate routine administration of such plans to an administrative committee consisting of one or more of our  officers or other employees.  
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to retain compensation consultants to assist in its evaluation of executive and director compensation. The Compensation Committee engaged Radford Consulting, an Aon company ("Radford"), as a compensation consultant to perform compensation advisory services during 2018. The Compensation Committee instructed the consultant to conduct an independent evaluation of the Company's existing peer group of companies and provide recommended changes to the peer group to assess the competitiveness of the Company's executive, equity and Board of Directors compensation programs and to review the Company's equity program and broader equity practices. Our Compensation Committee plans to retain a consultant to provide similar information and advice in future years for consideration in determining annual cash, equity and other compensation for our employees, executive officers and directors. We do not believe the retention of, and the work performed by, Radford creates any conflict of interest. 
Pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"), the Compensation Committee has delegated to our Chief Executive Officer the authority to approve grants of stock options or restricted stock units ("RSUs") to new hires, subject to certain limitations for each level of employment and an annual aggregate maximum amount of awards that can be granted pursuant to such delegated authority. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee held nine meetings. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the evaluation of the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
During 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held three meetings. 
Board Leadership 
The positions of our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are presently separated at Fate. Separating these positions allows our Chief Executive Officer to focus on our day-to-day business, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to lead our Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice to and independent oversight of management. Our Board of Directors recognizes the time, effort and energy that the Chief Executive Officer must devote to his position in the current business environment, as well as the commitment required to serve as our Chairman of the Board, particularly as our Board of Directors' oversight responsibilities continue to grow. Our Board of Directors also believes that this structure ensures a greater role for the independent directors in the oversight of our Company and active participation of the independent directors in setting agendas and establishing priorities and procedures for the work of our Board of Directors.  While our Bylaws and corporate governance guidelines do not require that our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions be separate, our Board of Directors believes that having separate positions and having an independent outside director serve as Chairman of the Board is the appropriate leadership structure for us at this time and demonstrates our commitment to good corporate governance. Our separated Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions are augmented by the independence of seven of our eight directors, and our three entirely independent Board committees that provide appropriate oversight in the areas described above. At executive sessions of independent directors, these directors speak candidly on any matter of interest, without the Chief Executive Officer or other executives present. The independent directors met four times in 2018 without management present. We believe this structure provides consistent and effective oversight of our management and the Company. 
Director Nominations 
The director qualifications developed to date focus on what our Board believes to be essential competencies to effectively serve on the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must reassess such criteria annually and submit any proposed changes to the Board of Directors for approval. Presently, at a minimum, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must be satisfied that each nominee it recommends has the highest personal and professional integrity, demonstrates exceptional ability and judgment and shall be most effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board of Directors, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. 
In addition to those minimum qualifications, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends that our Board of Directors select persons for nomination to help ensure that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of our Board is "independent" in accordance with NASDAQ standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee be  comprised entirely of independent directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• at least one member of the Audit Committee shall have the experience, education and other qualifications  necessary to qualify as an "Audit Committee financial expert" as defined by the rules of the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to other standards the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may deem appropriate from time to time for the overall structure and compensation of the Board of Directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following factors when recommending that our Board select persons for nomination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether a nominee has direct experience in the biotechnology or pharmaceuticals industry or in the markets in  which the Company operates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the nominee, if elected, assists in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of  background and experience; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• achieving diversity within the Board of Directors and adhering to the philosophy of maintaining an environment  free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, disability, veteran status or any protected category under applicable law, which would include considering a  nominee's diverse background, skills and experience, including appropriate financial, scientific, medical and other expertise relevant to our business.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee adheres to the following process for identifying and evaluating nominees for the Board of Directors. First, it solicits recommendations for nominees from non-employee directors, our Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers, third-party search firms or any other source it deems appropriate. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then reviews and evaluates the qualifications of proposed nominees and conducts inquiries it deems appropriate; all proposed   nominees are evaluated in the same manner, regardless of who initially recommended such nominee. In reviewing and evaluating proposed nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider, in addition to the minimum qualifications and other criteria for Board membership approved by our Board from time to time, all facts and circumstances that it deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, the skills of the proposed nominee, his or her depth and breadth of business experience or other background characteristics, his or her independence and the needs of the Board. This process is designed to provide that the Board includes members with diverse backgrounds, skills and experience, including appropriate financial, scientific, medical and other expertise relevant to the business of the Company. Additionally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers whether nominees assist in achieving a mix of Board members that represents a diversity of background and experience, which is not only limited to race, gender or national origin, and is committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates, as well as candidates with diverse backgrounds, skills and experiences, to include in the pool from which Board nominees are chosen. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses its own performance on a periodic basis, and in doing so, gives consideration to its implementation of, and the results achieved through, this process. 
If the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides to retain a third-party search firm to identify proposed nominees, it has sole authority to retain and terminate such firm and to approve any such firm's fees and other retention terms. 
Each nominee for election as director at the 2019 Annual Meeting is recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and is presently a director and stands for re-election by the stockholders. From time to time, the Company may pay fees to third-party search firms to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees, although no such fees have been paid in connection with nominations to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
Pursuant to our Bylaws, stockholders who wish to nominate persons for election to the Board of Directors at an annual meeting must be a stockholder of record at the time of giving the notice, entitled to vote at the meeting, present (in person or by proxy) at the meeting and must comply with the notice procedures in our Bylaws. A stockholder's notice of nomination to be made at an annual meeting must be delivered to our principal executive offices not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting. However, if an annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date, the notice must be delivered no later than the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the 10th day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was made. A stockholder's notice of nomination may not be made at a special meeting unless such special meeting is held in lieu of an annual meeting. The stockholder's notice must include the following information for the person making the nomination: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a statement whether or not the proposing stockholder will deliver a proxy statement and form of proxy to holders  of, in the case of a business proposal, at least the percentage of voting power of all shares of capital stock required to approve the proposal or, in the case of director nominations, at least the percentage of voting power of all of the shares of  capital stock reasonably believed by the proposing stockholder to be sufficient to elect the nominee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any other information relating to the nominating person that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy  statement filed with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to proposed director nominees, the stockholder's notice must include all information required to be disclosed in a proxy statement in connection with a contested election of directors or otherwise required pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected). 
For matters other than the election of directors, the stockholder's notice must also include a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and any material interest in such business of the stockholder(s) proposing the business. 
The stockholder's notice must be updated and supplemented, if necessary, so that the information required to be provided in the notice is true and correct as of the record date for the meeting and as of the date that is ten business days prior to the meeting. 
The Board of Directors, a designated committee thereof or the chairman of the meeting will determine if the procedures in our Bylaws have been followed, and if not, declare that the proposal or nomination be disregarded. 
The nominee must be willing to provide any other information reasonably requested by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in connection with its evaluation of the nominee's independence. There have been no material changes to the process by which stockholders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders may send correspondence to the Board of Directors c/o the Corporate Secretary at our principal executive offices at the address set forth above. The Secretary will review all correspondence addressed to the Board, or any individual Board member, for any inappropriate correspondence and correspondence more suitably directed to management. Such items may not be forwarded to the Board or individual Board member, but will be made available to any non-management director upon request. Stockholders may also communicate online with our Board of Directors as a group by accessing our website (www.fatetherapeutics.com) and selecting the "Investors & Media" tab. 
Director Attendance at Annual Meetings 
Directors are encouraged to attend the Annual Meeting. Five of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
None of the members of the Compensation Committee is, or has at any time during the past fiscal year been, an officer or employee of the Company or had any relationship requiring disclosure under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. None of the members of the Compensation Committee, other than Drs. Mendlein and Rastetter, has formerly been an officer of the Company. Dr. Mendlein served as our Chief Executive Officer from February 2011 to February 2012, and Dr. Rastetter served as our interim Chief Executive Officer from February to October 2012. None of our executive officers serve, or in the past fiscal year, have served as a member of the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 
Director Compensation 
In August 2013, our Board of Directors adopted a non-employee director compensation policy, which became effective upon the completion of our initial public offering in October 2013, that is designed to provide a total compensation package that enables us to attract and retain, on a long-term basis, high-caliber non-employee directors. In April 2014, May 2016 and May 2018, our Board of Directors adopted amendments to the policy with respect to the equity component of compensation to our non-employee directors. Under this policy, as amended to date, all non-employee directors are paid cash compensation for service on the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors as set forth below, prorated based on days of service during a calendar year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

In addition, under the policy, each new non-employee director who is initially appointed or elected to our Board of Directors will receive an option grant to purchase 24,000 shares of our common stock, which will vest in equal monthly installments during the three years following the grant date, subject to the director's continued service on our Board of Directors. Thereafter, on the date of each annual meeting of stockholders, each continuing non-employee director will be eligible to receive an annual option grant to purchase 16,000 shares of our common stock, which will vest in full upon the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the date of the following annual meeting of stockholders. All of the foregoing options will be granted with an exercise price per share equal to the fair market value of a share of our common stock on the date of grant. 
We have agreed to reimburse all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by non-employee directors in attending Board and committee meetings.  Director Compensation Table—2018

RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will attend the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Company's organizational documents do not require that the stockholders ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and stockholder ratification is not binding on the Company, the Board or the Audit Committee. The Company requests such ratification, however, as a matter of good corporate practice. Our Board, including our Audit Committee, values the opinions of our stockholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and evaluate what actions may be appropriate to address those concerns, although the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still retain Ernst & Young LLP. 
The following table shows information about fees billed to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, retention and termination, and for determining the compensation, of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee shall pre-approve all auditing services and the terms thereof and non-audit services (other than non-audit services prohibited under Section 10A(g) of the Exchange Act or the applicable rules of the SEC or the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board), except that pre-approval is not required for the provision of non-audit services if the "de minimis" provisions of Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act are satisfied. The Audit Committee may delegate to the chairperson of the Audit Committee the authority to grant pre-approvals for audit and non-audit services, provided such approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services provided by Ernst & Young LLP during fiscal year 2018 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the pre-approval policy described above, and all audit-related fees, tax fees and other fees during the fiscal year 2018 were approved by the Audit Committee. 
Required Vote 
The ratification of the selection of Ernst & Young LLP requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal at the Annual Meeting. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for its fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL 3 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, not less frequently than once every three years, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
Our compensation programs are designed to effectively align our executives' interests with the interests of our stockholders by focusing on long-term equity incentives that correlate with the growth of sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. 
Stockholders are urged to read the section titled "Compensation of Executive Officers" in this proxy statement, which discusses how our executive compensation policies and practices implement our compensation philosophy and contains tabular information and narrative discussion about the compensation of our named executive officers. Our Board of Directors and our Compensation Committee believe that these policies and practices are effective in implementing our compensation philosophy and in achieving our compensation program goals. 
The vote on this resolution is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; rather, the vote relates to the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. 
Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders hereby approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the compensation tables and the narrative discussions that accompany the compensation tables. 
Required Vote 
The approval of this advisory non-binding proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal. 
The vote is advisory, which means that the vote is not binding on the Company, our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. To the extent there is any significant vote against our named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, our Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the concerns of stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement.  PROPOSAL 4 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTES TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act provides that stockholders must be given the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding advisory basis, for their preference as to how frequently we should seek future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, which we refer to as an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. 
By voting with respect to this proposal, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer that we conduct future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers every one, two or three years. Stockholders also may, if they wish, abstain from casting a vote on this proposal. Our Board of Directors has determined that an annual non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers will allow our stockholders to provide timely and direct input on the Company's executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices as disclosed in the proxy statement each year. The Board of Directors believes that an annual vote is therefore consistent with the Company's efforts to engage in an ongoing dialogue with our stockholders on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. 
Required Vote 
Stockholders will not be voting to approve or disapprove of the recommendation of our Board of Directors. The proxy card provides stockholders with the opportunity to choose among four options with respect to this proposal (holding the vote every one, two or three years, or abstaining). The option that receives the highest number of votes from the voting power of shares of our common stock present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon will be deemed to be the frequency preferred by our stockholders. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on this proposal. 
As an advisory vote, this proposal will not be binding on the Company, our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee in any way. As such, the results of the vote will not be construed to create or imply any change to the fiduciary duties of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may decide that it is in the best interests of our stockholders and the Company to hold a non-binding advisory vote on our named executive officer compensation more or less frequently than the option approved by our stockholders. Notwithstanding the non-binding advisory nature of this vote, the Company recognizes that the stockholders may have different views as to the best approach for the Company and looks forward to hearing from stockholders as to their preferences on the frequency of a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. 
Recommendation of the Board of Directors 
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR the option of ONE YEAR as the preferred frequency for future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers.  EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed in March 2019. Such grant date fair values do not take into account any estimated forfeitures related to service-based vesting conditions.

Bonuses. In January 2015, the Board of Directors adopted the Company's Amended and Restated Senior Executive Incentive Bonus Plan (the "Bonus Plan"), which applies to certain key executives (the "Executives"), that are recommended by the Compensation Committee and selected by the Board of Directors. The Bonus Plan provides for bonus payments based upon the attainment of performance targets established by the Compensation Committee and related to scientific, operational and financial metrics with respect to the Company or any of its subsidiaries (the "Performance Goals"), which may include, among others, revenue; expense levels; business development and financing milestones; total shareholder return; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; net income (loss) (either before or after interest, taxes, depreciation and/or amortization); changes in the market price of the Company's common stock; economic value-added; sales or revenue, developmental, clinical or regulatory milestones; acquisitions or strategic transactions; operating income (loss); cash flow (including, but not limited to, operating cash flow and free cash flow); return on capital, assets, equity, or   investment; stockholder returns; return on sales; gross or net profit levels; productivity; expense efficiency; margins; operating efficiency; customer satisfaction; clinical trial results; publications; reimbursement decisions; working capital; earnings (loss) per share of the Company's common stock; sales or market shares; number of customers or units of products sold; and operating income and/or net annual recurring revenue, any of which may be (i) measured in absolute terms or compared to any incremental increase, (ii) measured in terms of growth, (iii) compared to another company or companies or to results of a peer group, (iv) measured against the market as a whole and/or as compared to applicable market indices and/or (v) measured on a pre-tax or post-tax basis (if applicable). Further, any Performance Goals may be used to measure the performance of the Company as a whole or a business unit or other segment of the Company, or one or more product lines or specific markets. Any bonuses paid under the Bonus Plan will be based upon objectively determinable bonus formulas that tie such bonuses to one or more performance targets relating to the Performance Goals. The bonus formulas will be adopted in each performance period by the Compensation Committee and communicated to each Executive. No bonuses will be paid under the Bonus Plan unless and until the Compensation Committee makes a determination with respect to the attainment of the performance objectives. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Compensation Committee may adjust bonuses payable under the Bonus Plan based on achievement of individual performance goals or pay bonuses (including, without limitation, discretionary bonuses) to Executives under the Bonus Plan based upon such other terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may in its discretion determine. The bonuses payable under the Bonus Plan may be paid in equity or cash. 
For 2018, bonuses under the Bonus Plan were paid in cash and determined based upon the achievement of performance metrics related to the Company's corporate objectives, including objectives pertaining to the Company's advancement of its clinical and preclinical programs and achievement of its corporate development and financing initiatives. 
Equity Incentive Compensation. Historically, we have generally granted stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us. We also have historically granted stock options on an annual basis as part of annual performance reviews of our employees. From time to time, we have also granted, and intend to continue to grant, RSU awards to our employees, including our named executive officers, in connection with their initial employment with us or as part of annual performance reviews. We did not grant any RSUs to our named executive officers in 2018.

401(k) Savings Plan and Other Benefits 
We have established a 401(k) plan to allow our employees to save on a tax-favorable basis for their retirement. We do not match any contributions made by any employees, including our named executive officers, pursuant to the plan. We also pay, on behalf of our employees, a portion of the premiums for health, life and disability insurance. 
Employment and Severance Arrangements 
We consider it essential to the best interests of our stockholders to foster the continuous employment of our key management personnel. In this regard, we recognize that the possibility of a change in control may exist and that the uncertainty and questions that it may raise among management could result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and our stockholders. In order to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of certain key members of management, we have entered into written employment agreements with certain of our named executive officers that, while at-will, contain certain change in control and severance provisions. We have also adopted a severance and change in control policy for our employees, including our named executive officers, except for our Chief Executive Officer. A summary of such provisions is below. 
Employment Arrangements with Our Executive Officers 
J. Scott Wolchko 
Mr. Wolchko commenced employment with us on September 17, 2007, and, in connection with his appointment as our President and CEO, we entered into a new employment agreement with Mr. Wolchko (the "Original CEO   Employment Agreement"). The Original CEO Agreement was amended and restated in its entirety by a new employment agreement that Mr. Wolchko entered into with us on January 14, 2018, effective January 1, 2018 (the "CEO Employment Agreement"). The CEO Employment Agreement sets forth Mr. Wolchko's then-current annual base salary, then-current annual incentive compensation and his eligibility to participate in our benefit plans generally. Pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Wolchko is eligible to receive annual incentive compensation, for which the target annual incentive compensation will be 50% of his annual base salary, as determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. 
Payments Provided upon a Change of Control or Termination for Good Reason or Without Cause 
Mr. Wolchko's employment is at-will. Upon any termination of his employment, Mr. Wolchko will be entitled to receive (A) the amount of his accrued but unpaid salary and unpaid expense reimbursements and any accrued but unused vacation as of the date of termination, (B) any vested benefits Mr. Wolchko may have under any employee benefit plan, which shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such employee benefit plans, as of the date of termination, and (C) any earned but unpaid incentive compensation from the prior calendar year (clauses (A) through (C) collectively, the "Accrued Benefits"). Pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, in the event that Mr. Wolchko's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" (other than due to death or disability) or by Mr. Wolchko for "Good Reason" (as such terms are defined below), in each case outside of the "Sale Event Period" (as defined below), subject to his execution of a nonrevocable separation agreement and release, Mr. Wolchko will be entitled to, in addition to the Accrued Benefits, (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of twelve (12) months of Mr. Wolchko's then-current base salary and his annual target incentive compensation for the year of termination, (ii) full acceleration of vesting of all outstanding equity awards containing performance-based vesting conditions, if such performance-based vesting conditions have been satisfied as of the date of termination, (iii) for all outstanding equity awards containing time-based vesting conditions, twelve (12) months of accelerated vesting; provided, however, that for any equity awards that include both a performance-based vesting condition (including the achievement of a specified stock price or market capitalization) and a time-based vesting condition, or any equity awards that vest solely upon the achievement of a performance-based vesting condition, no acceleration of vesting will be provided unless the applicable performance-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of Mr. Wolchko's termination, and any acceleration provided shall be subject to clause (ii) of this paragraph, and (iv) payment of the premiums for Mr. Wolchko's and his family's participation in the Company's group health care plans, subject to Mr. Wolchko's copayment amount, for up to eighteen (18) months after such termination. 
Pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, in the event that Mr. Wolchko's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause (other than due to death or disability) or by Mr. Wolchko for Good Reason, in each case within the period beginning three months prior to and ending eighteen (18) months following a "Sale Event" (as such term is defined below) (the "Sale Event Period"), subject to his execution of a nonrevocable separation agreement and release, Mr. Wolchko is entitled to, in addition to the Accrued Benefits, (i) a lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of eighteen (18) months of Mr. Wolchko's then-current base salary (or base salary in effect immediately prior to the Sale Event, if higher) and one and a half (1.5) times his annual target incentive compensation for the year of termination, (ii) full acceleration of vesting of all outstanding equity awards; provided, that for any equity awards that include both a performance-based vesting condition (including the achievement of a specified stock price or market capitalization) and a time-based vesting condition, or any equity awards that vest solely upon the achievement of a performance-based vesting condition, no acceleration of vesting will be provided unless the applicable performance-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of Mr. Wolchko's termination, and (iii) payment of the premiums for Mr. Wolchko's and his family's participation in the Company's group health care plans, subject to Mr. Wolchko's copayment amount, for up to eighteen (18) months after such termination. 
The payments and benefits provided to Mr. Wolchko under the CEO Employment Agreements in connection with a change of control may not be eligible for federal income tax deduction for the Company pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These payments and benefits may also be subject to an   excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the payments or benefits payable to Mr. Wolchko in connection with a change of control would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, then those payments or benefits will be reduced if such reduction would result in a higher net after-tax benefit to him. 
Under the CEO Employment Agreement, the terms below are generally defined as follows: 
"Cause" means, (i) conduct by the employee constituting a material act of misconduct in connection with the performance of the employee's duties, including, without limitation, misappropriation of funds or property of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates other than the occasional, customary and de minimis use of Company property for personal purposes; (ii) the commission by the employee of (A) any felony; or (B) a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud; (iii) any conduct by the employee that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury or reputational harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates if the employee were retained in the employee's position; (iv) continued material and substantial non-performance by the employee of the employee's material responsibilities hereunder (other than by reason of the employee's physical or mental illness, incapacity or disability) which has continued for more than thirty (30) days following written notice of such non-performance from the Board of Directors; (v) a material and substantial breach by the employee of any of the employee's confidentiality, noncompetition, nonsolicitation or other similar restrictive covenant obligations to the Company; (vi) a material and substantial violation by the employee of any of the Company's written employment policies; or (vii) failure to cooperate with a bona fide internal investigation by or on behalf of the Board or an authorized committee thereof or an investigation by regulatory or law enforcement authorities, after being instructed by the Company to cooperate, or the willful destruction or failure to preserve documents or other materials known to be relevant to such investigation or the inducement of others to fail to cooperate or to produce documents or other materials in connection with such investigation. 
"Sale Event" means (i) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis to an unrelated person or entity, (ii) a merger, reorganization or consolidation pursuant to which the holders of the Company's outstanding voting power and outstanding stock immediately prior to such transaction do not own a majority of the outstanding voting power and outstanding stock or other equity interests of the resulting or successor entity (or its ultimate parent, if applicable) immediately upon completion of such transaction, (iii) the sale of all of the common stock of the Company to an unrelated person, entity or group thereof acting in concert, or (iv) any other transaction in which the owners of the Company's outstanding voting power immediately prior to such transaction do not own at least a majority of the outstanding voting power of the Company or any successor entity immediately upon completion of the transaction other than as a result of the acquisition of securities directly from the Company. 
"Good Reason" means that the employee has complied with the appropriate notice process following the occurrence of any of the following events: (i) a material diminution in the employee's responsibilities, authorities, powers, functions or duties; (ii) a material reduction in the employee's then-current base salary or target annual incentive compensation, except for across-the-board reductions based on the Company's financial performance similarly affecting all or substantially all senior management employees of the Company; or (iii) the relocation of the employee's principal place of business to a place that is more than twenty-five (25) miles from the employee's current location of employment as of the effective date of the employment agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the following shall be considered good reason: (x) the mere occurrence of a Sale Event; (y) any change in the identity of the surviving corporation in the event of a Sale Event; or (z) any change in the status of the surviving corporation after a Sale Event as a public or private Company.

Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy 
Effective on January 14, 2018, the Compensation Committee adopted the Severance and CIC Policy, in which all of our named executive officers, except for Mr. Wolchko, participate. 
Under the Severance and CIC Policy, if a participant is terminated by the Company without "Cause" (as defined below) or resigns for "Good Reason" (as defined below), in each case, following the first anniversary of the participant's first day of employment with the Company, then the participant will be entitled to the following benefits, subject to his or her execution of a nonrevocable release: (i) for all outstanding equity awards containing time-based vesting conditions, nine (9) months of accelerated vesting; provided, however, that for any equity awards that include both a performance-based vesting condition (including the achievement of a specified stock price or market capitalization) and a time-based vesting condition, or any equity awards that vest solely upon the achievement of a performance-based vesting condition, no acceleration of vesting will be provided unless the applicable performance-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of the participant's termination; (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to nine (9) months of the participant's then-current base salary; and (iii) payment of the employer portion of group health care benefits under COBRA for up to nine (9) months.  In addition, if a participant is terminated by the Company without Cause or resigns for Good Reason, in each case within the period beginning three (3) months prior to and ending twelve (12) months following a "Sale Event" (as defined in the 2013 Plan), then, in lieu of the benefits described above, such participant will be entitled to the following benefits, subject to his or her execution of a nonrevocable release: (i) for all outstanding equity awards containing time-based vesting conditions, full acceleration of vesting; provided, however, that for any equity awards that include both a performance-based vesting condition (including the achievement of a specified stock price or market capitalization) and a time-based vesting condition, or any equity awards that vest solely upon the achievement of a performance-based vesting condition, no acceleration of vesting will be provided unless the applicable performance-based vesting condition has been satisfied as of the date of the participant's termination; (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to twelve (12) months of the participant's then-current base salary; (iii) one (1) times the participant's annual target incentive compensation for the year of termination; and (iv) payment of the employer portion of group health care benefits under COBRA for up to twelve (12) months. 
The payments and benefits provided a participant under the Severance and CIC Policy may not be eligible for federal income tax deduction for the Company pursuant to Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These payments and benefits may also be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. If the payments or benefits payable to a participant would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, then those payments or benefits will be reduced to the extent necessary so that no portion of such payments or benefits will be subject to such excise tax or loss of tax deduction for the Company. 
Participants who are party to an agreement or an arrangement with the Company that provides greater benefits in the aggregate than set forth in the Severance and CIC Policy are not eligible to receive any payments or benefits under the Severance and CIC Policy. 
Under the Severance and CIC Policy, the terms above are generally defined as follows: 
"Cause" means (i) the participant's dishonest statements or acts with respect to the Company or any affiliate of the Company, or any current or prospective customers, suppliers, vendors or other third parties with which such entity does business; (ii) the participant's commission of (A) a felony or (B) any misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, deceit, dishonesty or fraud; (iii) any conduct by the participant that would reasonably be expected to result in material injury or reputational harm to the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates if the participant were retained in the participant's position; (iv) the participant's failure to perform his or her assigned duties and responsibilities to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company which failure continues, in the reasonable judgment of the Company, after written notice given to the participant by the Company; (v) the participant's gross negligence, willful misconduct or insubordination with respect to the Company or any affiliate of the Company; or (vi) the participant's material violation of any provision of any agreement(s) between the participant and the Company relating to noncompetition, nonsolicitation, nondisclosure and/or assignment of inventions. 
"Good Reason" means (i) a material diminution in the participant's responsibilities, authority or duties; (ii) a material diminution in the participant's base compensation except for across-the-board compensation reductions similarly affecting all or substantially all similarly situated service providers of the Company; or (iii) a change of more than twenty-five (25) miles in the geographic location at which the participant provides services to the Company, in each case so long as the participant provides at least sixty (60) days' notice to the Company following the initial occurrence of any such event, the Company fails to cure such event within thirty (30) days thereafter and the participant terminates his or her employment within thirty (30) days after the end of such cure period.

We have entered into indemnification agreements with or have contractual obligations to provide indemnification to each of our directors and intend to enter into such agreements with certain of our executive officers. These agreements require us, among other things, to indemnify these individuals for certain expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and settlement amounts reasonably incurred by such person in any action or proceeding, including any action by or in our right, on account of any services undertaken by such person on behalf of the Company or that person's status as a member of our Board of Directors to the maximum extent allowed under Delaware law.

For information regarding stock option awards and other equity incentive awards granted to our named executive officers and directors, see "Election of Directors—Director Compensation" and "Compensation of Executive Officers." 
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
The Audit Committee conducts an appropriate review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis, and the approval of the Audit Committee is required for all such transactions. The Audit Committee follows the policies and procedures set forth in our Related Person Transaction Policy in order to facilitate such review. The Related Person Transaction Policy is written.  SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth information with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by (i) each director, (ii) each named executive officer, (iii) all directors and executive officers as a group, and (iv) each person who we know beneficially owns more than 5% of our common stock as of January 30, 2019. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. These rules generally attribute beneficial ownership of securities to persons who possess sole or shared voting power or investment power with respect to those securities and include shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options that are immediately exercisable or exercisable within 60 days after January 30, 2019, but excludes unvested stock options. Except as otherwise indicated, all of the shares reflected in the table are shares of common stock and all persons listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares beneficially owned by them, subject to applicable community property laws. The information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. 
In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of January 30, 2019, as well as common stock issuable upon the vesting and settlement of RSU awards held by that person. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Shares beneficially owned include restricted shares of common stock acquired upon any early exercise of stock options granted under our 2007 Plan. 
Percentage ownership calculations for beneficial ownership for each person or entity are based on 64,734,026 shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 30, 2019 and, except as set forth in footnote (4) below, do not take into account 14,097,745 shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all 2,819,549 Preferred Shares outstanding on such date.

If Redmile elects pursuant to the Certificate of Designations of the Class A Convertible Preferred Stock to  increase the percentage of shares of common stock that it, together with its affiliates, may beneficially own to cover the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding shares of Class A Convertible  Preferred Stock held by Redmile, then Redmile would beneficially own an aggregate of 24,457,411 shares of common stock, representing a beneficial ownership percentage of 31.02%. Redmile, as the general partner and/or investment manager to the  limited partnerships, pooled investment vehicle(s), separately managed accounts, etc. and Jeremy Green, as the majority managing member and owner of Redmile, may therefore be deemed to beneficially own the shares owned by such investment limited  partnerships, pooled investment vehicle(s), separately managed accounts, etc., insofar as they may be deemed to have the power to direct the voting or disposition of those shares. Each of Redmile and Jeremy Green disclaims beneficial ownership as to  the shares, except to the extent of his or its pecuniary interests therein.

 SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership (Forms 3, 4 and 5) with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us with copies of all such forms which they file. 
To our knowledge, based solely on our review of such reports or written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of the filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors, greater than 10% beneficial owners and other persons subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act were complied with during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The following Audit Committee Report is not considered proxy solicitation material and is not deemed filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in any of the Company's filings made under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act that might incorporate filings made by the Company under those statutes, the Audit Committee Report shall not be incorporated by reference into any prior filings or into any future filings made by the Company under those statutes. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has furnished this report concerning the independent audit of the Company's financial statements. Each member of the Audit Committee meets the enhanced independence standards established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rulemaking of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and the NASDAQ Stock Market regulations. A copy of the Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website at http://www.fatetherapeutics.com. 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities include assisting the Board of Directors regarding the oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, and the performance of the Company's internal audit function and the independent registered public accounting firm. 
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with the Company's management and Ernst & Young LLP. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, with and without management present, their evaluation of the Company's internal accounting controls and overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 114 (formerly SAS 61), as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1 AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee also received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 and the Audit Committee discussed the independence of Ernst & Young LLP with that firm. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions noted above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors have recommended the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

ROBERT S. EPSTEIN, M.D., M.S.  HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
We have made available a procedure approved by the SEC known as "householding." This procedure allows multiple stockholders residing at the same address the convenience of receiving a single copy of our Notice, Annual Report on Form 10-K and proxy materials, as applicable. This allows us to save money by reducing the number of documents we must print and mail, and helps protect the environment as well. 
Householding is available to both registered stockholders (i.e., those stockholders with certificates registered in their name) and street name holders (i.e., those stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage). 
Registered Stockholders 
If you are a registered stockholder and would like to consent to a mailing of proxy materials and other stockholder information only to one account in your household, as identified by you, we will deliver or mail a single copy of our Annual Report and proxy materials for all registered stockholders residing at the same address. Your consent will be perpetual unless you revoke it, which you may do at any time by contacting the Householding Department of American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC ("AST"), at One Embarcadero Center, Suite 530, San Francisco, CA 94111. 
Registered stockholders who have not consented to householding will continue to receive copies of Annual Reports and proxy materials for each registered stockholder residing at the same address. As a registered stockholder, you may elect to participate in householding and receive only a single copy of Annual Reports or proxy statements for all registered stockholders residing at the same address by contacting AST as outlined above. 
Street Name Holders 
Stockholders who hold their shares through a brokerage may elect to participate in householding or revoke their consent to participate in householding by contacting their respective brokers.  OTHER MATTERS 
We are not aware of any matters that may come before the meeting other than those referred to in the Notice. If any other matter shall properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote all proxies in accordance with their best judgment. 
Accompanying this Proxy Statement is our Annual Report. Copies of our Annual Report are available free of charge on our website at www.fatetherapeutics.com or you can request a copy free of charge by calling Investor Relations at (858) 875-1800 or sending an e-mail request to Investor Relations by accessing our website (www.fatetherapeutics.com), and then selecting "Contact Us."
