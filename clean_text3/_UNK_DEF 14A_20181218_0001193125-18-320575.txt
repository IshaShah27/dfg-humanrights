Dear Shareholder, 
You are cordially invited to attend a combined special meeting ("Special Meeting") of the shareholders of Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Trusts, SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust (each, a "Trust" or collectively, the "Trusts"), to be held at 1:00 p.m., local time, on December 18, 2018 at the offices of SSGA Funds Management, Inc. ("SSGA FM" or the "Adviser"), One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111. 
At the Special Meeting, you are being asked to vote for the election of Trustees of your Trust(s). Election of all of the nominees will have the effect of bringing the membership of the boards of trustees of many of the mutual funds managed by SSGA FM into greater alignment and is expected to enhance efficiency and provide cost savings and greater consistency in the operations and management among and between the Trusts managed by SSGA FM. The Board of Trustees of your Trust(s) unanimously recommends for each Trust it oversees that you vote "FOR" each of the nominees included in the applicable Proposal. 
Shareholders may also be asked to transact such other business, not currently contemplated, that may properly come before the Special Meeting or any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof, in the discretion of the proxies or their substitutes. 
All shareholders are invited to attend the Special Meeting in person. You can access proxy materials and vote at www.proxyvote.com. Details regarding the matters to be acted upon at this Special Meeting are described in the Proxy Statement.

Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares you own. To avoid the added cost of follow-up solicitations and possible adjournments, please read the Proxy Statement and cast your vote via the Internet or telephone by following the instructions in the Proxy Statement and at www.proxyvote.com, or you may vote by signing, voting and returning your proxy ballot in the envelope provided. Your prompt vote via Internet, telephone or execution and return of the enclosed proxy card is requested. 
If you attend the Special Meeting, you may vote in person even if you have previously returned your proxy ballot or have voted via the Internet or by telephone. Please review the instructions for each voting option described in the Proxy Statement. Your prompt cooperation will be greatly appreciated.  We appreciate your participation and prompt response in this matter and thank you for your continued support. 
Sincerely, 
Ellen M. Needham 
President, Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Trusts, SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust  Important Information to Help You Understand and Provide Voting Instructions on the Proposals 
The following Q&A is provided to assist you in understanding the proposals. The proposals are described in greater detail in the enclosed proxy statement. Please read the full text of the proxy statement. Your voting instructions are important. 
Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 
You are receiving these proxy materials — which include the proxy statement and your proxy card — because you have the right to vote on an important proposal concerning one or more of Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Trusts, SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust (each, a "Trust" or collectively, the "Trusts"). Each proposal is described below. 
Throughout this proxy statement, unless the proxy statement or context indicates otherwise, the terms "Trust" or "Trusts" include Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Trusts, SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust; the terms "Fund" or "Funds" include the constituent funds or series of each of SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust and each other Trust that is organized as a single fund; the terms "Board" or "Board of Trustees" include the Board of Trustees of each of the Trusts; and the terms "Trustee" or "Trustees" include the Trustees of each of the Trusts. 
What proposals am I being asked to vote on? 
Depending on the Trusts in which you have an interest, you may be asked to provide voting instructions on the following proposals for one or more Trusts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  To elect the following six (6) nominees as Trustees of Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money  Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, and Elfun Trusts: John R. Costantino, Michael F. Holland, Michael A. Jessee, Ellen M. Needham, Donna M.  Rapaccioli, and Richard D. Shirk.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  To elect the following four (4) nominees as Trustees of SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment  Trust, and State Street Master Funds: John R. Costantino, Michael A. Jessee, Ellen M. Needham, and Donna M. Rapaccioli.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  To elect the following three (3) nominees as Trustees of State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust:  John R. Costantino, Ellen M. Needham, and Donna M. Rapaccioli.  
[END TABLE]
How does the Board recommend that I vote? 
The Board of each of the Trusts unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR the election of all nominees. 
How do I provide voting instructions? 
By telephone: Call the toll-free number printed on your proxy card(s) and follow the recorded instructions. 
On-line: Visit www.proxyvote.com and follow the on-line instructions.  By mail: Complete and sign the enclosed proxy card(s) and mail it (them) in the enclosed postage-paid return envelope. 
Each Board of Trustees and the management of the Trusts believe that the Proposal is in the best interests of each of the Trusts as applicable. 
What are shareholders being asked to do? 
Shareholders are being asked to elect Trustees of the Trusts in order to consolidate oversight of the Funds by bringing the membership of the Boards of Trustees of the Trusts and boards of other registered investment companies advised by SSGA FM into greater alignment with one another. This will result in each of the Funds being largely overseen by the same group of Trustees. All but one of the nominees currently serve as Trustees of a subset of the Trusts or serve on boards of other registered investment companies advised by SSGA FM, and the one nominee who is not already on a Board is currently the President of several of the Trusts. Shareholders are also being asked to elect those Trustees who currently serve on the Board of Trustees of one or more Trusts as a result of being appointed by a Board between shareholder meetings. Upon election, all of the nominees would serve on the applicable Board(s) with other existing Trustees who have previously been elected by shareholders of the applicable Trust(s). 
Why does my Trust's Board recommend this proposal? 
The Board of Trustees of each Trust has separately determined that it is in the best interests of each Fund in the applicable Trust to consolidate oversight of the Funds and other registered investment companies advised by SSGA FM by bringing the membership of the Boards of Trustees of the Trusts and such other funds into greater alignment with one another. Your Trust's Board believes that a consolidated board structure will benefit each Fund by, among other things, promoting: (i) transparency and effective communications among the trustees of the Trusts and other funds, consistent with preserving the quality of the decision-making by the Trustees, (ii) enhanced effectiveness of board oversight of the Funds, their management and other service providers and (iii) a more efficient and effective use of resources by management. Additionally, each Trust's Board believes that the Trust would benefit from the diversity of background and experience of the nominees. 
Will a majority of the Trustees be independent of SSGA FM? 
Yes, if all of the nominees are elected, the majority of the Trustees of each Trust will be independent of SSGA FM.  NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS

Copies of the Funds' Annual and unaudited Semi-Annual Reports have previously been mailed to shareholders.

You can obtain copies of the Prospectuses, Statement of Additional Information, Annual and unaudited Semi-Annual Reports of each Fund upon request, without charge, by writing to the applicable Trust at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210, by calling 1-800-997-7327, or by visiting http://www.ssgafunds.com.  PROPOSAL 1 
ELECT TRUSTEES FOR THE ELFUN FUNDS 
This Proposal applies to the following Trusts (the "Elfun Funds"): 
Elfun Diversified Fund; 
Elfun Government Money Market Fund; 
Elfun Income Fund; 
Elfun International Equity Fund; 
Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund; and 
Elfun Trusts. 
We are asking shareholders of each Elfun Fund to elect six (6) nominees as members of the Board of Trustees of that Elfun Fund, which Trustees, if elected, would serve on the Board with the three (3) previously shareholder-elected Trustees of the Elfun Funds. In connection with the election of the Nominees, two current Trustees of the Elfun Funds—William L. Marshall and Douglas T. Williams—are scheduled to retire and another current Trustee, James E. Ross, is scheduled to step down. 
The members of each Board considered the benefit to the Elfun Funds of calling a meeting of shareholders to elect the nominees at this time. 
Who are the nominees to the Board? 
The Board of Trustees of each Elfun Fund (the "Boards") has nominated six (6) individuals (the "Nominees") for election as Trustees of each Elfun Fund. 
The Nominees are John R. Costantino, Michael F. Holland, Michael A. Jessee, Donna M. Rapaccioli, and Richard D. Shirk, each of whom is not an "interested person," as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of any Elfun Fund (such individuals are commonly referred to as "Independent Trustees"), and Ellen M. Needham. Ms. Needham is an "interested person," as defined in the 1940 Act, of each Elfun Fund because of her affiliation with State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), which includes the personnel and operations of the Adviser ("SSGA"). Ms. Needham currently serves as Senior Managing Director of SSGA, the President of each Elfun Fund, and President of SSGA FM, investment adviser to each Elfun Fund. 
If the Proposal is approved with respect to each Nominee, after the Special Meeting and other Board membership changes described below that are scheduled to occur in connection with the Special Meeting, each Board would consist of nine Trustees. Four of the six Nominees—Mses. Needham and Rapaccioli and Messrs. Holland and Costantino—would be added to these Boards. Two of the six Nominees—Messrs. Jessee and Shirk—currently serve on these Boards by appointment of the Trustees in between shareholder meetings, and would continue to serve as Trustees after election by shareholders. Three of the current Board members—Mses. La Porta and Spence and Mr. Riley—have previously been elected by shareholders and would continue to serve on these Boards alongside the Nominees after the Special Meeting. In connection with the election of the Nominees, two current Trustees of the Boards—William L. Marshall and Douglas T. Williams—are scheduled to retire and another current Trustee, James E. Ross, is scheduled to step down from each Board.  Each Nominee has consented to serve as a Trustee and to being named in this Proxy Statement. If elected, each Nominee will serve as a Trustee for the lifetime of the applicable Elfun Fund or until his or her death, resignation, retirement or removal. If a Trustee sooner dies, resigns or retires, each Board may, in its discretion and subject to the 1940 Act, select another person to fill the vacant position. 
Prior to taking action to nominate each of the Nominees, the Nominating Sub-Committee of the Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") of each Board reviewed the qualifications, experience and background of each of the Nominees. Some of the factors considered by the Nominating Committee included the following, among others: (1) the Nominee's knowledge in matters relating to the mutual fund industry; (2) any experience possessed by the Nominee as a director or senior officer of other companies; (3) the Nominee's educational background, reputation for high ethical standards, and professional integrity; (4) any specific financial, technical, or other expertise possessed by the Nominee and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills, core competencies, and qualifications; (5) the Nominee's perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the Nominee's ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly and work collaboratively with other members of the Board; and (6) if applicable, the Nominee's ability to qualify as an independent trustee for purposes of the 1940 Act. 
Based upon this review, each Nominating Committee determined that nominating Messrs. Costantino, Holland, Jessee, and Shirk and Mses. Rapaccioli and Needham would be in the best interests of the shareholders of each Elfun Fund. Each Board believes that these Nominees are well suited for service on that Board due to their knowledge of the financial services sector, and their substantial experience in serving as directors or trustees, officers or advisers of public companies and business organizations, including other investment companies. 
Based upon this review, at a meeting of the Boards held on September 20, 2018, after discussion and further consideration of the matter, each Board voted to nominate each of the Nominees for election by shareholders. 
What are the qualifications of the Nominees? 
Set forth below are the names, ages, business experience during the past five years and other directorships of each of the Trustees and Nominees and other information relating to the professional experiences, attributes and skills relevant to each Trustee's and Nominee's qualifications to serve as a Trustee. The Nominees have varied experiences, attributes and skills that may be utilized in overseeing the activities of the Elfun Funds, reviewing contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the Elfun Funds, and reviewing fund performance. Among the attributes or skills common to all Nominees are their ability to (i) review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, (ii) interact effectively with the other Trustees, the Adviser, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and (iii) exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. Each Nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively has been attained through the Nominee's business, consulting, public service and/or academic positions and through experience from service as a member of a Board, other investment companies and public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations as set forth below. Each Nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by his or her educational background, professional training, and/or other life experiences. In considering the nomination of Ms. Needham, the Board also considered the desirable composition of the Board and determined that it is appropriate and of benefit to shareholders to have a representative of management of the Elfun Funds serve as a member of each Board.

 What are each Board's responsibilities? 
Each Board of Trustees is responsible for overseeing generally the management, activities and affairs of the applicable Elfun Fund and has approved contracts with various organizations to provide, among other services, day-to-day management required by the applicable Elfun Fund. Each Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the Elfun Fund on a day-to-day basis. Each Board is responsible for overseeing the Adviser and other service providers in the operation of the applicable Elfun Fund in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable state laws and regulations, other applicable laws and regulations, and such Elfun Fund's Trust Agreement. 
How does each Board oversee risk management on behalf of the funds? 
Each Board oversees risk management for the applicable Elfun Fund in several ways. Each Board receives regular reports from both the Chief Compliance Officer and administrator for the Elfun Fund, detailing the results of the Elfun Fund's compliance with its Board-adopted policies and procedures, the investment policies and limitations of the applicable Elfun Fund, and applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As needed, the Adviser discusses management issues regarding the Elfun Fund with each Elfun Fund's Board, soliciting the input of each Elfun Fund's Board on many aspects of management, including potential risks to the Elfun Fund. Each Board's Audit Committee also receives reports on various aspects of risk that might affect the Elfun Fund and offers advice to management, as appropriate. The Trustees also meet in executive session with the independent counsel to the those Trustees who are not considered to be "interested" as that term is defined in the 1940 Act (the "Independent Trustees"), the independent registered public accounting firm, counsel to the Elfun Fund, the Chief Compliance Officer and representatives of management, as needed. Through these regular reports and interactions, each Board oversees the risk management parameters for the applicable Elfun Fund, which are effected on a day-to-day basis by service providers to the Elfun Fund. 
How is each Board structured? 
Each Board has established various committees to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of various matters of importance to Independent Trustees, the Elfun Funds, and the Elfun Fund's shareholders and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, each Board has created an Audit Committee, Governance Committee, Valuation Committee and Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees. The Audit Committee meets twice a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of each Board. The Audit Committee oversees and monitors the Elfun Funds' internal accounting and control structure, its auditing function and its financial reporting process. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and retaining the independent accountants for the Elfun Funds. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the audit plans, fees and other material arrangements in respect of the engagement of the independent accountants, including non-audit services performed. The Audit Committee reviews the qualifications of the independent accountant's key personnel involved in the foregoing activities and monitors the independent accountant's independence. A copy of the Amended and Restated Audit Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix A. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee held 4 meetings. 
Governance Committee. The Governance Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the Governance Committee, including the Nominating Committee (a sub-committee of the Governance Committee), is to review and evaluate the composition and performance of each Board; make nominations for membership on each Board and committees; review the responsibilities of each committee; and review governance procedures, and compensation of Independent Trustees. The Nominating Committee operates pursuant to a joint charter that has been approved by the Board. A copy of the Nominating Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix B. The Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Trustees. The   Nominating Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending the nomination of candidates for election as independent trustees of the Trust. A potential nominee must have a college degree or equivalent business experience. The Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering potential nominees, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise, (v) ability, judgment and expertise and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition. The Nominating Committee will consider nominees to each Board recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter and should be submitted in writing to the Elfun Funds, to the attention of the Elfun Funds' Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Elfun Funds. Shareholder recommendations must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Elfun Funds not less than sixty (60) calendar days nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the date of the Board or shareholder meeting at which the nominee candidate would be considered for election. The Governance Committee performs an annual Board self-evaluation. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Governance Committee held 2 meetings. 
Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The Valuation Committee's primary purpose is to review the actions and recommendations of the Adviser's Oversight Committee. The Elfun Funds have established procedures and guidelines for valuing portfolio securities and making fair value determinations from time to time. The Valuation Committee is responsible for overseeing the Elfun Funds' valuation determinations, with the assistance of the Oversight Committee, State Street and SSGA FM. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Valuation Committee held 4 meetings. 
Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. The Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee (the "QLCC") is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the QLCC are to receive quarterly reports from the CCO; to oversee generally the Elfun Funds' responses to regulatory inquiries; and to investigate matters referred to it by the Chief Legal Officer and make recommendations to each Board regarding the implementation of an appropriate response to evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Elfun Funds, its officers or the Trustees. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee held 4 meetings. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Board held seven (7) meetings and each Trustee who was then a member of the Board was present for at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she has been a Trustee and meetings held by all committees on which he or she served during the period that he or she served.

Change in Audit Firm 
KPMG LLP ("KPMG") served as the independent registered certified public accounting firm of each Elfun Fund through its resignation as of June 30, 2016. On November 30, 2016, upon recommendation by the Audit Committee of the Elfun Funds, the Elfun Funds' Board selected Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") to replace KPMG as the independent public accountant for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. The reports of KPMG on the financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
During the Elfun Funds' fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and through the period ended June 30, 2016, there were no disagreements with KPMG on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG would have caused them to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years or periods. 
During the Elfun Funds' fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and through the period ended June 30, 2016, there were no reportable events (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). The Elfun Funds requested and KPMG furnished a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not it agreed with the above statements. A copy of such letter was filed as Exhibit 77 to each Elfun Fund's Form N-SAR for the period ended December 31, 2016. 
During the Elfun Funds' fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2015 and through November 30, 2016, neither the Elfun Funds nor anyone on their behalf has consulted EY on items which: (i) concerned the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or   the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Trust's financial statements or (ii) concerned the subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of Item 304 of Regulations S-K) or reportable events (as described in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of said Item 304). 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the aggregate fees billed to the Elfun Funds for professional services rendered by KPMG were $2,100 for tax-related services and $3,750 for services related to the transition to Ernst & Young LLP.

As a result, their annual base retainer is currently $164,000 and Mr. Holland's Chairman annual retainer is $49,000.) The Independent Trustees are reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses in connection with meeting attendance. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Trustees were not paid pension or retirement benefits as part of the Funds' expenses.

What happens if shareholders do not approve the Nominees? 
If shareholders of an Elfun Fund do not approve the Nominees, such Elfun Fund will continue to be managed under the current Trustees and the Board will determine what action, if any, should be taken. 
What does the Board recommend? 
Each Board has determined that election of the six (6) Nominees as Trustees is in the interests of each Elfun Fund and its shareholders. Accordingly, after consideration of the above factors and other information it considered relevant, each Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved the nomination of each of the six (6) Nominees. Each Board is recommending that the shareholders vote "FOR" each of the Nominees. 
EACH BOARD RECOMMENDS 
THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES UNDER THE PROPOSAL  PROPOSAL 2 
ELECT TRUSTEES FOR THE STT TRUSTS 
This Proposal applies to the following trusts (the "STT Trusts"): 
SSGA Funds; 
State Street Institutional Investment Trust; and 
State Street Master Funds. 
We are asking shareholders of each STT Trust to elect four (4) nominees as members of the Board of Trustees of that Trust, which Trustees, if elected, would serve on the Board with the six (6) previously elected Trustees of each STT Trust. In connection with the election of the nominees, two current Trustees of the STT Trusts—Messrs. Marshall and Williams—are scheduled to retire. 
The members of each Board considered the benefit to the STT Trusts of calling a meeting of shareholders to elect the nominees at this time. 
Who are the nominees to the Board? 
The Board of Trustees of each STT Trust (the "Boards") has nominated four (4) individuals (the "Nominees") for election as Trustees of each STT Trust. 
The Nominees are John R. Costantino. Michael A. Jessee and Donna M. Rapaccioli, each of whom is not an "interested person," as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of any STT Trust (such individuals are commonly referred to as "Independent Trustees"), and Ellen M. Needham. Ms. Needham is an "interested person," as defined in the 1940 Act, of each STT Trust because of her affiliation with State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), which includes the personnel and operations of the Adviser ("SSGA"). Ms. Needham currently serves as Senior Managing Director of SSGA and President of SSGA FM, investment adviser to each STT Trust. 
If the Proposal is approved with respect to each Nominee, after the Special Meeting and the Trustee retirements scheduled to occur in connection with the Special Meeting, each Board would consist of ten Trustees. Three of the four Nominees—Mses. Needham and Rapaccioli and Mr. Costantino—would be added to these Boards. The other Nominee, Mr. Jessee, currently serves on these Boards by appointment of the Trustees in between shareholder meetings and would continue to serve as a Trustee after his election by shareholders. Six of the current Board members—Ms. Spence and Messrs. Holland, Riley, Ross, Shirk, and Taber— have previously been elected by shareholders and would continue to serve on these Boards alongside the Nominees after the Special Meeting. In connection with the election of the Nominees, two current Trustees of these Trusts—Messrs. Marshall and Williams—are scheduled to retire. 
Each Nominee has consented to serve as a Trustee and to being named in this Proxy Statement. If elected, each Nominee will serve as a Trustee for the lifetime of the applicable STT Trust or until his or her death, resignation, retirement or removal. If a Trustee sooner dies, resigns or retires, each Board may, in its discretion and subject to the 1940 Act, select another person to fill the vacant position. 
Prior to taking action to nominate each of the Nominees, the Nominating Sub-Committee of the Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") of each Board reviewed the qualifications, experience and background of each of the Nominees. Some of the factors considered by the Nominating Committee included the following,   among others: (1) the Nominee's knowledge in matters relating to the mutual fund industry; (2) any experience possessed by the Nominee as a director or senior officer of other companies; (3) the Nominee's educational background, reputation for high ethical standards, and professional integrity; (4) any specific financial, technical, or other expertise possessed by the Nominee and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills, core competencies, and qualifications; (5) the Nominee's perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the Nominee's ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly and work collaboratively with other members of the Board; and (6) if applicable, the Nominee's ability to qualify as an independent trustee for purposes of the 1940 Act. 
Based upon this review, each Nominating Committee determined that nominating Messrs. Costantino and Jessee and Mses. Rapaccioli and Needham would be in the best interests of the shareholders of each STT Trust. Each Board believes that these Nominees are well suited for service on that Board due to their knowledge of the financial services sector, and their substantial experience in serving as directors or trustees, officers or advisers of public companies and business organizations, including other investment companies. 
Based upon this review, at a meeting of the Boards held on September 20, 2018, after discussion and further consideration of the matter, each Board voted to nominate each of the Nominees for election by shareholders. 
What are the qualifications of the Nominees? 
Set forth below are the names, ages, business experience during the past five years and other directorships of each of the Trustees and Nominees and other information relating to the professional experiences, attributes and skills relevant to each Trustee's and Nominee's qualifications to serve as a Trustee. The Nominees have varied experiences, attributes and skills that may be utilized in overseeing the activities of the STT Trusts, reviewing contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the STT Trusts, and reviewing fund performance.

What are each Board's responsibilities? 
Each Board of Trustees is responsible for overseeing generally the management, activities and affairs of the applicable STT Trust and has approved contracts with various organizations to provide, among other services, day-to-day management required by the applicable Trust. Each Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the STT Trust (including its constituent funds) on a day-to-day basis. Each Board is responsible for overseeing the Adviser and other service providers in the operation of the applicable STT Trust in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable state laws and regulations, other applicable laws and regulations, and such Trust's Trust Agreement. 
How does each Board oversee risk management on behalf of the funds? 
Each Board has delegated management of the STT Trusts to service providers who are responsible for the day-to-day management of risks applicable to the Trust. Each Board oversees risk management for the Trusts in several ways. Each Board receives regular reports from both the Chief Compliance Officer and administrator for the Trusts, detailing the results of the Trusts' compliance with its Board-adopted policies and procedures, the investment policies and limitations of the Trusts' constituent funds, and applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As needed, the Adviser discusses management issues regarding the STT Trusts with the Board soliciting the Board's input on many aspects of management, including potential risks to the Trusts. The Board's Audit Committee also receives reports on various aspects of risk that might affect the STT Trusts and offers advice to management, as appropriate. The Trustees also meet in executive session with the independent counsel to the Independent Trustees, the independent registered public accounting firm, counsel to the STT Trusts, the Chief Compliance Officer and representatives of management, as needed. Through these regular reports and interactions, each Board oversees the risk management parameters for the STT Trusts, which are effected on a day-to-day basis by service providers to the Trusts. 
How is each Board structured? 
Each Board of Trustees has established various committees to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of various matters of importance to Independent Trustees, the STT Trusts, and the Trusts' shareholders and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, each Board has created an Audit Committee, Governance Committee, Valuation Committee and Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. The purpose and function of the committees is described below.  Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees. The Audit Committee meets twice a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of the Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee oversees and monitors the STT Trusts' internal accounting and control structure, its auditing function and its financial reporting process. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and retaining the independent accountants for the Trusts. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the audit plans, fees and other material arrangements in respect of the engagement of the independent accountants, including non-audit services performed. The Audit Committee reviews the qualifications of the independent accountant's key personnel involved in the foregoing activities and monitors the independent accountant's independence. A copy of the Amended and Restated Audit Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix A. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee held four meetings. 
Governance Committee. The Governance Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the Governance Committee, including the Nominating Committee (a sub-committee of the Governance Committee), is to review and evaluate the composition and performance of the Board; make nominations for membership on the Board and committees; review the responsibilities of each committee; and review governance procedures, compensation of Independent Trustees and independence of outside counsel to the Trustees. The Nominating Committee operates pursuant to a joint charter that has been approved by the Board. A copy of the Nominating Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix B. The Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Trustees. The Nominating Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending the nomination of candidates for election as independent trustees of the Trust. A potential nominee must have a college degree or equivalent business experience. The Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering potential nominees, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise, (v) ability, judgment and expertise and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition. The Nominating Committee will consider nominees to the Board recommended by investors. Recommendations should be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter and should be submitted in writing to the STT Trusts, to the attention of the Trusts' Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the STT Trust. Investor recommendations must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Trust not less than sixty (60) calendar days nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the date of the Board or investor meeting at which the nominee candidate would be considered for election. The Governance Committee performs an annual self-evaluation of Board members. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Governance Committee held two meetings. 
Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The Valuation Committee's primary purpose is to review the actions and recommendations of the Adviser's Oversight Committee no less often than quarterly. The STT Trusts have established procedures and guidelines for valuing portfolio securities and making fair value determinations from time to time through the Valuation Committee, with the assistance of the Oversight Committee, State Street and SSGA FM. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Valuation Committee held four meetings. 
Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. The Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee (the "QLCC") is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the QLCC are to receive quarterly reports from the STT Trusts' chief compliance officer (the "Chief Compliance Officer"); to oversee generally the STT Trusts' responses to regulatory inquiries; and to investigate matters referred to it by the Chief Legal Officer and make recommendations to the Board regarding the implementation of an appropriate response to evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by an STT Trust, its officers or the Trustees. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the QLCC held four meetings. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Board of State Street Institutional Investment Trust, and State Street Master Funds held seven (7) meetings and each Trustee who was then a member of the Board   was present for at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she has been a Trustee and meetings held by all committees on which he or she served during the period that he or she served.

What happens if shareholders do not approve the Nominees? 
If shareholders of an STT Trust do not approve the Nominees, such Trust will continue to be managed under the current Trustees and the Board will determine what action, if any, should be taken. 
What does the Board recommend? 
Each Board has determined that election of the four (4) Nominees as Trustees is in the interests of each STT Trust and its shareholders. Accordingly, after consideration of the above factors and other information it considered relevant, each Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved the nomination of each of the four (4) Nominees. Each Board is recommending that the shareholders vote "FOR" each of the Nominees. 
EACH BOARD RECOMMENDS 
THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES UNDER THE PROPOSAL  PROPOSAL 3 
ELECT TRUSTEES FOR THE NAVIGATOR TRUST 
This Proposal applies to the following trust (the "Navigator Trust"): 
State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust. 
We are asking shareholders of the Navigator Trust to elect three (3) nominees as members of the Board of Trustees of that Trust, which Trustees, if elected, would serve on the Board with the seven (7) previously elected Trustees of the Navigator Trust. In connection with the election of the nominees, two current Trustees of the Navigator Trust—Messrs. Marshall and Williams—are scheduled to retire. 
The members of the Board considered the benefit to the Navigator Trust of calling a meeting of shareholders to elect the Nominees at this time. 
Who are the nominees to the Board? 
The Board of Trustees of the Navigator Trust (the "Board") has nominated three (3) individuals (the "Nominees") for election as Trustees of the Navigator Trust. 
The Nominees are John R. Costantino and Donna M. Rapaccioli, each of whom is not an "interested person," as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), of the Navigator Trust (such individuals are commonly referred to as "Independent Trustees"), and Ellen M. Needham. Ms. Needham is an "interested person," as defined in the 1940 Act, of the Navigator Trust because of her affiliation with State Street Global Advisors Trust Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Street Bank and Trust Company ("State Street"), which includes the personnel and operations of the Adviser ("SSGA"). Ms. Needham currently serves as Senior Managing Director of SSGA and President of SSGA FM, investment adviser to the Navigator Trust. 
If the Proposal is approved with respect to each Nominee, after the Special Meeting and the Trustee retirements scheduled to occur in connection with the Special Meeting, the Board would consist of ten Trustees. The three Nominees—Mses. Needham and Rapaccioli and Mr. Costantino—would be added to the Board. Seven of the current Board members—Ms. Spence and Messrs. Holland, Jessee, Riley, Ross, Shirk and Taber—have previously been elected by shareholders and would continue to serve on the Board alongside the Nominees after the Special Meeting. In connection with the election of the Nominees, two current Trustees—Messrs. Marshall and Williams—are scheduled to retire. 
Each Nominee has consented to serve as a Trustee and to being named in this Proxy Statement. If elected, each Nominee will serve as a Trustee for the lifetime of the Navigator Trust or until his or her death, resignation, retirement or removal. If a Trustee sooner dies, resigns or retires, each Board may, in its discretion and subject to the 1940 Act, select another person to fill the vacant position. 
Prior to taking action to nominate each of the Nominees, the Nominating Sub-Committee of the Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") of the Board reviewed the qualifications, experience and background of each of the Nominees. Some of the factors considered by the Nominating Committee included the following, among others: (1) the Nominee's knowledge in matters relating to the mutual fund industry; (2) any experience possessed by the Nominee as a director or senior officer of other companies; (3) the Nominee's educational background, reputation for high ethical standards, and professional integrity; (4) any specific financial, technical, or other expertise possessed by the Nominee and the extent to which such expertise would complement the Board's existing mix of skills, core competencies, and qualifications; (5) the Nominee's perceived ability to contribute to the ongoing functions of the Board, including the Nominee's ability and commitment to attend meetings regularly and work collaboratively with other members of the Board; and (6) if applicable, the Nominee's ability to qualify as an independent trustee for purposes of the 1940 Act.  Based upon this review, the Nominating Committee determined that nominating Mr. Costantino and Mses. Rapaccioli and Needham would be in the best interests of the shareholders of the Navigator Trust. The Board believes that these Nominees are well suited for service on the Board due to their knowledge of the financial services sector, and their substantial experience in serving as directors or trustees, officers or advisers of public companies and business organizations, including other investment companies. 
Based upon this review, at a meeting of the Board held on September 20, 2018, after discussion and further consideration of the matter, the Board voted to nominate each of the Nominees for election by shareholders. 
What are the qualifications of the Nominees? 
Set forth below are the names, ages, business experience during the past five years and other directorships of each of the Trustees and Nominees and other information relating to the professional experiences, attributes and skills relevant to each Trustee's and Nominee's qualifications to serve as a Trustee. The Nominees have varied experiences, attributes and skills that may be utilized in overseeing the activities of the Navigator Trust, reviewing contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the Navigator Trust, and reviewing fund performance. Among the attributes or skills common to all Nominees are their ability to (i) review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, (ii) interact effectively with the other Trustees, the Adviser, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and (iii) exercise effective and independent business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. Each Nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively has been attained through the Nominee's business, consulting, public service and/or academic positions and through experience from service as a member of a Board, other investment companies and public companies, or non-profit entities or other organizations as set forth below. Each Nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively also has been enhanced by his or her educational background, professional training, and/or other life experiences. In considering the nomination of Ms. Needham, the Board also considered the desirable composition of the Board and determined that it is appropriate and of benefit to shareholders to have a representative of management of the Navigator Trust serve as a member of the Board. 
Following is a summary of the experience, attributes and skills that may be seen to qualify each Nominee to serve on the Board: 
John R. Costantino: In addition to his tenure as a board member of various other funds advised by SSGA FM, Mr. Costantino has over 30 years of private equity investing experience. He has also served as an officer or a board member of charitable organizations and public and private companies for over 30 years. 
Donna M. Rapaccioli: Ms. Rapaccioli has over 26 years of service as a full-time member of the business faculty at Fordham University, where she developed and taught undergraduate and graduate courses, including International Accounting and Financial Statement Analysis and has taught at the executive MBA level. She has served on Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business accreditation team visits, lectured on accounting and finance topics and consulted for numerous investment banks. 
Ellen M. Needham: Ms. Needham is a Senior Managing Director of State Street Global Advisors, Head of Global Funds Management, and President of SSGA Funds Management, Inc. Ms. Needham serves as a director of SSGA Funds Management, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors Funds Distributors, LLC. In her role, she is responsible for managing firm-wide processes that focus on governance, fund structure, subadviser oversight, tax, product viability, distribution, ongoing monitoring and regulatory coordination across all products globally. Ms. Needham has been involved in the investment industry for over thirty years, beginning her career at State Street in 1989. 
References to the experience, attributes and skills of Nominees above are pursuant to the requirements of the SEC, do not constitute holding out of the Board or any Nominee as having any special expertise or experience, and shall not impose any greater responsibility or liability on any such person or on the Board by reason thereof.  Assuming all of the Nominees are elected, the Board would consist of the following ten (10) individuals following the Special Meeting and scheduled Trustee retirements:

 What are the Board's responsibilities? 
The Board of Trustees is responsible for overseeing generally the management, activities and affairs of the Navigator Trust and has approved contracts with various organizations to provide, among other services, day-to-day management required by the applicable Trust. The Board has engaged the Adviser to manage the Navigator Trust on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing the Adviser and other service providers in the operation of the Navigator Trust in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable state laws and regulations, other applicable laws and regulations, and the Trust's Trust Agreement. 
How does the Board oversee risk management on behalf of the funds? 
The Board has delegated management of the Navigator Trust to service providers who are responsible for the day-to-day management of risks applicable to the Trust. The Board oversees risk management for the Trust in several ways. The Board receives regular reports from both the Chief Compliance Officer and administrator for the Trust, detailing the results of the Trust's compliance with its Board-adopted policies and procedures, the investment policies and limitations of the Trust, and applicable provisions of the federal securities laws and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As needed, the Adviser discusses management issues regarding the Navigator Trust with the Board, soliciting the Board's input on many aspects of management, including potential risks to the Trust. The Board's Audit Committee also receives reports on various aspects of risk that might affect the Navigator Trust and offers advice to management, as appropriate. The Trustees also meet in executive session with the independent counsel to the Independent Trustees, the independent registered public accounting firm, counsel to the Navigator Trust, the Chief Compliance Officer and representatives of management, as needed. Through these regular reports and interactions, the Board oversees the risk management parameters for the Navigator Trust, which are effected on a day-to-day basis by service providers to the Trust. 
How is the Board structured? 
The Board of Trustees has established various committees to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of various matters of importance to Independent Trustees, the Navigator Trust, and the Trust's shareholders and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Currently, the Board has created an Audit Committee, Governance Committee, Valuation Committee and Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. The purpose and function of the committees is described below. 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is composed of all of the Independent Trustees. The Audit Committee meets twice a year, or more often as required, in conjunction with meetings of the Board of Trustees. The Audit Committee oversees and monitors the Navigator Trust's internal accounting and control structure, its auditing function and its financial reporting process. The Audit Committee is responsible for selecting and retaining the independent accountants for the Trust. The Audit Committee is responsible for approving the audit plans, fees and other material arrangements in respect of the engagement of the independent accountants, including non-audit services performed. The Audit Committee reviews the qualifications of the independent accountant's key personnel involved in the foregoing activities and monitors the independent accountant's independence. A copy of the Amended and Restated Audit Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix A. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Audit Committee held four meetings. 
Governance Committee. The Governance Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the Governance Committee, including the Nominating Committee (a sub-committee of the Governance Committee), is to review and evaluate the composition and performance of the Board; make nominations for membership on the Board and committees; review the responsibilities of each committee; and review governance procedures, compensation of Independent Trustees and independence of outside counsel to the Trustees. The Nominating Committee operates pursuant to a joint charter that has been approved by the Board. A copy of the Nominating Committee Charter is attached hereto as Appendix B. The Nominating Committee is comprised entirely of Independent Trustees. The Nominating Committee is responsible for   evaluating and recommending the nomination of candidates for election as independent trustees of the Trust. A potential nominee must have a college degree or equivalent business experience. The Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering potential nominees, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise, (v) ability, judgment and expertise and (vi) overall diversity of the Board's composition. The Nominating Committee will consider nominees to the Board recommended by investors. Recommendations should be submitted in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Nominating Committee Charter and should be submitted in writing to the Navigator Trust, to the attention of the Trust's Secretary, at the address of the principal executive offices of the Navigator Trust. Investor recommendations must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Trust not less than sixty (60) calendar days nor more than ninety (90) calendar days prior to the date of the Board or investor meeting at which the nominee candidate would be considered for election. The Governance Committee performs an annual self-evaluation of Board members. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Governance Committee held two meetings. 
Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The Valuation Committee's primary purpose is to review the actions and recommendations of the Adviser's Oversight Committee no less often than quarterly. The Navigator Trust has established procedures and guidelines for valuing portfolio securities and making fair value determinations from time to time through the Valuation Committee, with the assistance of the Oversight Committee, State Street and SSGA FM. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Valuation Committee held four meetings. 
Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee. The Qualified Legal and Compliance Committee (the "QLCC") is composed of all the Independent Trustees. The primary functions of the QLCC are to receive quarterly reports from the Navigator Trust's chief compliance officer (the "Chief Compliance Officer"); to oversee generally the Navigator Trust's responses to regulatory inquiries; and to investigate matters referred to it by the Chief Legal Officer and make recommendations to the Board regarding the implementation of an appropriate response to evidence of a material violation of the securities laws or breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation by the Navigator Trust, its officers or the Trustees. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the QLCC held four meetings. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the Board of the Navigator Trust held seven (7) meetings and each Trustee who was then a member of the Board was present for at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she has been a Trustee and meetings held by all committees on which he or she served during the period that he or she served.

Audit-Related Fees. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were no fees for assurance and related services that were reasonably related to the performance of the audit of the Navigator Trust's financial statements that were not reported under "Audit Fees." 
Tax Fees. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the aggregate tax fees billed for professional services rendered to the Navigator Trust by Ernst & Young LLP for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning in the form of preparation of excise filings and income tax returns were $12,036.

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, there were no fees billed for professional services rendered by PwC for products and services provided by PwC to the Navigator Trust, other than the services noted above.  For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP for products and services provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the Adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Navigator Trust that (i) relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Navigator Trust and (ii) were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, were $7,777,372. 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by PwC for products and services provided by PwC to the Adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provides ongoing services to the Navigator Trust that (i) relate directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Trust and (ii) were pre-approved by the Audit Committee, were $0.

All of the services described above were approved by the Navigator Trust's Audit Committee pursuant to pre-approval policies and procedures adopted by the Audit Committee. Pursuant to such policies and procedures each Audit Committee pre-approves: (i) all audit and non-audit services to be rendered to the Navigator Trust by Ernst & Young LLP; and (ii) all permissible non-audit services related to the Trust provided by Ernst & Young LLP to the Adviser or any affiliate thereof that provides ongoing services to the Trust (collectively, "Covered Services"). The Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval procedures authorizing one or more members of the Audit Committee to pre-approve from time to time, on behalf of the Audit Committee, all Covered Services to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP that are not otherwise pre-approved at a meeting of the Audit Committee, provided that such delegate reports to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee has delegated this general pre-approval authority to the Chairperson, or a Co-Chairperson, of the Audit Committee. The pre-approval procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee's responsibilities to management.
The Audit Committee of the Board will periodically consider whether Ernst & Young LLP's receipt of non-audit fees from the Navigator Trust, the Adviser and all entities controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser that provide services to the Navigator Trust is compatible with maintaining the independence of Ernst & Young LLP. 
Change in Audit Firm 
On February 15, 2017, the Audit Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of the Navigator Trust dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), 101 Seaport Boulevard, Suite 500, Boston, MA 02210, as the Navigator Trust's independent registered public accounting firm effective following the issuance by PwC of their report on the Navigator Trust's December 31, 2016 annual financial statements. 
The reports of PwC on the Navigator Trust's financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principle. 
During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and in the subsequent interim period through February 15, 2017, there were: (a) no disagreements with PwC on any matters of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference to the matter in their reports on the financial statements for such years; and (b) no reportable events (as defined in Regulation S-K 304(a)(1)(v)).  The Navigator Trust has provided a copy of the foregoing disclosures to PwC and requested that PwC furnish it with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether PwC agrees with the above statements. A copy of PwC's letter, dated August 24, 2017, is included as an exhibit to the Navigator Trust's Form N-SAR for the period ended June 30, 2017. 
On February 15, 2017, the Audit Committee also approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, 200 Clarendon Street, Boston, MA 02116, as the Navigator Trust's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. 
During the two most recent fiscal years and in the subsequent interim period through February 15, 2017, neither the Navigator Trust nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with Ernst & Young LLP with respect to either (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that would have been rendered on the Navigator Trust's financial statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the Navigator Trust that was an important factor considered by the Navigator Trust in reaching a decision as to any accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event (as defined in Regulation S-K 304(a)(1)(v)). 
Trustees' Compensation. 
Each Independent Trustee receives for his or her services to the Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund and Elfun Trusts and each constituent fund of SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, State Street Master Funds, and State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust (each a "Fund") a $170,000 annual base retainer in addition to $22,500 for each in-person meeting, $6,000 for each special in-person meeting and $2,500 for each telephonic meeting from the Funds. The Chairmen receive an additional $50,000 annual retainer. (Mr. Holland and Mr. Taber do not currently serve on the Boards of the Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund and Elfun Trusts. As a result, their annual base retainer is currently $164,000 and Mr. Holland's Chairman annual retainer is $49,000.) The Independent Trustees are reimbursed for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses in connection with meeting attendance. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Trustees were not paid pension or retirement benefits as part of the Funds' expenses. 
Each Interested Trustee serves without receiving compensation from the Funds.

What happens if shareholders do not approve the Nominees? 
If shareholders of the Navigator Trust do not approve the Nominees, the Trust will continue to be managed under the current Trustees and the Board will determine what action, if any, should be taken. 
What does the Board recommend? 
The Board has determined that election of the three (3) Nominees as Trustees is in the interests of the Navigator Trust and its shareholders. Accordingly, after consideration of the above factors and other information it considered relevant, the Board, including all of the Independent Trustees, unanimously approved the nomination of each of the three (3) Nominees. The Board is recommending that the shareholders vote "FOR" each of the Nominees. 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS 
THAT SHAREHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE NOMINEES UNDER THE PROPOSAL  GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROXY STATEMENT 
Who is asking for my vote? 
Each Trust's Board is soliciting your vote for a Special Meeting of shareholders of that Trust. 
How is my proxy being solicited? 
Each Trust has retained Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. (the "Proxy Solicitor") to assist in the solicitation of proxies, at an estimated cost of $497,224 which will be paid by the Adviser. As the date of the Special Meeting approaches, certain shareholders may receive a telephone call from a representative of the Proxy Solicitor if their votes have not yet been received. Authorization to permit the Proxy Solicitor to execute proxies may be obtained by telephonic instructions from shareholders of the Trusts. Proxies that are obtained telephonically will be recorded in accordance with certain procedures, as explained further below. Each Board believes that these procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that both the identity of the shareholder casting the vote and the voting instructions of the shareholder are accurately determined and recorded. 
In situations where a telephonic proxy is solicited, the Proxy Solicitor's representative is required to ask for each shareholder's full name, address, social security or employer identification number, title (if the shareholder is authorized to act on behalf of an entity, such as a corporation), the number of shares owned, and to confirm that the shareholder has received the proxy materials in the mail. The Proxy Solicitor's representative will explain the process, read the Proposal on the Proxy Ballot, and ask for the shareholder's instructions on the Proposal. Although the Proxy Solicitor's representative is permitted to answer questions about the process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the shareholder how to vote, other than reading any recommendation set forth in the Proxy Statement. The Proxy Solicitor's representative will record the shareholder's instructions on the Proxy Ballot. Within approximately 72 hours of soliciting telephonic voting instructions, the shareholder will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the shareholder to call the Proxy Solicitor immediately if his or her instructions are not correctly reflected in the confirmation. 
In addition to solicitation by mail, certain officers and representatives of the Trusts, officers and employees of the Adviser or its affiliates and certain financial services firms and their representatives, who will receive no extra compensation for their services, may solicit votes by telephone, telegram, facsimile, or other communication. 
What happens to my proxy once I submit it? 
Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, and Elfun Trusts: Each Board has named Ellen M. Needham, President of the Trusts and Ann Carpenter, Vice President of the Trusts, or one or more substitutes designated by them, as proxies who are authorized to vote fund shares as directed by shareholders. 
SSGA Funds, State Street Institutional Investment Trust, and State Street Master Funds: Each Board has named Ellen M. Needham, President of the Trusts and Ann Carpenter, Vice President of the Trusts, or one or more substitutes designated by them, as proxies who are authorized to vote fund shares as directed by shareholders. 
State Street Navigator Securities Lending Trust: The Board has named Ellen M. Needham, President of the Trust and Ann Carpenter, Vice President of the Trust, or one or more substitutes designated by them, as proxies who are authorized to vote fund shares as directed by shareholders. 
If you followed the instructions when you voted, your proxies will vote your shares as you have directed. If you submitted a Proxy Ballot but did not vote on the Proposal, your proxies will vote on the Proposal as recommended by the Board, except as described under "What are the voting rights and the quorum requirements?"  Can I revoke my proxy after I submit it? 
A shareholder may revoke the accompanying proxy at any time prior to its use by filing with the Trust a written revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date. In addition, any shareholder who attends the Special Meeting in person may vote by ballot at the Special Meeting, thereby canceling any proxy previously given. The persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote as directed by the shareholder under the proxy. In the absence of voting directions under any proxy that is signed and returned, they intend to vote "FOR" the Proposal and may vote in their discretion with respect to other matters not now known to the Board that may be presented at the Special Meeting. 
What are the voting rights and quorum requirements? 
Each shareholder of a Trust is entitled to one vote for each share held as to any matter on which such shareholder is entitled to vote and for each fractional share that is owned, the shareholder shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote. Thirty percent (30%) of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for all Trusts except Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, and Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund. For Elfun Diversified Fund, Elfun Government Money Market Fund, Elfun Income Fund, Elfun International Equity Fund, and Elfun Tax-Exempt Income Fund, fifty percent (50%) of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum. Shares have no preemptive or subscription rights. 
Only shareholders of the funds at the close of business on October 22, 2018 (the "Record Date") will be entitled to be present and give voting instructions for the funds at the Special Meeting with respect to their shares owned as of that Record Date. To be counted, the properly executed Voting Instruction Form must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on December 17, 2018. Appendix E sets forth the number of shares of each class of each Fund issued and outstanding as of the Record Date. 
The chairperson of the Special Meeting may adjourn the Special Meeting. The question of adjournments may also be (but is not required to be) submitted to vote of the shareholders of record, and in that case, any adjournment with respect to one or more matters must be approved by the vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting with respect to the matter or matters adjourned, whether or not a quorum is present with respect to such matter or matters, and if approved, such adjournment shall take place without the necessity of further notice. Any shares present and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may, at the discretion of the proxies named therein, be voted in favor of such an adjournment. 
If a shareholder abstains from voting as to any matter, or if a broker returns a "non-vote" proxy, indicating a lack of authority to vote on a matter, then the shares represented by such abstention or non-vote will be treated as shares that are present at the Special Meeting for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum. However, abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded in determining the "votes cast" on an issue. Since each Proposal requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares cast at the Special Meeting, an abstention or broker non-vote will have no effect on such matter. 
What are the voting procedures for master-feeder Funds? 
Certain series of State Street Institutional Investment Trust (each such series, a "Feeder Fund") pursue their investment objectives by investing substantially all of their investable assets in a corresponding master fund that may be a series of State Street Institutional Investment Trust or State Street Master Trust (each such series, a "Master Fund"). Shareholders of the Master Funds' Feeder Funds, will vote on the proposals with respect to their respective Trusts. As a shareholder of a Master Fund, each of the Feeder Funds is "passing-through" to its shareholders the vote on the proposals for the applicable Trust.  Shareholders of each Feeder Fund are being asked to provide voting instructions to the applicable Feeder Fund as to how to vote regarding the proposals for each Master Fund. Each of the Feeder Funds will cast its votes for the corresponding Master Fund in the same proportion as the votes cast by its shareholders on such proposals. If you are a shareholder of a Feeder Fund, your vote for a proposal will apply (i) directly to the proposal for the applicable Feeder Fund in which you own shares, and (ii) indirectly to the proposal for the corresponding Master Fund. 
Each of the Feeder Funds will vote shares of the corresponding Master Fund for which it receives no voting instructions in the same proportion as the shares for which it does receive voting instructions. Because each of the Feeder Fund's votes are proportionate to its percentage interest in the Trust of which the applicable Master Fund is a series, the majority of such Trust's shareholders could approve an action against which a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any Feeder Fund votes. 
Can shareholders submit proposals for consideration in a proxy statement? 
The Trusts are not required to hold annual meetings and currently do not intend to hold such meetings. A shareholder proposal to be considered for inclusion in a proxy statement at any subsequent meeting of shareholders must be submitted in a reasonable time before a proxy statement for that meeting is printed and mailed. Whether a proposal is submitted in a proxy statement will be determined in accordance with applicable federal and state laws. 
What if a proposal that is not in this Proxy Statement comes up at the Special Meeting? 
If any other matter is properly presented, your proxies will vote in their discretion in accordance with their best judgment, including any proposal to adjourn the meeting. At the time this Proxy Statement was printed, the Boards knew of no matter that needed to be acted upon at the Special Meeting other than the Proposals discussed in this Proxy Statement.  
What is "Householding?" 
Only one copy of this Proxy Statement may be mailed to each household, even if more than one person in the household is a shareholder of record of any of the funds, unless a Trust has received contrary instructions from one or more of the household's shareholders. If a shareholder needs an additional copy of this Proxy Statement, please contact Shareholder Services at 1-800-647-7327. If in the future, any shareholder does not wish to combine or wishes to recombine the mailing of a proxy statement with household members, please inform the applicable Trust in writing at One Iron Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02210 or via telephone at 1-800-997-7327. 
Who pays for this proxy solicitation? 
The Trusts will not pay the expenses in connection with the proxy solicitation, Proxy Statement and Special Meeting. The Adviser (or an affiliate) will pay expenses, including the printing, mailing, solicitation and vote tabulation expenses, legal fees, and out-of-pocket expenses. 
Your vote is important regardless of the number of shares you own. To assure the presence of a quorum at the Special Meeting, and to avoid the added cost of follow-up solicitations and possible adjournments, please take a few minutes to read the Proxy Statement and cast your vote via the Internet or telephone by following the instructions on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and at www.proxyvote.com, or if you have requested a proxy ballot by mail, you may vote by signing, voting and returning that proxy ballot in the envelope provided. It is important that your proxy ballot be received no later than December 17, 2018.  Ellen M. Needham

AUDIT COMMITTEE CHARTER 
This Audit Committee Charter (the "Charter") is adopted by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of each Trust to govern the activities of the Audit Committee of the Board with respect to its oversight of the Trust, and, if applicable, series of the Trust (each, a "Fund" and, collectively, the "Funds"). Unless otherwise stated herein or required by the context, each singular reference herein to the Board, Trust, Fund and Audit Committee shall be construed as a reference to each Board, Trust, Fund or Audit Committee of a Board. 
Membership 
The Audit Committee shall be comprised of as many Trustees as the Board shall determine, none of whom shall be an "interested person" of a Trust, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Unless designated by the Board, the Audit Committee shall elect from its members a Chairperson or Co-Chairpersons, who shall preside over each meeting of the Audit Committee. 
Purposes 
The purposes of the Audit Committee are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  to review, discuss with independent auditors and representatives of management, and assess (i) the  Trust's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices and its internal controls, (ii) the quality and objectivity of the Funds' financial statements and the independent audits thereof;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  to make recommendations to the Board with respect to the engagement of independent auditors for the Trust and  to act as a liaison between independent auditors and the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (c)  to approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided to the  Trust, and to certain other persons, by the Trust's independent auditors.  
[END TABLE]
Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of the Funds' investment adviser, SSGA Funds Management, Inc. (the "Adviser") or the Trusts' independent auditors. The function of the Audit Committee shall be oversight; it shall be the responsibility of the Adviser to maintain appropriate systems for accounting and internal control; the independent auditors' responsibility to plan and carry out a proper audit   and report thereon to the Board and shareholders, as required by law; and management's and the independent auditors' responsibility to determine that each Fund's financial statements are accurate and complete and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

As such, it is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. Each member of the Audit Committee shall be entitled to rely on (i) the integrity of those persons and organizations within management and outside the Trusts from which the Audit Committee receives information and (ii) the accuracy of financial and other information provided to the Audit Committee by such persons or organizations absent actual knowledge to the contrary.

The Audit Committee shall meet on a regular basis and is empowered to hold special meetings as circumstances require. The Audit Committee may meet in person or by telephone, and a majority of Audit Committee members then in office shall constitute a meeting quorum.

The Audit Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the authority to retain and compensate special counsel and other experts, consultants, or advisers as the Audit Committee deems necessary and the authority to obtain specialized training for Audit Committee members (at the expense of the Trusts or relevant Fund), as appropriate. The Trusts and each Fund shall provide for appropriate funding, as determined by the Audit Committee, for the payment of expenses of the Audit Committee that the Audit Committee considers to be necessary or appropriate in fulfilling its purposes or carrying out its responsibilities under this Charter, including without limitation compensation of independent legal counsel or other advisers retained by the Audit Committee. 
The matters to be considered by the Audit Committee, at any meeting or in general, shall be in the sole discretion of the Audit Committee. Membership of the Audit Committee shall not be deemed to impose on any Trustee an obligation or duty, or to imply any experience, expertise, or knowledge, different from or greater than that of any other Trustee.  It is the responsibility of each investment adviser, subadviser, and the Funds' other service providers to ensure that their activities in respect of the Funds comply with applicable law and regulation and with the policies and procedures of the Funds. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to limit or reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of any adviser, subadviser, the Funds' distributor, or any other service provider of the Funds.

NOMINATING COMMITTEE CHARTER 
Mission Statement 
The Board of Trustees (each, a "Board") of each Trust has adopted this charter to govern the activities of the Nominating Committee of each Board (each, a "Nominating Committee"). This Charter applies separately to each Trust, and the Board and Nominating Committee thereof, and shall be interpreted accordingly. Unless otherwise stated herein or required by the context, each singular reference herein to the Board, Trust and Nominating Committee shall be construed as a reference to each Trust or Board or Nominating Committee thereof, as applicable. 
The Nominating Committee is a committee of the Board created to assist the Board in fulfilling its duty to fill vacancies in the Board. The Nominating Committee of the Board is responsible for evaluating and recommending the nomination of candidates for election as independent trustees of the Trust. 
The scope of the Nominating Committee's responsibilities and its structure, process and membership requirements are set forth in this charter (the "Charter"). 
Organization 
The membership of the Nominating Committee shall consist entirely of those trustees who are not "interested persons," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended ("Independent Trustees"), of the Trust; however, the Nominating Committee need not be comprised of all of the Independent Trustees. 
The Nominating Committee may designate one or more members to serve as Chair or Co-Chair of the Nominating Committee, as the case may be, but need not make such a designation. 
The Nominating Committee shall report to the Board of Trustees as to the results of its meetings and activities.  Authority and Responsibilities 
The Nominating Committee, in discharging its responsibilities under this Charter, may, in addition to other actions it deems appropriate, consider taking one or more of the actions described below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  To make nominations for Independent Trustee membership on the Board. A potential nominee must have a college  degree or equivalent business experience. The Nominating Committee may take into account a wide variety of factors in considering potential nominees, including (but not limited to): (i) availability and commitment of a candidate to attend meetings  and perform his or her responsibilities on the Board, (ii) relevant industry and related experience, (iii) educational background, (iv) financial expertise, (v) ability, judgment and expertise and (vi) overall diversity of  the Board's composition.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2  When identifying potential nominees for a Board, the Nominating Committee may consider candidates recommended  by the following sources: (i) the Trust's current Trustees; (ii) the Trust's officers; (iii) the Trust's investment adviser, sub-advisers or administrator; (iv) shareholders  of the Trust (see below); or (v) any other source the Nominating Committee deems to be appropriate. The Nominating Committee may consider qualified incumbent trustees of other trusts and/or funds managed and/or advised by SSGA Funds Management,  Inc. for the purpose of achieving fund board consolidations and related efficiencies or any other objective that it determines to be in the best interests of the Trust and its shareholders. The Nominating Committee may, but is not required to,  retain a third party search firm at the applicable Trust's expense to identify potential candidates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  To consider nominee candidates properly submitted in accordance with Appendix A by shareholders of the Trust on  the same basis as it considers and evaluates candidates recommended by other sources.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  To review Nominating Committee Chair or Co-Chair assignments and  Nominating Committee assignments periodically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.  To consider the structure, operations and effectiveness of the Nominating Committee and review this Charter  periodically.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  To meet as frequently and at such times as circumstances dictate.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  To hire (and compensate) from time to time independent counsel and any other expert deemed necessary by the  Nominating Committee to perform its duties.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee shall have the resources to discharge all of its responsibilities, including but not limited to the authority to select, retain, terminate and approve the fees and other retention terms of special or independent counsel or any other advisers determined to be necessary or appropriate without seeking approval of management of the Trust. Costs incurred by the Nominating Committee in performing its functions under this Charter shall be borne by the Trust. 
The matters to be considered by the Nominating Committee, at any meeting or in general, shall be in the sole discretion of the Nominating Committee. Membership of the Nominating Committee shall not be deemed to impose on any Trustee an obligation or duty, or to imply any experience, expertise, or knowledge, different from or greater than that of any other Trustee. 
It is the responsibility of each investment adviser, sub-adviser, and the funds' other service providers to ensure that their activities in respect of the funds comply with applicable law and regulation and with the policies and procedures of the funds. Nothing in this Charter shall be construed to limit or reduce the responsibilities or liabilities of any adviser, sub-adviser, the funds' distributor, or any other service provider of the funds.
