Dear Stockholder: 
We cordially invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., the parent company of Northwest Bank. The Annual Meeting will be held at The Struthers Library Theatre, located at 302 W. Third Avenue, Warren, Pennsylvania, at 11:00 a.m. (Pennsylvania time) on April 17, 2019. 
The enclosed Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement describe the formal business to be transacted. During the Annual Meeting, we will also report on the operations of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. Our directors and officers, as well as a representative from our independent registered public accounting firm, will be present to respond to any questions that stockholders may have. 
The business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting includes the election of four directors, the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the consideration of an advisory, non-binding resolution to approve the executive compensation described in the Proxy Statement. 
Our Board of Directors has determined that the matters to be considered at the Annual Meeting are in the best interests of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and its stockholders. For the reasons set forth in the Proxy Statement, the Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" each matter to be considered. 
Under rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we sent the majority of those stockholders who are eligible to vote at the Annual Meeting a notice that explains how to access their proxy materials, including our 2018 Annual Report, online, rather than in traditional printed form. The notice also explains the steps our eligible stockholders can follow in order to vote their shares online or by telephone. If you are among the stockholders who received the notice explaining this process and would prefer to receive your proxy materials in the traditional printed format, the notice also explains how to arrange to have the printed materials sent to you in the mail. If you are among those who received their proxy materials in printed form, rather than the notice, please note that you may still access these materials and vote your shares online by going to the following website: www.proxyvote.com. 
Please take a moment now to cast your vote via the Internet or by telephone as described on the enclosed proxy card, or alternatively, complete, sign, date and return the proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided. Voting in advance of the Annual Meeting will not prevent you from voting in person, but will assure that your vote is counted if you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting.

2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
April 17, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. to be used at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., which will be held at The Struthers Library Theatre, 302 W. Third Avenue, Warren, Pennsylvania, on April 17, 2019, at 11:00 a.m., Pennsylvania time, and all adjournments of the Annual Meeting. The accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and this Proxy Statement are first being mailed to stockholders on or about March 8, 2019. 
VOTING SECURITIES AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS THEREOF 
Holders of record of our shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, as of the close of business on February 22, 2019 are entitled to one vote for each share then held. As of February 22, 2019, there were 103,689,288 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote is necessary to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining that a quorum is present. 
As to the election of directors, the Proxy Card being provided by the Board of Directors enables a stockholder to vote FOR all nominees proposed by the Board, to withhold authority for all nominees or to vote for all except one or more of the nominees being proposed. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes cast, without regard to either broker non-votes, or proxies as to which the authority to vote for the nominees being proposed is withheld. In addition, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. has adopted a policy regarding majority voting with respect to the election of directors. For more information, see "Policy Regarding Majority Voting." 
As to the ratification of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, by checking the appropriate box, a stockholder may: (i) vote FOR the ratification; (ii) vote against the ratification; or (iii) abstain from voting on such ratification. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, without regard to either broker non-votes, or shares as to which the abstain box has been selected on the proxy card, is required for the approval of this matter. 
As to the advisory, non-binding resolution to approve our executive compensation as described in this Proxy Statement, a stockholder may: (i) vote FOR the resolution; (ii) vote against the resolution; or (iii) abstain from voting on the resolution. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, without regard to either broker non-votes, or shares as to which the abstain box has been selected on the proxy card, is required for the approval of this non-binding resolution. While this vote is required by law, it will neither be binding on Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or the Board of Directors, nor will it create or imply any change in the fiduciary duties of, or impose any additional fiduciary duty on Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or the Board of Directors. 
As provided in Section D of Article 5 of our Articles of Incorporation, record holders of shares owned, directly or indirectly, by a person who beneficially owns in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock are not entitled to vote any shares held in excess of this 10% limit. Subject to certain exceptions, a person is deemed to beneficially own shares owned by an affiliate of, as well as by persons acting in concert with, such person. The Board of Directors of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is authorized to construe and apply the provisions of Section D of Article 5 of the Articles of Incorporation, and to make all determinations it deems necessary or desirable to implement them, including determining the number of shares beneficially owned by any person and whether a person is an affiliate of or has an arrangement or agreement with another person, and to demand certain information from any person who is reasonably believed to beneficially own stock in excess of the 10% limit and reimbursement for all expenses incurred by Northwest Bancshares, Inc. in connection with an investigation conducted by the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of Article 5, Section D of the Articles of Incorporation. 
If you have selected a broker or other intermediary to hold your common stock rather than having them directly registered with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you will receive instructions directly from your broker or other intermediary in order to vote your shares. Your brokerage firm may also provide the ability to vote your proxy by telephone or online. Please be advised that if you choose to not vote your proxy, your brokerage firm only has the authority under applicable stock market rules to vote your shares "FOR" or "against" routine matters. The ratification of the appointment of the independent   registered public accounting firm is deemed to be a routine matter. Accordingly, we urge you to vote by following the instructions provided by your broker, bank, or other intermediary. 
We are utilizing Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow companies to furnish proxy materials to stockholders via the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners, unless they have directed us to provide the materials in a different manner or hold shares of our common stock through our stock-based benefit plans. The Notice provides instructions on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the Company's Proxy Statement and Annual Report to Stockholders, as well as how to cast a vote. Stockholders who receive the Notice and who would still like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials can find instructions for requesting these materials included in the Notice. We plan to mail the Notice to stockholders by March 8, 2019. 
Persons and groups who beneficially own in excess of 5% of our shares of common stock are required to file certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding such ownership pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The following table sets forth, as of February 22, 2019, the shares of our common stock beneficially owned by each person known to us who was the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock.

As used herein, "voting power" is the power to vote or direct the voting of shares and "investment power" is the power to dispose or direct  the disposition of shares, and includes all shares held directly as well as by spouses and minor children, in trust and other indirect ownership, over which shares the named individuals effectively exercise sole or shared voting or investment power.

[END TABLE]
REVOCATION OF PROXIES 
Stockholders who execute proxies in the form solicited hereby retain the right to revoke them in the manner described below. Unless so revoked, the shares represented by such proxies will be voted at the Annual Meeting and all adjournments thereof. Proxies solicited on behalf of our Board of Directors will be voted in accordance with the directions given thereon. You may vote by Internet or telephone as described on your Proxy Card. You may also vote by signing and returning your Proxy Card to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. Proxies we receive that are signed, but contain no instructions for voting, will be voted "FOR" the proposals set forth in this Proxy Statement for consideration at the Annual Meeting. 
Proxies may be revoked by sending written notice of revocation to the Secretary of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., Richard K. Laws, at the address shown above, or by returning a duly executed proxy bearing a later date by mail, or voting on a later date by Internet or telephone, as described on your Proxy Card. The presence at the Annual Meeting of any stockholder who had given a proxy shall not revoke such proxy unless the stockholder delivers his or her ballot in person at the Annual Meeting or delivers a written revocation to the Secretary prior to the voting of such proxy.  PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors consists of ten members. Our bylaws provide that directors are divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as reasonably possible, such that approximately one-third of the directors are to be elected annually. Our directors are generally elected to serve for a three-year period, or a shorter period if the director is elected to fill a vacancy, and until their respective successors shall have been elected and shall qualify. Four directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting and will serve until their successors have been elected and qualified. The Nominating Committee has nominated John P. Meegan, Timothy B. Fannin, Robert M. Campana and Mark A. Paup to serve as directors for three-year terms. Each of these individuals is currently a member of the Board of Directors. 
The table below sets forth certain information regarding our nominees and the composition of our Board of Directors as of February 22, 2019 (with age information as of December 31, 2018), including the terms of office of Board members. It is intended that the proxies solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors (other than proxies in which the vote is withheld as to a nominee) will be voted at the Annual Meeting for the election of the nominees identified below. If one or more nominees is unable to serve, the shares represented by all such proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute or substitutes as the Nominating Committee may recommend. At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why the nominees might be unable to serve, if elected. Except as indicated herein, there are no arrangements or understandings between the nominees and any other person pursuant to which such nominees were selected. 
None of our Directors or Executive Officers had any shares pledged as collateral as of February 22, 2019. We have adopted a policy that prohibits our insiders from (1) pledging Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock as collateral against a loan or line of credit or holding Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock in a margin account; and (2) conducting any hedging activities (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) designed to offset any decrease in the market value of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the persons nominated by the Board of Directors.

Board Independence 
The Board of Directors has determined that Directors Campana, Chadsey, Fannin, Hunter, McKnight, Meegan, Paup, Probst and Tredway are "independent" within the meaning of the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. Mr. Seiffert is not independent by virtue of being an employee of Northwest Bank. Mr. Tredway serves as the Lead Director. In this capacity, Mr. Tredway chairs the meetings of the independent directors and other meetings of the Board when the Chairman is excused or absent. Mr. Tredway also acts as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors. 
In determining the independence of the directors and the nominees listed above, the Board of Directors reviewed the transactions reported under "—Transactions With Certain Related Persons," below, as well as the following transactions and relationships, none of which are required to be reported under "—Transactions With Certain Related Persons." Each of the following products or services are with Northwest Bank. Director Campana has a mortgage, home equity line of credit, commercial loans and commercial lines of credit. Director Chadsey has a residential mortgage loan and a home equity line of credit, and Kavinoky Cook, LLP, where she is a law partner, has a commercial line of credit. Kavinoky Cook, LLP also received legal fees from Northwest Bank, directly and indirectly, during the year ended December 31, 2018. Director Fannin has an unsecured line of   credit. Director McKnight has a residential mortgage loan. Director Paup's sister is a non-management employee at Northwest Bank. Director Paup has mortgages, an equity loan, and a home equity line of credit. Director Tredway has a credit card. Additional loans (including mortgage loans, lines of credit, credit cards and automobile loans) have been made to related persons of Directors Campana, Chadsey, Hunter, McKnight, Paup and Tredway. 
Board Leadership Structure and Oversight 
The Board of Directors currently combines the role of Chairman of the Board with the role of Chief Executive Officer, coupled with a lead director position to further strengthen the governance structure. The Board believes this provides an efficient and effective leadership model. Combining the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer roles fosters clear accountability, effective decision-making, and alignment on corporate strategy. To assure effective independent oversight, the board has adopted a number of governance practices, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a strong, independent, clearly-defined lead director role;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• periodic meetings of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• annual performance evaluations of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer by the independent directors; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• direct reporting lines between the Board of Directors and both the Chief Risk Officer and Chief Auditor, with  quarterly meetings with these individuals without the presence of management.  
[END TABLE]
The board recognizes that, depending on the circumstances, other leadership models, such as a separate independent chairman of the board, might be appropriate. Accordingly, the board periodically reviews its leadership structure. 
A key responsibility of the Chief Executive Officer and the board is ensuring that an effective process is in place to provide continuity of leadership over the long term at all levels in our company. Each year, succession planning reviews are held at every significant organizational level of our company, culminating in a full review of senior leadership talent by the independent directors. During this review, the Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors discuss future candidates for senior leadership positions, succession timing for those positions, and development plans for the highest-quality candidates. This process ensures continuity of leadership over the long term, and it forms the basis on which we make ongoing leadership assignments. It is a key success factor in managing the long-term planning and investment lead times of our business. 
In addition, the Chief Executive Officer maintains in place at all times, and reviews with the independent directors, a confidential plan for the timely and efficient transfer of his responsibilities in the event of an emergency or his sudden incapacitation or departure. 
The Board of Directors is actively involved in oversight of risks that could affect Northwest Bancshares, Inc. This oversight is conducted primarily through committees of the Board of Directors, but the full Board of Directors has retained responsibility for general oversight of risks. The Board has designated a Risk Management Committee, consisting of all independent directors, to meet quarterly for the specific purpose of evaluating our exposure to all risks specifically identified in banking regulations: credit, interest rate, strategic/capital, market price, liquidity, operational, business resumption, compliance/legal/regulatory, foreign exchange and reputation. The Risk Management Committee also evaluates risk related to cybersecurity. The Risk Management Committee reports are prepared and presented by our Chief Risk Officer. The Board of Directors also satisfies this responsibility through reports to the Board of Directors by the committee chair of all board committees regarding the committees' considerations and actions, through review of minutes of committee meetings and through regular reports directly from officers responsible for oversight of particular risks within Northwest Bancshares, Inc. Risks relating to the direct operations of Northwest Bank are further overseen by the Board of Directors of Northwest Bank, which generally consists of the same individuals who serve on the Board of Directors of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. The Board of Directors of Northwest Bank also has additional committees that conduct risk oversight, and such committees typically meet jointly with the committees of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. All committees are responsible for the establishment of policies that guide management and staff in the day-to-day operation of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank such as lending, risk management, asset/liability management, investment management and others. 
Meetings and Committees of the Board of Directors 
The business of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is conducted at regular and special meetings of the full Board and its standing committees. In addition, our independent directors meet in executive sessions. The standing committees consist of the Executive, Audit, Compensation, Compliance, Nominating, Risk Management, Governance, Trust and Innovation and Technology Committees. Mr. Seiffert, our Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, is a member of the Executive, Compliance and Trust Committees. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. met at 12 regular meetings and held one special meeting. No member of the Board or any committee thereof attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of: (i) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors (held during the period for which he or   she has been a director); and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served (during the periods that he or she served).

Such committee members also must not receive, directly or indirectly, fees in excess of $10,000 per year from us other than fees for service as a director. The Compensation Committee meets at least quarterly, or more frequently if necessary. Our Governance Committee has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, which is available on our website at www.northwest.com. The Compensation Committee of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. met four times during the year ended December 31, 2018. The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to, among other things, evaluate:

 The Compensation Committee has available to it the resources and authority necessary to properly discharge its duties and responsibilities, including the authority to retain counsel and other experts or consultants.    The Compensation Committee, in performing these duties and responsibilities with respect to director and executive officer compensation, relies on the assistance of professionals within our Human Resources Department. Although the Human Resources Department utilizes survey information provided by compensation consultants in recommending compensation levels, the Compensation Committee has not directly utilized compensation consultants in determining director or executive officer compensation. 
Audit Committee. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined in the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards and under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 10A-3. The Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Fannin, Hunter, McKnight and Meegan qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is used in the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Information with respect to the experience of Messrs. Fannin, Hunter, McKnight and Meegan is included in "—Directors." Our Governance Committee has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our website at www.northwest.com.

[END TABLE]
Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee Charter provides that the Nominating Committee will consist of all independent directors not subject to reelection at the next annual meeting of stockholders. Each member of the Nominating Committee is considered "independent" as defined in the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. Such committee members also must not receive, directly or indirectly, fees in excess of $10,000 per year from us other than fees for service as a director. Our Governance Committee has adopted a written charter for the Nominating Committee, which is available on our website at www.northwest.com. The Nominating Committee of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. met once during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The functions of the Nominating Committee include the following:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conducting an annual performance evaluation of the Committee and annually reviewing the adequacy of its charter  and recommending any proposed changes to the Board of Directors.  
[END TABLE]
 The Nominating Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board of Directors willing to continue in service. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to our business and who are willing to continue in service are first considered for re-nomination, balancing the value of continuity of service by existing members of the Board with that of obtaining a new perspective. In addition, the Committee is authorized by its charter to engage a third party to assist in the identification of director nominees, if it chooses to do so. The Nominating Committee would seek to identify a candidate who, at a minimum, satisfies the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the highest personal and professional ethics and integrity and whose values are compatible with our values;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the capacity and desire to represent the balanced, best interests of our stockholders as a group, and not  primarily a special interest group or constituency.  
[END TABLE]
The Board seeks independent directors who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences that will enhance the quality of the Board's deliberations and decisions. The Board is particularly interested in maintaining a mix that includes active or retired business professionals and senior executives, particularly those with experience in management, operations, finance, accounting, banking, risk management, compliance, information technology, or marketing and sales. As part of its periodic self-assessment process, the Board discusses the diversity of specific skills and characteristics necessary for the optimal functioning of the Board in its oversight of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. over both the short and long term. The Nominating Committee then gives consideration to these specific skill areas or experiences when considering candidates for nomination. Specific qualities or experiences could include matters such as experience in our industry, financial or technological expertise, leadership experience and relevant geographical experience. The effectiveness of the Board's diverse mix of skills and experiences is considered as part of each Board self-assessment. 
In addition to meeting these qualifications, a person is not qualified to serve as a director if he or she: (1) is under indictment for, or has ever been convicted of, a criminal offense involving dishonesty or breach of trust and the penalty for such offense could be imprisonment for more than one year; (2) is a person against whom a banking agency has, within the past ten years, issued a cease and desist order for conduct involving dishonesty or breach of trust and that order is final and not subject to appeal; or (3) has been found either by a regulatory agency whose decision is final and not subject to appeal or by a court to have (i) breached a fiduciary duty involving personal profit or (ii) committed a willful violation of any law, rule or regulation governing banking, securities, commodities or insurance, or any final cease and desist order issued by a banking, securities, commodities or insurance regulatory agency. 
The Nominating Committee will also take into account whether a candidate satisfies the criteria for "independence" under the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards. We have not adopted stock ownership guidelines at this time, although we analyze such guidelines as they relate to "best practices" for corporate governance, and we may adopt such guidelines in the future. 
Although the Board of Directors has not established a specific policy setting forth governance guidelines, the Board of Directors believes that its members are subject to many of the same requirements that would be set forth in such guidelines. These requirements are included in its Code of Ethics and the Nominating Committee Charter and other committee charters. In addition, directors are required to have ongoing education, and the Board of Directors reviews director compensation to confirm the reasonableness of such compensation. 
Procedures for the Recommendation of Director Nominees by Stockholders. The Nominating Committee has adopted procedures for the submission of recommendations for director nominees by stockholders. There have been no material changes to these procedures since they were previously disclosed in Northwest Bancshares, Inc.'s proxy statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If a determination is made that an additional candidate is needed for the Board of Directors, the Nominating Committee will consider candidates submitted by our stockholders. Stockholders can submit the names of qualified candidates for Director by writing to us at 100 Liberty Street, P.O. Box 128, Warren, Pennsylvania 16365, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The Corporate Secretary must receive a submission not less than 180 days prior to the anniversary date of our proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting, which, for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, is no later than September 4, 2019.

Stockholder Communications with the Board. A stockholder of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. who wants to communicate with the Board of Directors or with any individual director can write to: Board of Directors, Northwest Bancshares, Inc., 100 Liberty Street, P.O. Box 128, Warren, Pennsylvania 16365, Attention: Corporate Secretary. The letter should indicate that the author is a stockholder of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and, if shares are not held of record, should include appropriate evidence of stock ownership. Depending on the subject matter, the Corporate Secretary will: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• forward the communication to the director or directors to whom it is addressed; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attempt to handle the inquiry directly, or forward the communication for response by another employee of  Northwest Bancshares, Inc. For example, a request for information about us on a stock-related matter may be forwarded to our Shareholder Relations Officer; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• not forward the communication if it is primarily commercial in nature or relates to an improper or irrelevant  topic.  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Secretary will prepare a general summary of those communications that were not forwarded and provide a summary of activity to the Board of Directors each quarter. 
Policy Regarding Majority Voting 
The Board of Directors has adopted a majority voting policy (the "Policy"), which shall be utilized for the election of any director at any meeting of stockholders for uncontested elections and shall not be applicable for contested elections. For the purpose of the Policy, an "uncontested election" shall mean an election of directors where the only director nominees are those individuals recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company.  Pursuant to the Policy, any incumbent director nominee in an uncontested election who receives a greater number of votes "WITHHELD" than votes cast "FOR" at the stockholders meeting shall promptly tender his or her proposed resignation following certification of the stockholder vote. 
The Nominating Committee will promptly consider the resignation and will recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept the resignation or to take other action, including rejecting the resignation and addressing any apparent underlying causes of the failure of the director to obtain a majority of votes "FOR" such nominee. When considering the resignation and making its recommendation, the Nominating Committee will consider all factors deemed relevant by its members including, without limitation, the underlying reasons for the stockholder's WITHHELD votes for the director (to the extent ascertainable), the length of service and qualifications of the director, the director's contributions to the Company, whether the acceptance or rejection of the resignation will have any adverse affect on the Company's compliance with any applicable law, rule, regulation or governing document, to determine whether the acceptance of the resignation is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Board of Directors will act on the Nominating Committee's recommendation no later than at its first regularly scheduled meeting following certification of the stockholder vote, but in any case, no later than 90 days following the certification of the stockholder vote. 
If a majority of the members of the Nominating Committee are required to tender a resignation at the same election, then the other independent directors will appoint a special board committee amongst themselves solely for the purpose of considering the resignations and will recommend to the Board whether to accept, reject or take other action as to the resignations. 
Attendance at Annual Meetings of Stockholders 
Although we do not have a formal written policy regarding director attendance at annual meetings of stockholders, it is expected that directors will attend these meetings absent unavoidable scheduling conflicts. All of our then-current directors attended our prior year's annual meeting of stockholders. 
Codes of Ethics 
We have adopted a Code of Ethics that is applicable to our directors, officers and employees, including a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers attached thereto. The Code of Ethics is available on our website at www.northwest.com. Amendments to and waivers from the Code of Ethics with respect to directors and executive officers will also be disclosed on our website. 
Audit Committee Report

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Our common stock is registered pursuant to Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The officers and directors of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of our shares of common stock ("10% beneficial owners") are required to file reports on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require disclosure in our Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K of the failure of an officer, director or 10% beneficial owner of the shares of common stock to file a Form 3, 4 or 5 on a timely basis. Based on our review of such ownership reports, we believe that no officer, director   or 10% beneficial owner of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. failed to file such ownership reports on a timely basis for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary. As discussed in greater detail below, our compensation program is specifically designed to provide executives with competitive compensation packages that include elements of both reward and retention. The Compensation Committee routinely reviews our compensation practices to remain market competitive and to ensure that these practices are aligned with our compensation philosophy, regulatory requirements and evolving best practices. Key highlights of our program include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of the Compensation Committee are independent, which ensures that all aspects of the compensation  decision-making process is free from conflicts of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have adopted a clawback policy for bonuses paid to corporate Senior Vice Presidents and "Named Executive  Officers" (as defined in "Executive Compensation") under our Management Bonus Plan, which mitigates risk-taking behavior;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee has reviewed all incentive cash bonus and incentive/variable compensation programs  with respect to risk-taking behavior, which takes into consideration that the safety and soundness of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. is paramount to all compensation incentives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A meaningful portion of our Named Executive Officers' compensation is in the form of short- and long-term  performance-based pay, which reinforces our pay-for-performance philosophy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation packages for Named Executive Officers include an appropriate mix of fixed and variable pay, which  provides executives with both reward and retention incentives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have limited perquisites.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Philosophy. The Compensation Committee has the responsibility for establishing, implementing and monitoring adherence with our overall employee compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee's goal is to ensure that the total compensation paid to all employees, including executive officers, is fair, reasonable and competitive. In this regard, the Compensation Committee has adopted a framework for our compensation program that is intended to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a total compensation program that is aligned with the interests of our stockholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract and retain talent needed to successfully perform in a competitive market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assist in balancing the competing needs of external competitiveness, internal consistency, organizational  economics, management flexibility, ease of understanding and simplicity of administration;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure all employees (including executive officers) receive rewards based on performance and value added to the  organization in an environment built on shared leadership; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• use long-term equity programs to motivate and reward performance that increases our market value over time, align  senior management interests with the organization's strategic business objectives and provide a retention incentive.  
[END TABLE]
At least four times a year, the Compensation Committee meets to review various aspects of our programs with the assistance of our Chief Human Resources Officer. These reviews are intended to assure: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the framework for executive officer compensation supports our business strategy and corporate compensation  philosophy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall compensation package, including the mix of base salary, annual cash bonuses, equity awards,  incentive/variable compensation programs and benefits is competitive; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall program is aligned with stockholders' interests.  
[END TABLE]
Senior management cash compensation is calculated from competitive peer group information to determine base salary and annual cash bonus levels. Cash compensation levels for all positions are established with a goal that the total cash compensation paid for a position will approximate the market median (50th percentile) for fully qualified and experienced employees. See "—Market Comparisons." Market cash compensation is developed using national and/or regional financial industry data for executives and other management employees, and national, as well as regional and/or local pay practices for other employees. Based on the work location, a salary differential may be used if dictated by the local market. 
Compensation Program. Compensation paid to our executive officers for 2018 consisted of performance-based salary, annual cash bonuses, stock option awards and restricted stock awards. An annual cash bonus may be paid to management personnel and is directly related to our performance, with consideration given to our return on average equity, return on average tangible equity, return on average assets, growth in earnings per share, and retail deposit growth as well as the performance of the individual employee. In addition, with the Compensation Committee's approval, substantially all employees, including executive officers, can receive a discretionary holiday bonus ranging from 2% of base compensation for employees with at least three months of service to 5% of base compensation for those with five or more years of service. Additionally, stock benefit awards are granted to motivate and reward individual performance that increases the long-term value of our franchise and provide a retention incentive for key employees. Approximately 400, or 17%, of our employees receive these stock benefit awards. Executive officers participate in the same employee benefit programs generally available to all employees. In addition, Messrs. Wagner, Seiffert, Harvey and Fisher participate in a supplemental retirement plan and Messrs. Harvey and Fisher participate in a senior management life insurance plan. 
Please refer to the "Summary Compensation Table" for compensation information regarding these benefits for 2018. These benefits are aligned with our objective to attract and retain highly qualified management talent for the benefit of all of our stockholders and are considered by the Compensation Committee to be reasonable when compared to industry averages. 
Market Comparisons. In determining Named Executive Officer compensation, we use market information which is supported by survey data from our peer group, as well as from McLagan, an Aon Hewitt company ("McLagan"), a nationally recognized compensation consulting firm. We establish compensation targets for substantially all of our employees so that their total cash compensation opportunity would approximate the market median (50th percentile) for fully qualified and experienced employees. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we used financial services survey data from McLagan in reviewing   compensation for substantially all employees, including executive officers. Two additional surveys, prepared by nationally recognized firms Crowe Horwath and MarshBerry, were used to corroborate the findings from the McLagan survey, but were not used to provide benchmarks with respect to Named Executive Officer compensation. 
McLagan was utilized by Northwest Bancshares, Inc. based on their comprehensive set of reports within the financial services industry. McLagan provides complete compensation coverage for each job position in the financial services industry by extensive analysis of salaries, incentive eligible positions, incentive amounts with regard to base salaries, and total cash compensation. In addition, analysis by company size and geographic location is performed and categorized by jobs based on levels of responsibility and experience. 
The McLagan survey data is based on the following group of companies primarily in the financial services industry. We do not select the companies used by McLagan. Instead, these are the companies that respond to McLagan as part of their survey. 
We also used the following peer group in determining market compensation for our executive officers: 
Community Bank System, Inc. 
First Commonwealth Financial Corporation 
NBT Bancorp, Inc. 
S&T Bancorp, Inc. 
Tompkins Financial Corporation 
WesBanco, Inc. 
The peer group of institutions was selected due to the entities being of like size and operating in similar markets to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 
Base Salary. Substantially all employees receive base salaries determined by the responsibilities, skills, performance, growth and relative experience related to their respective positions. Another factor considered in base salary determination is our competitiveness of total compensation within our markets. It is our goal for fully qualified and experienced employees' total cash compensation to reach the market median (50th percentile) for their position. Specifically, base salaries range between 80% and 120% of the established midpoint (market median) of a salary range. Base salaries above target (midpoint of the salary range) will be limited to those whose performance is "distinguished", "commendable" or "good", which are the top three of four performance categories ("distinguished," "commendable," "good" and "needs improvement"). Employees are eligible for consideration of increases to their base salary as a result of individual performance and salary adjustments for significant changes in their duties and responsibilities. Base salaries are adjusted using a merit increase system and a performance evaluation process that consists of general rating factors. Merit increases are based on the employee's overall performance rating by considering their salary relative to the midpoint, the time interval since the last increase and any added responsibilities since the last salary increase. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors reviews and approves any salary increases for executive officers.  The market median for our Named Executive Officers' base salaries for the year ended December 31, 2018, and their actual base salaries, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer    Market median      Actual base salary   
 Ronald J. Seiffert    $ 791,650        650,000   
 William W. Harvey, Jr.      491,550        416,400   
 Steven G. Fisher      491,550        416,400   
 Michael G. Smelko      335,750        285,000   
 Michael W. Bickerton      305,200        290,300   
[END TABLE]
Increases in base salaries for our Named Executive Officers were based upon their position within their salary range and receiving the following performance ratings, which were the latest ratings available at the time base salaries were determined: Mr. Seiffert – distinguished; Mr. Harvey – distinguished; Mr. Fisher – distinguished; Mr. Smelko – distinguished; and Mr. Bickerton – distinguished. 
Annual Cash Incentive. We provide performance-based cash incentive awards to over 500 eligible management personnel, including executive officers, under the Management Bonus Plan. Cash incentives are used to motivate and reward achievement of corporate and individual performance objectives, while allowing for control of discretionary compensation expenses. Funding for the Management Bonus Plan is based on an assessment of our actual performance relative to the Compensation Committee's pre-established financial performance levels based on a combination of financial factors. For the year ended December 31, 2018, these factors were: return on average assets, return on average equity, return on average tangible equity, growth in earnings per share and retail deposit growth. After the conclusion of the fiscal year, the Chief Executive Officer may suggest that the Compensation Committee consider additional adjustments to discretionary cash incentive awards that fall in line with the long-term advancement of our strategic initiatives. Furthermore, in a business environment where people make the difference, we may consider industry trends for recruitment and retention in determining the level of cash incentives for our professional personnel. 
The Management Bonus Plan sets forth five levels of corporate performance targets, with the lowest level (Level 1) resulting in cash incentive payments to the Named Executive Officers in amounts ranging from no bonus to 10% of base salary, and the highest level (Level 5) resulting in cash incentive payments up to 30% of base salary. The performance targets for Levels 1, 3 and 5, which could result in maximum cash incentive payments of 10%, 20% and 30% of base salary, respectively, are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Bonus level under Management Bonus  Plan 
 Performance measure     Level 1 (10% of base  salary)     Level 3 (20% of base  salary)     Level 5 (30% of base  salary)

[END TABLE]
The target level for bonuses for our Named Executive Officers for the year ended December 31, 2018 (level 3 in the table above), and their actual bonuses, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer    Target bonus (Level 3)      Actual bonus (Level 3)   
 Ronald J. Seiffert    $ 130,000        130,000   
 William W. Harvey, Jr.      83,300        83,300   
 Steven G. Fisher      83,300        83,300

 Michael W. Bickerton      58,100        58,100   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has discretion under the Management Bonus Plan to make adjustments to the overall performance level achieved to include or exclude the effect of extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items, changes in tax or accounting rules or the effect of mergers or acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee adjusted results for impacts related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, when determining the results of the performance measures.  For 2018, operating results (actual results and adjusted for the above-note items) were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance measure    Actual result     Level      Adjusted result     Level   
 Return on Average Assets      1.11%      5        0.98%      3   
 Return on Average Equity      8.61%      2        7.60%      2   
 Return on Average Tangible Equity      11.34%      3        10.40%      3   
 Percentage Growth in Earnings Per Share      10.87%      3        5.88%      —     
 Retail Deposit Growth      1.17%      1        1.17%      1   
[END TABLE]
Based on the performance measurements reviewed, without assigning any specific weightings to any one factor, the Compensation Committee determined, on a discretionary basis, that the management bonus should be paid at Level 3 (maximum of 20% of base salary) for all Named Executive Officers. 
As a condition to receiving an annual performance-based cash incentive award, our named executive officers agree that any award is subject to recovery by us if the executive's actions during that fiscal year that resulted in payment of the award are deemed by the Board of Directors to be illegal, unsafe or unsound or resulted in an elevated risk profile beyond the tolerances established by the Board of Directors. 
Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation. The purpose of our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is to advance the interests of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and its stockholders by providing management and outside directors, upon whose judgment, initiative and efforts the success of our business largely depends, with an additional incentive to perform in a superior manner. The plan was designed to reward seniority as well as longevity and to attract and retain people of experience and ability.  
The 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, in addition to prior stock benefit plans, was approved by stockholders. The intention of the Compensation Committee with respect to the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan is to distribute a total of approximately 3,500,000 stock options and approximately 1,500,000 shares of restricted stock to key employees and directors, with all grants based upon the level of responsibility and performance levels of those eligible. The Compensation Committee determines which executives will receive stock awards as well as type, size and restrictions on the awards. 
In 2018, 895,960 stock options and 414,330 shares of restricted stock were granted under the 2018 plan. These awards vest over seven-years, with the first vesting on the day of the grant. Under the 2018 plan, 2,604,040 stock options and 1,085,670 shares of restricted stock remain available for grant. It is the intention of the Compensation Committee that, under the 2018 plan, the total awards should be distributed over five years. We do not require a minimum holding period for restricted stock awards or shares received upon the exercise of stock options. 
Grants of stock awards to an individual are based primarily on the individual's level of responsibility and their performance. Individual performance is evaluated using certain general elements applicable to all employees, including problem solving, communication, leadership and teamwork, as well as job specific elements. Job specific elements for measuring the individual performance of our Named Executive Officers include the individual's contributions to our operations and performance in the following areas: Mr. Wagner – strategic, operational and profitability considerations; Mr. Seiffert – strategic, operational and profitability considerations; Mr. Fisher – strategic, tactical, administrative and profitability considerations; Mr. Harvey – strategic, financial records/reporting administrative, facilities and profitability considerations; Mr. Smelko – strategic, credit administration, appraising, collections and loan workout, administrative and profitability considerations; and Mr. Bickerton – strategic, commercial lending, administrative and profitability considerations. These performance measures are not quantitative or otherwise measurable targets. Rather, stock award grants are based on the named executive officer's overall performance, which factors in how the officer performed in their areas of responsibility. The same rating system that is used for base salary increases is used to determine grants of stock awards. For the year ended December 31, 2018, each Named Executive Officer was granted awards under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan based upon their "distinguished" individual performance ratings. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, under the 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee granted stock options and shares of restricted stock to employees, with different amounts given for different levels of responsibility within our organization and different performance ratings, based upon the employee's most recent performance review. However, the amounts of stock options and shares of restricted stock that could be received were not determined prior to the beginning of the applicable performance evaluation period. Mr. Wagner and Mr. Seiffert were each awarded 24,000 stock options and 11,250 restricted shares as a result of a "distinguished" performance rating. Similarly, Mr. Harvey and Mr. Fisher were each awarded 15,470 stock options and 7,250 restricted shares as a result of "distinguished" performance ratings. Mr. Smelko and Mr. Bickerton were each awarded 12,480 stock options and 5,850 restricted shares as a result of "distinguished" performance ratings. The Compensation Committee would have granted to the Named Executive Officers 50% fewer awards for a "commendable" rating and no awards had any of these individuals received lower performance ratings.  Employment Agreements/Change in Control Agreements. We have entered into employment agreements with Named Executive Officers Seiffert, Harvey and Fisher and change in control agreements with certain executive officers, including Named Executive Officers Smelko and Bickerton. These agreements are designed to give us the ability to retain the services of the designated executives while reducing, to the extent possible, unnecessary disruptions to our operations. The employment agreements are for a two-year period and the Change in Control Agreements are for a one-year period. The agreements are reviewed for renewal annually by the Compensation Committee and provide for salary and bonus payments as well as additional post-employment benefits, primarily medical and dental benefits, under certain conditions, as defined in the agreements. The agreements were negotiated directly with and recommended for approval by, the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee believes such agreements are common and necessary to retain executive talent. For a discussion of these agreements and the payments that would be received by the Named Executive Officers under certain scenarios with respect to these agreements, see "Employment Agreements/Change in Control Agreements" and "Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers." 
Retirement Plans. Substantially all of our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in our tax-qualified defined benefit plan, which is intended to provide an annual retirement benefit. See "Defined Benefit Plan." We have also adopted a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan for the benefit of those individuals whose benefits under the defined benefit plan are limited by restrictions contained in the Internal Revenue Code. See "—Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan." All of our employees who have attained age 21 are also eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan. However, one year of service and a 1,000 hour eligibility requirement must be met before becoming eligible for the company match. We provide matching contributions equal to 100% of an eligible employee's (an employee with one year of continuous service) 401(k) plan contributions, up to 4% of the employee's eligible, biweekly compensation. 
Tax and Accounting Implications. In consultation with our advisors, we evaluate the tax and accounting treatment of each of our compensation programs at the time of adoption and on an annual basis to ensure that we understand the financial impact of the program. Our analysis includes a detailed review of recently adopted and pending changes in tax and accounting requirements. As part of our review, we consider modifications and/or alternatives to existing programs to take advantage of favorable changes in the tax or accounting environment or to avoid adverse consequences. To preserve maximum flexibility in the design and implementation of our compensation program, we have not adopted a formal policy that requires all compensation to be tax deductible. However, to the greatest extent possible, it is our intent to structure our compensation programs in a tax efficient manner. 
Review of Risk Related to Compensation Policies and Procedures. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors is responsible for the oversight of employee compensation policies and procedures, including the determination of whether any material risk is imposed on Northwest Bancshares, Inc. from the annual cash incentive plan, long-term stock-based compensation plan and/or employment or change in control agreements. After reviewing the compensation policies and procedures, including the determination of whether any incentive/variable compensation programs encourage excessive risk taking by employees, the Compensation Committee has concluded such plans do not pose material risk to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. 
Say-on-Pay. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, we received the following votes with respect to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers: (i) an advisory, non-binding vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in the proxy statement (commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay Vote"), which vote received an overwhelming majority of the votes cast in favor of the proposal; and (ii), an advisory, non-binding vote on the frequency of the Say-on-Pay Vote in the future (the "Frequency Vote"). At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders recommended that we hold a Say-on-Pay Vote on an annual basis. Our Compensation Committee considered the recommendation of the stockholders at our 2017 and 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in reviewing executive compensation and in determining the frequency of future Say-on-Pay Votes, and has determined to include the Say-on-Pay Vote in our proxy materials for each annual meeting of stockholders until the next Frequency Vote, which will occur no later than our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
No Pledging or Hedging Company Securities. We have adopted a policy that prohibits our insiders from (1) pledging Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock as collateral against a loan or line of credit or holding Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock in a margin account; and (2) conducting any hedging activities (including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds) designed to offset any decrease in the market value with respect to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. stock. 
CEO Pay Ratio. As mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the annual total compensation for both the chief executive officer (the "CEO") and the median employee along with the ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation to the median employees annual total compensation. 
We identified the median employee by: (i) obtaining a listing of all employees including active full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees excluding our CEO, Ronald J. Seiffert, as of December 31, 2018, and (ii) ranking the employees by all taxable earnings as of December 31, 2018.  Total compensation for this median employee was determined in the same manner as the "Total Compensation" shown for our CEO in the Summary Compensation Table on page 20. There were no cost-of-living adjustments, full-time equivalent adjustments, or annualization in the calculation of these amounts. As Mr. Seiffert became the CEO during 2018, the total compensation for the CEO disclosed below was determined by annualizing Mr. Seiffert's base salary as CEO. 
In determining the median employee, we included approximately 375 employees who work less than 1,000 hours per year and do not receive the complete line of benefits offered to full-time employees.

(1)  Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock awards granted during the applicable year. The  assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are included in Notes 1(p) and 14(d) to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018,  as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
(2)  Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of option awards granted during the applicable year. The value is  the amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718. The assumptions used in the valuation of these  awards are included in Notes 1(p) and 14(e) to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange  Commission.  
(3)  The change in pension value includes both the value of the benefit earned by the executive during the year as  well as the financial impact of discount rate changes on the prior service benefits earned under the plan. When discount rates decline there is an increase in the value of the prior service benefits and when discount rates increase there is a  decrease in the value of the prior service benefits. For the year ending December 31, 2018, the discount rate used to value plan benefits increased from 3.53% to 4.15% which resulted in a decrease in the value of the prior service benefits.  Messrs. Harvey, Fisher and Smelko had decreases in pension value of $49,275, $22,371 and $26,180, respectively. For the year ending December 31, 2017, the discount rate used to value plan benefits decreased from 4.06% to 3.53%, which resulted  in a significant increase in the value of the prior service benefits and for the year ending December 31, 2016, the discount rate decreased from 4.25% to 4.06%.

Amounts included in the "Stock awards" column for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 represent grants under both our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. Amounts related to stock awards and option awards are reported in the table above pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that require that we report the full grant-date fair value of grants in the year in which such grants are made. Because grants vest (are earned) at a rate between 10% and 15% per year depending on the year of grant, the amounts actually vested and recognized as income on Form W-2 for stock awards granted during the applicable year for Messrs. Wagner, Seiffert, Harvey, Fisher, Smelko and Bickerton were $188,566, $26,676, $17,253, $17,253, $13,936 and $13,936, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. The amounts vested and recognized as income for Messrs. Wagner, Harvey, Fisher, Smelko and Bickerton were $17,145, $11,049, $11,049, $8,915 and $8,915, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $16,324, $10,520, $10,520, $8,488 and $4,251, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Amounts included in the "Option awards" column represent grants under our stock option plans. Stock option grants are not treated as taxable income in the year of grant, so for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the economic value of compensation related to the award of stock options as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 for income tax purposes was $0. 
Amounts listed above in the "Salary" column are paid pursuant to employment agreements or change in control agreements with the Named Executive Officers. See "Employment Agreements/Change in Control Agreements." A portion of the amounts listed in the "Bonus" column reflect a discretionary holiday bonus approved by the Compensation Committee and distributed to substantially all employees. Distribution ranges vary from 0% to 5% of base pay dependent upon tenure with us. Due to their years of service, Messrs. Harvey, Fisher, and Smelko received bonuses equal to 5% of base pay, Mr. Bickerton received 4% of base pay, and Mr. Seiffert received 2% of base pay for the year ended December 31, 2018. Amounts listed in the "Bonus" column also reflect discretionary bonuses paid by the Compensation Committee under the Management Bonus Plan. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Annual Cash Incentive." Amounts listed in the "Change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings" column reflect the aggregate year-to-year change in the actuarial present value of the Named Executive Officer's accrued pension benefit under all qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans based on the assumptions used for FASB ASC 715 at each measurement date. As such, the change reflects changes in value due to an increase or decrease in the FASB ASC 715 discount rate, changes in the mortality table, and changes due to the accrual of plan benefits. 
There were no nonqualified deferred compensation earnings required to be reported because the earnings, if any, were not "above market" as defined in Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, stock options and shares of restricted stock were awarded under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Stock options and shares of restricted stock that are subject to time-based vesting are listed in the columns entitled "All other option awards; number of securities and underlying options" and "All other stock awards; number of shares or units." Awards listed under "Estimated future payouts under equity incentive plan awards" represent the amount of stock options (the first line for each Named Executive Officer) and shares of restricted stock (the second line for each Named Executive Officer) that can be earned as described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation." Each award vests over seven years beginning with the date of grant. Vesting is accelerated in the event of involuntary termination following a change in control of Northwest Bank or Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and in the event of the recipient's death, disability or normal retirement (generally, the attainment of age 65). For a further discussion of grants made for the year ended December 31, 2018, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Long-Term Stock-Based Compensation."  Outstanding Equity Awards at Year End.

Effective December 31, 2005, we suspended the Northwest Savings Bank and Affiliates Upper Managers' Bonus Deferred Compensation Plan. Under this plan, certain employees of Northwest Bank were eligible to defer all or part of their annual management incentive bonus. Interest is credited to a participant's deferred compensation account at the annual earnings rate paid on Northwest Bank's five-year certificates of deposit, calculated as of the end of the preceding fiscal year. The interest rate paid for 2018 was 0.90%. Under this plan, participants could elect to receive either a lump-sum payment or approximately equal monthly installments over a period of up to 10 years, with payment commencing upon the earlier of specified events selected by the participant, including retirement, voluntary resignation, involuntary termination, death, disability, reaching a certain age or on a date selected by the participant. Mr. Wagner is the only Named Executive Officer who participates in this plan.  Employment Agreements/Change in Control Agreements 
Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank are parties to a two-year employment agreement with each of Messrs. Seiffert, Harvey and Fisher. On each anniversary date the contracts may be renewed for an additional year, and a contract that is not renewed expires twelve months following the anniversary date. Under the agreements, the base salaries of Messrs. Seiffert, Harvey and Fisher of $650,000, $416,400 and $416,400, respectively, are reviewed annually and may be increased but not decreased. In the event Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank terminates their employment for reasons other than for "just cause" (as defined in the agreement), or if they resign due to "good reason" (as defined in the agreement), with or without a "change in control" (as defined in the agreement), within 30 days after the executive's termination of employment, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank (or any successor) will pay the executive a cash lump sum equal to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  the sum of three times his highest rate of base salary and three times his highest rate of cash bonus paid  during the prior three years, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  continuation of medical and dental coverage for 36 months from the date of termination, unless they obtain  similar benefits from their new employer.  
[END TABLE]
To the extent necessary, in order to avoid penalties under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, the base salary and bonus amount shall be paid in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination.    During the employment term and thereafter, the executive shall be indemnified and covered under a standard directors' and officers' liability insurance policy provided by Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with or arising out of any action in which the executive may have been involved by reason of his having been a director or officer of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank, including judgments, court costs, attorneys fees and settlements approved by the Compensation Committee. However, such indemnification does not apply to matters where the executive is adjudged liable for willful misconduct in performing his duties. All payments under any of the agreements will be made by Northwest Bank, but if not timely paid, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. shall make such payments. The agreements are binding on successors to Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank. 
Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank are parties to a one-year change in control agreement with each of Messrs. Smelko and Bickerton (the "executives"), under which the executives serve as executive officers of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank. On each anniversary date a contract may be renewed for an additional year, and if it is not renewed it expires on the anniversary date. Under the agreement, each of the executive's current base salary is reviewed annually and may be increased but not decreased. As of July 1, 2018, Mr. Smelko's base salary was $285,000 and Mr. Bickerton's base salary was $290,300. In the event of a "change of control" (as defined in the agreement), and if, within 24 months after the change in control, the executive either resigns due to "good reason" (as defined in the agreement) or is involuntarily terminated other than for "just cause," (as defined in the agreement) within 30 days after the executive's termination of employment, Northwest Bancshares, Inc. or Northwest Bank (or any successor) will pay the executive a cash lump sum equal to the sum of three times the executive's highest rate of base salary and three times their highest rate of cash bonus paid to him during the prior three years. Northwest Bank would also continue the executive's medical and dental coverage for 36 months from the date of termination, unless the executive obtains similar benefits from his new employer. To the extent necessary in order to avoid penalties under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, the base salary and bonus amount shall be paid in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination. 
The following provisions apply to all of the agreements. If the executive's employment is terminated for "just cause", no further compensation or benefits shall be paid under the agreements and all unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock awarded to the executive, as well as all unexercised stock options, shall be immediately forfeited. Any payments to the executive would be reduced, if necessary, so as not to be an "excess parachute payment" as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 280G (relating to payments made in connection with a change in control). If the executive becomes disabled (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A), Northwest Bank may terminate the agreement but will pay the executive his then-current base salary for the longer of the remaining term of the agreement or one year, reduced by the amount of any disability insurance, workers' compensation or social security benefits paid to the executive. If the executive dies during the term of the agreement, Northwest Bank shall continue to pay their then-current base salary for one year and shall provide medical and dental benefits for the executive's eligible dependents for three years after the executive's death, at generally the same level as Northwest Bank was providing such benefits at the time of the executive's death. 
Potential Payments to Named Executive Officers 
The following tables show potential payments that would be made to the Named Executive Officers upon specified events, assuming such events occurred on December 31, 2018, pursuant to each individual's employment or change in control agreement, pursuant to stock benefits that have been granted under our equity incentive plans and pursuant to our policies with respect to health care and other benefits continuation. All of the payments are subject to reduction under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code, however, the amounts set forth below have not been adjusted for such reductions. For a discussion of additional benefits   that would be paid to the Named Executive Officers or their beneficiaries upon various termination scenarios, see "—Defined Benefit Plan," "—Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan," and "—Life Insurance Coverage."

Defined Benefit Plan 
Northwest Bank maintains the Northwest Bank Pension Plan (Retirement Plan) covering substantially all employees who satisfy the eligibility requirements of age 21 and the completion of one year of service. The plan is noncontributory and funded by the employer. Northwest Bank annually contributes an amount necessary to at least satisfy the actuarially determined minimum funding requirements under Section 430 of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). For the plan year ended December 31, 2018, there was not a required contribution but the Bank elected to contribute $2.0 million to maintain a well-funded position. 
The benefits under the plan are payable on the participants normal retirement date which is age 65 and the completion of five years of service. Benefits are computed using the plan formula, base pay and years of credited service. Upon retirement, benefits are payable as a lifetime annuity and the participant has the option to select from several choices of actuarially equivalent benefits. Early retirement is available as early as age 55 with the completion of five years of service or any time after the completion of 25 years of service but the benefit is reduced on an actuarial basis to account for early payment. 
The plan formula for employees hired prior to January 1, 2008, and applicable to their service up through March 31, 2013 was 1.6% of five-year average monthly base pay plus 0.6% of average monthly base pay in excess of covered compensation (35 year average of the maximum taxable wage bases) multiplied by credited service up to a maximum of 25 years. The formula also provided an additional benefit equal to 0.6% of five-year average monthly base pay multiplied by credited service between 25 years and 35 years. The benefits computed under this formula were frozen effective March 31, 2013 and a new formula was adopted. Messrs. Wagner, Fisher, Harvey and Smelko completed service prior to March 31, 2013 and earned a portion of their pension benefit under this formula. 
For service commencing January 1, 2013, which includes all Named Executive Officers, additional benefits for all participants under the plan will be earned equal to 1% of eligible base pay for each calendar year that a participant completes at least 1,000 hours of service.  The accrued annual pension benefit as of December 31, 2018 for Messrs. Seiffert, Harvey, Fisher, Smelko and Bickerton were $2,750, $92,972, $136,965, $55,303 and $8,074, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Fisher qualified for early retirement under the Retirement Plan. If Mr. Fisher had retired on December 31, 2018, and began receiving benefit payments immediately upon retirement, his annual pension benefit would have been $108,791. Mr. Wagner retired, effective November 1, 2018, and is receiving $126,181 on an annual basis from the pension plan. Mr. Wagner elected to receive his benefit on an actuarially reduced basis in the form of a joint and 75% to spouse annuity. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
Northwest Bank has adopted a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan ("SERP") for certain participants in Northwest Bank's Retirement Plan whose benefits are limited by Section 415(b) of the Internal Revenue Code (which limits the amount of annual benefits that may be accrued to fund future benefit payments) or Section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code (which places a limitation on compensation taken into account for tax-qualified plan purposes; for 2018, that limit was $275,000). The SERP provides the designated executives with retirement benefits generally equal to the difference between the benefit that would be available under the Retirement Plan but for the limitations imposed by Internal Revenue Code Sections 401(a)(17) and 415(b) and that which is actually funded under the Retirement Plan as a result of the limitations. 
Participants must elect the method of payment. Options for payment include a lump sum, three substantially equal annual installments, or five substantially equal annual installments, starting within 30 days of the earliest of the following events: the participant's death, disability, retirement or a change in control, provided, however, that if the participant is a specified employee under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, distribution following retirement must be delayed for six months. The SERP is considered an unfunded plan for tax and ERISA purposes. All obligations arising under the SERP are payable from the general assets of Northwest Bank. The benefits paid under the SERP supplement the benefits paid by the Retirement Plan. 
The accrued annual pension benefit as of December 31, 2018 for Messrs. Wagner, Seiffert, Harvey and Fisher were $174,654, $2,994, $6,141 and $6,782, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Fisher qualified for early retirement under the SERP. If Mr. Fisher had retired on December 31, 2018 and began receiving benefit payments immediately upon retirement, his annual pension benefit would have been $5,387. Mr. Wagner retired, effective November 1, 2018, and elected to receive the value of his SERP benefit in three installments. The first installment will be payable May 1, 2019 in the amount of $838,972. The subsequent two installments will be credited with interest until the date of payment based on the rate payable on Northwest Bank Certificate of Deposit with a five-year term. 
Life Insurance Coverage 
Northwest Bank generally provides group term life insurance to its employees. The amount of eligible life insurance coverage is a multiple of their base salary up to a maximum of $700,000 or flat dollar amount based on their job classification. Pay grade level or job classification determines the flat dollar amount or multiple used. The first $50,000 of group term life insurance coverage is a non-taxable benefit each year. 
Certain select senior officers participate in a Senior Managers' Life Insurance Plan. This plan is designed to allow the participant to waive an equal amount of coverage in the group term life insurance plan in order to purchase a whole life insurance plan using their own funds in conjunction with the amount Northwest Bank would have spent for the individual's group term premium expense. The benefit then becomes a split dollar arrangement. The officer's coverage is provided through two sources: the group term life insurance plan, which has a carve-out provision funded by bank-owned life insurance, and an individual policy owned by the executive. The Senior Managers' Life Insurance Plan thus gives participants a means to obtain post-retirement life insurance that is not available through the group term life plan. 
Under Northwest Bank's life insurance plans, the pre-retirement death benefit amount is determined as a flat dollar amount or a multiple of the employee's annual base salary rounded up to the next $1,000. Multiples range from 200% to 500% based on pay grade levels. The Named Executives Officers are all eligible for the highest multiple of 500% or maximum of $700,000. The group term life insurance plan does not have a post-retirement death benefit provision. Messrs. Harvey and Fisher participate in the Senior Managers' Life Insurance Plan, giving them the option to continue their individual policies into retirement. As of December 31, 2018, the pre-retirement death benefit amounts from the Northwest Bank plan were as follows: $700,000 for Mr. Seiffert; $150,000 for Mr. Harvey; $50,000 for Mr. Fisher; $700,000 for Mr. Smelko and $700,000 for Mr. Bickerton. No death benefit was payable to Mr. Wagner as of December 31, 2018, as his death benefit terminated when he retired in 2018. 
The federal income tax treatment and the annual economic benefit realized by each Named Executive Officer vary depending on the amount of life insurance in the Northwest Bank plan and the Senior Managers' Life Insurance Plan. The specific arrangement with each Named Executive Officer is discussed below. 
The premiums paid by Northwest Bank for the Named Executive Officers for life insurance coverage during 2018 totaled $18,296 consisting of the following premiums: $83 for Mr. Wagner; $1,386 for Mr. Seiffert; $3,939 for Mr. Harvey; $10,116 for  Mr. Fisher; $1,386 for Mr. Smelko and $1,386 for Mr. Bickerton. However, the imputed economic benefit for this life insurance coverage during 2018 was as follows: $31,147 for Mr. Wagner; $22,374 for Mr. Seiffert; $3,496 for Mr. Harvey; $10,186 for Mr. Fisher; $3,667 for Mr. Smelko and $7,084 for Mr. Bickerton. The imputed economic benefit to the Named Executive Officers of the 2018 premium payments is included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table and is described in a footnote to that column for each Named Executive Officer. The amount of such economic benefit was determined using the amount imputed to the individual under applicable tables published by the Internal Revenue Service multiplied by the aggregate death benefit payable to the individual's beneficiary.  Director Compensation 
The following table sets forth for the year ended December 31, 2018 certain information as to the total remuneration to Northwest Bancshares, Inc.'s directors. Messrs. Wagner and Seiffert did not receive separate compensation for their service as a director.

Amounts included in the "Stock Awards" column for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent the value of current year grants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Amounts related to stock awards and option awards are reported in the table above pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission regulations that require that we report the full grant-date fair value of grants in the year in which such grants are made. Because grants vest (are earned) at a rate of approximately 1/7th per year beginning May 14, 2018, the amounts actually vested and recognized as income was $6,470 for each director who had received such grants. Amounts included in the "Option awards" column for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent the value of current year grants under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan. Stock option grants are not treated as taxable income in the year of grant, so for the year ended December 31, 2018, the economic value of compensation related to the award of stock options recognized for income tax purposes was $0. The amount included in the "Change in pension value and nonqualified deferred compensation earnings" column reflects the change in the estimated present value of future benefits under our pension plans as well as the amount of interest paid on deferred compensation over the applicable federal rate.

The full board of directors determines director compensation. In determining director compensation, we utilize market information that is provided by our Chief Human Resources Officer, which is supported by survey data from various sources. 
For the year ended December 31, 2018, each nonemployee director of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank was paid a combined retainer of $22,600 per year plus $1,000 for each board meeting of Northwest Bank and Northwest Bancshares, Inc. attended. Non-employee members of the Executive, Compensation, Compliance, Trust, Audit, Risk Management, Nominating and Governance Committees were paid a total of $700 for attendance at committee meetings for both Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank. The Chairperson of the Compensation, Compliance, Trust, Audit and Risk Management committees were paid an additional $1,000 per quarter as a retainer for their service as Chairperson with the Chairperson of the Nominating Committee receiving $1,000 per year and the Chairperson of the Governance Committee receiving $2,000 per year. Director Tredway received a fee of $8,000 for his service as Lead Director for Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and Northwest Bank. All Chairman and Lead director fees are prorated based on service period during the year. 
Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors. We sponsor a non-qualified deferred compensation plan for directors (the "Deferred Compensation Plan") that enables a director to elect to defer all or a portion of their directors' fees. The amounts deferred are credited with interest at the taxable equivalent rate received by Northwest Bank on its bank owned life insurance policies that insure the directors' lives. Deferred amounts are payable upon retirement of a director on or after attaining age 59-1/2 but no later than age 72, in the form of a lump sum or installments over a three, five or ten year period. Payments to a director, or to their designated beneficiary, may also be made from the Deferred Compensation Plan upon the director's death, total and permanent disability, or termination of service from the Board. Participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan would not recognize taxable income with respect to the Deferred Compensation Plan benefits until the assets are actually distributed. Active directors are provided between $110,500 and $200,000 of term life coverage through our group life insurance policy. Coverage is subject to standard age reductions starting at age 65. 
Retirement Plan for Directors. We maintain a retirement plan for outside directors (the "Directors Plan"). Directors who have served on the Board for five years or more and are not Northwest Bank employees are eligible to receive benefits under the Directors Plan. Upon a director's retirement from the Board on or after five years of service and the attainment of age 60, the director is entitled to receive a retirement benefit equal to 60% of the annual retainer paid immediately prior to retirement plus 60% of the board meeting fees paid for the director's attendance at board meetings at the annual rate which was in effect immediately prior to his retirement. If a director retires after five years or more of service but before attaining age 60, the director is entitled to one-half of the benefits otherwise available to him or her. Retirement benefits commence on the first day of the calendar quarter following the director's attainment of age 65, or if retirement occurs later, on the first day of the calendar quarter following retirement. Such retirement benefits are paid for a period equal to the lesser of the number of a director's completed full years of service, his or her life, or ten years. In the event the director dies before normal retirement age or after normal retirement age but before all retirement benefits to which he is entitled have been received, the director's beneficiary or estate shall be paid a lump sum equal to the present value of the benefits that would have been paid had the director lived until all accrued retirement benefits had been paid. The retirement plan for outside directors was amended to freeze all benefits earned through December 31, 2012 based on the plan formula using years of service and a director's compensation as of December 31, 2012. The amendments also provide that, for service commencing January 1, 2013, additional benefits will be earned equal to 1.25% of career average fees   paid in cash for each year in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized expense of $109,966 for the Directors Plan. 
Directors Equity Awards. Options granted under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan vest over a seven-year period. All nonstatutory options granted under the plan expire upon the earlier of ten years from the date of grant or, up to one year following the date the optionee ceases to be a director. However, in the event of termination of service due to death, disability, normal retirement or a change of control of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., nonstatutory options may be exercised for up to ten years from the date of grant. 
Restricted shares granted under our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan vest over a seven-year period, with the first vesting on the day of grant. However, all awards will vest at the earlier of age 72 plus five years of service or upon a change in control, death or disability. All unvested awards will expire upon voluntary or involuntary termination before age 72. Dividends are paid on the unvested restricted stock and participants can vote the unvested restricted stock pursuant to the the plans. 
Transactions With Certain Related Persons 
Federal law requires that all loans or extensions of credit to executive officers and directors must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with the general public and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Federal regulations adopted under this law permit executive officers and directors to receive the same terms that are widely available to other employees as long as the director or executive officer is not given preferential treatment compared to the other participating employees. Northwest Bank offers its employees interest rate discounts of generally up to 50 basis points off their Agency rates on loans made by Northwest Bank to such persons for personal use. Our policy is that extensions of credit to any insider will be approved in advance by a majority vote of the Board of Directors if the aggregate of all extensions of credit to that insider and related interests exceeds $500,000 or 5% of Northwest Bank's unimpaired capital and surplus, whichever is less. Also, all extensions of credit made to executive officers will be promptly reported to the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. Except for the interest rate discount described above, loans to our current directors, principal officers, nominees for election as directors, security holders known by us to own more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, or associates of such persons (together, "specified persons"), are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Northwest Bank, and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
The following table sets forth loans made by Northwest Bank to its directors and executive officers where the largest amount of all indebtedness outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2018 and all amounts of interest payable during the year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded $120,000, and where the borrowers received interest rate discounts, as described above. These loans have otherwise been made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with persons not related to Northwest Bank, and do not involve more than normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features.

In addition, any business transactions between Northwest Bank and any Director or Executive Officer are reviewed to ensure they are both competitive and at terms that are at least as preferable for Northwest Bank as could be received in an arms-length transaction. Any such transactions are then reported to the Board of Directors, or committee thereof.  PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018 was KPMG LLP. Our Audit Committee has approved the engagement of KPMG LLP to be our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, subject to the ratification of the engagement by our stockholders. At the Annual Meeting, the stockholders will consider and vote on the ratification of the engagement of KPMG LLP for the year ending December 31, 2019. A representative of KPMG LLP is expected to attend the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if he or she so desires. 
Even if the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such change is in the best interest of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. and its stockholders. 
Set forth below is certain information concerning aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by KPMG LLP during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. 
The aggregate fees included in the Audit Fees category were fees agreed to be billed for the fiscal years for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of our quarterly financial statements. The aggregate fees included in each of the other categories were fees billed in the stated periods. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees    $ 1,024,850        995,000   
 Audit-Related Fees      26,000        125,735   
 All Other Fees      45,000        256,294   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were for professional services rendered for the audits of our consolidated financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting, review of the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the internal controls attestation required under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. 
Audit-Related Fees. Audit-related fees for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were for procedures performed with respect to student lending, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development programs and consent letters. Such fees are reasonably related to the performance of the audit of and review of the financial statements and are not already reported in "Audit Fees," above. 
All Other Fees. Other fees for the year ended December 31, 2018 were for assistance related to the implementation of new accounting pronouncements. 
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services, which relate primarily to guidance on the implementation of new accounting standards, is compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee concluded that performing such services does not affect the independence of KPMG LLP in performing its function as our independent registered public accounting firm. 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, either by approving an engagement prior to the engagement or pursuant to a pre-approval policy with respect to particular services. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee when expedition of services is necessary. The independent registered public accounting firm and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in accordance with this pre-approval, and the fees for the services performed to date. All audit-related fees, tax fees and all other fees described above were approved either as part of our engagement of KPMG LLP or pursuant to the pre-approval policy described above. 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL 3 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The compensation of our Named Executive Officers is described in "PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "—Executive Compensation." Stockholders are urged to read these sections of this Proxy Statement, which discuss our compensation policies and procedures with respect to our Named Executive Officers. 
Stockholders will be asked at the Annual Meeting to provide their support with respect to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers by voting on the following advisory, non-binding resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Northwest Bancshares, Inc.'s Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Item 402 of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
This advisory vote, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" advisory vote, is non-binding on the Board of Directors. Although non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee value constructive dialogue on executive compensation and other important governance topics with our stockholders and encourage all stockholders to vote their shares on this matter. The Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation. 
Unless otherwise instructed, validly executed proxies will be voted "FOR" this resolution. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the resolution set forth in Proposal 3. 
ADVANCE NOTICE OF BUSINESS TO BE CONDUCTED AT AN ANNUAL MEETING 
Our Bylaws provide an advance notice procedure for certain business, or nominations to the Board of Directors, to be brought before an annual meeting of stockholders. In order for a stockholder to properly bring business before an annual meeting, or to nominate a candidate for the Board of Directors, our Secretary must receive written notice not earlier than the 90th day nor later than the 80th day prior to date of the annual meeting; provided, however, that in the event that less than 90 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of the annual meeting is provided to stockholders, then, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be so received not later than the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. 
The notice with respect to stockholder proposals that are not nominations for director must set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting: (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (ii) the name and address of such stockholder as they appear on Northwest Bancshares, Inc.'s books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; (iii) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; (iv) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in such business; and (v) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting. 
The notice with respect to director nominations must include (i) as to each individual whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election as a director, (A) all information relating to such person that would indicate such person's qualification under Article 2, Section 12 of our Bylaws, including an affidavit that such person would not be disqualified under the provisions of Article 2, Section 12 of the Bylaws and (B) all other information relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any successor rule or regulation; and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice, (A) the name and address of such stockholder as they appear on our books and of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is made; (B) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of Northwest Bancshares, Inc. which are owned beneficially or of record by such stockholder and such beneficial owner; (C) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and each proposed nominee and any other person or persons (including their names) pursuant to which the nomination(s) are to be made by such stockholder; (D) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice; and (E) any other information relating to such stockholder that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act or any successor rule or regulation. Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. 
The 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected to be held April 22, 2020. Accordingly, advance written notice for certain business, or nominations to the Board of Directors, to be brought before the next annual meeting must be received by   our Secretary no earlier than January 23, 2020 and no later than February 2, 2020. If notice is received prior to January 23, 2020 or after February 2, 2020 it will be considered untimely, and we will not be required to present the matter at the stockholders meeting. 
Nothing in this Proxy Statement shall be deemed to require us to include in our proxy statement and proxy relating to an annual meeting any stockholder proposal that does not meet all of the requirements for inclusion established by the Securities and Exchange Commission in effect at the time such proposal is received. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
In order to be eligible for inclusion in our proxy materials for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, any stockholder proposal to take action at such meeting must be received at our executive office, 100 Liberty Street, Warren, Pennsylvania 16365, no later than November 14, 2019.

ONLINE DELIVERY OF PROXY AND OTHER MATERIALS
