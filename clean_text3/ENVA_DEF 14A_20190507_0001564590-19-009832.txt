PROXY STATEMENT
FOR
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
General Information
We are furnishing this proxy statement to you in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our Board of Directors (Board) for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Annual Meeting), to be held at 175 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604 on the 4th floor, at 9:30 a.m., Central Time, on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, and at any reconvened meeting following any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. Our telephone number is (312) 568-4200, and our mailing address is 175 West Jackson Blvd., Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Our website address is www.enova.com. Information on our website is not a part of this proxy statement. When used in this proxy statement, the terms we, us, our, the Company or Enova refer to Enova International, Inc. and, unless the context requires otherwise, its subsidiaries.
We began mailing the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice) to the record holders of our Common Stock on or about March 28, 2019.
The Company's annual report to stockholders (Annual Report) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (fiscal year 2018), which includes the Company's 2018 audited consolidated financial statements, is a part of our proxy materials being made available to you. Questions and Answers
Why did I receive these materials?
These materials are being provided to you in connection with our Board's solicitation of proxies for use at the Annual Meeting. As a Stockholder, you are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and to vote in person or by proxy on the proposals described in this proxy statement.
What is included in the proxy materials?
The proxy materials include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 
• this proxy statement; and 
• our Annual Report. 
[END TABLE]
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a full set of printed proxy materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), we are making this proxy statement and our Annual Report available to Stockholders electronically on the Internet. On or about March 28, 2019, we began mailing the Notice to Stockholders of record as of the record date. Holders of our Common Stock will be able to access the proxy materials on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or request printed copies of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet or request a printed copy are found in the Notice. We believe this electronic process will expedite your receipt of the proxy materials and reduce the cost and environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. We also encourage you to have all your accounts registered in the same name and address by contacting our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., at (800) 884‑4225 or at www.computershare.com/contactus.
What am I voting on?
Our Board is soliciting your vote for:
Proposal 1: the election of eight members of our Board named in this proxy statement for a one-year term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;
Proposal 2: a non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement; and
Proposal 3: ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 (fiscal year 2019).
What are the Board's voting recommendations?
Our Board recommends you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of the eight directors for a one-year term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (Proposal 1); 
• FOR the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 2); and 
• FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 (Proposal 3). 
[END TABLE]
 How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?
The Notice provides you with instructions on how to view the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet. The website on which you can view our proxy materials will also allow you to elect to receive future proxy materials electronically by email, which will save us the cost of printing and mailing materials to you. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email next year with instructions and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you revoke it.
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
Stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 18, 2019 (record date) will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting or any reconvened meeting following any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting.
How many votes do I have?
On the record date, there were 33,689,863 shares of Common Stock (exclusive of treasury shares) outstanding. Each Stockholder is entitled to one vote for each outstanding share of Common Stock held as of the record date.
We refer to the total number of votes represented by our outstanding Common Stock as our total voting power. As of the record date, our Stockholders held 100% of the total voting power entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
What is the difference between holding Common Stock as a holder of record and as a beneficial owner?
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Common Stock of Record. If your Common Stock is registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., you are considered the Stockholder of record of those shares of Common Stock, and we sent the Notice directly to you. 
• Beneficial Owner of Common Stock. If your Common Stock is held in an account at a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are the beneficial owner of the Common Stock, and the Notice was sent directly to you. The nominee holding your account is considered the Stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your nominee on how to vote the Common Stock held in your account. 
[END TABLE]
What is the quorum required for the Annual Meeting?
A majority of our total voting power outstanding on the record date must be present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.
If I am a Stockholder of record, how do I vote?
There are four ways to vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. If you are a Stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. We will give you a ballot when you arrive. 
• On the Internet. You may vote by proxy on the Internet by following the instructions in the Notice. 
• By telephone. You may vote by proxy on the telephone by following the instructions in the Notice or by calling the toll-free number on the proxy card. 
• By mail. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by marking, signing and dating the proxy card and returning it in the envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
 If you are voting on the Internet, by telephone or by returning an executed proxy card, your vote or proxy card must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 6, 2019 to be counted.
If I am a beneficial owner of Common Stock held in street name, how do I vote?
There are four ways to vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. If you are a beneficial owner of Common Stock held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your Common Stock. Please contact your broker, bank or other nominee for instructions on obtaining a proxy. 
• On the Internet. You may give your voting instructions to your nominee on the Internet by following the instructions on the voting instruction form. 
• By telephone. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may give your voting instructions to your nominee by calling the toll-free number on the voting instruction form. 
• By mail. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by completing the voting instruction form and mailing it back in the envelope provided. 
[END TABLE]
If you are voting on the Internet, by telephone or by returning an executed voting instruction form, your vote or voting instruction form must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 6, 2019 to be counted.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholders of Record. If you are a Stockholder of record and you indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by our Board, or if you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your Common Stock in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders determine in their discretion on any other matters properly presented at the Annual Meeting. 
• Beneficial Owners of Common Stock. If you are a beneficial owner of Common Stock and do not provide the nominee that holds your Common Stock with specific voting instructions, the nominee may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If your nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your Common Stock on a non-routine matter, it will not have authority to vote your Common Stock on that matter. This is generally referred to as a broker non-vote. When our Inspector of Election tabulates the votes for any particular matter, broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the existence of a quorum, but will not be treated as votes cast for or against the matter. We encourage you to provide voting instructions to the nominee that holds your Common Stock by carefully following the instructions provided in the Notice or voting instruction form. 
[END TABLE]
Which proposals are considered routine or non-routine?
Proposal 3 (ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP) is considered a routine matter.
Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 2 (non-binding advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation) are considered non-routine matters.
What happens if other business is brought before the Annual Meeting?
Management does not know of any business to be transacted at the Annual Meeting other than the matters described in this proxy statement. However, if any other matters do properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the shares represented by the proxies in the accompanying form will be voted by the proxy holders as  recommended by the Board or, if no recommendation is given, in accordance with the best judgment of the person voting the proxies.
What vote is required to approve each proposal?
The following table describes the voting requirement for each proposal:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal 1     Election of eight directors for a one-year term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders      Each director must be elected by an affirmative majority of the shares voted. This means the number of votes cast by Stockholders FOR the director must exceed the number of votes cast as WITHHOLD for the director. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for this proposal. 
 Proposal 2     Advisory vote on named executive officer compensation      This proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. This means that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, a majority of them must be voted FOR the proposal for it to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST this proposal, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for this proposal. 
 Proposal 3     Ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019      This proposal must be approved by the affirmative vote of the majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the matter. This means that of the shares represented at the meeting and entitled to vote, a majority of them must be voted FOR the proposal for it to be approved. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote AGAINST this proposal, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote for this proposal. 
[END TABLE]
What happens if a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast?
If a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, he or she is required to promptly tender a resignation to the Board after the certification of the election results. The remaining directors on the Board will then determine, in accordance with procedures established by such directors, or a committee designated by such directors, whether to accept or reject the resignation or take any other action within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. If such director's resignation is not accepted by the remaining directors on the Board, such director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is duly elected or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation is accepted by the remaining directors on the Board, then such directors, in their sole discretion, may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board.
What is the effect of the advisory vote?
As an advisory vote, Proposal 2 is not binding on our Board or the Management Development and Compensation Committee (Compensation Committee). However, we value your opinion on this important issue. Our Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering our executive compensation programs, appreciates support for its compensation philosophy and will consider the results of the advisory vote on Proposal 2 when making future executive compensation decisions.
Can I change my vote after I have voted?
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before your vote is due, which deadline includes the final vote at the Annual Meeting if you have the right to vote in person. You may vote again on a later date on the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the applicable deadline will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person if you have the right to vote in person. Mere attendance at the  Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting or specifically request in writing that your prior proxy be revoked.
How will my proxy be voted?
Common Stock represented by a properly executed proxy (in paper form, by internet or telephone) that is received in a timely manner, and not subsequently revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof in the manner directed on the proxy. David Fisher and Sean Rahilly (our General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer & Secretary) are named as proxies in the proxy form and have been designated by the Board as the directors' proxies to represent you and vote your Common Stock at the Annual Meeting. All Common Stock represented by a properly executed proxy on which no choice is specified will be voted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)  FOR the election of the eight directors named in this proxy statement for a one-year term to expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders; 
    (2)  FOR the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers; and 
    (3)  FOR ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Is my vote confidential?
We will handle proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual Stockholders in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed within or outside our Company, except:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; 
• to allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; and 
• to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation. 
[END TABLE]
Occasionally, Stockholders provide written comments on their proxy cards. These may be forwarded to management or our Board.
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?
The preliminary voting results may be announced at the Annual Meeting and will be promptly announced after the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the Inspector of Election for the Annual Meeting and announced in a current report on Form 8-K or quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC within four business days after the final voting results are known.
Who is paying the cost of this proxy solicitation?
We are paying the cost of soliciting proxies. We must pay brokerage firms and other persons representing beneficial owners of Common Stock their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners who specifically request them and obtaining voting instructions from those beneficial owners.
In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, members of our Board and our officers and employees may solicit proxies on our behalf, without additional compensation, personally or by telephone. We may also solicit proxies by email from Stockholders who are our employees or who have previously requested electronic receipt of proxy materials.
Do I have dissenters' rights of appraisal?
The Delaware General Corporation Law does not provide dissenters' rights of appraisal to the Stockholders in connection with any proposal described in this proxy statement. Who can help answer my questions?
If you have questions concerning a proposal or the Annual Meeting, if you would like additional copies of this proxy statement, or if you need directions to or special assistance at the Annual Meeting, please contact our Secretary, Sean Rahilly, at (312) 568-4200 or by mail at 175 West Jackson Blvd., Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60604. In addition, information regarding the Annual Meeting is available via the internet at the website www.proxyvote.com. Stockholder Proposals and Communications with our Board
Proposals
Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), provides that we must receive stockholders' proposals intended for presentation at the 2020 annual meeting of our stockholders (2020 Annual Meeting) by November 29, 2019 to be eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for the 2020 Annual Meeting. For other business (other than director nominations) to be properly brought before a stockholder meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to our Secretary and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action. To be timely, a stockholder's notice relating to business proposed to be conducted at the 2020 Annual Meeting must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than seventy (70) days nor more than one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting. In the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date then to be timely such notice must be received by the Company on or before the later of (i) seventy (70) days prior to the date of the meeting or (ii) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made.
Director Nominations
Stockholders who wish to nominate qualified candidates for election to our Board may notify our Secretary in accordance with our Bylaws at Enova International, Inc., 175 West Jackson Blvd., Chicago, Illinois 60604. Each Stockholder nomination must provide the information required by the nomination notice provision of our Bylaws, including certain information relating to the candidate that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act (including such candidate's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected) and information relating to the proposing stockholder.
To be timely, a stockholder's notice relating to nominations to be made at the 2020 Annual Meeting must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Company not less than seventy (70) days nor more than one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the 2019 Annual Meeting. In the event that the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is advanced more than thirty (30) days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than sixty (60) days after such anniversary date then to be timely such notice must be received by the Company on or before the later of (i) seventy (70) days prior to the date of the meeting or (ii) the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the meeting was made.
Communication with the Board
We encourage any Stockholder or any other interested party who desires to communicate with our Board about the holder's views and concerns to do so by writing our Secretary at Enova International, Inc., 175 West Jackson Blvd., Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60604. Our Secretary will ensure that the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receives your correspondence.
Householding of Proxy Materials
Some brokers, banks and other nominee record holders may participate in the practice of householding stockholder materials, such as proxy statements, information statements and annual reports. This means only one copy of the proxy materials may have been sent to multiple Stockholders in your household. To obtain a separate copy of the proxy materials, contact our Secretary, Sean Rahilly, at (312) 568-4200 or by mail at 175 West Jackson Blvd., Suite 1000, Chicago, Illinois 60604. If you wish to receive separate copies of proxy materials in the future, or if you are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive a single copy for your household, you should contact your broker, bank or other nominee record holder, or, if you are a record holder of our Common Stock, you may contact Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (Broadridge) either by calling toll-free at (800) 542‑1061, or by writing Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York 11717. Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of our Common Stock to file with the SEC reports of their initial ownership and changes in their ownership of our Common Stock and other equity securities. SEC regulations require us to identify anyone who filed a required report late during the most recent fiscal year. Based on our review of these reports, we believe that for fiscal year 2018 all reports required to be made by our reporting persons were timely filed in accordance with the Exchange Act, except that Mr. Fisher, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. Zeeman and Mr. Chartier each filed one late Form 4 reporting a grant of restricted stock and stock options, and Mr. Rahilly filed two late Form 4s each reporting grants of restricted stock and stock options.
Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management
Securities Owned by Officers and Directors
The following table sets forth information about the beneficial ownership of our outstanding Common Stock as of March 18, 2019 by our directors, our named executive officers (NEOs) whose compensation is disclosed in "Executive Compensation" of this proxy statement and all of our directors and executive officers as a group. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act and includes voting or investment power with respect to the securities. Shares of Common Stock that may be acquired by an individual within 60 days of March 18, 2019 are deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of such individual, but are not deemed to be outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person shown in the table. The ownership percentage for each individual named below is based on the number of shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding on March 18, 2019, which was 33,689,863.

We believe Mr. Tebbe's qualifications to sit on our Board include, among other things, his leadership experience as an executive officer of two publicly traded companies, his service as a director on other public company boards, which has given him a strong understanding of public company corporate governance and financial reporting and business controls, his extensive entrepreneurial background and his many years of senior management experience in the technology industry.

Corporate Governance Philosophy
Our corporate governance philosophy is expressed in our Corporate Governance Guidelines; the charters of our Audit Committee, Management Development and Compensation Committee (Compensation Committee), and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee; our Code of Business Conduct, which applies to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our CEO, chief financial officer and those officers responsible for financial reporting; and our Related Party Transaction Policy, among others. Our committee charters, Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct, Insider Trading Policy, Regulation FD Policy and Stock Ownership Guidelines are available on the Corporate Governance page of our website at ir.enova.com. We are committed to maintaining effective corporate governance guidelines designed to ensure that the Board is actively engaged in the proper performance of its oversight function.
Corporate Governance Structure and Function
Our articles of incorporation provide that the number of directors who constitute the entire Board will be fixed by resolution adopted from time to time by the affirmative vote of the majority of the Board. Our Board consists of eight persons. It is the policy of the Company that the number of directors will not exceed a number that can function efficiently as a body. Our directors are elected annually at each Annual Meeting by our Stockholders voting together as a single class.
Our Board, assisted by its committees, oversees the Company's business and affairs and assures that the long-term interests of our stockholders are being served.
Directors are encouraged to have direct dialogue with our management and internal audit manager and internal audit team and may request attendance by management, the internal audit manager and internal audit team, and our external auditors at Board and committee meetings.
We provide directors with materials such as our corporate governance documents, compensation plans, Company policies, Board and committee minutes, continuing education materials, and reports and presentations prepared by management, internal and external auditors and other advisors in advance of each meeting. Directors are encouraged to review these materials prior to the meeting.
The Company facilitates the continuing education of directors to assist them in maintaining currency with the Company's business and operations.
Primary Responsibilities of the Board
As described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board's primary functions are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing the formation of and reviewing major strategies, plans and actions; 
• reviewing and evaluating our performance against broad financial and strategic objectives; 
• providing direction, advice and counsel to senior management; 
• selecting, compensating and evaluating our CEO and other executive officers; 
• reviewing succession planning for our CEO and other executive officers; 
• selecting appropriate candidates for election as directors; 
• reviewing our systems and practices designed to bring about compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including our accounting and financial reporting obligations; and 
• reviewing the major risks we face and helping us to develop and oversee strategies to address those risks. 
[END TABLE]
Director Independence
Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Under the rules of the NYSE, independent directors must comprise a majority of our Board. In addition, the rules of the NYSE require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation, and nominating and governance committees must be independent. Under the rules of the NYSE, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of that company's board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act and compensation committee members must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10C- 1(b)(1). Each of these rules provide that, in order to be considered independent, a director may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries. 
Our Board has determined that none of Ms. Carnahan, Mr. Feehan, Mr. Goodyear, Mr. Gray, Mr. Kaplan, Mr. McGowan and Mr. Tebbe, representing seven (7) of our eight (8) directors, has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the rules of the NYSE. Our Board also determined that each of Mr. Goodyear (chair), Ms. Carnahan, Mr. Gray and Mr. McGowan, who comprise our audit committee, Mr. Feehan (chair), Mr. Kaplan and Mr. Tebbe, who comprise our Compensation Committee, and Mr. Gray (chair), Ms. Carnahan, Mr. Goodyear, Mr. Kaplan, Mr. McGowan and Mr. Tebbe, who comprise our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by the rules of the NYSE and applicable SEC rules. In making these determinations, our Board considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director.
Board Diversity
Our Stockholders are better served when there is diversity of education, skill, age, experience, background, expertise and outlook on our Board. Our directors bring diverse backgrounds and experience to the Board that inform the Board's oversight function. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines express the belief that diversity, including differences in background qualifications and personal characteristics, is important to our Board's oversight function.
Director Meeting Attendance
Our Board held four (4) meetings during 2018. Directors are expected to prepare for and make every effort to attend and participate in meetings of the Board and committees on which they serve. During 2018, each director attended at least 75% of (i) the total number of Board meetings held in 2018 and (ii) the total number of meetings held by each committee of the Board on which such director served.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors are expected to attend annual stockholder meetings in person or by telephone or other electronic means. All directors attended the prior year's annual meeting.
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors
Executive sessions or meetings of independent directors are held at least in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Board meeting to discuss such matters as the independent directors deem worthy of discussion. In addition to such executive sessions, the Board may also hold regular executive sessions of outside directors without management present. The presiding outside director serves as the presiding director at such meetings and performs such other functions as the Board may direct, including serving in a liaison capacity between the Board as a whole and the senior management of the Company. If there is no presiding outside director then designated or if the presiding outside director is not available, the Board will select another outside director to serve as the presiding outside director until such time as the presiding outside director becomes available or is elected, as the case may be. Additional executive sessions or meetings of outside directors may be held from time to time as required. Executive sessions or meetings are held from time to time with our chief executive officer for a general discussion of relevant subjects.
Board and Committee Self-Assessment
To promote continuous improvement in our corporate governance processes, our Board and committees conduct an annual performance self-evaluation. The results are collected and analyzed and used to identify and implement improvements in our governance processes. Board Committees

The chair of each committee serves as lead director for committee matters and spokesperson for the committee, and provides recommendations and guidance to our Board, Board Chairman and management.
Each committee may retain its own legal and other advisors and conduct independent inquiries and investigations at our expense into matters under its oversight. Each committee has the sole right to appoint and direct its own advisors, each of whom is accountable and reports directly to the committee.
Audit Committee
Our Audit Committee met five (5) times during 2018.
The Audit Committee was established in accordance with Exchange Act Section 3(a)(58)(A). Our Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Audit Committee are independent directors under the applicable rules of NYSE and the SEC. Our Board has additionally determined that Mr. Goodyear, Ms. Carnahan, Mr. Gray and Mr. McGowan are audit committee financial experts, as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K, and meet the financial sophistication requirement in NYSE Rule 303A.07. The Audit Committee's functions are described in its charter, which is available on the Committee Charters page of our website at www.enova.com.
As described in its charter, the Audit Committee's responsibilities include: reviewing and overseeing financial reporting and financial statements; reviewing, overseeing and maintaining independent auditor relationships; overseeing and maintaining internal audit and compliance procedures and requirements; and setting policies for the Company's administrative policies and procedures.
Our independent auditor is accountable and reports directly to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee reviews our independent auditor's independence and the overall scope and focus of the annual audit. The Audit Committee discusses with our independent auditor any relationships or services that may affect its objectivity or independence. If the Audit Committee is not satisfied with the independent auditor's assurances of independence, it will take, or recommend that the Board take, appropriate action to ensure its independence.
Compensation Committee
Our Compensation Committee met five (5) times during 2018.
Our Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are independent directors under the applicable rules of NYSE and the SEC. The Compensation Committee members also qualify as non-employee directors under Exchange Act Rule 16b-3 and as outside directors under Section 162(m) of the Code. Our Compensation Committee's functions are described in its charter, which is available on the Committee Charter page of our website at www.enova.com.
As described in its charter, the Compensation Committee's responsibilities include: overseeing the Company's overall compensation structure and practices, including providing guidance to management on significant issues affecting compensation philosophy or policy; reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the  compensation of the CEO and the Company's other executive officers; setting the Company's general policy regarding executive compensation; granting stock options, restricted stock and other discretionary awards under the Company's stock option and other equity incentive plans; reviewing and making recommendations to the Board with respect to matters concerning the Company's stock and cash-based incentive compensation plans; reviewing and discussing with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required to be included in the Company's proxy statement for each annual meeting of stockholders or Form 10-K; overseeing and considering the results of the Company's submissions to stockholders on matters relating to executive compensation including advisory votes on executive compensation and frequency of such votes; and reviewing with the CEO the functions of the CEO and other executive officers of the Company and the succession plans relating to these officers.
The Compensation Committee has primary responsibility for determining our compensation programs for executive officers and directors. In evaluating the level of executive officer and director compensation, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration advice from its independent consultant and recommendations from senior management. The Compensation Committee has sole authority to engage and compensate a compensation consultant and determine its independence from management. The compensation consultant is accountable and reports directly to the Compensation Committee.
Compensation Committee Interaction with Compensation Consultants
Since 2014, the Compensation Committee has engaged Towers Watson & Co., n/k/a Willis Towers Watson plc (Willis Towers Watson), an executive compensation firm, to assist with its review of the compensation programs for our executive officers and the compensation disclosures in this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee intends to continue engaging Willis Towers Watson in an advisory capacity with respect to executive compensation, including reviewing the compensation disclosures in this proxy statement. Although the Compensation Committee retains Willis Towers Watson, Willis Towers Watson interacts directly with our executive officers when necessary and appropriate. Willis Towers Watson's advisory services include providing industry and peer group compensation data and presenting compensation plan designs to the Compensation Committee for consideration. The Compensation Committee considered and assessed all factors specified under NYSE Listing Rules with respect to advisor independence and determined that Willis Towers Watson is an independent executive compensation firm.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
Our Nominating and Governance Committee met three (3) times during 2018.
Our Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Nominating and Governance Committee are independent directors under the applicable rule of NYSE. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's functions are described in its charter, which is available on the Committee Charters page of our website at www.enova.com.
As described in its charter, the Nominating and Governance Committee's responsibilities include: identifying, assessing and recommending Board candidates; developing the criteria for selecting Board candidates; recommending for approval to the Board director candidates; assisting the Board in assessing director independence; reviewing the structure and charters of Board committees and recommending to the Board, if desirable, changes in their number, responsibilities and membership; reviewing and approving related person transactions; providing oversight of our Related Person Transaction Policy and our Insider Trading Policy; administering, reviewing and reassessing the adequacy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and recommending any proposed changes to the Board; recommending other changes in corporate governance to the Board for approval from time to time; and overseeing annual evaluations of the Board and its committees.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has the authority to consult with, retain and terminate, special legal counsel, search firms used to identify director candidates, or other consultants or advisors to advise the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as circumstances may dictate. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to approve the terms of engagement of, fees payable to, and any agreements with such outside advisors. All of the eight Board nominees identified in this proxy statement are current directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed the qualifications of each nominee and recommended each nominee for election to the Board. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will accept director nominations from Stockholders made in accordance with our Bylaws. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter guides our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in considering candidates for director, including nominees submitted by Stockholders. Candidates for Board membership are to be selected based on their character, judgement, business experience and acumen. Financial expertise, independence and familiarity with national and international issues affecting business are also considered. In assessing potential new directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers diversity of personal and professional background, perspective, experience, age, gender and ethnicity.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews annually the overall skills, characteristics and experience of our Board.
Board Leadership Structure
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the roles of Chairman of the Board (Chairman) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) may be separated or combined, as the Board determines from time to time. Our Board has appointed Mr. Fisher as our CEO and Chairman. In addition, our Board has appointed Mr. Gray to serve as the presiding outside director.
The presiding outside director's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding over all meetings of the Board at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors; 
• communicating to the Chairman feedback from executive sessions as appropriate; 
• serving as liaison between senior management and the Board; 
• reviewing Board and committee agendas and schedules to confirm that appropriate topics are reviewed and sufficient time is allocated to each; 
• calling meetings of the independent directors, if desired; 
• supervising the Board's determination of the independence of its directors; and 
• such other responsibilities as the independent directors may designate from time to time. 
[END TABLE]
Our Board believes that the current leadership structure best serves our stockholders as a young public company and that combining the role of Chairman and CEO enables a single voice to set the tone and have primary responsibility for the management of our company during this important transition period. As a young public company, our CEO is the person most familiar with our business and is in the best position to effectively identify strategic priorities and opportunities, leading the Board in the discussion of the execution of our strategy and facilitating the flow of information between the Board and management.
Our Board believes that the designation of a presiding outside director with substantive responsibilities, a board comprised of a majority of members who are independent directors and our strong corporate governance policies and procedures achieves the appropriate balance for the combined role of Chairman and CEO.
The Board will regularly review its leadership structure and take into account the responsibilities of the leadership positions and the directors qualified to hold such positions. In conducting this review, the Board will consider, among other things: (i) the policies and practices in place that provide independent board oversight; (ii) our performance and the effect a particular leadership structure may have on that performance; (iii) the structure that serves the best interests of our stockholders and (iv) any relevant legislative or regulatory developments. The Board's Role in Risk Management
Our full Board oversees our risk management process. Our Board oversees a company-wide approach to risk management, carried out by our management. Our full Board determines the appropriate level of risk for us generally, assesses the specific risks faced by us, and reviews the steps taken by management to manage those risks.
While the full Board maintains the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, its committees oversee risks in certain specified areas. In particular, our Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and arrangements, and the incentives created by the compensation awards it administers. Our Audit Committee oversees management of enterprise risks as well as financial and regulatory compliance risks. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks associated with maintaining the independence of our Board. Pursuant to our Board's instruction, management regularly reports on applicable risks to the relevant committee or the full Board, as appropriate, with additional review or reporting on risks conducted as needed or as requested by our Board and its committees.
Legal Proceedings
To the best of our knowledge, there are no material proceedings adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries in which any of our directors, director nominees or executive officers or their affiliates or associates, or any owner of record or beneficially of more than 5% of any class of our Common Stock or their affiliates or associates, is a party adverse to us or in which any such person has an interest that is materially adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During 2018, the Compensation Committee consisted of Daniel R. Feehan (Chair), Gregg A. Kaplan and Mark A. Tebbe. Currently and at all times during 2018, none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee or as a director of another entity where an executive officer of that entity also served on our Compensation Committee or the Board.
Director Compensation
We provide competitive compensation to our non-employee directors that is designed to attract and retain high-quality directors, provide them with compensation at a level that is consistent with our compensation objectives, and encourage their ownership of our stock to further align their interests with those of our stockholders. Our directors who are also employees receive no additional compensation or stock awards for service on our Board, although we may reimburse them for travel and other expenses. Each of our directors received $63,125 for their service on our Board during fiscal year 2018. We pay an annual retainer fee of $65,000, which was increased in May 2018 from $57,500 in the prior year, to each non-employee director. We pay an annual retainer fee of $25,000 to the non-employee director chairs of each of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee and to the independent director serving as the presiding outside director, and we also pay an annual retainer fee of $10,000 to the non-employee director chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. These retainers are paid in cash in quarterly installments.
Our non-employee directors are each eligible to receive an annual grant of restricted stock units (RSU). An annual RSU grant valued at $140,000, which was increased from $117,500 in the prior year, was made to each of our non-employee directors on May 8, 2018, which will fully vest twelve months from the grant date. The number of RSUs granted was determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the first trading date of our common stock prior to the grant date. Our non-employee directors are eligible to receive annual RSU grants on or shortly following the date of each annual meeting of stockholders. Beginning in 2019, the number of RSUs to be granted is determined based on the average of the closing price of our common stock for the last 45 trading days preceding the grant date. The table below sets forth the director compensation paid or earned in fiscal year 2018. Mr. Fisher, who also served as our CEO, received no compensation for serving as a director and is not included in the table below.

Our Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Our Compensation Committee determines the design of our executive compensation program and has implemented the executive compensation policies and practices described below.
General
We believe compensation provided to our executives should be performance-based, competitive in the markets and industries in which we compete for talent, closely linked to our stockholders' interests and reflect each executive's contribution in enhancing our stockholders' investment in us.
Primary Objectives
The primary objectives of our executive compensation program are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● support Enova's core values; 
● attract, motivate and retain the best executive talent; 
● encourage and reward high performance and results, while aligning executive short- and long-term interests with those of our stockholders; 
● reinforce our strategy to grow our business as we continue to innovate, execute and diversify; and 
● align an appropriate level of risk to be taken by our executives to achieve sustained long-term growth while discouraging excessive risk taking to achieve short-term results. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Committee's Role in Establishing Executive Compensation
Our Compensation Committee approves, or recommends to the independent members of our Board for approval, all compensation decisions relating to our NEOs and other executive officers, including grants of short- and long-term incentive awards, which may include cash- and equity-based awards. Key responsibilities of our Compensation Committee are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● ensure our executives are fairly compensated based upon results and contributions to our growth and profitability; 
● ensure our executives are incentivized to achieve exceptional performance and rewarded for outstanding results; 
● make executive compensation decisions that support our compensation philosophy and our strategic and risk objectives, as well as stockholder interests; 
● provide oversight of our executives' compliance with our stock ownership guidelines; and 
● assess the risks associated with our executive compensation programs. 
[END TABLE]
 Management's Role in Establishing Compensation
Our Chief Executive Officer is the primary management contact with our Compensation Committee. Our Chief Executive Officer recommends to the Compensation Committee changes in compensation for our NEOs, based on an assessment of each individual's responsibilities and contributions to our results and the individual's potential for future contributions to our success. None of the other executive officers are involved in the Chief Executive Officer's compensation recommendations, and neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any other executive officers are involved in the determination of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation.
Competitive Reference Points
Our Compensation Committee selects competitive market reference points with which we compare our executive compensation policies and practices from time to time. The Compensation Committee may retain compensation consultants to gather and present such information.
In making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee has historically reviewed the compensation policies and practices of a peer group of publicly-traded companies participating in a sufficiently broad range of industries to capture the uniqueness of our business, customers, industry, technology and regulatory environment. Our Compensation Committee selected the peer group companies that are of a similar size to Enova and operate in high-technology, internet retail, online-focused consumer finance or otherwise operate in highly regulated industries.
Our Compensation Committee engaged Willis Towers Watson to review and update the peer group to be used by the Compensation Committee in determining compensation to be paid to our NEOs for fiscal year 2018 and to provide compensation information for these companies. The following publicly traded companies were selected as our peer group for fiscal year 2018 compensation decisions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Bankrate, Inc.• LendingClub Corporation 
• CBOE Holdings, Inc.• Nelnet, Inc. 
• CoreLogic, Inc.• On Deck Capital, Inc. 
• CoStar Group Inc.• OneMain Holdings, Inc. 
• EZCORP, Inc.• Regional Management Corp. 
• Fair Isaac Corporation• Shutterfly, Inc. 
• Green Dot Corporation• SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. 
• Investment Technology Group Inc.• TripAdvisor Inc. 
• Liquidity Services, Inc.• World Acceptance Corp. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee considers the compensation information provided by our compensation consultant about our peer group as a competitive reference point but not a benchmark for compensation decisions.
Our Compensation Committee uses the peer group compensation information provided by our compensation consultant to assess the market competitiveness of our compensation programs for our NEOs with respect to the following:
Base Salaries. Subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee, our base salaries generally range between the 50th and 75th percentile of our competitive group, aligning closer to the 75th percentile for sustained superior performance;
Short-term Incentive Compensation. Subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee, short-term incentive compensation targets generally range between the 50th and 75th percentile of our competitive group, with awards aligning closer to the 75th percentile for sustained superior performance; and
Long-term Incentive Compensation. Subject to the discretion of the Compensation Committee, long-term incentive compensation targets generally range between the 50th and 75th percentile of our competitive group, with awards aligning closer to the 75th percentile for sustained superior performance. We believe it is important to maintain peer group stability from year-to-year, but equally important to make changes when they would improve market comparability and better align with our peer group selection criteria. Our Compensation Committee, with the support of Willis Towers Watson, undertook a review of our 2018 compensation peer group in late 2018 and determined that changes to the peer group should be made for 2019 compensation decisions. These changes include the removal of Bankrate, Inc., CBOE Holdings, Inc., CoStar Group Inc., EZCORP, Inc., Liquidity Services, Inc., Shutterfly, Inc. and TripAdvisor Inc., and the inclusion of CURO Group Holdings Corp., Elevate Credit, Inc., Envestnet, Inc., Groupon, Inc., Grubhub Inc. and Morningstar, Inc. Aside from considering the typical financial criteria, these changes provide comparable companies that provide consumer lending services, face a similar regulatory environment and/or have a strong data-analytics focus.
Principal Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program
Our executive compensation is comprised of the following elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Base salary. 
● A performance-based annual incentive award, intended to increase stockholder value and our success by motivating executives to perform at their best and meet and exceed objectives. 
● The goal of the annual incentive award is to provide executives with motivating incentives based on the achievement of goals relating to Enova or Enova's individual business units. 
● Clear and objective financial and non-financial performance goals as well as strategic qualitative initiatives are established to provide an opportunity for increased rewards for exceptional results. 
● Long-term incentive compensation consists of time-based RSUs and stock options. The purpose of our long-term incentives is to promote Enova's long-term business strategy and the interests of our stockholders by: 
● providing a line of sight to the long-term strategic goals of Enova; 
● attracting and retaining executive talent; 
● enabling executives to participate in our long-term growth and develop a sense of ownership by acquiring a proprietary interest in Enova; and 
● providing long-term incentives with upside earnings opportunity for exceptional performance and, in the case of stock options, with earnings opportunity only in the event Enova's share price increases over time. 
● Retirement benefits, including a 401(k) plan, a nonqualified savings plan, a supplemental executive retirement plan, and a severance pay plan for executives. 
● 100% health insurance coverage (medical, dental and vision). 
● Certain additional benefits available to executives that may include: Employment contracts, retention agreements and other similar benefits, including, but not limited to, executive short-term and long-term disability plans, which are not expected to be utilized frequently but may be used selectively and only if and when appropriate. 
[END TABLE]
In addition to our Compensation Committee, from time to time our Board may also review and approve our executive compensation philosophy or elements thereof and other matters related thereto when necessary or appropriate.
2018 Compensation for Named Executive Officers
The 2018 compensation levels for Messrs. Chartier, Cunningham, Rahilly and Zeeman were recommended by Mr. Fisher and approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of fiscal year 2018. In determining 2018 compensation levels, the Compensation Committee considered each element of compensation and the fit of each such element into the respective officer's total compensation package. The compensation packages were designed with a goal of balancing short-term compensation, including base salary and short-term incentive compensation,  with long-term compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that providing both short-term incentive compensation that is paid based on the achievement of shorter-term financial targets and long-term incentive compensation that is paid based on the achievement of longer-term financial targets, helps to align our NEOs interests with those of our stockholders.
Base Salary
Base salaries are reviewed and considered by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Fisher's 2018 base salary was set by the Compensation Committee at a level the Compensation Committee believed to be competitive in the market in which we compete for talent. In recommending the 2018 base salaries for Messrs. Chartier, Cunningham, Rahilly and Zeeman, Mr. Fisher took into consideration the overall performance of the Company, each officer's breadth of responsibilities, their impact on financial and operational results over the prior year, their leadership and accomplishments that affected the Company's performance and their achievement of goals throughout the year.
The annual base salaries for our NEOs as of December 31, 2018, including their percentage increase over their salaries in effect on December 31, 2017 were as follows:

In February 2018, our Compensation Committee approved the performance measures and goals and the threshold, target and maximum opportunities for the awards to be made under the Senior Executive Bonus Plan and the Discretionary Bonus Plan for the 2018 performance period. The threshold, target and maximum opportunities, which are set as a percentage of base salary for each NEO, may vary from year-to-year at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. The target award amounts for 2018 STI compensation, as a percentage of base salary, for our NEOs were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     Target Percentage of Base Salary

The 2018 STI performance measures and goals that were established for the awards made under our Senior Executive Bonus Plan were based on equal weightings of our revenue, earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses (EBITDA), which is a non-GAAP financial measure (2018 STI EBITDA), and adjusted earnings per share (Adjusted EPS), which is also a non-GAAP financial measure (2018 STI Adjusted EPS). Payment of the STI awards was subject to achievement of the following performance conditions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Earnings Thresholds: Potential STI awards began to accrue based on formulas set forth in the Senior Executive Bonus Plan once the earnings thresholds for 2018 revenue, 2018 STI EBITDA and/or 2018 STI Adjusted EPS set by the Compensation Committee (the Earnings Thresholds) were exceeded. The Earnings Thresholds for the Senior Executive Bonus Plan for 2018 was $867.0 million of 2018 revenue, $133.5 million of 2018 STI EBITDA and $1.58 of STI Adjusted EPS. 
● Earnings Targets: If the earnings targets set by the Compensation Committee were achieved, then the NEO was eligible to receive a cash payment equal to 100% of his or her target award (the Earnings Targets). If the Earnings Targets were exceeded, each NEO was eligible to receive a cash payment in excess of his or her target award calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the Senior Executive Bonus Plan. The Earnings Targets for the Senior Executive Bonus Plan for 2018 were $992.0 million of 2018 revenue, $178.0 million of 2018 STI EBITDA and $2.10 of 2018 STI Adjusted EPS. 
[END TABLE]
2018 revenue was $1,114.1 million. Our actual 2018 STI EBITDA was $198.3 million, which is comprised of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Income from Operations (1)     $183.1 million 
 Depreciation and amortization (1)     15.2 million 
 2018 STI EBITDA (2)     $198.3 million

 (2)  For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded $25.0 million ($19.6 million net of tax) of losses on early extinguishment of debt related to the repurchase of $345 million of principal amount of senior notes in 2018. 
 (3)  For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded an income tax benefit of $11.2 million from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
 (4)  For the year ended December 31, 2018, we consented to the issuance of a Consent Order by the CFPB, pursuant to which we agreed, without admitting or denying any of the facts or conclusions made by the CFPB from its 2014 review of us, to pay a civil money penalty of $3.2 million, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. 
[END TABLE]
The 2018 STI EBITDA exceeded the Earnings Threshold and the Earnings Target for 2018, thus payments were made above target levels under the terms of the Senior Executive Bonus Plan. 
Our Compensation Committee also adopted five performance objectives and the target opportunities for the 2018 performance period under the Discretionary Bonus Plan. The performance objectives were to (i) achieve a 95% completion rate within 15 days after the year end for all training courses, (ii) maintain effective compliance and training programs in the jurisdictions in which we operate such that there are no significant regulatory actions taken by our regulators, (iii) maintain high customer satisfaction levels, (iv) be an Employer of Choice for great talent and (v) handle all customer funding and payments successfully. The Discretionary Bonus Plan is intended to increase stockholder value and our success by providing our officers and other employees with discretionary bonus awards based upon exceptional individual achievement or exceptional performance by us or our individual business units. The Compensation Committee assessed the Company's performance against the 2018 Discretionary Bonus Plan performance objectives, considered the individual performance in 2018 of our participating executive officers and approved the following actual payments under the Discretionary Bonus Plan to our participating NEOs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Discretionary Bonus Plan

[END TABLE]
Beginning in 2015, 100% of the first 1% of pay and 50% of the next 5% of pay that each employee contributes to the Enova 401(k) is matched by us. All employee contributions are fully vested upon contribution. Our matching contributions subsequent to January 1, 2015 will fully vest after an employee's second year of service with us and will also fully vest if an employee dies, becomes disabled or reaches age 59 1/2 during employment. Prior to January 1, 2015, 50% of the first 5% of pay that each employee contributed to the Enova 401(k) was matched by us. All employee contributions were fully vested upon contribution. Our matching contributions prior to January 1, 2015 vest ratably over an employee's first five years of service with us or our former parent company, Cash America International, Inc. (Cash America), and also become fully vested if an employee dies, becomes disabled or reaches age 59 1/2 during employment. Employees may select from among several mutual funds when investing their 401(k) account funds. 
The Enova NQSP is a nonqualified retirement savings plan into which eligible participants may contribute portions of their salary in excess of the 401(k) contribution limits. Enova NQSP participants can also defer up to 80% of their STI awards and annual bonuses into the Enova NQSP. If a participant's pay exceeded the IRS limit on amounts that could be taken into account for contributions to the Enova 401(k) prior to 2016, we matched 50% of the first 5% of compensation deferred to the Enova NQSP in excess of the 401(k) compensation limit; however, if a participant participated in both the Enova 401(k) and the Enova NQSP, the combined match to both plans was limited to 50% of the first 5% of the participant's pay. This plan generally offers the same investment options as the Enova 401(k). Our matching contributions in the Enova NQSP vest immediately. We generally distribute each participant's Enova NQSP account in a lump sum shortly after the participant's separation from service with us and all of our affiliates. Alternatively, a participant may elect to receive his or her Enova NQSP account at a later date or receive payments in up to 10 annual installments. Most officers may not receive a distribution of any portion of their account during the first six months after their separation from service. A participant generally may not receive any portion of his or her Enova NQSP account while employed, unless the participant makes an in-service distribution election before the deferred compensation is earned or suffers a severe financial hardship. We may pay Enova NQSP distributions from a Rabbi trust associated with the Enova NQSP or from the general assets of the entity that is the participant's employer. A participant would have the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the entity that is his or her employer for any Enova NQSP benefits he or she is owed.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan
We provide supplemental executive retirement plan benefits to our officers and certain other eligible employees as a supplement to their retirement benefits under the Enova SERP. After the end of each plan year, we make discretionary supplemental contributions that are credited to the Enova SERP account of each NEO who was employed by us on the last day of the plan year. The rate of return of a participant's Enova SERP account is determined by the rate of return on deemed investments in mutual funds that a participant selects. Enova SERP participants' deemed investment options are generally the same as the investment options available under the Enova 401(k). Participants vest in their Enova SERP accounts over their first five years of service with us and are fully vested in their Enova SERP accounts and new contributions to those accounts after that five-year period.
We generally distribute each participant's Enova SERP account as a lump sum soon after the participant's separation from service with us and all of our affiliates. An Enova SERP participant may, however, elect to defer receipt of the Enova SERP account for at least an additional five years beyond his or her separation from service and may also elect to receive the Enova SERP account in up to ten annual installments. Most officers cannot receive a distribution of any portion of their account during the first six months after their separation from service. A participant generally may not withdraw any portion of his or her Enova SERP account during employment, except in the case of a severe financial hardship. We may pay Enova SERP benefits from a Rabbi trust associated with the Enova SERP or from the general assets of the entity that is the participant's employer. A participant would have the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the entity that is his or her employer for any Enova SERP benefits he or she is owed.
Our Compensation Committee administers the Enova SERP and annually determines the supplemental contributions for each of our NEOs. The targeted (but non-binding) amount of the supplemental contribution for each plan year is a percentage of each participant's compensation. The compensation on which the supplemental contribution is based is the base salary, plus the lesser of (a) the participant's target STI award payable during the plan year for the preceding year's performance and (b) the actual STI award paid during the plan year based on the preceding year's performance. The contribution amounts are prorated for the portion of the year that a participant was eligible to participate in the Enova SERP, and are credited to the participant's Enova SERP account before March 15 of the following year. For fiscal year 2018, the supplemental contributions for each of our NEOs, reflected as a percentage of the combined base salary paid during the year and the target STI award granted for fiscal year 2018, are listed below.
[BEGIN TABLE]

vested in 60% of our contributions at the end of 2018 because he joined Enova in October 2015. For the Enova 401(k), Mr. Zeeman was fully vested in our contributions at the end of 2018. 
Severance Arrangements for Named Executive Officers
On November 13, 2014 in connection with our spin-off (Spin-Off) from Cash America, we entered into Executive Change-in-Control Severance and Restrictive Covenant Agreements (CIC Agreements) with our executive officers, including Messrs. Fisher, Chartier and Rahilly. Also, upon commencement of their employment, we entered into CIC Agreements with Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Zeeman. The CIC Agreements were effective through November 13, 2018, and were automatically extended for a one-year period thereafter. The term of the CIC Agreements will automatically be extended for subsequent one-year periods unless we or the executive officer provide notice not to extend the Term at least six months prior to the scheduled extension date. In addition, the term of these agreements will automatically be extended for two years following a Change-in-Control (as defined in the CIC Agreements).
The CIC Agreements provide our executive officers with severance payments and certain benefits in the event of his or her termination by us without Cause (as defined in the CIC Agreements) or by the relevant executive officers for Good Reason (as defined in the CIC Agreements) during the twelve months following a Change-in-Control (as defined in the CIC Agreements). Such payments and benefits include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (i)  a lump sum payment equal to the executive officer's unpaid base salary, accrued vacation pay and unreimbursed business expenses, as well as all certain other items earned by and owed to such executive officer through the termination date;  
    (ii)  a lump sum payment equal to the pro rata portion of the executive officer's annual target bonus amount for the year in which the termination occurs;  
    (iii)  a lump sum payment equal to (A) for Mr. Fisher, two times the higher of (1) his base salary in effect at the termination date and (2) his base salary in effect on the date of the Change-in-Control and (B) for all other executive officers, one times the higher of (1) his or her base salary in effect at the termination date and (2) his or her base salary in effect on the date of the Change-in-Control;  
    (iv)  a lump sum amount equal to (A) for Mr. Fisher, two times the higher of (1) his annual target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs and (2) the actual annual bonus payments made to Mr. Fisher for the year preceding the year in which the termination occurs and (B) for all other executive officers, one times the higher of (1) his or her annual target bonus for the year in which the termination occurs and (2) the actual annual bonus payments made to such executive officer for the year preceding the year in which the termination occurs;  
    (v)  the immediate vesting of any outstanding cash-based long term incentive awards held by the executive officer, including a lump sum payment for any vested awards (the value of which to be determined after the termination date in accordance with the CIC Agreements);  
    (vi)  the immediate vesting and lapse of all restrictions on any outstanding stock-based awards held by the executive officer to the extent not already provided for in the related grant agreement(s);  
    (vii)  equivalent payment for continued medical coverage under our group health plan for the executive and the executive's dependents for a period of twenty-four months for Mr. Fisher or twelve months for all other executive officers following the termination date in accordance with the terms of the relevant CIC Agreement; and  
    (viii)  up to $50,000 for Mr. Fisher or $25,000 for all other executive officers for reimbursement of amounts paid by the executive officer for reasonable outplacement services from an executive search firm to the extent such expenses are incurred as a direct result of the separation from service and within twenty-four months for Mr. Fisher or twelve months for all other executive officers after the termination date. 
[END TABLE]
Additionally, the CIC Agreements contain certain restrictive covenants to which the executive officers are subject. These include confidentiality, non-disclosure, non-solicitation and non-competition provisions. The term of the non-competition provision applies during the term of the executive officer's employment through the twenty-four-month period for Mr. Fisher or twelve-month period for all other executive officers following termination (the Subject Period). Such provision restricts the executive officer from competing with us or any of our subsidiaries or affiliates (including former subsidiaries or affiliates, which is collectively referred to as the Enterprise), by providing  employment (other than to the Enterprise), management or consulting services, similar to those provided by the executive officer to the Enterprise with respect to any products or services similar to those offered or under development by the Company or any of its affiliates or subsidiaries anywhere within the Territory (as defined in the CIC Agreements) during the Subject Period.
In addition, we have adopted a severance pay plan for executives that provides guidance for severance pay, continued medical and health benefits, payment of accrued but unused paid time off and an allowance for outplacement services for our executive officers following certain terminations not related to a change-in-control.

The 2014 LTIP contains a clawback provision that would allow us, in the event that there is a material restatement of our financial results, to (i) cancel part or all of the outstanding portion of any award, whether or not vested, and/or (ii) require a participant to repay an amount, satisfied in cash or in another form of consideration, such as shares of common stock as permitted by applicable law and as acceptable to the Compensation Committee, equal to all or any portion of the value of shares of common stock that have been issued and other payments that have been made to the participant pursuant to any award within the two years preceding the date on which we are required to prepare an accounting restatement, to the extent that such value or payment amount was based on the erroneous data and exceeded the value or amount that would have been paid to the participant under the accounting restatement. The 2014 LTIP also permits us, to the extent required to comply with applicable laws and/or any compensation recovery or clawback policy adopted by us after the date the 2014 LTIP was approved by our Stockholders, to unilaterally amend the clawback provision in the 2014 LTIP, with any such amendment binding on all participants.
The Senior Executive Bonus Plan also contains a clawback provision that would allow us to recoup certain compensation and awards paid to our officers in certain circumstances in the event that there is a material restatement of our financial results.
Deductibility of Executive Compensation
Our Compensation Committee reviews and considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Code Section 162(m), which provides that we may not deduct compensation of more than $1 million that is paid to certain individuals. As part of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") that was signed into law December 22, 2017, the ability to rely on exemptions from the $1 million limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation" was eliminated, and the limitation on deductibility was generally expanded to include all named executive officers. While the Committee recognizes the nondeductibility provisions of Code Section 162(m), the Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in structuring compensation programs, even though such programs may result in non-deductible compensation expenses.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Our Compensation Committee has established stock ownership guidelines that require ownership of our stock that is five times base salary for our chief executive officer, three times base salary for our other executive officers and two times the annual retainer for directors, subject to certain achievement timelines. Until the stock ownership guidelines are met, executive officers and directors are required to retain 50% of any shares of stock they receive on a net after tax basis. Our executive officers and directors currently comply with the applicable stock ownership guidelines.
Restrictions on Pledges of our Securities and Certain Trading Practices
Among other things, our Insider Trading Policy does not permit any director or associate of the Company, including officers, to engage in short sales or trade in market options or any other kind of derivatives related to Company securities, hold the Company's securities in a margin account or pledge Company securities as collateral for a loan or engage in hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts. Compensation Risk Assessment
Our Compensation Committee has reviewed our compensation policies and practices, including incentive programs, to ensure they do not encourage unreasonable or excessive risk-taking. Based upon this review, we believe our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to expose us to unreasonable or excessive risk that could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe our practice of providing a significant portion of compensation in the form of long-term equity compensation and using multiple performance measures in our incentive plans serve to balance risk and reward. We also maintain a prohibition on hedging and an incentive compensation recovery policy to mitigate undue risk associated with compensation. Management Development and Compensation Committee Report
As the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Enova International, Inc., we have reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) with the Company's management. Based on this review and discussion, the Management Development and Compensation Committee recommends to the Company's board of directors that the CD&A be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and this proxy statement.

Mr. Cunningham also received a cash sign-on bonus of $525,000, one-third of which was paid within 30 days of Mr. Cunningham's start date, one-third of which was paid on the first anniversary of his start date and one-third of which will be paid on the second anniversary of his start date. Repayment of the first installment of the cash sign-on bonus would have been required if Mr. Cunningham separated from the Company voluntarily earlier than 12 months from the date of employment.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change-in-Control
We have entered into the CIC Agreements with our executive officers. We have also adopted a severance pay plan for executives that we may follow in the case of an involuntary termination. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Severance Arrangements for Named Executive Officers" for additional information.
Payments Made Upon Resignation, Retirement, Termination, Death or Disability
We have adopted a severance pay plan (the Severance Pay Plan) for executives that provides guidance for severance pay, continued medical and health benefits, payment of accrued but unused paid time off and an allowance for outplacement services for our executive officers following certain terminations not related to a change-in-control. Under our Severance Pay Plan each of our NEOs is entitled to receive severance pay and benefits if his or her employment is involuntarily terminated due to restructuring, job elimination or other circumstances that Enova determines warrant the provision of severance benefits. Upon termination of employment for any of these  reasons, if the executive agrees to a general release of Enova and its affiliates related to employment claims arising from the termination and a promise to comply with confidentiality and nonsolicitation provisions, the executive will be entitled to severance pay equal to the number of months of base salary and payable over the period reflected in the table below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Years of Employment     Executive     CEO 
 Years of Employment     Executive     CEO 
 1 but less than 5     9 months     12 months 
 5 but less than 10     12 months     18 months 
 10 but less than 15     18 months     24 months 
 15 or more     24 months     24 months 
● Continued medical benefits for the shorter of the period set forth in the table above or the period during which the former executive is covered by COBRA, with our continuing to pay the portion of COBRA premiums that exceed the portion of health care premiums that current employees are required to pay (Employer COBRA Premiums) and for the costs of supplemental health care benefits in excess of the amount current executives are required to pay (Employer Supplemental Executive Health Care Premiums); and 
● A lump sum equal to all accrued but unpaid vacation and paid time off. 
[END TABLE]
In all cases Enova has complete discretionary authority to award greater or lesser amounts of severance pay and benefits.
Payments made Upon a Change-in-Control
The CIC Agreements with our NEOs specify the payments that they are to receive if they are terminated in connection with or during a specified period following a change-in-control. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Severance Arrangements for NEOs."
Executive CIC Agreements.
The CIC Agreement with Mr. Fisher provides that if, within 12 months after a "change-in-control" of Enova, Enova terminates Mr. Fisher's employment without cause or if Mr. Fisher voluntarily terminates his employment with good reason (including a reduction in his duties or compensation or relocation of place of employment), then Mr. Fisher will be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● earned and unpaid salary; 
● a pro-rated portion of the target annual bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) under the existing bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) plan based on the number of months employed during the year; 
● a lump sum equal to all accrued but unpaid vacation and paid time off; 
● a lump sum equal to two times the higher of the executive's annual rate of base salary on the date of termination or on the date of change-in-control; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a lump sum equal to two times the greater of (i) the target bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) for the year, or (ii) the actual bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) for the preceding year; 
● immediate vesting of any outstanding unvested cash-based and equity-based long-term incentive awards with the amount paid with respect to (i) cash-based awards to be equal to the greater of (A) the amount calculated under the award agreement based on the higher of the target or the actual achievement of the performance goals or (B) the amount to which the executive would be entitled under the provisions of the award agreement, and (ii) performance-based equity awards to be equal to the maximum amount available under each award; 
● continued medical and health care benefits for 24 months, consisting of Employer COBRA Premiums to be paid over an 18-month period and an amount equal to (i) six times the first monthly Employer COBRA Premium and (ii) 24 times the first monthly Employer Supplemental Executive Health Care Premium, paid in a lump sum; and 
● executive placement services from an executive search/placement firm of up to $50,000. 
[END TABLE]
The CIC Agreement with our other NEOs provide that if, within 12 months after a "change-in-control" of Enova, Enova terminates the NEO's employment without cause or if the NEO voluntarily terminates his or her employment with good reason (including a reduction in his or her duties or compensation or relocation of place of employment), then the executive will be entitled to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● earned and unpaid salary; 
● a pro-rated portion of the target annual bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) under the existing bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) plan based on the number of months employed during the year; 
● a lump sum equal to all accrued but unpaid vacation and paid time off; 
● a lump sum equal to the higher of the executive's annual rate of base salary on the date of termination or on the date of change-in-control; 
● a lump sum equal to the greater of (i) the target bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) for the year, or (ii) the actual bonus (or short-term incentive compensation) for the preceding year; 
● immediate vesting of any outstanding unvested cash-based and equity-based long-term incentive awards with the amount paid with respect to (i) cash-based awards to be equal to the greater of (A) the amount calculated under the award agreement based on the higher of the target or the actual achievement of the performance goals or (B) the amount to which the executive would be entitled under the provisions of the award agreement, and (ii) performance-based equity awards to be equal to the maximum amount available under each award; 
● continued medical and health care benefits for 12 months, consisting of Employer COBRA Premiums to be paid over a 12-month period and an amount equal to (i) six times the first monthly Employer COBRA Premium and (ii) 12 times the first monthly Employer Supplemental Executive Health Care Premium, paid in a lump sum; and 
● executive placement services from an executive search/placement firm of up to $25,000. 
[END TABLE]
Certain payments under the CIC Agreements will be delayed for six months if required by Section 409A of the Code. In addition, the CIC Agreements provide that a change-in-control is deemed to occur under the circumstances described below under "Change-in-Control Definitions."
Accelerated Vesting of Awards under the Enova Long-Term Incentive Plan.
The agreements relating to RSUs and stock options granted under the 2014 LTIP provide that the vesting and payment of RSUs and stock options will be accelerated if there is a change-in-control and, within 12 months afterward, Enova terminates the executive's employment without cause or if the executive voluntarily terminates his or her employment with good reason (including a reduction in his or her duties or compensation or relocation of place of employment). Accelerated Vesting under the Enova SERP and the Enova NQSP.
The Enova SERP provides that the vesting under the Enova SERP will be accelerated if there is a change-in-control or if the executive's employment is terminated as a result of his or her job being eliminated. The Enova NQSP provides that the vesting of the unvested portion of Enova's matching amounts contributed to a NEO's Enova NQSP account will accelerate in the event of a change-in-control or if the executive's employment is terminated as a result of death or disability or of his or her job being abolished.
Change-in-Control Definitions.
The CIC Agreement with Mr. Fisher, the CIC Agreements with our other NEOs, the RSU awards and stock option awards granted to our NEOs under the 2014 LTIP, the Enova SERP and the Enova NQSP each provide that a change-in-control is deemed to occur:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● if any person or group acquires ownership of Enova stock that, together with all other Enova's stock held by that person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total voting power or total fair market value of Enova stock; 
● if, during any 12-month period, any person or group acquires ownership of Enova stock with at least 30% of the total voting power; 
● if, during any 12-month period, a majority of the Enova directors at the beginning of such period are replaced, other than in specific circumstances; or 
● if, during any 12-month period, any person or group acquires assets of Enova with an aggregate fair market value of at least 40% of the fair market value of all of Enova's gross assets immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions. 
[END TABLE]
Distribution of Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Our NEOs are entitled to receive the vested amounts in their accounts under the Enova NQSP and the Enova SERP if their employment with us terminates. The last column in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table reports each NEO's aggregate balance at December 31, 2018 under each plan. Messrs. Chartier, Cunningham, Rahilly, Fisher and Zeeman were vested in 80%, 20%, 80%, 80% and 40%, respectively, in each of their Enova SERP balances at December 31, 2018. All of our NEOs who had balances in the Enova NQSP at December 31, 2018 were fully vested. The account balances continue to be credited with increases or decreases reflecting changes in the value of the investments against which the account balances are calculated, and to accrue interest income or dividend payments, as applicable, between the termination event and the date distributions are made. Therefore, amounts that the NEO would actually receive would differ from those shown in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table.
Potential Payments
The following tables and disclosures show the potential payments that could have been made to our NEOs, under our contracts, agreements, plans and arrangements, whether written or unwritten, in the event of a change-in-control or termination of employment, assuming such event occurred on December 31, 2018, based on the closing price of our common stock of $19.46 (as reported on the NYSE as of December 31, 2018).

CEO Pay Ratio
Pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring public companies to disclose in their annual proxy statements the ratio of the annual total compensation of the chief executive officer to the median employee's annual total compensation. These rules became effective for proxies filed in 2018 with respect to 2017 compensation.
For 2018, we continued to exclude international employees from our determination of the median employee, as they represented less than 5% of the total employee population of 1,211. The employee headcounts for the excluded countries were 18 in the United Kingdom and 10 in Brazil, so that the employee population after the exclusion was 1,183. We determined there has been no change in our employee population or employee  compensation arrangements that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. However, because our 2017 median employee, a customer support representative, departed during 2018, we selected another employee, a collections specialist, whose compensation is substantially similar to the original median employee based on the compensation measure used in 2017 — total cash compensation, consisting of base salary, bonus and commissions — to serve as our median employee for 2018.
We then calculated the median employee's total annual compensation in the same manner that was used in the summary compensation table for our named executive officers, including our CEO, by considering base salary, bonuses and 401(k) employer matching contributions. 
Based on this methodology, for 2018, the total annual compensation was $5,709,683 for our CEO and $57,480 for our median employee, a collections customer representative, resulting in a ratio of CEO pay to our median employee pay of 99 to 1.
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

 Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee (the Committee) oversees our accounting and financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. The Committee is composed of four independent directors (as defined by the NYSE Listing Rules), met five times in 2018 and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board in November 2016, which is available on the Committee Charters page of our website at www.enova.com. As provided in the Charter, the Committee's responsibilities include overseeing the quality and integrity of our financial reporting, including our systems of disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls, the qualifications and independence of our external auditors and the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm, and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. However, management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including our systems of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements to be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management, including a discussion of the quality and the acceptability of our financial reporting and controls as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018.
The Committee reviewed with the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality and acceptability of our financial reporting, the effectiveness of the Company's internal control and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Committee under generally accepted auditing standards. In addition, the Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees" issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm its independence from the Company and its management, including matters in the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526, "Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence." The Committee also has considered whether the provision by the independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit professional services is compatible with maintaining its independence.
The Committee also discussed with our internal audit manager and the internal audit team and our independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets periodically with the internal audit manager and internal audit team and our independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our internal controls and the overall quality of our financial reporting. The Committee also meets in executive session separately with the internal audit manager and internal audit team, our independent registered public accounting firm and Company management at least annually.
In reliance on the reviews and the discussions referred to above, the Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. The Committee also reappointed our independent registered public accounting firm for our 2019 fiscal year.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 (1)  Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of Enova's consolidated financial statements included in Enova's Annual Report on Form 10-K and for the review of the financial statements included in Enova's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as well as services that generally only Enova's independent registered public accounting firm can reasonably provide, including services rendered in connection with SEC filings. 
 (2)  Audit-related fees consist of services provided in connection with our securitization facilities. 
 (3)  Other fees consist of amounts paid for technical publications and subscriptions. 
[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee must pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services that the independent registered public accounting firm is to perform for us (except for items exempt from pre-approval requirements under applicable laws and rules). Our Audit Committee periodically monitors the services rendered by, and actual fees paid to, the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that the services provided are within the parameters that have been approved. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to evaluate and approve engagements on behalf of the Audit Committee in the event that a need arises for pre-approval between regular audit committee meetings. If the Chair of the Audit Committee so approves any such engagements, he will report that approval to the full Audit Committee at the next Audit Committee meeting. Our Audit Committee approved all of the audit and non-audit services and related fees for 2018 in accordance with the policy set forth above.
The Audit Committee determined that the level of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's fees for providing audit-related services is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's independence.
Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions
Our written related person transaction policy governs the review of any transaction, or series of transactions, involving amounts greater than $60,000 in which a director, director nominee, executive officer, 5% stockholder, members of their immediate families, or any entity of which any such person or any member of their immediate family is an officer, director, partner, principal or 5% stockholder (each, a "related person") has a direct or indirect material interest. The policy does not cover transactions, or series of transactions, that involve (i) compensation arrangements of any executive officer, if such arrangements have been approved by the Board or one of its committees, (ii) less than $60,000, (iii) rates or charges that are determined by competitive bids, (iv) the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority, or (v) services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, trustee under a trust indenture or similar services. The policy also does not cover transactions, or series of transactions, that arise solely from the ownership of a class of our equity securities if all holders of that class of our equity securities received the same benefit on a pro rata basis.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, or another committee of the Board comprised of at least three independent directors who are not involved in the transaction, must approve, ratify or refer to the full Board related person transactions involving amounts from $60,000 to $120,000. For transactions involving amounts  greater than $120,000, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, or such other committee that has reviewed the transaction, will make a recommendation to the full Board concerning such related person transaction and the full Board will then ratify, approve or disapprove of such transaction. A director may not participate in the review or approval of any transaction involving himself or herself or any of his or her affiliates or family members. In addition, if stockholder approval is required under the NYSE rules, our articles of incorporation or applicable law for any related person transaction, our related person transaction policy requires us to seek stockholder approval for such transaction.
If it is impractical or undesirable to wait until a committee or Board meeting to consummate a related person transaction involving $120,000 or less, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee chair may review and approve the transaction pursuant to the criteria set forth in the related person transaction policy. Another Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee member may review and approve the transaction if the chair is unavailable or if he or she, a family member or an affiliate of his or hers is a party to the transaction. Such approval will be reported to the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. PROPOSAL 2 ADVISORY PROPOSAL ON NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act and in accordance with SEC rules, we are asking Stockholders to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the following advisory resolution at the Annual Meeting:
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs, as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED.
This advisory vote is not intended to address any specific element of executive compensation, but is instead intended to address the overall compensation of our NEOs as disclosed in this proxy statement.
Executive compensation is an important issue for our Stockholders. As described in Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing and implementing our executive compensation philosophy and practices. The Compensation Committee has adopted an executive compensation program that supports our near- and long-term strategic objectives by attracting and retaining high caliber executives tasked with achieving continuous improvement in our operating results and motivating executives to achieve high levels of performance without excessive risk taking. Our Compensation Committee believes our executive officers should be compensated competitively consistent with our strategy, sound corporate governance principles, our particular circumstances and stockholders' interests.
We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the Summary Compensation Table and related compensation tables and narrative, which provide detailed information on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices and the compensation of our NEOs.
Effect of the Proposal
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a say-on-pay resolution, is not binding on us, the Board or the Compensation Committee. The vote on this proposal will, therefore, not affect any compensation already paid or awarded to any NEO and will not overrule any decisions previously made by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Because we highly value the opinions of our Stockholders, however, our Board and Compensation Committee will consider the results of this advisory vote when making future executive compensation decisions.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 2. PROPOSAL 3
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Our Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has confirmed to the Audit Committee that they are independent accountants with respect to us.
Our Board submits the Audit Committee's appointment of our independent auditor for ratification by Stockholders at each annual meeting. Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will be present at this Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so.
Effect of the Proposal
Although Stockholder ratification is not required, if Stockholders do not ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR PROPOSAL 3
Other Matters
Our Board does not intend to bring any other business before the Annual Meeting and is not aware that anyone else intends to do so. If any other business comes before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the enclosed form of proxy to vote in accordance with their best judgment.
