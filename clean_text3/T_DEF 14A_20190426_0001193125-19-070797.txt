Dear Stockholders: 
It's a pleasure to invite you to our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. I hope you can join us on Friday, April 26, 2019, at 9:00 a.m., at the Moody Performance Hall, 2520 Flora Street, Dallas, Texas 75201. 
At this year's meeting, we will discuss our strategy to become a modern media company and deliver on our mission to inspire human progress through the power of communication and entertainment. 
You'll hear about how we're executing on that strategy by building on the solid performance of our communications business, standing up a revolutionary advertising business and continuing to create great entertainment. Most important, we'll discuss our plans to grow free cash flow and pay down our debt – all while continuing to invest in growth and maintain a solid, steady dividend for you, our owners. 
In recent years, you have seen us transform our company in big and dramatic ways. But one thing has not – and will not – change. That's our goal of delivering strong results for you and sustainable, long-term growth and success for AT&T. On behalf of the Board and our management team, thank you for your continued support. 
Sincerely, 
Randall Stephenson

Dear Stockholders: 
In my second term as your company's Independent Lead Director, I want you to know how proud I am to reaffirm AT&T's lasting commitment to thoughtful and effective governance. 
The Board's role is to keep our company focused on the long-term and protect the interests of our stockholders. We take a disciplined, hands-on approach to discharging that duty – questioning assumptions, offering alternative points of view and assessing every decision through the lens of building stockholder value. 
We have worked hard to recruit and maintain a Board with deep experience and varied backgrounds. In a rapidly evolving marketplace, that diversity of perspectives is crucial to our success in serving our customers and creating value for you. 
I hope to see you at our 2019 Annual Meeting. Until then, please accept the gratitude of our entire Board for your enduring confidence in AT&T. 
Sincerely, 
Matthew Rose

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY 
Executive Compensation Highlights 
2019 Program Enhancement 
The Committee has approved the use of Net-Debt-to-Adjusted-EBITDA as a new performance metric with a 20% weighting for determining 2019 short-term incentive awards (payable 2020) for all Executive Officers. 
The narrative on pages 40-60 more fully describes how the Committee, with the input of its consultant, has designed and evolved our Executive Officer compensation and benefits program using the Committee's guiding pay principles as the pillars of the program. We also outline how we establish pay targets and how actual Executive Officer pay is determined. Finally, we provide a description of other benefits.

VOTING PROCEDURES 
Each share of AT&T common stock represented at the Annual Meeting is entitled to one vote on each matter properly brought before the meeting. All matters, except as provided below, are determined by a majority of the votes cast, unless a greater number is required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation for the action proposed. A majority of votes cast means the number of votes cast "for" a matter exceeds the number of votes cast "against" such matter. 
If the proxy is submitted and no voting instructions are given, the person or persons designated on the card will vote the shares for the election of the Board of Directors' nominees and in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors on the other subjects listed on the proxy card and at their discretion on any other matter that may properly come before the meeting. 
The Board of Directors is not aware of any matters that will be presented at the meeting for action on the part of stockholders other than those described in this Proxy Statement. 
Election of Directors 
In the election of Directors, each Director is elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election. Under our Bylaws, if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is an existing Director standing for re-election (or incumbent Director), the Director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to the Board's acceptance. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation, taking into account the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release, a filing with the SEC, or other broadly disseminated means of communication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation and the Board of Directors in making its decision may each consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant. Any Director who tenders his or her resignation as described above will not participate in the recommendation of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the Board of Directors with respect to his or her resignation. 
If the number of persons nominated for election as Directors as of ten days before the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting shall exceed the number of Directors to be elected, then the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. Because no persons other than the incumbent Directors have been nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting, the majority vote provisions will apply. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The advisory vote on executive compensation is non-binding, and the preference of the stockholders will be determined by the choice receiving the greatest number of votes. 
All Other Matters to be Voted Upon 
All other matters at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be determined by a majority of the votes cast. 
Abstentions 
Except as noted above, shares represented by proxies marked "abstain" with respect to the proposals described on the proxy card and by proxies marked to deny discretionary authority on other matters will not be counted in determining the vote obtained on such matters. 
Broker Non-Votes 
Under the rules of the NYSE, on certain routine matters, brokers may, at their discretion, vote shares they hold in "street name" on behalf of beneficial owners who have not returned voting instructions to the brokers. On all other matters, brokers are prohibited from voting uninstructed shares. In instances where brokers are prohibited from exercising discretionary authority (so-called broker non-votes), the shares they hold are not included in the vote totals. 
At the 2019 Annual Meeting, brokers will be prohibited from exercising discretionary authority with respect to each of the matters submitted other than the ratification of the auditors. As a result, for each of the matters upon which the brokers are prohibited from voting, the broker non-votes will have no effect on the results.

MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS 
Item No. 1 - Election of Directors 
Under our Bylaws, the Board of Directors has the authority to determine the size of the Board and to fill vacancies. Currently, the Board is comprised of 13 Directors, one of whom is an Executive Officer of AT&T. There are no vacancies on the Board. Under AT&T's Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Director will not be nominated by the Board for re-election if the Director would be 72 or older at the time of the election. 
Joyce M. Roché will retire at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will not stand for re-election. Accordingly, the Board has voted to reduce its size to 12 Directors effective immediately before the meeting. 
The Board of Directors has nominated the 12 persons listed below for election as Directors to one-year terms of office that would expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is an incumbent Director of AT&T recommended for re-election by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. In making these nominations, the Board reviewed the background of the nominees (each nominee's biography can be found beginning on the next page) and determined to nominate each of the current Directors for re-election, other than the retiring Director. 
The Board believes that each nominee has valuable individual skills, attributes, and experiences that, taken together, provide us with the variety and depth of knowledge, judgment and vision necessary to provide effective oversight of a large and varied enterprise like AT&T. As indicated in the following biographies, the nominees have significant leadership skills and extensive experience in a variety of fields, including telecommunications, technology, public accounting, health care, education, economics, financial services, law, operations, logistics, government service, public policy, academic research, consulting, and nonprofit organizations, each of which the Board believes provides valuable knowledge about important elements of AT&T's business. A number of the nominees also have extensive experience in international business and affairs, which the Board believes affords it an important global perspective in its deliberations. 
If one or more of the nominees should at the time of the meeting be unavailable or unable to serve as a Director, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted to elect the remaining nominees and any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Board knows of no reason why any of the nominees would be unavailable or unable to serve.

Item No. 2 - Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as Independent Auditors 
This proposal would ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of Ernst & Young LLP (EY) to serve as independent auditors of AT&T for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Audit Committee's decision to re-appoint our independent auditor was based on the following considerations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• quality and performance of the lead audit partner and the overall engagement team,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• knowledge of the telecommunications, media and enternainment, and technology industries and company operations,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• global capabilities and technical expertise,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• auditor independence and objectivity, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the potential impact of rotating to another independent audit firm.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee's oversight of EY includes regular private sessions with EY, discussions about audit scope and business imperatives, and—as described above—a comprehensive annual evaluation to determine whether to re-engage EY. Considerations concerning auditor independence include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limits on non-audit services: The Audit Committee preapproves audit and  permissible non-audit services provided by EY in accordance with its pre-approval policy.   
• Audit partner rotation: EY rotates the lead audit partner and other partners on the engagement consistent with  independence requirements. The Audit Committee oversees the selection of each new lead audit partner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EY's internal independence process: EY conducts periodic internal reviews of its audit and other work and  assesses the adequacy of partners and other personnel working on the Company's account.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong regulatory framework: EY, as an independent registered public accounting firm, is subject to PCAOB  inspections, "Big 4" peer reviews and PCAOB and SEC oversight.  
[END TABLE]
Based on these considerations, the Audit Committee believes that the selection of Ernst & Young LLP is in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Therefore, the Audit Committee recommends that stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Committee will reconsider its decision. One or more members of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will be able to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Item No. 3 - Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation 
This proposal would approve the compensation of Executive Officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables, and the accompanying narrative disclosures (see pages 40 through 75). These sections describe our executive compensation program. 
The Human Resources Committee is responsible for executive compensation and works to structure a balanced program that addresses the dynamic, global marketplace in which AT&T competes for talent. The compensation structure includes pay-for-performance and equity-based incentive programs and seeks to reward executives for attaining performance goals. 
AT&T submits this proposal to stockholders on an annual basis. While this is a non-binding, advisory vote, the Committee intends to take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. AT&T is providing this vote as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act.

         GUIDING PAY PRINCIPLES             
       (discussed in detail on page 40)          
     Alignment with Stockholders        
     Provide compensation elements and set performance targets that closely align executives' interests with  those of stockholders. For example, approximately 69% of target pay for NEOs is tied to stock price performance. In addition, we have executive stock ownership guidelines and stock holding requirements, as described on page 60. Each of the NEOs  exceeds the minimum stock ownership guidelines.        
     Competitive and Market Based        
     Evaluate all components of our compensation and benefits program in light of appropriate peer company  practices to ensure we are able to attract and retain world-class talent with the leadership abilities and experience necessary to develop and execute business strategies, obtain superior results, and build long-term stockholder value in an  organization as large and complex as AT&T.        
     Pay for Performance        
     Tie a significant portion of compensation to the achievement of predetermined goals and recognize individual  accomplishments that contribute to our success. For example, in 2018, 93% of the CEO's target compensation (and, on average, 89% for other NEOs) was variable and tied to short- and long-term performance incentives, including stock price  performance.        
     Balanced Short- and Long-Term Focus        
     Ensure that the compensation program provides an appropriate balance between the achievement of short-and  long-term performance objectives, with a clear emphasis on managing the sustainability of the business and mitigating risk.        
     Alignment with Generally Accepted Approaches        
     Provide policies and programs that fit within the framework of generally  accepted approaches adopted by leading major U.S. companies.

    Item No. 4 - Stockholder Proposal Independent Chair   Proposal 4 — Independent Board Chairman   Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require  henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not  violate any existing agreement.   If the Board  determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if  no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.   This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes  would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.   When considering a shareholder proposal such as this is good to remember the positive role that shareholder proposals have. For  instance AT&T adopted a policy requiring that senior executives retain a significant percentage of stock acquired through AT&T's equity pay programs until one year following the termination of their employment because Ray. T. Chevedden  submitted a proposal for this specific topic.   An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the  challenging day-to-day issues facing the company like the falling price of our stock over a 5-year period. Clearly our CEO needs  to focus on increasing the stock price (which has been lagging during a robust stock market) by enhancing the underlying core value of the company.   An independent board chairman would have more time to devote to improving the qualifications of our directors. For instance Joyce  Roché and Laura Tyson each had more than 19-years long-tenure. Long-tenure in a director is the opposite of independence. Ms. Tyson was also tainted by her Kodak experience.   The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally  different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company.     Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 4

An independent board chairman would have more time to devote to improving the qualifications of our directors. For instance Joyce  Roché and Laura Tyson each had more than 19-years long-tenure. Long-tenure in a director is the opposite of independence. Ms. Tyson was also tainted by her Kodak experience.   The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally  different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company.

    Item No. 4 - Stockholder Proposal Independent Chair   Proposal 4 — Independent Board Chairman   Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require  henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not  violate any existing agreement.   If the Board  determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if  no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.   This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes  would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.

T. Chevedden  submitted a proposal for this specific topic.   An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the  challenging day-to-day issues facing the company like the falling price of our stock over a 5-year period. Clearly our CEO needs  to focus on increasing the stock price (which has been lagging during a robust stock market) by enhancing the underlying core value of the company.   An independent board chairman would have more time to devote to improving the qualifications of our directors. For instance Joyce  Roché and Laura Tyson each had more than 19-years long-tenure. Long-tenure in a director is the opposite of independence. Ms. Tyson was also tainted by her Kodak experience.   The roles of Chairman and CEO are fundamentally  different and should be held by 2 directors, a CEO and a Chairman who is completely independent of the CEO and our company.     Please vote yes: Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 4     
    Item No. 4 - Stockholder Proposal Independent Chair   Proposal 4 — Independent Board Chairman   Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as a policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require  henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not  violate any existing agreement.   If the Board  determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if  no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.   This proposal topic won 50%-plus support at 5 major U.S. companies in 2013 including 73%-support at Netflix. These 5 majority votes  would have been still higher if all shareholders had access to independent proxy voting advice.

Your Board of Directors believes that AT&T and its stockholders are best served by having Mr. Stephenson serve as both Chairman and CEO. 
At this juncture in our Company's history, your Board believes that the Company can more effectively execute its strategy and business plans to maximize stockholder value if the Chairman of the Board is also responsible for the Company's operations on a daily basis. At the same time, the Board believes that, as a matter of sound corporate governance, it is important to pair its Chairman with an independent Lead Director who is vested with substantial responsibility for all Board matters, including its oversight of management. To that end, the Board has again appointed an independent Lead Director (currently, Matthew K. Rose) who presides over regular executive sessions of the non-management members of the Board. Members of management do not attend these sessions. The Lead Director is also responsible for approving the agenda for each Board meeting, presiding at Board meetings at which the Chairman is not present, and acting as the principal liaison between the Chairman and CEO and the nonmanagement Directors. For a complete description of the Lead Director's responsibilities, please see page 18. 
As CEO, Mr. Stephenson is the only Director that is also a member of management. As a result, each committee of the Board other than the Executive Committee is made up solely of independent Directors. The appointment of an independent Lead Director and the use of executive sessions of the Board, along with the Board's strong committee system and substantial majority of independent Directors, allow the Board to maintain effective oversight of management. 
For these reasons, the Board does not support an inflexible policy that the CEO and Chairman roles should never be held by the same person. Instead, the Board has established what it believes to be an appropriate balance for AT&T based on the best interests of AT&T's stockholders and recommends a vote against this proposal.

THE ROLE OF THE BOARD 
The Board of Directors is responsible for oversight of management and strategic direction and for establishing broad corporate policies. In addition, the Board of Directors and various committees of the Board regularly meet to review and discuss operational and financial reports presented by the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and other members of management as well as reports by experts and other advisors. Corporate review sessions are also offered to Directors to give them more detailed views of our businesses, such as corporate opportunities, technology, and operations. 
Members of the Board are expected to attend Board meetings in person, unless the meeting is held by teleconference. The Board held 10 meetings in 2018. Directors are also expected to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. All Directors were present at the 2018 Annual Meeting. In 2018, all Directors attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the Committees on which each served. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board is responsible for overseeing our policies and procedures for assessing and managing risk. Management is responsible for assessing and managing our exposures to risk on a day-to-day basis, including the creation of appropriate risk management policies and procedures. Management also is responsible for informing the Board of our most significant risks and our plans for managing those risks. Annually, the Board reviews the Company's strategic business plans, which includes evaluating the competitive, technological, economic and other risks associated with these plans. 
In addition, under its charter, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies, as well as overseeing our compliance program, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and associated risks. This includes, among other matters, evaluating risk in the context of financial policies, counterparty and credit risk, and the appropriate mitigation of risk, including through the use of insurance where appropriate. Members of the Company's finance, internal audit, and compliance organizations are responsible for managing risk in their areas and reporting regularly to the Audit Committee. 
The Company's senior internal auditing executive and Chief Compliance Officer each meet annually in executive session with the Audit Committee. The senior internal auditing executive and Chief Compliance Officer review with the Audit Committee each year's annual internal audit and compliance risk assessment, which is focused on significant financial, operating, regulatory and legal matters. The Audit Committee also receives regular reports on completed internal audits of these significant risk areas. 
In addition, the Audit Committee, as well as the Board of Directors, receive reports from responsible officers on cybersecurity. The AT&T Chief Security Office establishes policy and requirements for the security of AT&T's computing and networking environments.

Randall Stephenson currently serves as both Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that having Mr. Stephenson serve in both capacities is in the best interests of AT&T and its stockholders because it enhances communication between the Board and management and allows Mr. Stephenson to more effectively execute the Company's strategic initiatives and business plans and confront its challenges. The Board believes that the appointment of a strong independent Lead Director and the use of regular executive sessions of the non-management Directors, along with the Board's strong committee system and substantial majority of independent Directors, allow it to maintain effective oversight of management.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a substantial majority of our Board of Directors consist of independent Directors. In addition, the NYSE Listing Standards require a majority of the Board and every member of the Audit Committee, Human Resources Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to be independent. For a Director to be "independent" under the NYSE standards, the Board must affirmatively determine that the Director has no material relationship with AT&T, either directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with AT&T, other than in his or her capacity as a Director of AT&T. In addition, the Director must meet certain independence standards specified by the NYSE as well as the additional standards referenced in our Corporate Governance Guidelines (found at www.att.com). 
Using these standards for determining the independence of its members, the Board has determined that the following Directors are independent: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Samuel A. Di Piazza, Jr.     Beth E. Mooney 
 Richard W. Fisher     Joyce M. Roché 
 Scott T. Ford     Matthew K. Rose 
 Glenn H. Hutchins     Cynthia B. Taylor 
 William E. Kennard     Laura D'Andrea Tyson 
 Michael B. McCallister     Geoffrey Y. Yang 
[END TABLE]
In addition, each member of the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and the Human Resources Committee is independent. 
In determining the independence of the Directors, the Board considered the following commercial relationships between AT&T and companies at which our Directors serve as Executive Officers: payments by AT&T for the use of rights of way and facilities at Burlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC, where Mr. Rose serves as CEO; and interest paid from participation in a structured finance program through KeyCorp, where Ms. Mooney serves as CEO. In addition, each of the foregoing companies as well as each of the entities where Mr. Ford, Ms. Taylor, and Mr. Yang serve as executive officers purchased communications services from subsidiaries of AT&T. In each case for the year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The relevant products and services were provided by AT&T or to AT&T on terms determined on an arm's-length basis that were comparable to the terms provided to or by similarly situated customers or suppliers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The transactions were made in the ordinary course of business of each company; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total payments by AT&T to the Director's company (for rights of way or for interest) or to AT&T by the  Director's company (for communications services) were each substantially less than 1% of the consolidated gross revenues of each of AT&T and the other company. This level is significantly below the maximum amount permitted under the NYSE  listing standards for director independence (i.e., 2% of consolidated gross revenues).

We share the feedback from this engagement with the Board and incorporate it into our policies and practices.

ANNUAL MULTI-STEP BOARD EVALUATIONS 
Each year, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Lead Director lead the Board through three evaluations: a Board self-evaluation, Committee self-evaluations, and peer evaluations. Through this process, Directors provide feedback, assess performance, and identify areas where improvement can be made. We believe this approach supports the Board's effectiveness and continuous improvement.

HOW TO SUBMIT A PROPOSAL FOR NEXT YEAR

Since the Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be held on April 26, 2019, written notice of any such proposal or nomination must be received by the Company no earlier than December 28, 2019 and no later than January 27, 2020. In addition, such proposal or nomination must meet certain other requirements and provide such additional information as provided in the Company's Bylaws. A copy of the Company's Bylaws may be obtained without charge from the Senior Vice President and Secretary of AT&T. Special notice provisions apply under the Bylaws if the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or 70 days after the anniversary date. 
Stockholder proposals intended to be included in the proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received by November 12, 2019. Such proposals should be sent in writing by courier or certified mail to the Senior Vice President and Secretary of AT&T at 208 S. Akard Street, Suite 2954, Dallas, Texas 75202.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Under the rules of the SEC, public issuers, such as AT&T, must disclose certain "Related Person Transactions." These are transactions in which the Company is a participant where the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and a Director, Executive Officer, or holder of more than 5% of our common stock has a direct or indirect material interest. 
AT&T has adopted a written policy requiring that each Director or Executive Officer involved in such a transaction notify the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and that each such transaction be approved or ratified by the Committee. 
In determining whether to approve a Related Person Transaction, the Committee will consider the following factors, among others, to the extent relevant to the Related Person Transaction: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the Related Person Transaction are fair to the Company and on the same basis as would apply if the  transaction did not involve a related person,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether there are business reasons for the Company to enter into the Related Person Transaction,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the Related Person Transaction would impair the independence of an outside director, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the Related Person Transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any of our Directors or  Executive Officers, taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the Director, Executive Officer or other related person, the direct or indirect nature of the Director's, Executive Officer's or other related  person's interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and any other factors the Committee deems relevant.  
[END TABLE]
A Related Person Transaction entered into without the Committee's pre-approval will not violate this policy, or be invalid or unenforceable, so long as the transaction is brought to the Committee as promptly as reasonably practical after it is entered into or after it becomes reasonably apparent that the transaction is covered by this policy. 
The employment of the following persons was approved by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee under the Company's Related Party Transactions Policy. The rate of pay for each of these employees is similar to those paid for comparable positions at the Company. During 2018, a sister-in-law of John Stankey, Chief Executive Officer, Warner Media, LLC, was employed by a subsidiary with an approximate rate of pay, including commissions, of $132,530. Also during 2018, a brother of John Donovan, Chief Executive Officer, AT&T Communications, LLC, was employed by a subsidiary with an approximate rate of pay, including commissions, of $197,376. In addition, during 2018, a son of William Blase, Senior Executive Vice President – Human Resources, was employed by a subsidiary with an approximate rate of pay, including commissions, of $127,943. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The compensation of Directors is determined by the Board with the advice of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is composed entirely of independent Directors. None of our employees serve on this Committee. The Committee's current members are Matthew K. Rose (Chair), Richard W. Fisher, William E. Kennard, Beth E. Mooney and Joyce M. Roché. Under its charter, the Committee annually reviews the compensation and benefits provided to Directors for their service and makes recommendations to the Board for changes. This includes not only Director retainers, but also Director compensation and benefit plans. 
The Committee's charter authorizes the Committee to employ independent compensation and other consultants to assist in fulfilling its duties. From time to time, the Committee engages a compensation consultant to advise the Committee and to provide information regarding director compensation paid by other public companies, which may be used by the Committee to make compensation recommendations to the Board. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer may make recommendations to the Committee or the Board about types and amounts of appropriate compensation and benefits for Directors. Directors who are employed by us or one of our subsidiaries receive no separate compensation for serving as directors or as members of Board committees. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
The Company offers Directors both cash and equity compensation. Cash compensation comes in the form of an annual cash retainer that may be deferred and earn interest at the election of a Director. Equity is offered both as an annual grant and as an opportunity to defer the cash compensation into deferred stock units. The value of deferred stock units is based on the stock price and is converted to a cash payout after retiring from the Board.

[END TABLE]
Under the Non-Employee Director Stock and Deferral Plan (the Director Plan) each non-employee Director annually receives a grant of deferred stock units. Each deferred stock unit is equivalent to a share of AT&T stock and earns dividend equivalents in the form of additional deferred stock units. The annual grants are fully earned and vested at issuance and are distributed beginning in the calendar year after the Director leaves the Board. At distribution, the deferred stock units are converted to cash based on the then price of AT&T stock and are paid either in a lump sum or in up to 15 annual installments. Beginning in 2016, the deferred stock units had a grant date value of $170,000. To determine the number of deferred stock units granted, we calculate the nominal value of the award, which is the value that would yield the grant date value after applying an illiquidity discount. We use the average remaining tenure of the non-employee Directors as the discount period. We then divide the nominal value by the price of AT&T stock on the grant date to determine the number of deferred stock units issued. The nominal value of the award before application of the discount was $231,924 in 2018. Beginning in 2019, the Company will annually issue Directors $220,000 in deferred stock units without an illiquidity discount and the Chair Retainers will increase by $5,000 for the Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, and Corporate Development and Finance Committees. 
Additionally, Directors may defer the receipt of their retainers into either additional deferred stock units or into a cash deferral account under the Director Plan. Directors purchase the deferred stock units at the fair market value of AT&T common stock. Deferrals into the cash deferral account under the plan earn interest during the calendar year at a rate equal to the Moody's Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for September of the preceding year (Moody's Rate). Directors may annually choose to convert their cash deferral accounts into deferred stock units at the fair market value of our stock at the time of the conversion. Directors may also use all or part of their retainers to purchase AT&T stock at fair market value under the Non-Employee Director Stock Purchase Plan. 
To the extent earnings on cash deferrals under the Director Plan exceed the interest rate specified by the SEC for disclosure purposes, they are included in the "Director Compensation" table on page 28 under the heading "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings." 
Non-employee Directors may receive communications equipment and services pursuant to the AT&T Board of Directors Communications Concession Program. The equipment and services that may be provided to a Director, other than equipment at his or her primary residence, may not exceed $25,000 per year. All concession services must be provided by AT&T affiliates, except that the Director may use another provider for the Director's primary residence if it is not served by an AT&T affiliate.

Note (b). Stock Awards 
Amounts in this column represent the annual grant of deferred stock units that are immediately vested but are not distributed until after the retirement of the Director. The grant date value was determined by applying an illiquidity discount of 26.7%. The illiquidity discount was determined by taking the average expected remaining tenure of the Directors (8.2 years) and then using that average to calculate the illiquidity discount under FASB ASC Topic 718. The nominal value of each award (before applying the discount) was $231,924. The deferred stock units will be paid out in cash in the calendar year after the Director ceases his or her service with the Board, at the times elected by the Director. The aggregate number of stock awards outstanding at December 31, 2018, for each Director can be found in the "Common Stock Ownership" section beginning on page 29.

Represents number of vested stock units held by the Director or Executive Officer, where each stock unit is equal in value to one share of AT&T stock. The stock units are paid in stock or cash depending upon the plan and the election of the participant at times specified by the relevant plan. None of the stock units listed may be converted into common stock within 60 days of the date of this table. As noted under "Compensation of Directors," AT&T's plans permit non-employee Directors to acquire stock units (also referred to as deferred stock units) by deferring the receipt of retainers into stock units and through a yearly grant of stock units. Officers may acquire stock units by participating in stock-based compensation deferral plans. Stock units carry no voting rights.

AUDIT COMMITTEE 
AT&T has a separately designated standing Audit Committee. The Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which may be viewed on the Company's web site at www.att.com. The Audit Committee performs a review and reassessment of its charter annually. The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of AT&T's financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors, and AT&T's compliance with legal and regulatory matters. 
The Audit Committee is composed entirely of independent Directors in accordance with the applicable independence standards of the New York Stock Exchange and AT&T. The members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Di Piazza (Chairman), Mr. McCallister, Ms. Taylor, and Dr. Tyson, each of whom was appointed by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Di Piazza and Ms. Taylor are "audit committee financial experts" and are independent as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and in accordance with AT&T's additional standards. Although the Board of Directors has determined that these individuals have the requisite attributes defined under the rules of the SEC, their responsibilities are the same as those of the other Audit Committee members. They are not AT&T's auditors or accountants, do not perform "field work" and are not full-time employees. The SEC has determined that an audit committee member who is designated as an audit committee financial expert will not be deemed to be an "expert" for any purpose as a result of being identified as an audit committee financial expert. 
PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of management in the preparation of AT&T's financial statements and financial disclosures. The Audit Committee relies on the information provided by management and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee does not have the duty to plan or conduct audits or to determine that AT&T's financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate. AT&T's Audit Committee charter provides that these are the responsibility of management and the independent auditors. 
Independent Auditor Oversight 
The Audit Committee has oversight of the Company's relationship with the independent auditor and is directly responsible for the annual appointment, compensation and retention of the independent auditor. The independent auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee. 
Financial Reporting Review 
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and the independent auditor: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any major issues regarding accounting principles and financial statement presentations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• earnings press releases and other financial disclosures.  
[END TABLE]
Internal Audit Oversight 
The Audit Committee oversees the activities of the Company's senior internal auditing executive, including internal audit's assessment of operational and financial risks and associated internal controls. Significant internal audit reports and corrective action status are regularly discussed with the Audit Committee. 
Risk Review 
The Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies. This includes, among other matters, evaluating risk in the context of financial policies, counterparty and credit risk, and the appropriate mitigation of risk, including through the use of insurance where appropriate. 
Compliance Oversight 
The Audit Committee meets with the Company's Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) regarding the CCO's assessment of the Company's compliance and ethics risks, the effectiveness of the Company's Corporate Compliance Program, and any other compliance related matters that either the Committee or the CCO deems appropriate. The Audit Committee oversees the administration and enforcement of the Company's Code of Business Conduct, Code of Ethics, and Corporate Compliance Program. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES 
Ernst & Young LLP acts as AT&T's principal auditor and also provides certain audit-related, tax and other services. The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy for services to be performed by Ernst & Young. Under this policy, the Audit Committee approves specific engagements when the engagements have been presented in reasonable detail to the Audit Committee before services are undertaken. 
This policy also allows for the approval of certain services in advance of the Audit Committee being presented details concerning the specific service to be undertaken. These services must meet service definitions and fee limitations previously established by the Audit Committee. Additionally, engagements exceeding $500,000 must receive advance concurrence from the Audit Committee Chairman. After an auditor is engaged under this authority, the services must be described in reasonable detail to the Audit Committee at the next meeting. 
All pre-approved services must commence, if at all, within 14 months of the approval. 
The fees for services provided by Ernst & Young (all of which were pre-approved by the Audit Committee) to AT&T in 2018 and 2017 are shown below.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Executive Summary 
Our Human Resources Committee (Committee) takes great care to develop and refine an executive compensation program that recognizes its stewardship responsibility to our stockholders while ensuring the availability of talent to support a culture of growth, innovation, and performance in an extraordinarily large and complex organization. 
In this section, we summarize the elements of our compensation program, how our program supports pay for performance, and our key performance achievements. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The foundation of our program     Our Committee believes that our programs should:    Page 40 
 The foundation of our program     Our Committee believes that our programs should:    Page 40 
    –  be competitive and market-based,     
    –  pay for performance,     
    –  balance both short- and long-term focus, and     
    –  be aligned with generally accepted approaches.     
    To that end, we incorporate many best practices in our compensation program  and avoid ones that are not aligned with our guiding pay principles.      
Stockholder Engagement     Each year, we engage with large stockholders to understand their views on  executive compensation. In light of their feedback, results of the stockholder advisory vote on our executive compensation program, and market trends, the Committee adjusts our compensation program periodically as it determines to be  appropriate.    Page 41 
 Our compensation program elements and  percentage of pay tied to performance and stock price       Our program includes a number of different elements, from  fixed compensation (base salaries) to performance-based variable compensation (short- and long-term incentives), to key benefits, which minimize distractions and allow our executives to focus on our success.

How we make compensation decisions     The starting point for determining Executive Officer compensation is an  evaluation of market data. Our consultant compiles compensation information for our Peer Group companies and then presents this information to our Committee for it to consider when making compensation decisions. Our Peer Group companies were chosen  based on their similarity to AT&T on a number of factors, including alignment with our business, scale, and/or complexity.    Page 43

2019 PROGRAM ENHANCEMENT 
The Committee has approved the use of Net-Debt-to-Adjusted-EBITDA as a performance metric with a 20% weighting for determining 2019 short-term incentive awards (payable 2020) for all Executive Officers. 
The narrative on the following pages more fully describes how the Committee, with the input of its consultant, has designed and evolved our Executive Officer compensation and benefits program using the Committee's guiding pay principles as the pillars of the program. We also outline how we establish pay targets and how actual Executive Officer pay is determined. Finally, we provide a description of other benefits.

Our Committee has designed an executive compensation program that encourages our leaders to produce outstanding financial and operational results, create sustainable long-term value for our stockholders, and lead the company with ethics and integrity. Our guiding pay principles are: 
Alignment with Stockholders 
Provide compensation elements and set performance targets that closely align executives' interests with those of stockholders. For example, approximately 69% of target pay for NEOs is tied to stock price performance. In addition, we have executive stock ownership guidelines and stock holding requirements, as described on page 60. 
Competitive and Market Based 
Evaluate all components of our compensation and benefits program in light of appropriate peer company practices to ensure we are able to attract and retain world-class talent with the leadership abilities and experience necessary to develop and execute business strategies, obtain superior results, and build long-term stockholder value in an organization as large and complex as AT&T. 
Pay for Performance 
Tie a significant portion of compensation to the achievement of predetermined goals and recognize individual accomplishments that contribute to our success. For example, in 2018, 93% of the CEO's target compensation (and, on average, 89% for other NEOs) was variable and tied to short- and long-term performance incentives, including stock price performance. 
Balanced Short- and Long-Term Focus 
Ensure that the compensation program provides an appropriate balance between the achievement of short- and long-term performance objectives, with a clear emphasis on managing the sustainability of the business and mitigating risk. 
Alignment with Generally Accepted Approaches 
Provide policies and programs that fit within the framework of generally accepted approaches adopted by leading major U.S. companies. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
These guiding pay principles serve as the pillars of our compensation and benefits program and any potential changes to the program are evaluated in light of their ability to help us meet these goals.

The consultant reviewed the market data for the Peer Group with members of management and the CEO (for Executive Officers other than himself) to confirm the job matches and scoping of market data based on the relative value of each position and differences in responsibilities between our jobs and those in the comparator groups. After completing this review, the consultant presented the market data to the Committee. 
The Committee used the market data and the CEO's compensation recommendations for the other Executive Officers and then applied its judgment and experience to set Executive Officer compensation for the coming year. When setting compensation, the Committee may determine that Executive Officers with significant experience and responsibilities or who demonstrate exemplary performance have higher target compensation, while other Executive Officers may have lower target compensation.

 Determination of Performance Goal     Performance Below Target Range 
 We established a performance target range of 6.50% to 7.50% at the beginning of the 3-year  performance period. This target range does not reward or penalize Executive Officers for performance achievement within close proximity to the midpoint of the range. The lower end of the performance target range was set so that it exceeded our  internally calculated cost of capital (determined, in part, based on input from banks) by 75 basis points, ensuring a reasonable return is delivered to stockholders before Executive Officers are eligible for full payout of their target  award.     No payout is earned if less than 65% of the performance target range is achieved. Achievement below the target range results in  decreasing levels of award payout. The payout drops to 0% of the Performance Shares tied to this metric if less than 65% of the low end of the target range is achieved.   Performance Within Target Range   100% payout if performance falls within the target range.   Performance Above Target Range   Maximum payout of 150% is earned if 137% or more of the performance  target range is achieved. Achievement above the target range provides for higher levels of award payout, up to the maximum payout.

 After conclusion of the performance period, the Committee determined (using the ROIC payout table) that we achieved  7.56%, which was above the ROIC target range, and 181 basis points above the cost of capital we established based on input from banks. As a result, the Committee directed that 101% of the related Performance Shares be  distributed in accordance with the payout table as follows. Our actual performance attainment is also shown:

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
In this section we detail how each NEO's compensation was impacted by performance attainment. The following tables summarize the compensation our NEOs realized in 2018. The long-term values below do not align to what is reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table (SCT) because the SCT reflects long-term grant values for 2018 whereas these tables show the values of the long-term distributions for awards with performance/restriction periods ending in 2018 or early 2019. 
AT&T's 2018 performance highlights are summarized on page 38.

[END TABLE]
(1) These amounts represent the rounded value of the awards on February 1, 2018, the date the Committee authorized the awards; however, the final terms of the Performance Share grants were not determined until March 29, 2018, which is the grant date for valuation of the awards in the Summary Compensation Table. 
(2) Target value includes the value of supplemental long-term grants made upon the Time Warner merger close. The grants made were in the same form (weight 75% Performance Shares and 25% Restricted Stock Units) and subject to the same terms and conditions as the annual grants. 
2018 Performance Share Grants 
The Performance Shares granted in 2018 are for the 2018-2020 performance period. The Committee determined that the Performance Shares would be tied to a ROIC performance metric with a payout modifier based on a comparison of AT&T's TSR to our 22-company Peer Group (as shown on page 43). 
ROIC Performance Metric 
We calculate ROIC for the 2018-2020 performance period by averaging over the three-year performance period: (1) our annual reported net income plus after-tax interest expense minus minority interest, divided by (2) the total of the average debt and average stockholder equity for the relevant year. For mergers and acquisitions over $2.0 billion, we exclude the dilutive impacts of intangible amortization, asset write-offs, accelerated depreciation, and transaction and restructuring costs so that the impact of certain significant transactions, including those which may not have been contemplated in the determination of a performance metric, will not have an impact on the performance results. We also exclude the net impact of certain of the following items after taxes and available collectible insurance, if they exceed, individually or in certain combinations, $500 million in a calendar year and satisfy other conditions; changes in tax laws, changes in accounting principles (except for the impacts of Revenue Recognition under ASC 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"), expenses caused by natural disasters or intentionally caused damage to the Company's property, and non-cash accounting write-downs of goodwill, other intangible assets and fixed assets. Additionally, we disregard gains and losses related to the assets and liabilities of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans (and associated tax effects). 
The ROIC target range for the 2018-2020 performance period was set 100 basis points above our cost of capital, a target that we believe to be challenging, but attainable. For performance above or below the performance target range, the number of Performance Shares are increased or reduced, respectively. Potential payouts range from 0% to 150% of the number of Performance Shares granted. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
TSR Performance Modifier 
This measure compares our TSR (stock appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) relative to that of the 22 companies in our Peer Group. We believe that TSR is an important measure because it helps ensure that our executives remain focused on the value they are delivering to our stockholders.

 Quartile 4       Subtract 10 Percentage Points from Final ROIC Payout Percentage   
[END TABLE]
Award payouts will be determined based on our TSR performance relative to our 22-company Peer Group shown on page 43. These companies are the same ones that comprise the Peer Group used to assess market- based compensation for 2018. TSR performance will be measured over the entire performance period. 
At the end of the performance period, the number of Performance Shares to be paid out, if any, will be determined by comparing the actual performance of the Company against the predetermined performance objective for ROIC, and modifying the award for relative TSR achievement, if applicable. Performance Shares, if earned, are paid 34% in stock, 66% in cash. 
2018 Restricted Stock Unit Grants 
RSUs granted in 2018 vest 100% after four years or upon retirement eligibility, whichever occurs earlier, but do not pay out until the scheduled distribution date. These RSUs receive quarterly dividend equivalents, paid in cash, at the time regular dividends are paid on our stock. RSUs pay 100% in stock to further tie executive and stockholder interests. 
RISK MITIGATION 
By ensuring that a significant portion of compensation is based on our long-term performance, we reduce the risk that executives will place too much focus on short-term achievements to the detriment of our long-term sustainability. Our short-term incentive compensation is structured so that the accomplishment of short-term goals supports the achievement of long-term goals. These elements work together for the benefit of AT&T and our stockholders and to reduce risk in our incentive plans. 
CLAWBACK POLICY 
In addition to the risk moderation actions, we intend, in appropriate circumstances, to seek restitution of any bonus, commission, or other compensation received by an employee as a result of such employee's intentional or knowing fraudulent or illegal conduct, including the making of a material misrepresentation in our financial statements. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
BENEFITS AND POLICIES 
Benefits and Personal Benefits 
Benefits are an important tool to maintain the market competitiveness of our overall compensation package. We provide personal benefits to our Executive Officers for three main reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To effectively compete for talent: We must have a program that is robust and competitive  enough to attract and retain key talent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To support Executive Officers in meeting the needs of the business: We require the around-the-clock commitment and availability of our Executive Officers. Therefore, we provide benefits that allow us to have greater access to them. These benefits should not  be measured solely in terms of any incremental financial cost, but rather the value they bring to us through maximized productivity and availability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To provide for the safety, security, and personal health of executives: We provide  Executive Officers certain personal benefits to provide for their safety and personal health.  
[END TABLE]
Benefits for our Executive Officers are outlined below. The Committee continues to evaluate our personal benefits based on needs of the business and market practices/trends. 
Benefits 
WarnerMedia employees did not participate in the following plans in 2018: 
Deferral Opportunities 
Tax-qualified 401(k) Plans 
Our 401(k) plans offer substantially all employees, including each of the NEOs, the opportunity to defer income and receive company matching contributions. Substantially all of our plans provide our employees the ability to invest in AT&T or other investments. We match 80% of employee contributions, limited to the first 6% of cash compensation (only base salary is matched for officers). Employees hired externally on or after January 1, 2015, do not receive a pension, and to account for the lack of a pension benefit, we increased the 401(k) match to 100% of the first 6% of eligible contributions for these employees. 
Nonqualified Plans 
We provide mid-level and above managers the opportunity for tax-advantaged savings through two nonqualified plans: 
• Stock Purchase and Deferral Plan 
This is our principal nonqualified deferral program, which we use as a way to encourage our managers to invest in and hold AT&T stock on a tax-deferred basis. Under this plan, mid-level managers and above may annually elect to defer, through payroll deductions, up to 30% of their salary and annual bonus (officers, including the NEOs, may defer up to 95% of their short-term award, which is similar to, and paid in lieu of, the annual bonus paid to other management employees) to purchase AT&T deferred share units at fair market value on a tax-deferred basis. Participants receive a 20% match on their deferrals in the form of additional AT&T deferred share units. Participants also receive makeup matching deferred AT&T share units to replace the match that is not available in the 401(k) because of their participation in our nonqualified deferral plans or because they exceeded the IRS compensation limits for 401(k) plans. Officers do not receive the makeup match on the contribution of their short-term awards. 
• Cash Deferral Plan 
Through this plan, eligible managers may also defer cash compensation in the form of salaries and bonuses. The plan pays interest at the Moody's Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average, reset annually, which is a common index used by companies for deferral plans. The SEC requires disclosure in the "Summary Compensation Table" of any earnings on deferred compensation that exceed an amount set by the SEC. 
These plans are described more fully on page 74. 
Pension Benefits 
We offer a tax-qualified group pension plan to substantially all of our managers. However, managers hired externally on or after January 1, 2015, who would otherwise be eligible to participate in the pension plan will instead receive an enhanced match in the 401(k) plan. 
We also provide supplemental retirement benefits under nonqualified pension plans, or SERPs, to employees who became officers before 2009. Additional information on pension benefits, including these plans, may be found beginning on page 68, following the "Pension Benefits" table.

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Committee has established stock ownership guidelines for all Executive Officers, as follows. We include vested shares held in our benefit plans in determining attainment of these guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO    6X Base Salary 
 Executive Officers     Lesser of 3X Base Salary or 50,000 Shares

NEO stock holdings as of December 31, 2018, can be found in the "Common Stock Ownership" section beginning on page 29. As of December 31, 2018, Randall Stephenson held 2,175,574 vested shares of AT&T stock, a multiple of 34 times his base salary, well exceeding his 
 6X requirement. In addition, Mr. Stephenson also holds 633,226 shares of vested RSUs, which are subject to a retention period, making his total vested shares a multiple of 44 times his base pay. 
Retention of Awards 
Executive Officers are required to hold shares equivalent, in aggregate, to 25% of the AT&T shares they receive (after taxes and exercise costs) from an incentive, equity, or option award granted to them after January 1, 2012, until they terminate employment with AT&T. 
Hedging Policy 
Executive officers are prohibited from hedging their AT&T stock or stock based awards, including through trading in publicly-traded options, puts, calls, or other derivative instruments related to AT&T stock. 
ROLE OF THE COMPENSATION CONSULTANT 
The Committee is authorized by its charter to employ independent compensation consultants and other advisors. The Committee has selected Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc.

EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS 
Messrs. Donovan, Stankey, and Stephens 
Both the 2011 Incentive Plan and the 2016 Incentive Plan provide that in the event an employee retires while retirement eligible under the plan, an award of Performance Shares will be prorated based on the number of months worked during the performance period. AT&T has provided that Performance Shares granted after September 28, 2017, to Messrs. Donovan, Stankey, or Stephens will not be prorated if they remain employed through December 30, 2020. Further, the Company has agreed that their Performance Shares shall not be prorated if (a) they report to an officer or employee of the Company or any of its affiliates other than the Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Inc.; or (b) if the Company creates a higher-level position (e.g., Vice Chairman or Chief Operating Officer of AT&T Inc.) and they are not placed in that role or an equivalent role. 
Mr. Stankey 
Following the acquisition of DIRECTV, AT&T entered into an agreement with Mr. Stankey, whose responsibilities included the oversight of DIRECTV operations. The Company agreed to reimburse him for state and local income taxes that he incurred while on business travel outside of Texas (Texas is his primary work location and residence) as well as the income taxes owed on the reimbursement of such state and local income taxes. Amounts reimbursed are reported annually in the Summary Compensation Table under All Other Compensation. Upon Mr. Stankey being reassigned to oversee merger integration planning for our acquisition of WarnerMedia on August 1, 2017, this agreement no longer applied to subsequent compensation. 
Upon closing of the acquisition of WarnerMedia, Mr. Stankey was appointed CEO of WarnerMedia. Subsequently, as part of his new position, he is expected to engage in extensive business travel, which will require him to file state and local income tax returns in a number of jurisdictions. AT&T has agreed to reimburse Mr. Stankey for any legal fees he incurs in the defense of his state and local income tax returns.

 the number of outstanding Performance Shares and their theoretical value based on the price of AT&T stock on December 31, 2018. In calculating the number of Performance Shares and their value, we are required by SEC rules to compare the Company's performance through 2018 for each outstanding Performance Share grant against the threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for the grant and report in this column the applicable potential payout amount. If the performance is between levels, we are required to report the potential payout at the next highest level. For example, if the previous fiscal year's performance exceeded target, even if it is by a small amount and even if it is highly unlikely that we will pay the maximum amount, we are required by SEC rules to report the awards using the maximum potential payouts. The performance measure for the 2017 and 2018 grants is ROIC with a payout adjustment for relative TSR achievement. As of the end of 2018, the ROIC achievement for each of the 2017 and 2018 grants was at target while the TSR performance was in the bottom quartile of the peer group. As a result, the grants were reported at the target for ROIC reduced for TSR performance.

Note 1. 
Pension benefits reflected in the above table were determined using the methodology and material assumptions set forth in the 2018 AT&T Annual Report to Stockholders in Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Pension and Postretirement Benefits," except that, as required by SEC regulations, the assumed retirement age is the specified normal retirement age in the plan unless the plan provides a younger age at which benefits may be received without a discount based on age, in which case the younger age is used. For the Nonbargained Program under the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan and the Pension Benefit Make Up Plan, the assumed retirement age is the date a participant is at least age 55 and meets the "modified rule of 75," which requires certain combinations of age and service that total at least 75. For the Management Cash Balance Program under the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, the assumed retirement age for the cash balance formula is age 65. For the AT&T SRIP and its successor, the 2005 SERP, the assumed retirement age is the earlier of the date the participant reaches age 60 or has 30 years of service (the age at which an employee may retire without discounts for age). 
The SRIP/SERP benefits are reduced for benefits available under the qualified plans and by a specified amount that approximates benefits available under other nonqualified plans included in the table. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN 
We offer post-retirement benefits, in various forms, to nearly all our managers. The AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, a "qualified pension plan" under the Internal Revenue Code, covers nearly all of our employees hired before 2015, including each of the NEOs. The applicable benefit accrual formula depends on the subsidiaries that have employed the participant. Effective January 1, 2015, no new management employees are eligible for a pension. However, they do receive an enhanced 401(k) benefit. 
Nonbargained Program 
Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Stankey are covered by the Nonbargained Program of the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, which is offered to most of our pre-2007 management employees. Participants in the Nonbargained Program receive the greater of the benefit determined under the CAM formula or the cash balance formula, each of which is described below. 
CAM Formula 
For each of Mr. Stephenson, Mr. Stephens, and Mr. Stankey the greater benefit comes from the CAM formula, which is reported in the Pension Benefits table. The CAM formula provides an annual benefit equal to 1.6% of the participant's average pension-eligible compensation (generally, base pay, commissions, and annual bonuses, but not officer bonuses paid to individuals promoted to officer level before January 1, 2009) for the five years ended December 31, 1999, multiplied by the number of years of service through the end of the December 31, 1999, averaging period, plus 1.6% of the participant's pension-eligible compensation thereafter. Employees who meet the "modified rule of 75" and are at least age 55 are eligible to retire without age or service discounts. The "modified rule of 75" establishes retirement eligibility when certain combinations of age and service total at least 75. 
Cash Balance Formula 
The cash balance formula was frozen, except for interest credits, on January 14, 2005. The cash balance formula provided an accrual equal to 5% of pension-eligible compensation plus monthly interest credits on the participant's cash balance account. The interest rate is reset quarterly and is equal to the published average annual yield for the 30-year Treasury Bond as of the middle month of the preceding quarter. The program permits participants to take the benefit in various actuarially equivalent forms, including various forms of life annuities or, for participants terminating on or after May 25, 2018 and receiving their benefit on or after June 1, 2018, this program permits participants to take the benefit in a full lump sum calculated as the present value of the annuity. 
Management Cash Balance Program 
Mr. Donovan and Mr. McAtee are covered by the MCB Program of the AT&T Pension Benefit Plan, which is offered to our management employees hired on or after January 1, 2007 (January 1, 2006 for AT&T Mobility) and before January 1, 2015. After completing one year of service, participants in the MCB Program are entitled to receive a cash balance benefit equal to the monthly credit of an age graded basic credit formula ranging from 1.75% to 4% of the participant's pension-eligible compensation and a 2% supplemental credit for eligible compensation in excess of Social Security Wage Base plus monthly interest credit at an effective annual rate of 4.5% to the participant's cash balance account. This program permits participants to take the benefit in various actuarially equivalent forms, including an annuity or a lump sum. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
NONQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS 
To the extent the Internal Revenue Code places limits on the amounts that may be earned under a qualified pension plan, managers instead receive these amounts under the nonqualified Pension Benefit Make Up Plan but only for periods prior to the person becoming a participant in the SRIP/SERP, described below. The Pension Benefit Make Up Plan benefit is paid in the form of a 10-year annuity or in a lump sum if the present value of the annuity is less than $50,000. 
In addition, we offer our Executive Officers and other officers (who became officers prior to 2005) supplemental retirement benefits under the SRIP and, for those serving as officers between 2005-2008, its successor, the 2005 SERP, as additional retention tools. As a result of changes in the tax laws, beginning December 31, 2004, participants ceased accruing benefits under the SRIP, the original supplemental plan. After December 31, 2004, benefits are earned under the SERP. Participants make separate distribution elections (annuity or lump sum) for benefits earned and vested before 2005 (under the SRIP) and for benefits accrued during and after 2005 (under the SERP). Elections for the portion of the pension that accrued in and after 2005, however, must have been made when the officer first participated in the SERP. Vesting in the SERP requires five years of service (including four years of participation in the SERP). Each of the eligible NEOs is vested in the SERP. Regardless of the payment form, no benefits under the SERP are payable until six months after termination of employment. An officer's benefits under these nonqualified pension plans are reduced by: (1) benefits due under qualified AT&T pension plans and (2) a specific amount that approximates the value of the officer's benefit under other nonqualified pension plans, determined generally as of December 31, 2008. These supplemental benefits are neither funded by nor are a part of the qualified pension plan. 
Each of the NEOs, except for Mr. McAtee, is eligible to receive SRIP/SERP benefits. Since January 1, 2009, no new officer has been permitted to participate in the SERP.  
Calculation of Benefit 
Under the SRIP/SERP, the target annual retirement benefit is stated as a percentage of a participant's annual salary and annual incentive bonus averaged over a specified period described below. The percentage is increased by 0.715% for each year of actual service in excess of, or decreased by 1.43% (0.715% for mid-career hires) for each year of actual service below, 30 years of service. In the event the participant retires before reaching age 60, a discount of 0.5% for each month remaining until the participant attains age 60 is applied to reduce the amount payable under this plan, except for officers who have 30 years or more of service at the time of retirement. Of the NEOs currently employed by the Company, only Mr. Stephenson and Mr. Stankey are eligible to retire without either an age or service discount under this plan. These benefits are also reduced by any amounts participants receive under AT&T qualified pension plans and by a frozen, specific amount that approximates the amount they receive under our other nonqualified pension plans, calculated as if the benefits under these plans were paid in the form of an immediate annuity for life. 
The salary and bonus used to determine the SRIP/SERP benefit amount is the average of the participant's salary and actual annual incentive bonuses earned during the 36-consecutive-month period that results in the highest average earnings that occurs during the 120 months preceding retirement. In some cases, the Committee may require the use of the target bonus, or a portion of the actual or target bonus, if it believes the actual bonus is not appropriate. Effective September 1, 2017, for Mr. Donovan and effective June 16, 2018, for Messrs. Stephens and Stankey, the annual earnings used in the SERP's "highest average earnings" is fixed at $3.0 million. 
The target annual retirement percentage for the Chief Executive Officer is 60%, and for other NEOs the target percentage ranges from 50% to 60%. Beginning in 2006, the target percentage was limited to 50% for all new participants (see note above on limiting new participants after 2008). If a benefit payment under the plan is delayed by the Company to comply with Federal law, the delayed amounts will earn interest at the rate the Company uses to accrue the present value of the liability, and the interest will be included in the appropriate column(s) in the "Pension Benefits" table. 
Mr. Stephenson's Benefit 
Mr. Stephenson's SERP benefit was modified in 2010. For purposes of calculating his SERP benefit, the Company froze his compensation as of June 30, 2010. He stopped accruing age and service credits as of December 31, 2012, at which time his benefit was determined as a lump sum amount, which thereafter earns interest. The discount rate for calculating the lump sum as well as the interest crediting rate is 5.8%. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Forms of Payment 
Annuity 
Participants may receive benefits as an annuity payable for the greater of the life of the participant or ten years. If the participant dies within ten years after leaving the Company, then payments for the balance of the ten years will be paid to the participant's beneficiary. Alternatively, the participant may elect to have the annuity payable for life with 100% or 50% payable upon his or her death to his or her beneficiary for the beneficiary's life. The amounts paid under each alternative (and the lump sum alternative described below) are actuarially equivalent. As noted above, separate distribution elections are made for pre-2005 benefits and 2005 and later benefits. 
Lump Sum 
Participants may elect that upon retirement at age 55 or later to receive the actuarially determined net present value of the benefit as a lump sum, rather than in the form of an annuity. To determine the net present value, we use the discount rate used for determining the projected benefit obligation at December 31 of the second calendar year prior to the year of retirement. Participants may also elect to take all or part of the net present value over a fixed period of years elected by the participant, not to exceed 20 years, earning interest at the same discount rate. A participant is not permitted to receive more than 30% of the net present value of the benefit before the third anniversary of the termination of employment, unless he or she is at least 60 years old at termination, in which case the participant may receive 100% of the net present value of the benefit as early as six months after the termination of employment. Eligible participants electing to receive more than 30% of the net present value of the benefit within 36 months of their termination must enter into a written noncompetition agreement with us and agree to forfeit and repay the lump sum if they breach that agreement. 
OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
The NEOs who retire after age 55 with at least five years of service or who are retirement eligible under the "modified rule of 75" continue to receive the benefits shown in the following table after retirement, except that of the NEOs, only Mr. Stephenson is entitled to receive executive health coverage after retirement. Benefits that are available generally to managers are omitted from the table. All the NEOs except for Mr. McAtee are currently retirement eligible. 
Financial counseling benefits will be made available to the Executive Officers for 36 months following retirement. We do not reimburse taxes on personal benefits for Executive Officers, other than certain non-deductible relocation costs, which along with the tax reimbursement, we make available to nearly all management employees. Through December 31, 2017, the executive health coverage supplemented the group health plan. Effective January 1, 2018, the executive health coverage is the primary and sole health coverage for eligible participants. The coverage is provided to Mr. Stephenson post-employment based on eligibility provisions that existed before he became CEO. During their employment, officers are subject to an annual deductible on health benefits, co-insurance, and must pay a portion of the premium. Officers who are eligible to receive the executive health coverage in retirement have no annual deductible or co-insurance, but they must pay larger premiums. In addition, we also provide communications, broadband/TV and related services and products; however, to the extent the service is provided by AT&T, it is typically provided at little or no incremental cost. These benefits are subject to amendment.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
In the event of the officer's termination of employment due to death, the officer's unvested Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, if any, will vest, and outstanding Performance Shares will pay out at 100% of target. As a result, if an NEO had died at the end of 2018, the amounts of Performance Shares, Restricted Stock Units, and/or Restricted Stock, as applicable, that would have vested and been distributed are: Mr. Stephenson—$18,560,732, Mr. Stephens—$8,733,525, Mr. Donovan—$13,473,049, Mr. McAtee—$8,481,603 and Mr. Stankey—$7,634,536. 
In the event of termination of employment due to disability, unvested Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, if any, will vest; however, Restricted Stock Units will not pay out until their scheduled vesting distribution times. As a result, if such an event had occurred to an NEO at the end of 2018, Mr. Donovan's Restricted Stock ($2,460,576) and Mr. McAtee's Restricted Stock Units ($3,748,786) would have vested. Conversely, Performance Shares will not be accelerated in the event of a termination due to disability but will be paid without proration, based solely on the achievement of the pre-determined performance goals. 
We pay recoverable premiums on split-dollar life insurance that provides a specified death benefit to beneficiaries of each NEO. The benefit is equal to one times salary during the officer's employment, except for the CEO who receives two times salary. After retirement, for officers who first participated beginning in 1998, the death benefit remains one times salary until he or she reaches age 66; the benefit is then reduced by 10% each year until age 70, when the benefit becomes one-half of his or her final salary. For officers who participated prior to 1998, including Messrs. Stephenson and Stephens, the post-retirement death benefit is one times salary. In addition, managers who were officers prior to 1998 are entitled to additional one times salary death benefit while employed and during retirement. 
In addition to the foregoing, each of the NEOs purchased optional additional split-dollar life insurance coverage equal to two times salary, which is subsidized by the Company. If the policies are not fully funded upon the retirement of the officer, we continue to pay our portion of the premiums until they are fully funded. The officer's premium obligation ends at age 65. 
Mr. Stephens elected to take his death benefits in the form of a ten-year Company-paid annuity payable after death, using an 11% discount rate based on 185% of the value of the death benefits. The increase in the value of the death benefits is to offset the income taxes that will result from the Company-paid benefit that would not be applicable in the case of insurance payments. This alternative payment method was available only to officers who elected the annuity before 1998. If Mr. Stephens had passed away at the end of 2018, his annual death benefit for ten years would have been $1,398,839.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
STOCK PURCHASE AND DEFERRAL PLAN (SPDP) 
Under the SPDP and its predecessor plan, mid-level managers and above may annually elect to defer up to 30% of their salary and annual bonus. Officers, including the NEOs, may defer up to 95% of their short-term award, which is similar to, and paid in lieu of, the annual bonus paid to other management employees. In addition, the Committee may approve other contributions to the plan. Contributions are made through payroll deductions and are used to purchase AT&T deferred share units (each representing the right to receive a share of AT&T stock) at fair market value on a tax-deferred basis. Participants receive a 20% match in the form of additional deferred share units; however, with respect to short-term awards, officer level participants receive the 20% match only on the purchase of deferred share units that represent no more than their target awards. In addition, the Company provides "makeup" matching contributions in the form of additional deferred share units in order to generally offset the loss of match in the 401(k) plan caused by participation in the SPDP and the CDP, and to provide match on compensation that exceeds Federal compensation limits for 401(k) plans. The makeup match is an 80% match on contributions from the first 6% of salary and bonus (the same rate as used in the Company's principal 401(k) plan), reduced by the amount of matching contributions the employee is eligible to receive (regardless of actual participation) in the Company's 401(k) plan. (For managers hired after January 1, 2015, the 401(k) match and SPDP makeup match is 100% on contributions from the first 6% of salary.) Officer level employees do not receive a makeup match on the contribution of their short-term awards. Deferrals are distributed in AT&T stock at times elected by the participant. For salary deferrals prior to 2011 and bonus deferrals prior to 2012, in lieu of the 20% match, participants received two stock options for each deferred share unit acquired. Each stock option had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant. 
Cash Deferral Plan (CDP) 
Managers who defer at least 6% of salary in the SPDP may also defer up to 50% (25% in the case of mid-level managers) of salary into the CDP. Similarly, managers that defer 6% of bonuses in the SPDP may also defer bonuses in the CDP, subject to the same deferral limits as for salary; however, officer level managers may defer up to 95% of their short-term award into the CDP without a corresponding SPDP deferral. In addition, the Committee may approve other contributions to the plan. We pay interest at the Moody's Long-Term Corporate Bond Yield Average for the preceding September (the Moody's rate), a common index used by companies. Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, we include in the "Summary Compensation Table" under "Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings" any earnings on deferred compensation that exceed a rate determined in accordance with SEC rules. Deferrals are distributed at times elected by the participant. Similarly, under its predecessor plan, managers could defer salary and incentive compensation to be paid at times selected by the participant. No deferrals were permitted under the prior plan after 2004. Account balances in the prior plan are credited with interest at a rate determined annually by the Company, which will be no less than the prior September Moody's rate. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
AT&T SEVERANCE POLICY 
The AT&T Severance Policy generally limits severance payments for Executive Officers to 2.99 times salary and bonus. Under the AT&T Severance Policy, the Company will not provide severance benefits to an Executive Officer that exceed 2.99 times the officer's annual base salary, plus target bonus, unless the excess payment receives prior stockholder approval or is ratified by stockholders at a regularly scheduled annual meeting within the following 15 months. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Change in Control 
An acquisition in our industry can take a year or more to complete, and during that time it is critical that the Company have continuity of its leadership. If we are in the process of being acquired, our officers may have concerns about their employment with the new company. Our Change in Control Severance Plan offers benefits so that our officers may focus on the Company's business without the distraction of searching for new employment. The Change in Control Severance Plan covers our officers, including each of the NEOs. 
Description of Change in Control Severance Plan 
The Change in Control Severance Plan provides an officer who is terminated or otherwise leaves our Company for "good reason" after a change in control a payment equal to 2.99 times the sum of the executive's most recent salary and target bonus. The Company is not responsible for the payment of excise taxes (or taxes on such payments). In 2014, the Company eliminated health, life insurance and financial counseling benefits from the plan. 
"Good reason" means, in general, assignment of duties inconsistent with the executive's title or status; a substantial adverse change in the nature or status of the executive's responsibilities; a reduction in pay; or failure to pay compensation or continue benefits. For the CEO, we eliminated a provision that defined "good reason" to include a good faith determination by the executive within 90 days of the change in control that he or she is not able to discharge his or her duties effectively. 
Under the plan, a change in control occurs: (a) if anyone (other than one of our employee benefit plans) acquires more than 20% of AT&T's common stock, (b) if within a two-year period, the Directors at the beginning of the period (together with any new Directors elected or nominated for election by a two-thirds majority of Directors then in office who were Directors at the beginning of the period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease to constitute a majority of the Board, (c) upon consummation of a merger where AT&T Inc. is one of the merging entities and where persons other than the AT&T stockholders immediately before the merger hold more than 50% of the voting power of the surviving entity, or (d) upon our stockholders' approval of a plan of complete liquidation of the Company or an agreement for the sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all the Company's assets. 
If a change in control and a subsequent termination of employment of the NEOs had occurred at the end of 2018 in accordance with the Change in Control Severance Plan, the following estimated severance payments would have been paid in a lump sum.

OTHER INFORMATION 
VOTING 
Stockholders of Record 
Stockholders whose shares are registered in their name on the Company records (also known as "stockholders of record") will receive either a proxy card by which they may indicate their voting instructions or a notice on how they may obtain a proxy. Instead of submitting a signed proxy card, stockholders may submit their proxies by telephone or through the Internet. Telephone and Internet proxies must be used in conjunction with, and will be subject to, the information and terms contained on the form of proxy. Similar procedures may also be available to stockholders who hold their shares through a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian. 
All shares represented by proxies will be voted by one or more of the persons designated on the form of proxy in accordance with the stockholders' directions. If the proxy card is signed and returned or the proxy is submitted by telephone or through the Internet without specific directions with respect to the matters to be acted upon, it will be treated as an instruction to vote such shares in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. Any stockholder giving a proxy may revoke it at any time before the proxy is voted at the meeting by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of AT&T, by submitting a later-dated proxy, or by attending the meeting and voting in person. The Chairman of the Board will announce the closing of the polls during the Annual Meeting. Proxies must be received before the closing of the polls in order to be counted. 
A stockholder may designate a person or persons other than those persons designated on the form of proxy to act as the stockholder's proxy by striking out the name(s) appearing on the proxy card, inserting the name(s) of another person(s), and delivering the signed card to that person(s). The person(s) designated by the stockholder must present the signed proxy card at the meeting in order for the shares to be voted. 
Shares Held Through a Bank, Broker, or Other Custodian 
Where the stockholder is not the record holder, such as where the shares are held through a broker, nominee, fiduciary or other custodian, the stockholder must provide voting instructions to the record holder of the shares in accordance with the record holder's requirements in order to ensure the shares are properly voted. 
Shares Held on Your Behalf under Company Benefit Plans or under The DirectSERVICE Investment Program 
The proxy card, or a proxy submitted by telephone or through the Internet, will also serve as voting instructions to the plan administrator or trustee for any shares held on behalf of a participant under any of the following employee benefit plans: the AT&T Savings and Security Plan; the AT&T Puerto Rico Retirement Savings Plan; the AT&T Retirement Savings Plan; the BellSouth Savings and Security Plan and the Warner Media, LLC Savings Plan (WM Plan). Subject to the trustee's fiduciary obligations, shares in each of the above employee benefit plans (other than the WM Plan) for which instructions are not received will not be voted. Shares in the WM Plan for which voting instructions are not received will be voted in the same proportion as shares for which voting instructions are received, except that if the WM Plan shares are attributable to accounts transferred from the Time Incorporated Payroll-Based Employee Stock Ownership Plan or the WCI Employee Stock Ownership Plan, then uninstructed shares will not be voted. To allow sufficient time for voting by the trustees and/or administrators of the plans, your voting instructions must be received by April 23, 2019. 
In addition, the proxy card or a proxy submitted by telephone or through the Internet will constitute voting instructions to the plan administrator under The DirectSERVICE Investment Program sponsored and administered by Computershare Trust Company, N.A. (AT&T's transfer agent) for shares held on behalf of plan participants. 
If a stockholder participates in the plans listed above and/or maintains stockholder accounts under more than one name (including minor differences in registration, such as with or without a middle initial), the stockholder may receive more than one set of proxy materials. To ensure that all shares are voted, please submit proxies for all of the shares you own. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
ATTENDING THE MEETING 
Only AT&T stockholders may attend the meeting. 
Stockholders of Record (shares are registered in your name) 
An admission ticket is attached to your proxy card or Annual Meeting Notice and Admission Ticket. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please retain the admission ticket and bring it with you to the meeting. A stockholder of record who does not have an admission ticket will be admitted upon presentation of photo identification at the door. 
Other Stockholders (shares are held in the name of a bank, broker, or other institution) 
You may obtain admission to the meeting by presenting proof of your ownership of AT&T common stock and photo identification. To be able to vote at the meeting, you will need the bank, broker, or record holder to give you a proxy. 
HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION 
No more than one annual report and Proxy Statement will be sent to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless AT&T has received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders at that address. Stockholders may request a separate copy of the most recent annual report and/or the Proxy Statement by writing the transfer agent at: Computershare Trust Company, N.A., P.O. Box 43078, Providence, RI 02940-3078, or by calling (800) 351-7221. Stockholders calling from outside the United States may call (781) 575-4729. Requests will be responded to promptly. Stockholders sharing an address who desire to receive multiple copies, or who wish to receive only a single copy, of the annual report and/or the Proxy Statement may write or call the transfer agent at the above address or phone numbers to request a change. 
VOTING RESULTS 
The voting results of the Annual Meeting will be published no later than four business days after the annual meeting on a Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will be available in the investor relations area of our website at www.att.com. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
AT&T's Executive Officers and Directors are required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to file reports of transactions and holdings in AT&T common stock with the SEC and the NYSE. Based solely on a review of the filed reports made during or with respect to the preceding year, AT&T believes that all Executive Officers and Directors were in compliance with all filing requirements applicable to such Executive Officers and Directors. 
COST OF PROXY SOLICITATION 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by AT&T. Officers, agents and employees of AT&T and its subsidiaries and other solicitors retained by AT&T may, by letter, by telephone or in person, make additional requests for the return of proxies and may receive proxies on behalf of AT&T. Brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians will be requested to forward soliciting material to the beneficial owners of shares and will be reimbursed for their expenses. AT&T has retained D. F. King & Co., Inc. to aid in the solicitation of proxies at a fee of $23,500, plus expenses. 
OTHER INFORMATION 
CEO PAY RATIO 
We determined the pay ratio by dividing the total 2018 compensation of the CEO as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table by the total 2018 compensation of the median employee, using the same components of compensation as used in the Summary Compensation Table for the CEO. 
Our median employee for 2018 was determined using the compensation of employees who were actively employed on October 1, 2018 (the Measurement Date). We used their cash compensation for the first three quarters of the year to determine the median employee. 
Determination of Number of Employees for Selection of Median Employee 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Step 1 - As of the Measurement Date, our total number of active global employees was 233,993, excluding the CEO and 31,618 employees of companies acquired  during 2018 as follows: WarnerMedia (30,208), AppNexus (1,054), and AlienVault (356).

Step 2 - 
Of the above referenced 233,993 active global employees, 44,892 were non-U.S. employees. We included in our calculation only the employees in the five foreign countries that held our largest foreign employee populations as follows: Mexico (20,214), Argentina (4,177), Slovakia (3,295), Colombia (3,064) and India (2,885). We excluded 11,257 employees in 56 other foreign countries as follows: Australia (266), Austria (12), Barbados (2), Belgium (125), Brazil (2,151), Bulgaria (101), Canada (440), Chile (467), China (78), Costa Rica (242), Curacao (17), Czech Republic (1,251), Denmark (58), Ecuador (379), El Salvador (1), Finland (19), France (183), Germany (289), Greece (3), Guatemala (2), Hong Kong (216), Hungary (2), Indonesia (2), Iraq (1), Ireland (31), Israel (308), Italy (137), Japan (124), Korea (28), Lithuania (1), Malaysia (694), Netherlands (219), New Zealand (16), Norway (11), Pakistan (2), Panama (3), Peru (272), Philippines (64), Poland (13), Portugal (2), Romania (2), Russian Federation (2), Singapore (314), Slovenia (2), South Africa (4), Spain (99), Sweden (43), Switzerland (52), Taiwan (20), Thailand (8), Trinidad (110), Turkey (3), United Arab Emirates (4), United Kingdom (1,066), Uruguay (199), and Venezuela (1,097).

The total compensation of our median employee, $95,814, was determined using the same methodology we used for Mr. Stephenson in the Summary Compensation Table and we included the cost of group health and welfare benefits. The total compensation of the CEO Randall L. Stephenson was $29,118,118, which includes the value of Mr. Stephenson's health benefits. The final pay ratio calculation is 304:1. 
ANNEX A 
The following tables reconcile our free cash flow (FCF) and earnings per share (EPS) metrics, discussed on page 38, to the most comparable GAAP metrics. 
Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations minus capital expenditures. We believe this metric provides useful information to our investors because management views free cash flow as an important indicator of how much cash is generated by routine business operations, including capital expenditures, and makes decisions based on it. Management also views free cash flow as a measure of cash available to pay debt and return cash to stockholders.

[END TABLE]
Adjusted diluted EPS is calculated by excluding from operating revenues, operating expenses and income tax expense certain significant items that are non-operational or non-recurring in nature, including dispositions and merger integration and transaction costs (referred to as "Adjusting Items"). Management believes that this measure provides relevant and useful information to investors and other users of our financial data in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends. 
Adjusting items include revenues and costs we consider nonoperational in nature, such as items arising from asset acquisitions or dispositions. We also adjust for net actuarial gains or losses associated with our pension and postemployment benefit plans.

We recorded total net actuarial gains of $3.4 billion in 2018. As a result, adjusted EPS reflects an expected return on  plan assets of $3.5 billion (based on an average expected return on plan assets of 7.00% for our pension trust and 5.75% for our VEBA trusts), rather than the actual return on plan assets of $1.2 billion loss (actual pension return of -1.4% and VEBA  return of -4.2%), included in the GAAP measure of income.
