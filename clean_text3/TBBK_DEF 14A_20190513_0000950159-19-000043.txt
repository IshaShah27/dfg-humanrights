PROXY STATEMENT ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS
GENERAL
Introduction
The 2019 annual meeting (the "Meeting") of stockholders of The Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company") will be held on Monday, May         13, 2019 at 1:00 P.M., at 409 Silverside Road, Suite 105, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice. Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2019 will be entitled to notice of and to         vote at such Meeting.
This statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board of         Directors") of proxies from holders of the Company's common stock, par value $1.00 per share (the "Common Shares"), to be used at the Meeting, and at all adjournments thereof. Proxies in the accompanying form, properly executed and duly returned to         the Company, and not revoked, will be voted at the Meeting and any and all adjournments thereof.
This proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy will be sent on or about April 5, 2019 to stockholders of record as         of March 19, 2019.
Revocation of Proxy
If a proxy in the accompanying form is executed and returned, it may nevertheless be revoked at any time before its exercise         by giving written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company at its Wilmington address stated herein, by submitting a later dated proxy or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.
Expenses and Manner of Solicitation
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company.  Directors, officers and regular employees of the Company may         solicit proxies either personally, by letter or by telephone, but will not be specifically compensated for soliciting such proxies. The Company will reimburse banks, brokerage firms, other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for reasonable         expenses incurred in sending proxy materials to beneficial owners of the common stock of the Company.
Annual Report and Report on Form 10-K
The Company's Annual Report to Stockholders, including the financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of         financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, is being sent to stockholders of record as of March 19, 2019.   Stockholders of record as of March 19, 2019, and beneficial owners of the Company's Common Shares on         that date, may obtain from the Company, without charge, a copy of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), by a request therefor in writing. Any         such request from a beneficial owner of the Company's Common Shares must set forth a good faith representation that, as of the record date for this solicitation, March 19, 2019, the person making the request was the beneficial owner of the         Company's Common Shares. Such written requests should be directed to The Bancorp, Inc., Attention: Paul Frenkiel, 409 Silverside Road, Suite 105, Wilmington, Delaware 19809. Stockholders Sharing an Address
Stockholders sharing an address with another stockholder may receive only one annual report or one set of proxy materials at         that address unless they have provided contrary instructions. Any such stockholder who wishes to receive a separate copy of the annual report or a separate set of proxy materials now or in the future may write or call the Company to request a         separate copy of these materials from the Company at The Bancorp, Inc., Attention: Andres Viroslav, 409 Silverside Road, Wilmington, Delaware 19809, telephone number (215) 861-7990. The Company will promptly deliver a copy of the requested         materials.
Similarly, a stockholder sharing an address with another stockholder who has received multiple copies of the Company's proxy         materials may use the contact information above to request delivery of a single copy of these materials.
Voting at the Meeting
At the Meeting, only those holders of Common Shares at the close of business on March 19, 2019, the record date, will be         entitled to vote. As of the record date, 56,468,004 Common Shares were outstanding. Each holder is entitled to one vote per share on each matter of business         properly brought before the Meeting. Stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights.
The presence at the Meeting in person or by proxy of holders of outstanding Common Shares entitled to cast a majority of all         the votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting will constitute a quorum. The presence of a quorum for any proposal establishes a quorum for all of the proposals, even if holders of outstanding Common Shares entitled to cast a majority of all the         votes entitled to be cast at the Meeting do not vote on all of the proposals.
A failure by brokers to vote Common Shares held by them in nominee name will mean that such Common Shares will not be counted         for the purposes of establishing a quorum and will not be voted.  If a broker does not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of Common Shares on a particular matter and indicates on the proxy delivered with respect to such Common         Shares that it does not have discretionary authority to vote on that matter, which is referred to as a broker "non-vote," those Common Shares will be considered as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists, but will not be         considered cast on any proposal on which they were not voted.  Brokers that are member firms of the New York Stock Exchange and who hold Common Shares in street name for customers only have discretion to vote those shares with respect to the         approval of the selection of the auditor (Proposal 3 below), but do not have discretion to vote those shares with respect to the other proposals.  Should any matters not described above be properly presented at the Meeting, the persons named in the         proxy form will vote in accordance with their judgment. The proxy form authorizes these persons, in their discretion, to vote upon such matters as may properly be brought before the meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof.
Proposal 1. The         number of votes required in order to be elected as a director is dependent on whether an election is contested or uncontested. The Company's bylaws define an election as "contested" if the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be         elected. As no Company stockholders have provided proper notice to the Company of an intention to nominate one or more candidates to compete with the Board of Directors' nominees, the director election described in Proposal 1 below is an         uncontested election. In order to be elected as a director in an uncontested election as described in Proposal 1 below, each director is elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to such director nominee at the Meeting. A "majority of votes         cast" means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that director's election. Votes "cast" includes votes "for" and votes "against", but excludes abstentions with respect to a director's         election or with respect to the election of directors in general. In the case of any contested election, the Company's bylaws provide that directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which         a quorum is present.
Proposal 2. The         affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting is required to approve the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as described in Proposal 2 below. The vote is advisory, which is a mechanism         that allows for stockholders of the Company to tell the Board of Directors how they feel about certain issues facing the Company, such as executive compensation. The results of an advisory vote are non-binding, which means that the Board of         Directors is not required by law to take any specific action in response to the results of the vote. However, the Board of Directors strongly values feedback from the Company's stockholders and will take the results of an advisory vote into account         when considering future actions. Proposal 3. The         affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting is required to approve the selection of Grant Thornton LLP, or Grant Thornton, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm as described in         our discussion of Proposal 3 below.
Proposal 4. For         any other matter which may properly come before the Meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting at which a quorum is present is required, either in person or by proxy, for approval, unless         otherwise required by law.
Any proxy not specifying to the contrary, and not designated as a broker non-vote, will be voted FOR:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the election of the directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the approval of the compensation for the named executive officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the approval of the selection of Grant Thornton as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
 PROPOSAL 1. ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Directors and Nominees
The Bylaws of the Company provide that the number of directors shall be fixed by the Board of Directors. The Board of         Directors has fixed the number of directors at eleven. All directors are elected for a term of one year or until their successors are elected and qualified. The Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of its Nominating and Governance Committee,         has nominated Daniel G. Cohen, Walter T. Beach, Michael J. Bradley, John C. Chrystal, Matthew Cohn, John M. Eggemeyer, Hersh Kozlov, Damian M. Kozlowski, William H. Lamb, James J. McEntee III and Mei-Mei Tuan, for election at the Meeting for a term         to expire at the annual meeting to be held in 2020 or until their successors are elected or appointed.
It is the intention of the persons named in the enclosed proxy, in the absence of a contrary direction, to vote for the         election of all the current directors. Should any of the nominees become unable or refuse to accept nomination or election as a director, the persons named as proxies intend to vote for the election of such other person as the Nominating and         Governance Committee of the Board of Directors may recommend. The Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees might be unable or refuse to accept nomination or election. Information is set forth below regarding the principal         occupation of each nominee. There are no family relationships among the directors, nominees and executive officers of the Company.

The number of votes required in order to be elected as a director depends on whether an election is contested or uncontested.         An election is uncontested if no stockholder provides proper notice of an intention to nominate one or more candidates to compete with the Board of Directors' nominees in a director election, or if any such stockholders have withdrawn all such         nominations at least five days prior to the mailing of notice of the meeting to stockholders. As no such notice has been provided, the director election described in this Proposal 1 is an uncontested election. In order to be elected as a director         in an uncontested election, each director is elected by a majority of votes cast with respect to such director nominee. A "majority of votes cast" means that the number of votes cast "for" a director's election exceeds the number of votes cast         "against" that director's election. Votes "cast" include votes "for" and votes "against," but excludes abstentions with respect to a director's election or with respect to the election of directors in general.
If an incumbent director nominated for election as a director receives a greater number of "against" votes for his or her         election than votes "for" such election, then that director, as a holdover director, must tender an offer of his or her resignation to the Board of Directors for consideration promptly following the certification of the vote. The Nominating and         Governance Committee must promptly consider any resignation offer so tendered and a range of possible responses, based on any facts or circumstances they consider relevant, and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors as to the response to         the resignation offer. If each member of the Nominating and Governance Committee received a majority against vote at the same election, then the independent directors who did not receive a majority against vote must appoint a committee among         themselves to consider the resignation offers and to recommend to the Board of Directors a response to the resignation offers. The Board of Directors must take action on the Nominating and Governance Committee's recommendation (or committee of         independent directors' recommendation) within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. Any director whose resignation is under consideration must abstain from participating in any board or committee deliberations regarding the         acceptance of his or her offer of resignation or the offer of resignation of any other director tendered because that director received a majority against vote.
If an incumbent director's offer of resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, then such director will cease to be a         member of the Board of Directors upon the effective date of acceptance by the Board of Directors of the offer of resignation. If an incumbent director's offer of resignation is not accepted by the Board of Directors, then such director will         continue to serve until the earlier of the next annual meeting or until his or her successor is elected and qualifies and his or her subsequent resignation or removal.
If any nominee for director who is not an incumbent fails in an uncontested election to receive a majority of votes cast at a         meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present, such nominee will not be elected and will not take office. All of the Board of Directors' nominees for election as a director at the Meeting are incumbents. If an incumbent         director's offer of resignation is accepted by the Board of Directors, or if a non-incumbent nominee for director is not elected, the Board of Directors may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board of Directors pursuant to         the Company's bylaws.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each nominee. STOCK OWNERSHIP AND SECTION 16 COMPLIANCE

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Director Independence
The Company's Common Shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol "TBBK" and the Company is subject         to the listing standards thereof. The Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Beach, Mr. Bradley, Mr. Cohn, Mr. Chrystal, Mr. Eggemeyer, Mr. Kozlov, Mr. Lamb, Mr. McEntee and Ms. Tuan, each meet the definition of an independent director set         forth in the NASDAQ rules. In making these determinations, the Board of Directors reviewed information from each of these directors concerning all their respective relationships with the Company and its affiliates and analyzed the materiality of         those relationships.
Board Leadership and Committee Structure and Role in Risk Oversight
Daniel G. Cohen serves as the Company's Chairman of the Board and Damian Kozlowski serves as its Chief Executive Officer and         as a director. The Company believes that the most effective leadership structure at the present time is to have separate Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer positions because this allows the board to benefit from having two strong         voices bringing separate views and perspectives to meetings.
The Risk Committee meets at least quarterly, and, while the Board of Directors and all of its committees are sensitive to         risks relating to the Company and its operations, the Risk Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the Company's risk management processes on behalf of the Board of Directors. A subset of the Risk Committee also serves as the Consent         Order Oversight Committee and meets at least quarterly to oversee the Bank's compliance with the requirements of the Bank's 2015 Consent Order with the FDIC and the Bank's consumer compliance, third-party risk management and compliance auditing         functions.  The Complaint and Error Claim Committee meets monthly and focuses on the process for handling, monitoring and resolving all complaints and Regulation E error claims received directly by the Bank or through its third-party product         contributors. The Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") Committee meets monthly and oversees compliance with BSA regulations, compliance with the requirements of consent orders with federal banking authorities, and related BSA risks. The Audit Committee meets         at least quarterly, and focuses on financial reporting risk, oversees the entire audit function and evaluates the effectiveness of internal and external audit efforts. These committees receive reports from management regularly regarding the         Company's assessment of risks and the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control systems. Through their interaction with the Company's senior management, these committees oversee credit risk, market risk (including liquidity and interest rate         risk) and operational risk (including compliance and legal risk). The Chief Risk Officer meets at least quarterly with the Risk Oversight Committee to discuss potential risk or control issues involving management. The aforementioned Board         committees report regularly to the Board of Directors, which also considers the Company's entire risk profile, including additional strategic and reputational risks. While the Board of Directors oversees the Company's risk management, senior         management at the Company and Bank are responsible for the day-to-day risk management processes. Senior management comprises the Bank's Enterprise Risk Management Committee which meets at least quarterly and addresses various risks, controls and         related monitoring.  While the Board of Directors believes that this division of responsibility is the most effective approach for addressing the risks facing the Company, it will continue to re-examine this structure on a regular basis,         recognizing that different structures may be appropriate in different situations faced by the Company.
Board Meetings
The Board of Directors held a total of 12 meetings during fiscal 2018. During fiscal 2018 all directors attended at least 75%         of the aggregate of (a) the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors held during the period for which the director had been a director and (b) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors on which the         director served during the periods that the director served. It is the policy of the Board of Directors that all directors attend the annual meeting of stockholders of the Company, if practicable. All directors attended the last annual meeting.

Compensation Committee.         The Compensation Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to have direct responsibility for approving the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and certain other officers and the non-management directors of the Company as described in         "Compensation Committee Report" and the related "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" below. At all times during 2018, the Compensation Committee had direct responsibility for (a) administering the Company's equity-based compensation plans and (b)         reviewing any extraordinary bonus or other compensatory payments to any employee of the Company.  For officers and employees reporting to named executive officers, or NEOs, the Compensation Committee has delegated primary responsibility for         recommending salary changes to the Chief Executive Officer and President.
Compensation Committee           Interlocks and Insider Participation. The Compensation Committee consists of Messrs. Beach, Bradley and Lamb.  None of such persons was an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries during fiscal 2018 or was formerly an         officer or employee of the Company. During fiscal 2018, none of the Company's executive officers served as a director or on the compensation committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on the Compensation Committee. During         fiscal 2018, none of the Company's executive officers served on the compensation committee of another entity, any one of whose executive officers served on the Company's Board of Directors.
Risk Committee. The         Risk Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to assist in the oversight of risk management and risks inherent in the Company's activities. The committee oversees the activities of the Chief Risk Officer and meets with various members of         management, as necessary or desirable, in its oversight of risk management. A subset of members of this committee serves as the Bank's Consent Order Oversight Committee for purposes of confirming compliance with the requirements of consent orders         with federal banking authorities. See "—Board Leadership and Committee Structure and Role in Risk Oversight."
Complaint and Error Claim           Committee. The Complaint and Error Claim Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to assist in the oversight of customer complaint resolution including claims of possible errors related to electronic fund transfers or inquiries         related to such transfers, and resolutions of related agreed upon improvements required by consent orders with federal banking authorities. See "—Board Leadership and Committee Structure and Role in Risk Oversight."
Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA")           Committee. The BSA Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to assist in the oversight of compliance with BSA/ Anti-Money Laundering requirements, including resolutions of agreed upon improvements required by the FDIC consent         orders. See "—Board Leadership and Committee Structure and Role in Risk Oversight."
Nominating and Governance           Committee. The Nominating and Governance Committee is appointed by the Board of Directors to (a) assist the Company and the Board of Directors in maintaining an effective and knowledgeable Board of Directors, including assisting the Board         of Directors in identifying individuals qualified to become directors and recommending to the Board of Directors the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders and the directors to be appointed to each committee, and (b) develop         and recommend for the Board of Director's consideration governance guidelines for the Company. All of the members of this committee have been determined by the Board of Directors to be independent under applicable NASDAQ and Exchange Act rules.
The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider candidates for nomination as a director recommended by stockholders,         directors, officers, third party search firms and other sources. The Company describes the procedures for nominations by stockholders in "Stockholder Proposals and Nominations." In evaluating candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee         considers the attributes of the candidate (including skills, experience, diversity, age, and legal and regulatory requirements) and the needs of the Board of Directors, and will review all candidates in the same manner, regardless of the source of         the recommendation.
The Nominating and Governance Committee has not adopted specific, minimum qualifications or specific qualities or skills that         must be met by a Nominating and Governance Committee-recommended nominee. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to ensure that the membership of the Board of Directors and each committee of the Board of Directors satisfies all relevant         NASDAQ rules and applicable laws and regulations and all requirements of the Company's governance documents. The Nominating and Governance Committee seeks to achieve a mixture of skills that are related to the Company's business. The nature of the         specific qualifications, qualities or skills that the Nominating and Governance Committee may look for in any particular director nominee depends on the qualifications, qualities and skills of the rest of the directors at the time of any vacancy on         the Board of Directors. Executive Committee.         The Executive Committee has the delegated authority to act in lieu of the Company's Board of Directors in between meetings of the Board.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Under the Code of Business Conduct, the Company has established a procedure regarding the review and approval of transactions         that would be required to be reported under Item 404 of Regulation S-K. Under this procedure, the Audit Committee must approve any such transaction and find it to be on terms comparable to those available on an arms' length basis from an         unaffiliated third party, or find that it otherwise does not create a conflict of interest. If the Audit Committee finds a conflict of interest to exist with respect to a particular transaction, that transaction is prohibited unless a waiver of the         Code of Business Conduct is approved by the Audit Committee.
The Bank maintains deposits for various affiliated companies totaling approximately         $2.6 million and $4.7 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Bank has entered into lending transactions in the ordinary course of business         with directors, executive officers, principal stockholders and affiliates of such persons.  All loans were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rate and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable loans with         persons not related to the lender.  At December 31, 2018, these loans were current as to principal and interest payments, and did not involve more than normal risk of collectability.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans to these related parties         amounted to $2.0 million and $1.7 million, respectively.
The Bank has periodically purchased securities under agreements to resell and         engaged in other securities transactions through J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC (JVB), a broker dealer in which the Company's Chairman is a registered representative and has a minority interest. The Company's Chairman also serves as the President, a         director and the Chief Investment Officer of Cohen & Company Financial Limited (formerly Euro Dekania Management Ltd.), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cohen & Company Inc. (formerly Institutional Financial Markets Inc.), the parent company of         JVB.  In 2018, the Bank purchased $7.1 million of government guaranteed SBA loans for Community Reinvestment Act purposes from JVB.  Prices for the SBA loans are verified to market rates and no separate commissions or fees are paid to that firm.         The Company purchased securities under agreements to resell through JVB primarily consisting of Government National Mortgage Association certificates which are full faith and credit obligations of the United States government issued at competitive         rates.  JVB was in full compliance with all of the terms of the repurchase agreements at December 31, 2018 and had complied with the terms for all prior repurchase agreements.  There were $0 and $64.3 million of repurchase transactions outstanding         at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Mr. Hersh Kozlov, a director of the Company, is a partner at Duane Morris LLP, an         international law firm.  The Company paid Duane Morris LLP $3.0 million in 2018, $3.5 million in 2017 and $4.0 million in 2016 for legal services. PROPOSAL 2. ADVISORY (NON-BINDING) VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Introduction
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"), which was signed into law by President         Obama on July 21, 2010, requires public companies to provide their stockholders with a non-binding vote to approve executive compensation at least once every three years, or more frequently, as directed by stockholder vote. The Company is seeking         this stockholder advisory vote on its executive compensation in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 14a-21(a) and pursuant to the stockholder vote of the Company's 2017 annual meeting that required the advisory         vote to be on an annual basis.
The Board of Directors Supports a Say-On-Pay Vote, and Will Consider the Results Carefully.
At its meeting held in 2018, 53% of the votes cast approved the 2017 executive compensation program. At its meeting held in         2017, 84% of the votes cast approved the 2016 executive compensation program. Notwithstanding that the majority of shareholders approved the program in 2018, the Compensation Committee acted on shareholder feedback to increase the 53% approval         rate. Specifically, in 2018 the Compensation Committee restructured the CEO's compensation to "pay for performance" and made other changes to address input from shareholders and their advisors. The restructuring of the CEO's compensation and other         changes are described in a chart in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") below.  The Board of Directors values the Company's stockholders' opinions. As it does each year, the Board of Directors intends to evaluate the results of         the advisory vote on compensation carefully when making future decisions regarding compensation of the named executive officers.
Compensation of Named Executive Officers
As described in the CD&A below, the Compensation Committee has developed an executive compensation program designed to         align the long-term interests of the Company's named executive officers with the long-term interests of its stockholders. The disclosure in the CD&A and the disclosure included in the section entitled "Executive and Director Compensation" below         have been provided in response to the requirements of SEC rules and explain the compensation policies under which the Company paid its named executive officers for 2018.
Advisory or Non-Binding Effect of Vote
Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the related SEC rules, your vote on this resolution is an advisory or "non-binding" vote. This         means that the purpose of the vote is to provide stockholders with a method to give their opinion to the Board of Directors about certain issues, like executive compensation. The Board of Directors is not required by law to take any action in         response to the stockholder vote. However, the Board of Directors values the Company's stockholders' opinions, and the Board of Directors intends to evaluate the results of the vote carefully when making future decisions regarding compensation of         the named executive officers. The Company believes that providing its stockholders with an advisory vote on its executive compensation program will further enhance communication with stockholders, while also meeting the Company's obligations under         the Dodd-Frank Act and the SEC's rules. 
Resolution
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve the following resolution:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve the compensation program for named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's         proxy statement dated April 5, 2019.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation of executive officers as described in         this proxy statement. COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
General
The Company is required to provide information regarding the compensation program in place for its Chief Executive Officer,         Chief Financial Officer and its three other most highly compensated executive officers. The Company must also provide compensation information for up to two additional individuals who would have been included but for the fact that they were not         executive officers at the end of the fiscal year. This discussion refers to the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the three other most highly-compensated executive officers, and one individual who would have been included         but for the fact that he was not an executive officer at the end of the fiscal year as "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs." This discussion should be read in conjunction with the detailed tables and narrative descriptions under "Executive and         Director Compensation."
The Compensation Committee is responsible for formulating and presenting recommendations to the Board of Directors with         respect to the compensation of the Company's NEOs. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for administering the Company's employee benefit plans, including incentive plans. The Compensation Committee is comprised solely of independent         directors.
Executive Summary
The Compensation Committee evaluated our Chief Executive Officer, Damian Kozlowski's performance for 2017 and 2018, his first         two full years of employment since his hire in 2016, in which year the Bank incurred a loss. Notwithstanding the Company exceeding all requirements and metrics for the payment of bonus and equity grants, Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation in 2018         was kept at 2017 levels as the Compensation Committee monitored sustainability. Additionally, to address shareholder input, his base salary was lowered to $750,000 from $900,000 effective December 31, 2018, and the Compensation Committee determined         to allocate a significant portion of any future equity grants to options instead of restricted stock units beginning in 2019. An analysis of the metrics for the payment of bonus or equity grants is as follows.

[END TABLE]
 While the 2018 shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation won majority approval, the approval percentage was less         than in prior years. The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer are the Company's primary representatives who meet with investors. In 2018, these officers met with shareholders owning approximately 51% of the Company's stock, including         shareholders who did not vote for approval. After considering such input, the Compensation Committee implemented a pay for performance structure and took the following actions related to CEO compensation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.   Effective December 31, 2018, CEO base salary was reduced from $900,000 to $750,000 per year.  This reduction brings the base salary to                    peer levels and increases the proportion of total compensation determined by financial performance.  
2.   Any incentive compensation awarded in 2019 and future years, will contain a significant component of stock options. While in 2016 a                    significant number of options had been awarded as part of Mr. Kozlowski's 2016 initial employment package, in 2017 and 2018, all equity compensation awarded was restricted stock units. The value of stock options is wholly determined by                    the increase in stock price, which provides a greater pay for performance element. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Kozlowski had 166,626 unvested restricted stock units versus 300,000 stock options.  
2.   Any incentive compensation awarded in 2019 and future years, will contain a significant component of stock options.

3.   The financial targets required to be achieved for incentive compensation to be awarded, including return on assets and return on                    equity, were published on the Company's website. This has created accountability and transparency, as the required targets for pay for performance awards are accessible by all shareholders.

[END TABLE]
Mr. Kozlowski was named the Company's CEO in June 2016, a year in which the Company had significant regulatory requirements         outstanding, and in which it incurred losses. He was engaged because of his proven experience in:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 a.   financial turn-around;  
 b.   improving the bank's compliance with regulatory requirements; and c.   reducing financial and regulatory risk, while sustaining financial performance.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee evaluated the Company's performance in each of the areas above as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 a.   Financial turn around  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Kozlowski was engaged as CEO in June 2016 and charged with engineering a financial turnaround from the losses in that         year.  The Company exceeded the required financial targets set by the Board of Directors in both 2017 and 2018, the first two full years since his hire.  In 2018, return on assets and equity were 2.07% and 24.26%, respectively. Compared to the loss         in 2016, pre-tax income from continuing operations in 2017 was $40.4 million and $119.8 million in 2018. Net income in 2018 increased to $88.7 million from $21.7 million in 2017. The Compensation Committee compared the return on assets and equity         to its peer groups and concluded that the Company was in the top quartile of peers for both return on assets and equity for 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 b.   Improving the bank's compliance with regulatory requirements  
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors including the Compensation Committee has monitored the implementation of a unique software system for         BSA, as well as other infrastructure improvements. These include the creation in 2018 of a Center of Excellence for BSA and related regulatory requirements. The system and infrastructure have been largely implemented and enhancements continue to be         made. Virtually all the items in the regulatory "encyclopedia", a compendium of all outstanding regulatory findings or recommendations, have been verified.
c.    Reducing financial and regulatory risk, while sustaining financial performance
During Mr. Kozlowski's 2.5-year tenure, the Company has sold or otherwise disposed of approximately 60%         of its higher risk discontinued assets and related investment in unconsolidated entity. Additionally, higher risk lines of business such as European operations were sold, while lower charge-off lending lines have grown significantly, with total         loans outstanding increasing 8% year over year.  
In addition to the key areas set forth above, under the oversight of the CEO, new sources of revenue, including the rapid         funds product, were initiated, an innovation framework and process was created, operating platforms were reengineered, including a securities-backed line of credit platform (SBLOC) to facilitate scalability, and corporate culture was enhanced to         include a formal diversity and inclusion program.
The Board of Directors pre-established specific financial and non-financial goals which were key in achieving the improved         2018 financial results and facilitating future growth. In fiscal 2018, the Company achieved or exceeded these goals, delineated in "Determination of Compensation Amounts." While Mr. Kozlowski had met or exceeded the pre-established requirements for         2017 and 2018, summarized above, the Compensation Committee maintained base salary, equity and bonus in 2018 at the same levels as 2017, as it continued to monitor sustainability.
After its 2018 annual meeting, the Company engaged its shareholders on the topic of executive compensation. As a result of         discussions with shareholders, the Company instituted a pay for performance structure with shareholder input and actions as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Shareholder Input   Company Actions  
 The CEO's base salary exceeds the peer median. A lower base salary better aligns pay for performance which places                  greater emphasis on incentive compensation and less emphasis on base salary.   Effective December 31, 2018, the CEO's base salary was reduced from $900,000 per year, to $750,000 per year.  
 The CEO's equity awards upon his hire included a significant amount of stock options, but subsequent grants consisted                  solely of restricted stock units.  Stock options provide greater incentive for pay for performance, since the value of that compensation is driven exclusively by the increase in stock price after the grant date.   In 2019 and future years a significant allocation of any equity compensation granted will be awarded as stock options.                  As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Kozlowski had 166,626 unvested restricted stock units versus 300,000 stock options.  
 Publicizing the pre-established financial targets required to be achieved for pay for performance awards on the                  Company's website, creates transparency and accountability for pay for performance.   Pre-established financial and other goals are presented on the Company's website, and were used in the determination                  of 2018 cash bonus and equity incentive compensation. In the future, the Compensation Committee will convert its established metrics into a grid for additional clarity in how incentive compensation awards were determined. http://investors.thebancorp.com/Presentations  
 Increases in net income and other performance measures have been significant, but sustainability should be considered.   Total CEO compensation for 2018 was maintained at 2017 levels, notwithstanding the significant increases in net                  income, return on assets and return on equity in 2017, with further increases in 2018. These parameters were in the upper quartile of peers in 2018. The Compensation Committee continues to validate sustainability of financial performance                  including return on assets, return on equity and other measures.  
 Comparisons to peers on key financial metrics provide a tool to help determine that financial goals adequately reward                  shareholders.   The Compensation Committee added peer comparisons for return on assets and equity to its decisioning parameters. The                  detailed financial targets required for pay for performance awards on the Company's website may also be compared to peers.  
 Some companies use grids or assign percentages to their various pre-established metrics which weight those factors in                  incentive compensation awards.   In 2018, the Compensation Committee required that the Company achieve pre-established metrics for the award of                  incentive compensation. In the future, the Compensation Committee will convert its established metrics into a grid for additional clarity in how incentive compensation awards were determined.  
[END TABLE]
 Compensation Objectives and the Focus of Compensation Awards
The Company's compensation policies are intended to provide appropriate compensation packages to motivate, reward, attract         and retain talented and experienced executive officers, and support the management succession plan. The policies are also intended to manage the Company's compensation costs. The primary components of the Company's executive compensation program         have been base pay, equity-based compensation and bonus.
The Compensation Committee believes that an appropriate compensation program should draw a balance between providing rewards         to executive officers while at the same time effectively controlling compensation costs. Executive officers are rewarded in order to attract and retain highly qualified individuals and to motivate them to perform in a manner that maximizes         corporate performance.
The Company's executive compensation program consists of three elements to reward and motivate its executive officers in line         with the Compensation Committee's objectives described above:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• cash bonuses; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• long-term equity incentives reflected in grants of stock options, restricted stock awards and phantom units.  
[END TABLE]
Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews annually the Company's mix of short-term performance incentives versus         longer-term incentives.  It primarily focuses compensation on base salary and equity incentives with additional consideration for cash bonuses. The Compensation Committee has not established set percentages of short-term versus long-term         incentives. Instead, it looks to provide a reasonable balance between those incentives and base salary. The Compensation Committee's policy for allocating between long-term and currently paid compensation is to set base compensation at levels         adequate to attract and retain personnel, while providing incentives to maximize long-term shareholder value for the Company and its stockholders. As discussed in "Specific Elements of the Compensation Program," below, the Company provides cash         compensation in the form of base salary to meet competitive salary norms. The Company also provides non-cash equity compensation to align this form of compensation with shareholder interests and the Company's long-term strategic goals. Cash bonuses         are considered by the Committee to provide a shorter-term incentive which may align with competitive norms, acknowledge and reward specific accomplishments and assist in compensation expense management. Because of performance generally in years         prior to 2017, cash bonuses were not paid in 2016. As a result of either achieving or exceeding pre-established financial goals including revenue increases and sustainable expense reductions, cash bonuses were paid to selected named executive         officers in 2017 and 2018 with the rationales and conclusions noted in "Determination of Compensation Amounts". The cash bonuses reflected specific successful efforts on the part of those officers in revenue generation and expense reduction. The         revenue generation and expense reduction combined to substantially increase pre-tax income in 2017 (to $40.4 million compared to a loss in 2016) to pre-tax income of $119.8 million in 2018 as shown in the related graph in "Determination of         Compensation Amounts" below. In 2017 and 2018 base salary increases were not made and the CEO base salary was reduced effective December 31, 2018, to enhance the pay for performance structure.
The Compensation Committee also "benchmarks" the Company's compensation programs to a peer group of banking institutions         based upon its review of financial statements and other publicly available data. The committee had historically used six banks as its peer group. The level of these institution's total assets and their regional location are factors the Compensation         Committee considers in establishing the peer group. In 2018, the Compensation Committee added three peers with lines of business similar to our own: Meta Financial Group (prepaid card accounts), TriState Capital (SBLOC loans) and Live Oak Bank (SBA         loans). Additionally, the Compensation Committee added to our peer group eighteen other banks supplied by McLagan, a company which provides salary databases for peer comparisons.  This expanded peer group of twenty-seven banks provides a wider peer         group on which basis to assess the Company's performance, especially return on assets and equity. The peer group is also used to compare the CEO and other NEO compensation to peers. Although considerable knowledge about the competitiveness of the         Company's compensation programs is gained through the benchmarking process, the Compensation Committee recognizes that each financial institution is unique and that significant differences in executive compensation practices exist. The Compensation         Committee also considered the added complexity and earnings stream resulting from the payments businesses unique to Bancorp. While Meta Bank also engaged in certain payments businesses, it did not engage in the specialized SBLOC, SBA and CMBS         securitization businesses. Those businesses differentiate the Company from banks in its size range, which also do not specialize in prepaid accounts. Additionally, the Compensation Committee utilized return on assets and equity peer comparisons,         which are independent of size. After the additions discussed above, the expanded peer group is composed of the following banks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that the combination of short and long-term compensation that the Company provides         fulfills its objectives of providing a competitive level of compensation and benefits in order to attract and retain key executives. The Compensation Committee also believes that the Company's incentive programs appropriately reward performance to         achieve profitability and growth while at the same time allowing the Company to maintain controls over its compensation costs.
The Company did not utilize an outside compensation consultant in assessing compensation.
Compensation Methodology
The Compensation Committee ordinarily determines compensation amounts for individual NEOs for 12 month periods. The Chief         Executive Officer typically provides the Compensation Committee with key elements of both the Company's and the NEOs' (other than the Chief Executive Officer's) performance as well as recommendations to assist it in determining compensation levels.         The Compensation Committee determines the amount of equity awards and cash bonuses, if any, at its discretion and reviews the prior year's performance during the first quarter of each year and at interim periods at its discretion. Specific Elements of the Compensation Program

Base Salary. The         Company believes that it is important to maintain a competitive salary structure to retain its existing qualified executive officers and a base pay structure consistent with similarly situated executives at similarly sized banking institutions. The         Company believes that a key objective of its salary structure is to maintain reasonable "fixed" compensation costs by targeting base salaries at a competitive average, taking into account the Company's and the individual's performance.  For 2018,         the annual base salaries of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Head of Credit Markets were, respectively, $900,000, $400,000, $300,000 and $300,000. These officers were hired in 2016 and their         base salaries were unchanged in 2017 and 2018, while the CEO's base salary was lowered from $900,000 to $750,000 effective December 31, 2018. The Compensation committee did not increase these base salaries since the hire dates in 2016, and lowered         the CEO's base salary, to enhance the Company's pay for performance salary structure. The Chief Financial Officer's annual salary of $310,660 in 2018 was increased .2% over 2017. A chart comparing 2018 base salary to 2017 is as follows:

Base salaries are paid to executive officers on a bi-weekly basis, and are generally reviewed annually by the Compensation         Committee as described in "Compensation Methodology," above. The Compensation Committee determines if any base pay changes should be made for executive officers. Base pay change, if any, is normally determined after considering:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive's total itemized compensation for the prior year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive's current base pay position relative to the peer group;

Cash Bonus. The         Compensation Committee evaluated CEO Kozlowski for 2017 and 2018, his first two full years of employment hire in 2016, in which year the Bank incurred a loss. Notwithstanding the Company exceeding all requirements and metrics for the payment of         bonus and equity grants, Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation in 2018 was kept at 2017 levels as the Compensation Committee monitored sustainability. Additionally, to address shareholder input, his base salary was lowered to $750,000 from $900,000         effective December 31, 2018, and the Compensation Committee in the future will allocate a significant portion of any equity grants to options instead of restricted stock units.
Please see the chart entitled "Pre-established Requirements for any Bonus and Equity Grants" in the         "Determination of Compensation Amounts" for the metrics for a cash bonus for the CEO.
Please see the footnotes for the chart under "Determination of Compensation Amounts- "Other NEOs", which         summarize the metrics for a cash bonus for the other NEOs.
The Compensation Committee particularly focuses on the contribution made to the Company by the NEO under consideration. The         Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to annual bonuses for the other executive officers, based on their respective contributions to the performance of the areas for which they are responsible.         Because of improved financial performance in 2017 and further improvement in 2018, cash bonuses were awarded in those years, but none were awarded in prior years. The primary factor in the cash bonus awards in 2018 was achieving or exceeding         pre-established requirements as detailed in "Determination of Compensation Amounts". The Compensation Committee also considered the cash bonus as a percentage of base salary. For the Chief Executive Officer, the 2018 cash bonus of $300,000         (compared to $300,000 in 2017) represented approximately 33% of base salary, which was identical to the prior year. Please see the chart entitled "Pre-established Requirements for any Bonus and Equity Grants" in the "Determination of Compensation         Amounts" for the metrics for a cash bonus for the CEO.
Please see the footnotes for the chart under "Determination of Compensation Amounts- "Other NEOs", which summarize the         metrics for a cash bonus for the other NEOs. For the Chief Operating Officer, Mr. McFadden, the 2018 cash bonus of $250,000 (compared to $100,000 in 2017) represented 83% of base salary. In addition to significant participation in cost reductions         related to operations, Mr. McFadden created an infrastructure which managed all outstanding regulatory issues and made personnel changes necessary to accelerate related progress. Such accelerated progress was acknowledged by the Compensation         Committee. Mr. McFadden's contributions were not immediately reflected in financial results. However, the Board of Director's commitment to resolving its regulatory issues and the related progress under Mr. McFadden, warranted this additional         compensation.  In 2017 and 2018, Mr. McFadden provided daily oversight in the resolution of those issues. He also oversaw the implementation of milestones in an Integrated Compliance Plan which addressed root causes for regulatory issues.          Additionally, Mr. McFadden played an executive role in the formation of the financial crimes Center of Excellence. The above represented Mr. McFadden's requirements, which did not have immediate financial impact, but were crucial in satisfying         regulatory expectations. For the Chief Administrative Officer, Dr. Leto, the cash bonus of $225,000 (compared to $100,000 in 2017) reflected 56% of base salary. One of Dr. Leto's primary responsibilities is to work closely with the Chief Executive         Officer and staff to effectuate cost reductions. Dr. Leto implemented changes in the Bank's organizational structures which significantly improved efficiency, by reducing or consolidating certain levels of management and right sizing staffing         levels. While the pay for performance requirement for 2018 was to keep non-interest expense flat while increasing revenues, non-interest expense was reduced from $154.9 million to $151.3 million. These 2018 reductions in expense were incremental to         the approximate $15 million of reductions (independent of BSA expenses) in 2017 compared to 2016, the year in which Dr. Leto was hired.  In 2018, non-interest expense was further reduced, in addition to sustaining the expense reductions from 2017.         Dr. Leto continued to direct and oversee various other operating expense reductions in data processing, facilities and other areas. Dr. Leto was directly involved in various staffing efforts to better align large data skill sets to resolving         regulatory issues and, with qualifications in organization management, reconfigured incentive payments to more directly align with improvements in financial performance. Dr. Leto also reconfigured the operations of the project management office,         leading to improved prioritization and implementation. These non-financial requirements were met. For the Head of Credit Markets, Mr. Connolly, the cash bonus of $225,000 (compared to $100,000 in 2017) was 75% of his base salary.  Mr. Connolly         oversees all lending operations and is also responsible for the disposition of the balance of discontinued operations to maximize shareholder value. Under Mr. Connolly's leadership, loan revenues have continued their consistent increases and         amounted to $95.3 million in 2018 compared to $79.1 million in 2017, an increase of 20%. These higher revenues reflected 17% and 8% respective growth in 2018 year end loan balances for SBA and SBLOC after similar increases in 2017.  Accordingly,         overall revenue growth matched pre-established budget requirements. Mr. Connolly's targeted requirement was to reduce year over year discontinued assets by 25%. This goal was exceeded as discontinued assets were reduced 35% to $197.8 million at         year end 2018, from $304.3 million at the prior year end. The Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Frenkiel, did not receive a bonus in 2017 but was awarded a $100,000 bonus in 2018 which was 32% of his base salary. Mr. Frenkiel was required to increase         investment securities revenue at least 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 without increasing risk, while achieving a yield which would rank in the upper quartile of peers. The upper quartile peer ranking requirement was based on the yields reported in         the Uniform Bank Performance Report for FDIC insured banks. For 2018, revenues were increased in excess of the 10% requirement, while overall portfolio risk was determined not to have been increased. The Company's yield was also in the top quartile         of peers. Accordingly, all requirements were met or exceeded.  Mr. Frenkiel was also primarily responsible for balance sheet and treasury management such that liquidity and capital were maintained at the levels approved by the Board of Directors.         The tier one capital ratio requirement of 8.50% was exceeded, as December 31, 2018 capital amounted to 10.11%. None of the named executive officers received cash bonuses in 2016. Long-Term Incentive           Compensation. Long-term incentives are provided to executive officers through the Company's 2018 Equity Incentive Plan ("2018 Plan"). The 2018 Plan permits the grant of stock options, restricted stock awards, stock appreciation rights and         phantom units. Stock options are granted to executive officers at exercise prices equal to the then current market price of the Company's Common Shares. Awards under the 2018 Plan are granted on the basis of the Company's financial performance and         each executive's contribution to such performance. Overall, the objective of long-term incentive compensation awards is to tie the interests of executive officers directly to increases in stockholder value. The criteria utilized for each NEO is         that which is used for cash bonuses as discussed directly above under "Cash Bonus" and presented in a chart under "Other NEOs".  In 2018, to balance the short-term incentive of cash bonus, equity grants were made in the same dollar amounts as the         cash bonuses.  These equity awards consist of restricted stock units which vest over two years and eight months. As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Kozlowski had 166,626 unvested restricted stock units and 300,000 stock options. Any incentive         compensation awarded to the CEO in 2019 and future years, will contain a significant component of stock options.
Compensation Risk Analysis
As a financial holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank, which has a subsidiary bank regulated by the FDIC and         the State of Delaware, the Company adheres to defined risk guidelines, practices and controls to ensure the safety and soundness of the institution.  The Company's management and Board of Directors conduct regular reviews of its business to ensure         that it is operating within appropriate regulatory guidelines and with appropriate practices, supplemented by its internal audit function.
During 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the Company's compensation practices to determine that (1) base salaries are         appropriately competitive in light of overall compensation; (2) the Company's use of equity grants provides appropriate long term incentives; (3) the Company offered an appropriate mix of cash and equity compensation to facilitate the alignment of         the interests of the Company's senior executives with those of the Company and its stockholders; and (4) cash bonuses are balanced with other compensation to incent financial performance and safety and soundness while managing compensation         expense.  In light of regulatory releases, the ultimate goal of the review was to assess the design, governance, policies and procedures of the Company's compensation structure to ensure that, as designed and executed, it does not motivate         excessive risk-taking that could adversely impact the long-term value of the Company.
After conducting the review, the Compensation Committee concluded that the Company's incentive programs do not motivate or         encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking.  This conclusion reflected a review of the Company's structure to determine that credit and other new business approvals are independent of new business efforts.  Other factors, such as fostering an         appropriate risk management culture, were also considered. The Company will continue to review and monitor its compensation programs to ensure that they continue to not motivate excessive risk taking that could adversely impact the long-term value         of the Company. Determination of Compensation Amounts
CEO Compensation Determination Factors
The Compensation Committee evaluated our Chief Executive Officer, Damian Kozlowski's performance for 2017 and 2018, his first         two full years of employment since his hire in 2016, in which year the Bank incurred a loss. Notwithstanding the Company exceeding all requirements and metrics for the payment of bonus and equity grants, Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation in 2018         was kept at 2017 levels as the Compensation Committee monitored sustainability. Additionally, to address shareholder input, his base salary was lowered to $750,000 from $900,000 effective December 31, 2018, and the Compensation Committee determined         to allocate a significant portion of any future equity grants to options instead of restricted stock units beginning in 2019. An analysis of the metrics for the payment of bonus or equity grants is as follows.

 Because of a lower majority percentage shareholder advisory vote at the 2018 annual meeting compared to prior years, the         Company reached out to its shareholders. The Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer are the Company's primary representatives who meet with investors. In 2018, these officers met with shareholders owning approximately 51% of the         Company's stock.  Related shareholder feedback has resulted in structural changes to the CEO's compensation determination. A summary of the shareholder input and resulting actions are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Shareholder Input   Company Actions  
 The CEO's base salary exceeds the peer median. A lower base salary better aligns pay for performance which places                  greater emphasis on incentive compensation and less emphasis on base salary.   Effective December 31, 2018, the CEO's base salary was reduced from $900,000 per year, to $750,000 per year.  
 The CEO's equity awards upon his hire included a significant amount of stock options, but subsequent grants consisted                  solely of restricted stock units.  Stock options provide greater incentive for pay for performance, since the value of that compensation is driven exclusively by the increase in stock price after the grant date.   In 2019 and future years a significant allocation of any equity compensation granted will be awarded as stock options.                  As of December 31, 2018, Mr. Kozlowski had 166,626 unvested restricted stock units versus 300,000 stock options.  
 Publicizing the pre-established financial targets required to be achieved for pay for performance awards on the                  Company's website, creates transparency and accountability for pay for performance.  Pre-established financial and other goals are presented on the Company's website, and were used in the determination of 2018 cash bonus and equity incentive compensation. In the future, the Compensation Committee will convert its established metrics into a grid for additional clarity in how incentive compensation awards were determined.

 Increases in net income and other performance measures have been significant, but sustainability should be considered.   Total CEO compensation for 2018 was maintained at 2017 levels, notwithstanding the significant increases in net                  income, return on assets and return on equity in 2017, with further increases in 2018. These parameters were in the upper quartile of peers in 2018. The Compensation Committee continues to validate sustainability of financial performance                  including return on assets, return on equity and other measures.  
 Comparisons to peers on key financial metrics provide a tool to help determine that financial goals adequately reward                  shareholders.   The Compensation Committee added peer comparisons for return on assets and equity to its decisioning parameters. The                  detailed financial targets required for pay for performance awards on the Company's website may also be compared to peers.  
 Some companies use grids or assign percentages to their various pre-established metrics which weight those factors in                  incentive compensation awards.   In 2018, the Compensation Committee required that the Company achieve pre-established metrics for the award of                  incentive compensation. In the future, the Compensation Committee will convert its established metrics into a grid for additional clarity in how incentive compensation awards were determined.  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Kozlowski was named the Company's CEO in June 2016, a year in which the Company had significant regulatory requirements         outstanding, and in which it incurred losses. He was engaged because of his proven experience in specific areas required by the Company. Those areas and the Compensation Committee's related evaluation are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 a.   Financial turn-around: Mr. Kozlowski was hired in 2016 to engineer a financial turnaround from losses in that year.  The Company                    exceeded the required financial targets set by the Board of Directors in both 2017 and 2018.  In 2018, return on assets and equity were 2.07% and 24.26%, respectively. Compared to the losses in 2016, pre-tax income from continuing                    operations in 2017 was $40.4 million in 2017 and $119.8 million in 2018. Net income in 2018 increased to $88.7 million from $21.7 million in 2017. The Compensation Committee compared the return on assets and equity to its peer groups. The                    Compensation Committee concluded that the Company was in the top quartile of peers for both return on assets and equity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 b.   Improving the bank's compliance with regulatory requirements: The Board of Directors including the Compensation Committee has                    monitored the implementation of a unique software system for BSA, as well as other infrastructure improvements. These include the creation in 2018 of a Center of Excellence for BSA and related regulatory requirements. The system and                    infrastructure have been largely implemented and enhancements continue to be made. Virtually all the items in the regulatory "encyclopedia", a compendium of all outstanding regulatory findings or recommendations, have been verified.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 c.   Reducing financial and regulatory risk, while sustaining financial performance: During Mr. Kozlowski's 2.5-year tenure Company has                    sold or otherwise disposed of approximately 60% of its remaining higher risk discontinued assets and related investment in unconsolidated entity. Additionally, higher risk lines of business such as European operations were sold, while                    lower charge- off lending lines have been emphasized.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 d.   Other goals: Under the oversight of the CEO new sources of revenue including the rapid funds product were initiated, an innovation                    framework and process was created, operating platforms were reengineered, including SBLOC to facilitate scalability, and the corporate culture was improved to include a formal diversity and inclusion program.  
[END TABLE]
A graphic representation of income before taxes shows the improvement in income from 2016, when the Company incurred losses.         The two full years in which Mr. Kozlowski has served as CEO show dramatic improvements. In 2018, return on assets and equity were 2.07% and 24.26%, respectively, and was within the top quartile of peers in both those measures. The Board of Directors pre-established specific financial and non-financial goals which were key in achieving the improved         2018 financial results and facilitating future growth. The Company achieved or exceeded these goals, delineated above and below.  While Mr. Kozlowski had met or exceeded the required criteria, the Compensation Committee maintained base salary,         equity and bonus in 2018 at the same levels as 2017 as it continued to monitor sustainability. Additionally, while a majority shareholder advisory vote affirmed executive compensation, the percentage was reduced from prior years. The Company         reached out to shareholders and implemented pay for performance as shown in the table above with the column headings "Shareholder Input" and "Company Actions".
CEO compensation is comprised of base salary, cash bonus and equity awards. To restructure CEO compensation to pay for         performance, base salary was reduced effective December 31, 2018, and future equity awards will include a significant allocation of stock options. The following factors impact the committee's determination of the amounts of cash bonus and equity         awards for pay for performance:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.   Pre-established, Publicly Disclosed Financial Goals  
[END TABLE]
In determining the Chief Executive Officer's compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee established specific, pre-set         financial goals. See "Pre-established Requirements for Bonus and Equity Grants" above. For transparency, these goals were posted on the Company's website. These goals were achieved sooner than expected and the goals for 2019 are being increased,         and will be updated on the Company's website. Continual progress towards achieving and exceeding these goals validated maintenance of base salary for 2018 at the original level necessary to retain the services of the current CEO. It also validated         the 2018 cash and restricted stock equity awards at the levels necessary to retain the CEO's service. Notwithstanding that financial performance was in the top quartile of peers for 2018, total CEO compensation was below the median, as the         committee continued to monitor sustainability of such financial performance. Additionally, effective December 31, 2018, base salary was reduced to the peer group median, and a significant portion of any future equity compensation awarded will be in         the form of stock options.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2.   Performance versus Peers  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee expanded its peer group in 2018 as detailed under "Compensation Objectives and the Focus of         Compensation Awards". While it did review the results of comparisons with its prior smaller peer group, the Compensation Committee now utilizes only one peer group, comprised of twenty-seven banks. The Company's 2.07% return on assets was         significantly more than that peer group which averaged in the 1.2% range, which was also the approximate median. The Company's 24.26% return on equity also significantly exceeded peer averages in the 11% range, which was also the approximate         median. Both the return on assets and return on equity were in the top quartile of these peer groups. The Company's progress toward ultimately achieving 2018 performance in the top quartile of peers validated maintenance of CEO base salary for 2018         at the original level necessary to engage the CEO in 2016. It also validated the 2018 cash and restricted stock equity awards at the levels necessary to retain the CEO's service. As noted previously, base salary was nonetheless reduced to the         approximate median of the Compensation Committee's peer group effective December 31, 2018, to increase the pay for performance element of compensation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  3.  Three-Year Analysis of CEO Compensation and Comparison of CEO Total Compensation to Peers  
[END TABLE]
Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation was $3.5 million in 2016, the year he was hired, and $1.5 million in both 2017 and 2018.         Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation in 2016 was significantly higher in that year because of equity grants necessary to engage his services. In 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the following: a. that pre-established financial goals were         exceeded ahead of schedule b. financial performance was in the upper quartile of peers, and c. the other pre-established goals set by the Board of Directors had been satisfied. Nonetheless, total compensation in 2018 was maintained at the same         level as 2017. For 2017 and 2018, the CEO's total compensation was below the 2017 total compensation (the most recent year available) of the Compensation Committee's 27 bank peer group.  Mr. Kozlowski's total compensation for 2018 of $1.5 million,         compared to 2017 median compensation of $2.0 million for the 27-bank peer group. As discussed above in item 2, Performance versus Peers, Mr. Kozlowski's performance in the top quartile and his total compensation below the median supported the         relatively high base salary in 2018 and equity grants as restricted stock in 2018. However, since the committee decided that the initial turn-around period since Mr. Kozlowski's June 2016 hire date concluded in 2018, 2019 base salary would be         reduced. Also, any future equity compensation awards would include a significant portion of stock options. The committee will continue to monitor progress to confirm sustainability of financial targets which were exceeded in 2018 and comparisons to         peers over a three-year period. Since Mr. Kozlowski was hired June 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 will constitute the first full three-year period of his tenure. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  4.  Other Goals  
[END TABLE]
In addition to pre-established and publicly disclosed financial parameters on the Company's website and financial performance         comparisons with peer groups, the Board of Directors pre-established other goals at the beginning of 2018 and the Compensation Committee utilized those goals in its evaluation.  Those goals and an outline of the results are as follows.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintain revenue momentum and build new sources of revenue generation: In addition to new rapid funds transfer products implemented in                    2018, under Mr. Kozlowski's management, other products were placed into development.  
• Create and implement an actionable innovation framework: Mr. Kozlowski visited each office throughout the country and met with all                    departments to initiate an innovation framework. He created a welcoming cultural environment by inviting ideas from staff. He conceived of and directed the creation of the financial crimes Center of Excellence to improve and innovate                    detection and reporting of financial crimes, especially BSA.  
• Reengineer operating platform to support innovative growth: In addition to creating the financial crimes Center of Excellence, Mr.                    Kozlowski initiated changes in processes and vendors and reorganized the human resources department. He also directed enhancements to project management processes, which positively impacted multiple departments.  
• Implement Integrated Compliance Program and complete encyclopedia of regulatory issues: Mr. Kozlowski institutionalized a compliance                    structure which addressed root causes of regulatory issues. Additionally, he directed the creation of a log of all outstanding regulatory and related issues which required follow up, and oversaw completion of those issues.  
• Implement enhanced culture, inclusion and diversity program: Under Mr. Kozlowski's aegis, a multi-pronged approach to enhanced                    culture, inclusion and diversity was created, involving the whole organization. His commitment to diversity has resulted in a more diverse workforce and periodic celebration of different diverse groups.  
• Integrate the automated SBLOC platform with key partners: Significant progress was made in the automation of the SBLOC platform, with                    full implementation of collateral and documentation management modules.  
• Implement long-term liquidity and capital management program: Mr. Kozlowski oversaw significant enhancements to liquidity and capital                    management.  
[END TABLE]
The committee reviewed each of these goals and determined that they had been either fully implemented or significant progress         had been made to satisfy the committee as outlined above. Especially important to the committee was the progress made on regulatory issues. Accordingly, the committee concluded that achievement of these non-quantitative goals also supported         maintenance of the relatively high base salary and the granting of equity as restricted stock units for 2018. Effective December 31, 2018 base salary was lowered to a median peer level and any future equity compensation would include stock options.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  5.  Risk Considerations  
[END TABLE]
The committee viewed the Board of Director's financial and other publicly disclosed goals in tandem with the institution's         risk profile. For financial performance especially, levels of risk required ongoing consideration so as not to incentivize excessive risk. Accordingly, specific percentages of additional compensation were not assigned to specific measures of         performance. Instead, risk would be considered as part of a balanced scorecard approach. Upon its review, the committee determined that risk had been reduced, while financial performance had been significantly improved. Significant reductions in         higher risk discontinued operations loans had been exceeded by growth in lower credit loss lines of business such as securities-backed lines of credit. The sale of the IRA portfolio concluded the sale of niche deposit lines of business which had         unique risk elements. A significant component of the improvement in financial performance resulted from expense reductions which also had been demonstrated not to result in additional risk. Accordingly, risk had been reduced, while financial         performance had been significantly improved. All five factors above supported 2018 compensation levels. All the pre-established financial goals were either achieved or         significantly exceeded while risk was decreased.  Performance of return on assets and return on equity versus peers placed the Company in the upper quartile of its 27 bank peer group. while total CEO compensation in 2018 was less than peer medians.         Pre-established strategic, non-quantifiable goals, which would impact financial performance in the future were all either met, or showed expected progress. The committee received frequent updates by Board subcommittees and other reporting to         monitor the regulatory related and other goals to reach this conclusion.
While total compensation for the CEO was below peers, 2018 financial performance was in the top quartile         of peers. However, compensation in 2018 was maintained at the 2017 level, as the Compensation Committee continued to monitor sustainability of financial achievements and other goals. Additionally, effective December 31, 2018, base salary has been         reduced to peer median levels while any future equity awards will include a significant allocation of stock options to align those with "pay for performance".
As a result of the Company's progress as described above, Chief Executive Officer Damian Kozlowski was         awarded $300,000 of restricted stock units vesting over two years and eight months and a $300,000 cash bonus. To better align Mr. Kozlowski's pay for performance, and be responsive to shareholder input, his annual base salary of $900,000 for both         2017 and 2018, was reduced to $750,000, effective December 31, 2018.  In 2016, Mr. Kozlowski's compensation had been significantly higher than 2017, as it reflected equity awards which were necessary to hire Mr. Kozlowski. This compensation both in         base pay and equity exceeded previous Chief Executive Officers' compensation.  However, Mr. Kozlowski's performance in timely profitability improvement in 2017 and 2018 including growing revenue in a safe and sound manner, reducing expenses and         resolving regulatory issues, was determined by the Compensation Committee to warrant these compensation levels. Based upon top quartile rankings, and other peer comparisons, total compensation was below peers. Nonetheless, compensation in 2018 was         maintained at 2017 levels, while the Compensation Committee continued to monitor sustainability of the significant financial improvement in 2017, with further improvement in 2018.
The Compensation Committee will continue to evaluate Mr. Kozlowski's performance with respect to his         multi-year plan which projects increasing profitability in each year.
Other NEOs
A history of other NEO compensation is followed by a chart for 2018 compensation. The footnotes to the         chart list the pre-established requirements for cash bonus and equity grants. The 2018 equity grants consisted of restricted stock units vesting over a two year and eight-month period.
Mr. Hugh McFadden, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, assumed his position in June         2016. His annual base salary was set at $300,000 per year and was not increased in either 2017 or 2018. He was awarded no bonus or equity compensation in 2016. In 2017, he was awarded $100,000 of restricted stock units, vesting over three years,         and a $100,000 cash bonus. Mr. McFadden's base salary has not been increased since his 2016 hire date, to emphasize pay for performance.
Dr. John Leto, Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, assumed his position in June         2016. His annual base salary was set at $400,000 per year and was not increased in either 2017 or 2018. He was awarded no bonus or equity compensation in 2016. In 2017, as previously agreed to between the Company and Dr. Leto, he was awarded         $454,196 of restricted stock units, vesting over three years, to replace those he had foregone at another institution, as an incentive to accept employment with the Company. Dr. Leto's base salary has not been increased since his 2016 hire date, to         emphasize pay for performance. Mr. Mark Connolly, Executive Vice President and Head of Credit Markets, assumed his position in June         2016. His annual salary was set at $300,000 and was not increased in either 2017 or 2018. He was awarded no bonus or equity compensation in 2016. In 2017, he was awarded $100,000 of restricted stock units, vesting over three years, and a $100,000         cash bonus.  Mr. Connolly's base salary has not been increased since his 2016 hire date, to emphasize pay for performance.
Mr. Paul Frenkiel, Chief Financial Officer, was not awarded either a cash bonus or equity compensation in         2016 or 2017. His salary in 2016 was $308,077 which was increased 1% to $310,000 for 2017 and 2018.
At the beginning of the year, each officer of the Company, including each NEO, participates in goal-         setting which pre-establishes their requirements for the payment of bonuses and equity grants. The metrics and other requirements are shown in the footnotes to the following chart:

 Hugh McFadden (e)   Chief Operating Officer   300,000     250,000     83%   250,000   83%  
(a)   Effective December 31, 2018, Mr. Kozlowski's base salary was reduced to $750,000. Please see the chart entitled "Pre-established                    Requirements for Bonus and Equity Grants" in the "Determination of Compensation Amounts" for the metrics for a cash bonus for the CEO.  
 (b)   Mr. Frenkiel was required to increase investment securities revenue at least 10% in 2018 compared to 2017 without increasing risk,                    while achieving a yield which would rank in the upper quartile of peers. The upper quartile peer ranking requirement was based on the yields reported in the Uniform Bank Performance Report for FDIC insured banks. For 2018, revenues were                    increased in excess of the 10% requirement, while overall portfolio risk was determined not to have been increased. The Company's yield was also in the top quartile of peers. Accordingly, all requirements were met or exceeded.  Mr.                    Frenkiel was also primarily responsible for balance sheet and treasury management such that liquidity and capital were maintained at the levels approved by the Board of Directors. The tier one capital ratio requirement of 8.50% was                    exceeded, as December 31, 2018 capital amounted to 10.11%.  
(c)   Mr. Connolly oversees all lending operations and is also responsible for the disposition of the balance of discontinued operations to                    maximize shareholder value. Under Mr. Connolly's leadership, loan revenues have continued their consistent increases and amounted to $95.3 million in 2018 compared to $79.1 million in 2017, an increase of 20%. These higher revenues                    reflected 17% and 8% respective growth in 2018 year end loan balances for SBA and SBLOC after similar increases in 2017.  Accordingly, overall revenue growth matched pre-established budget requirements. Mr. Connolly's targeted requirement                    was to reduce year over year discontinued assets by 25%. This goal was exceeded as discontinued assets were reduced 35% to $197.8 million at year end 2018, from $304.3 million at the prior year end.

This goal was exceeded as discontinued assets were reduced 35% to $197.8 million at year end 2018, from $304.3 million at the prior year end.  
(d)   One of Dr. Leto's primary responsibilities is to work closely with the Chief Executive Officer and staff to effectuate cost                    reductions. Dr. Leto implemented changes in the Bank's organizational structures which significantly improved efficiency, by reducing or consolidating certain levels of management and right sizing staffing levels. While the pay for                    performance requirement for 2018 was to keep non-interest expense flat while increasing revenues, non-interest expense was reduced from $154.9 million to $151.3 million. These 2018 reductions in expense were incremental to the approximate                    $15 million of reductions (independent of BSA expenses) in 2017 compared to 2016, the year in which Mr. Leto was hired. In 2018, non-interest expense was further reduced, in addition to sustaining the expense reductions from 2017. Dr.                    Leto continued to direct and oversee various other operating expense reductions in data processing, facilities and other areas. Dr. Leto was directly involved in various staffing efforts to better align large data skill sets to resolving                    regulatory issues and, with qualifications in organization management, reconfigured incentive payments to more directly align with improvements in financial performance. Dr. Leto also reconfigured the operations of the project management                    office, leading to improved prioritization and implementation. These non-financial requirements were met.

(e)   In addition to significant participation in cost reductions related to operations, Mr. McFadden created an infrastructure which                    managed all outstanding regulatory issues and made personnel changes necessary to accelerate related progress. Such accelerated progress was acknowledged by the Compensation Committee. Mr. McFadden's contributions were not immediately                    reflected in financial results. However, the Board of Director's commitment to resolving its regulatory issues and the related progress under Mr. McFadden, warranted this additional compensation.  In 2017 and 2018, Mr. McFadden provided                    daily oversight in the resolution of those issues. He also oversaw the implementation of milestones in an Integrated Compliance Plan which addressed root causes for regulatory issues.  Additionally, Mr. McFadden played an executive role                    in the formation of the financial crimes Center of Excellence. The above represented Mr. McFadden's requirements, which did not have immediate financial impact, but were crucial in satisfying regulatory expectations.

Such accelerated progress was acknowledged by the Compensation Committee. Mr. McFadden's contributions were not immediately                    reflected in financial results. However, the Board of Director's commitment to resolving its regulatory issues and the related progress under Mr. McFadden, warranted this additional compensation.  In 2017 and 2018, Mr. McFadden provided                    daily oversight in the resolution of those issues. He also oversaw the implementation of milestones in an Integrated Compliance Plan which addressed root causes for regulatory issues.  Additionally, Mr. McFadden played an executive role                    in the formation of the financial crimes Center of Excellence. The above represented Mr. McFadden's requirements, which did not have immediate financial impact, but were crucial in satisfying regulatory expectations.

The Compensation Committee reiterated its previously approved compensation recoupment policy as follows:
Compensation Recoupment Policy
The compensation recoupment policy applies if the Company is required to provide an accounting restatement for any of the         prior three fiscal years for which audited financial statements have been completed, due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws. In the event of such a restatement, the Compensation         Committee will determine, in its discretion, whether (1) NEOs, regardless of whether they were directly responsible for the restatement, or (2) all other recipients of cash-based or equity-based incentive compensation who were directly responsible         for the restatement, have received any cash-based or equity-based incentive compensation that they would not have been entitled to receive under the restated results. In the event of any future financial restatements, the Audit Committee will         evaluate the facts and formally consider whether any compensation recoupment (clawback) from any Company officer is warranted.
The Compensation Committee then will take such actions as it deems necessary or appropriate, depending on all the facts and         circumstances as determined during its review, including (i) the recoupment of all or part of any such excess compensation, (ii) recommending disciplinary actions to the Board of Directors, up to and including termination, and/or (iii) the pursuit         of other available remedies.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis above and has discussed that         analysis with management. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by         reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

 Ratio of Chief Executive Officer Pay to Median Pay
For 2018, the Company's last completed fiscal year, the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the         Company, other than the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), was $79,844, and the total compensation of the CEO was $1,509,324, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above.  Based on this information, for 2018, the CEO's annual total compensation         was 18.9 times that of the median of the annual total compensation of all employees.
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of the Company's employees, as well as to determine the annual         total compensation of the median employee and the CEO, the Company took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company determined that as of the payroll for December 21, 2018, there were 589 employees. This population consisted of the                    Company's full-time and an insignificant number of part-time workers. Independent contractors were not included in the analysis. December 21, 2018 was selected as the date to identify the "median employee" because it was the last payroll                    date within the last three months of 2018 and it enabled the Company to make such identification in a reasonably efficient and economical manner.  
• To identify the "median employee", the Company analyzed the salary, wages and overtime pay of all employees, to account for employees                    who had only worked a portion of the year. It also considered additional compensation consisting of 401(k) matches and health insurance. Since less than 10% of Company employees receive equity awards, such awards were excluded from the                    compensation measure.  
• The Company identified its median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all employees included                    in the calculation. Since all Company employees are located in the United States, including the CEO, the Company did not make any cost of living adjustments.  
• Once the median employee was identified, the Company combined the elements of such employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with                    the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K, resulting in total compensation of $79,844. The difference between such employee's salary, wages and overtime pay and the employee's annual total compensation represents the                    estimated value of health care benefits which were estimated at $7,844 per employee, which includes coverage for dependents.  The Company's 401(k) match was also included in the compensation analysis.  
• With respect to the total annual compensation of the CEO, the Company used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the Summary                    Compensation Table above.

Matthew Cohn PROPOSAL 3. APPROVAL OF ACCOUNTANTS
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that the stockholders approve the selection of Grant Thornton LLP, independent         registered public accounting firm, to audit the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Representatives of Grant Thornton are expected to be present at the Meeting. These representatives will have the         opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
The following table presents the aggregate fees billed by Grant Thornton for each of the services listed below for each of         the Company's last two fiscal years.
Audit Fees 
[BEGIN TABLE]
               2018                   2017  
 Audit Fees (1)       $   809,068           $   912,525  
 Audit – Related Fees       24,989          
 Tax Fees (2)           115,932               56,699  
 Total       $   949,989           $   969,224  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees consisted of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Grant Thornton in connection with its audit of the Company's                      consolidated financial statements and its limited reviews of the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements that are normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for these fiscal years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Tax fees consisted of the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Grant Thornton for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning in 2018                      and 2017.  
[END TABLE]
Exchange Act rules generally require any engagement by a public company of an accountant to provide audit or non-audit         services to be pre-approved by the audit committee of that public company. This pre-approval requirement is waived with respect to the provision of services other than audit, review or attest services if certain conditions set forth in rule         2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) under the Exchange Act are met. None of the audit-related and tax services described above were subject to this Rule and the approval procedures set forth therein. All services provided to the Company by Grant Thornton in 2018 and         2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote "FOR" the selection of Grant Thornton as the Company's independent         registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. OTHER MATTERS
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board of Directors does not intend to present and has not been informed that any         other person intends to present any other matters for action at the Meeting. However, if other matters do properly come before the meeting or any adjournment, postponement or continuation thereof, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies         to vote upon them in accordance with their best judgment. For any other matter which may properly come before the meeting, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting at which a quorum is present is         required, either in person or by proxy, for approval, unless otherwise required by law.
Except as set forth in this section, all Common Shares represented by valid proxies received will be voted in accordance with         the provisions of the proxy.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS
Rule 14a-8 the Exchange Act establishes the eligibility requirements and the procedures that must be followed for a         stockholder's proposal to be included in a public company's proxy materials.  Proposals submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy statement for its 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by the Company's Secretary on or before         the close of business December 6, 2019. Additionally, the persons named as proxies in the proxy statement and/or form of proxy will have discretionary authority to vote on a stockholder proposal received before February 19, 2020, if we briefly         describe the matter in the proxy statement and how management's proxy holders intend to vote on it, or if the stockholder does not comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-4(c) (2) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Stockholders who wish to submit their recommendations for director candidates to the Nominating and Governance Committee         should send their written recommendation to the Company's executive offices, The Bancorp, Inc., and Attention: Nominating and Governance Committee Chairman, 409 Silverside Road Suite 105, Wilmington, Delaware 19809. These stockholders must         represent that they are stockholders of the Company and will remain so through the date of the relevant annual meeting of stockholders of the Company and include the written consent of the person so recommended to serve as a director if nominated         and elected and to provide such information as the Nominating and the Governance Committee may request, as well as a description of the nominee's background and qualifications. All stockholder recommendations received by the Nominating and         Governance Committee will be reviewed at the first meeting of the Nominating and Governance Committee held after receipt of the recommendation. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominees recommended by security holders for the         annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020, if submitted as described above by December 6, 2019.
STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH
We seek to actively engage with our shareholders. We recognize the benefits that come from this interaction.  We engage with         shareholders throughout the year to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓   Provide visibility and transparency into our business, our performance and our governance practices: The metrics and other targets                  utilized by the Company and Compensation Committee to assess performance and determine incentive compensation are at: http://investors.thebancorp.com/Presentations  
 ✓   Discuss with our shareholders the issues that are important to them, hear their expectations for us, and share our views: The Company's                  Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer host quarterly phone calls in which all shareholders may participate, and which includes a question and answer session.    
 ✓   Assess emerging issues that may affect our business, inform our decision making, enhance our corporate disclosures and help shape our                  practices: As a result of a reduction in the percentage for the majority approval of the advisory vote on compensation taken at the Company's annual meeting held in 2018, executive management reached out to shareholders on that topic. The                  Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer are the Company's primary representatives who meet with investors. In 2018, these officers met with shareholders owning approximately 51% of the Company's stock. A chart detailing the                  specific shareholder recommendations made and corresponding steps to implement pay for performance and other governance, is presented both in the "Executive Summary" and "Determination of Compensation Amounts."  
[END TABLE]
 How We Engage
In addition to quarterly phone calls in which all shareholders may participate, we provide         institutional investors with many opportunities and events to provide feedback to our Board and senior management. We participate in:
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Formal events  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  One-on-one sessions  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✓  Group meetings throughout the year  
[END TABLE]
The Company's Board of Directors and management value direct interaction and communication with stockholders. The Company         encourages shareholders to contact it at any time to discuss compensation and any other topics of importance to them. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are the primary Company officers who meet with shareholders and their         representatives. Other officers are also made available as requested by shareholders.  In 2018, senior management held more than 50 meetings and conference calls with most of the Company's major stockholders.  Although some investors have a policy         of not meeting directly with management, management was successful in speaking directly with stockholders holding, in total, more than 51% of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company uses these meetings to obtain feedback from its         stockholders about areas important to them; including the Company's business model, performance, corporate governance, compensation practices and other investor topics. In engagement with shareholders of the Company, the lower percentage of         affirmative say-on-pay votes in 2018 compared to prior years was discussed. The Company also reached out to shareholders which did not cast affirmative votes.  After consideration of shareholder input, the compensation committee restructured CEO         compensation to "pay for performance," as more fully described elsewhere in this proxy statement.
Based upon continuing shareholder engagement throughout the year, we believe there is a more positive view of executive         compensation resulting from improvement in 2018 quarterly and annual results. The Company maintains a stockholder relations department headed by Andres Viroslav, and the Company encourages you to call either him at 215.861.7990 or its Corporate         Secretary and Chief Financial Officer, Paul Frenkiel at 302.385.5122 for your feedback and financially-related or other questions.
