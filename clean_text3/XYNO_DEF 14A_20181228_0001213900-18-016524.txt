The Audit Committee is directly responsible for appointing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is not bound by the outcome of this vote. However, if the shareholders do not ratify the selection of Marcum as our independent registered public accounting firm, our Audit Committee intends to reconsider the selection of Marcum as our independent registered public accounting firm.
Marcum has audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
The following is a summary of fees paid to Marcum for services rendered during the period from October 7, 2016 (inception) through December 31, 2017:
Audit Fees
Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by Marcum in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Marcum for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q for the respective periods and other required filings with the SEC for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 totaled $24,500 and -0- respectively.

Pre-Approval Policy
Our audit committee was formed upon the consummation of our initial public offering. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).

The adjournment proposal, if adopted, will request the chairman of the Meeting (who has agreed to act accordingly) to adjourn the Meeting to a later date or dates to permit further solicitation of proxies. The adjournment proposal will only be presented to our stockholders in the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Meeting to approve the other proposals in this proxy statement. If the adjournment proposal is not approved by our stockholders, the chairman of the meeting shall not adjourn the Meeting to a later date in the event, based on the tabulated votes, there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Meeting to approve any of the other proposals.

Terms of Office of Officers and Directors
Our officers are elected by the board of directors and serve at the discretion of the board of directors, rather than for specific terms of office. Our board of directors is authorized to appoint persons to the offices set forth in our Memorandum and Articles of Association as it deems appropriate. Our Memorandum and Articles of Association provides that our officers may consist of a Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, one or more vice-presidents, secretaries and treasurers and such other offices as may be determined by the board of directors. However, at the closing of the Business Combination our board and officers will change as described in the section entitled "Management After the Business Combination" in our preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018.
Shareholder Communications
Shareholders who wish to communicate directly with our board of directors, or any individual director, should direct questions in writing to our Corporate Secretary, Bison Capital Acquisition Corp., 609-610 21st Century Tower, No. 40 Liangmaqiao Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Board Communication" or "Director Communication." All such letters must identify the author and clearly state whether the intended recipients are all members of the board of directors or just certain specified individual directors. The Corporate Secretary will make copies of all such letters and circulate them to the appropriate director or directors.
Director Independence
NASDAQ listing standards require that a majority of our board of directors be independent as long as we are not a controlled company. An "independent director" is defined under the Nasdaq rules generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which in the opinion of the company's board of directors, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Our board of directors has determined that each of Messrs. Thomas Folinsbee, Charles Prizzi, and Richard Wu is an "independent director" as defined in the NASDAQ listing standards and applicable SEC rules. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Leadership Structure and Risk Oversight
The board of directors' oversight of risk is administered directly through the board of directors, as a whole, or through its audit committee. Various reports and presentations regarding risk management are presented to the board of directors including the procedures that the Company has adopted to identify and manage risks. The audit committee addresses risks that fall within the committee's area of responsibility. For example, the audit committee is responsible for overseeing the quality and objectivity of Bison's financial statements and the independent audit thereof. The audit committee reserves time at each of its meetings to meet with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm outside of the presence of the Company's management. See "Management After the Business Combination" in our preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on November 2, 2018.
Board of Directors and Committees
Our board of directors has three standing committees: an audit committee, a compensation committee, and a special committee. The rules of NASDAQ and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act as required by the rules of the NASDAQ, require that the audit committee and the compensation committee of a listed company be comprised solely of independent directors. 
Audit                                          Committee
Since our IPO, we have an audit committee of the board of directors. Messrs. Richard Wu, Thomas Folinsbee, and Charles Prizzi serve as members of our audit committee. Mr. Richard Wu serves as chairman of the audit committee. Under the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules, we are required to have three members of the audit committee all of whom must be independent. Messrs. Richard Wu, Thomas Folinsbee, and Charles Prizzi are independent.   
Each member of the audit committee is financially literate and our board of directors has determined that Mr. Richard Wu qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in applicable SEC rules.
We have adopted an audit committee charter, which details the principal functions of the audit committee, including:
Compensation Committee
Since our IPO, we have a compensation committee of the board of directors. The members of our Compensation Committee are Messrs. Richard Wu, Thomas Folinsbee, and Charles Prizzi. Mr. Prizzi serves as chairman of the compensation committee. We have adopted a compensation committee charter, which details the principal functions of the compensation committee, including:
The current charter of the Compensation Committee also provides that the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, retain, or obtain the advice of a compensation consultant, legal counsel, or other adviser and will be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of any such adviser. Before engaging or receiving advice from a compensation consultant, external legal counsel, or any other adviser, however, the compensation committee will consider the independence of each such adviser, including the factors required by Nasdaq and the SEC.  
Special Committee (in connection with the Business Combination)
During May 2018, the Board of Directors formed a Special Committee of independent directors to evaluate and make recommendations to the Board of Directors with respect to the Business Combination of the Company. The members of the Special Committee are Messrs. Mr. Richard Wu, Mr. Thomas Folinsbee, and Mr. Charles Prizzi.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee
On November 13, 2018 the Board of Directors formed the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The members of our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee are Charlie Prizzi, Tom Folinsbee and Richard Wu. Mr. Wu will serve as chairman of the corporate governance and nominating committee. We have adopted a committee charter, which details the principal functions of the committee, including:
Establish criteria for membership of the Board, including standards for the independence of directors to serve on the Board and committees of the Board.
Code of Conduct and Ethics
We have adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers, and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of any publicly traded class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of equity securities of the Company with the SEC. Officers, directors, and greater-than-ten-percent shareholders are required by the SEC's regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms that they file.
Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and Forms 4 furnished since the effective date of our IPO, we believe that all such forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely filed, as necessary, by the officers, directors, and security holders required to file the same.
Executive Compensation
We pay each of our independent directors an annual retainer in an aggregate of $38,400 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the first anniversary of the closing of the IPO and ending on the earlier of the consummation of our Business Combination and our liquidation. Until the earlier of the consummation of our Business Combination and our liquidation, we pay an affiliate of our Chairman a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative services. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party for such services. Except as set forth above, no compensation was paid or will be paid to our Sponsor, executive officers, directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to or in connection with the consummation of our Business Combination. Additionally, these individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on the Business Combination. Our independent directors review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors, or our or their affiliates.
After the completion of our Business Combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management, or other fees from the combined company. All such fees would be fully disclosed to shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished to our shareholders in connection with the Business Combination. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will be determined, or recommenced, to the board of directors for determination, either by a committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.  
We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain their positions with us after the consummation of our Business Combination, although it is possible that some or all of our executive officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after the Business Combination. The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management's motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with us after the consummation of our Business Combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any potential Business Combination. We are not party to any agreements with our executive officers and directors that provide for benefits upon termination of employment.
Grants of Plan-Based Awards and Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End
We have adopted the Xynomic 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, the effectiveness of which is conditioned on the approval of the Business Combination Proposal and the Incentive Plan Proposal.
Employment Agreements
We do not currently have any written employment agreements with any of our directors and officers except certain indemnification agreements with certain directors.
Retirement/Resignation Plans
We do not currently have any plans or arrangements in place regarding the payment to any of our executive officers following such person's retirement or resignation.
Director Compensation
The Company pays its independent directors an annual retainer in an aggregate amount of $38,400 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the first anniversary of the IPO and ending on the earlier of the Business Combination and the Company's liquidation.
Through June 30, 2018, the Company has paid $38,400 in director's fees. We reimburse each director for reasonable travel expenses related to such director's attendance at board of directors and committee meetings. BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP OF SECURITIES
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership based on 7,978,937 shares of our common stock outstanding as of November 21, 2018, based on information obtained from the persons named below, with respect to the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock by:
Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares beneficially owned by them.  
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
In December 2016, we issued an aggregate of 1,437,500 Founder Shares to our Initial Shareholders for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.017 per share. On June 19, 2017, the number of Founder Shares issued under the original subscription agreement was increased by way of the sub-division of each of the then existing Founder Shares on a 1.05 for 1 basis, resulting in the total number of Founder Shares becoming 1,509,375. The Founder Shares are identical to the shares sold in the IPO, except that (1) the Founder Shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions as set forth in a certain share escrow agreement, (2) the Founder Shares were purchased pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and will become tradable only after certain conditions are met or the resale of the Founder Shares is registered under the Securities Act, in addition to in accordance with the terms of the share escrow agreement, and (3) the Initial Shareholders have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to any shares in connection with the consummation of Business Combination and (ii) to waive their liquidation rights with respect to their Founder Shares and private shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. All of the Founder Shares were placed in escrow with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent, at the time of our IPO.
Additionally, subject to certain limited exceptions, the Initial Shareholders have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees) until, with respect to 50% of the Founder Shares, the earlier of (i) one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the date on which the closing price of the Company's ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after a Business Combination, and with respect to the remaining 50% of the Founder Shares, upon one year after the date of the consummation of a Business Combination, or earlier, in each case, if, subsequent to a Business Combination, the Company consummates a subsequent liquidation, merger, stock exchange, or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company's shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities, or other property.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, our Sponsor, Bison Capital Holding Company Limited, and EarlyBirdCapital purchased an aggregate of 388,750 Private Units (or an aggregate purchase price of $3,887,500), of which 362,500 Private Units were purchased by Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and 26,250 Private Units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital. In addition, on June 28, 2017, the Company consummated the sale of an additional 43,312 Placement Units at a price of approximately $10.00 per Unit, of which 39,375 Private Units were purchased by Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and 3,937 Private Units were purchased by EarlyBirdCapital, generating gross proceeds of $433,125. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Units were added to the net proceeds from the IPO held in the Trust Account.
The Private Units are identical to the Units sold in the IPO, except that (i) Bison Capital Holding Company Limited and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed not to transfer, assign, or sell any of the Private Units until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions, (ii) the Private Units (including underlying securities) were purchased pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and will become tradable only after certain conditions are met or the resale of the Private Units is registered under the Securities Act, and (iii) the warrants included in the Private Units (the "Private Warrants") are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by our Sponsor or EarlyBirdCapital or their permitted transferees. However, the holders have agreed (a) to vote their private shares (representing the ordinary shares underlying the Private Units) and any Public Shares in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose or vote in favor of an amendment to our Memorandum and Articles of Association, prior to and unrelated to a Business Combination, to affect the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to redeem all Public Shares if it cannot complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, unless the Company provides public shareholders an opportunity to redeem their Public Shares, (c) not to redeem any shares included in the Private Units (the "Private Shares") into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell their shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination, and (d) not to participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated.
We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Sponsor $5,000 per month for office space, utilities, and secretarial and administrative services, as we may require from time to time. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Beijing area, that the fee charged by our Chairman is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.   
Other than the $5,000 per-month administrative fee as described above, the $38,400 annual retainer payments to our independent directors as described below and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations, no compensation or fees of any kind, including finder's fees, consulting fees, or other similar compensation, will be paid to our Sponsor, officers, directors, or to any of their respective affiliates, prior to or with respect to our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Our independent directors review on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our Sponsor, officers, directors, or our or their affiliates and are responsible for reviewing and approving all related party transactions as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K, after reviewing each such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and other improprieties.
We pay each of our independent directors an annual retainer of $38,400 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the first anniversary of the closing of the IPO and ending on the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation.
Prior to our IPO, our Sponsor advanced to us an aggregate of $159,304 and loaned to us $300,000 to cover expenses related to such offering. We repaid these advances and loan from the proceeds of our IPO not placed in the trust account.
In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment, other than the interest on such proceeds that may be released to us for working capital purposes. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lender's discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000 private shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 private rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of an additional 5,000 private shares upon the Closing, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 Company common shares).
After our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management, or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to our shareholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our shareholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials or at the time of a shareholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.
All ongoing and future transactions between us and any member of our management team or his or her respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us at that time, based upon other similar arrangements known to us, to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. It is our intention to obtain estimates from unaffiliated third parties for similar goods or services to ascertain whether such transactions with affiliates are on terms that are no less favorable to us than are otherwise available from such unaffiliated third parties. If a transaction with an affiliated third party were found to be on terms less favorable to us than with an unaffiliated third party, we would not engage in such transaction.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that our initial business combination is fair to our public shareholders from a financial point of view.
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement we entered into on June 19, 2017, our Initial Shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the Founder Shares, the private units and underlying securities, and any securities issued upon conversion of working capital loans. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares are entitled to demand that we register these shares at any time commencing three months prior to the first anniversary of the consummation of our initial business combination. The holders of the private units (or underlying securities) are entitled to demand that we register these securities at any time after we consummate our initial business combination. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back" registration rights on registration statements filed after the consummation of our initial business combination.

On June 4, 2018, the Company entered into a share purchase agreement with certain investors (including Zhongshan Bison), pursuant to which a total of 5,281,101 Convertible Series B Preferred Shares ("Series B Preferred Shares") were to be issued for an aggregated cash consideration of US$17,000,000. On August 16, 2018, the Series B Preferred Shares were issued and the US$17,000,000 were received.
As of November 1, 2018, the Company repaid RMB1, 800,000 (equivalent to US$262,743) of the advance from ZhongShan Bison.

Mr. Peixin Xu, the Chairman of Bison, is the beneficial owner of 21% of Zhongshan Bison and his wife owns 100% of Sponsor.  
As of the date hereof, Bison has issued a $400,000 note to the Sponsor which is convertible into private units at the Sponsor's discretion at the Closing.
