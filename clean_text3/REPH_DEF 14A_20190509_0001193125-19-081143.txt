Our Director Nominees 
You are being asked to vote on the election of Gerri Henwood, Karen Flynn and Bryan M. Reasons as Class II directors, each to serve for a three-year term expiring at our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The number of members of our Board is currently set at eight members and is divided into three classes, each of which has a three-year term. Class I has two directors and Classes II and III each consist of three directors. 
The term of office of our Class II directors expires at the Annual Meeting. We are nominating Gerri Henwood, Karen Flynn and Bryan M. Reasons for re-election at the Annual Meeting to serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors, if any, are elected or appointed, or their earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. Directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by our shareholders at the Annual Meeting. The three nominees receiving the most FOR votes (among votes properly cast in person or by proxy) will be elected. If no contrary indication is made, shares represented by executed proxies will be voted FOR the election of Ms. Henwood, Ms. Flynn and Mr. Reasons. Each nominee has agreed to serve as a director if elected, and we have no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve.

[END TABLE]
If your shares are held by your broker, bank or other holder of record as a nominee or agent (i.e., the shares are held in "street name"), you should follow the instructions provided by your broker, bank or other holder of record. 
Deadline for Voting. The deadline for voting by telephone or Internet is 11:59 PM Eastern Time on May 8, 2019. If you are a registered shareholder and attend the meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person.

BROKER VOTING AND VOTES REQUIRED FOR EACH PROPOSAL 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. The Notice has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record who is considered the shareholder of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you may direct your broker, bank or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the proxy card included in the materials made available or by following their instructions for voting on the Internet. 
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker or other nominee that holds shares for another does not vote on a particular item because the nominee does not have discretionary voting authority for that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. The following table summarizes how broker non-votes and abstentions are treated with respect to our proposals:

 BOARD OF  DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Our Board has nominated Gerri Henwood, Karen Flynn and Bryan M. Reasons for re-election as Class II directors at our Annual Meeting to hold office until our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Our Board is our company's ultimate decision-making body, except with respect to those matters reserved to the shareholders. Our board selects the members of our senior management team, who in turn are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our company. Our Board acts as an advisor and counselor to senior management and oversees its performance. 
Our Board consists of directors divided into three classes, with each class holding office for a three-year term. Gerri Henwood, Karen Flynn and Bryan M. Reasons, current Class II directors, have been nominated by our Board for election at the Annual Meeting for three-year terms that will expire at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their successors, if any, are elected or appointed, or their earlier death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal. Each of the nominees has agreed to be named and to serve, and we expect each nominee to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is unable to serve, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, or the Governance Committee, of our Board will recommend to our Board a replacement nominee. The Board may then designate the other nominee to stand for election. If you voted for the unavailable nominee, your vote will be cast for his or her replacement. 
BOARD STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION 
The Governance Committee of our Board is responsible for recommending the composition and structure of our Board and for developing criteria for Board membership. This Committee regularly reviews director competencies, qualities and experiences, with the goal of ensuring that our Board is comprised of an effective team of directors who function collegially and who are able to apply their experience toward meaningful contributions to our business strategy and oversight of our performance, risk management, organizational development and succession planning. 
Our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws, or Bylaws, provide that the number of members of our Board shall be fixed by the Board from time to time. Our Board is currently fixed at eight members. Our Board is divided into three classes with staggered three-year terms. The Governance Committee is responsible for identifying individuals that the Committee believes are qualified to become Board members. 
CRITERIA FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP 
The Governance Committee has identified certain criteria that it will consider in identifying director nominees. Important general criteria and considerations for Board membership include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 General  Criteria   
 General  Criteria   
    ability to contribute to the Boards range of talent, skill and experience to  provide sound and prudent guidance with respect to the Companys strategy and operations, including, but not limited to: 
   experience at senior levels in public companies, 
   technology and financial expertise, and 
   experience in leadership roles in the life sciences, healthcare or public health fields,  including experience in the areas of development and commercialization of drug products, particularly in the therapeutic areas served by our products and product candidates, and pharmaceutical manufacturing and quality control, including oversight  and expansion of contract manufacturing and development operations; 
[END TABLE]
Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and 2019 Proxy Statement | 4 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BOARD OF  DIRECTORS (continued) 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    personal integrity and ethical character, commitment and independence of thought and  judgment; 
    capability to fairly and equally represent our shareholders; 
    confidence and willingness to express ideas and engage in constructive discussion with  other Board members and management, to actively participate in the Boards decision-making process and make difficult decisions in the best interest of the Company; 
    willingness and ability to devote sufficient time, energy and attention to the affairs of  the Company and the Board; and 
    lack of actual and potential conflicts of interest. 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee also considers, on an ongoing basis, the background, experience and skills of the incumbent directors that are important to our current and future business needs, including, among others, the combined mix of experience in the following areas: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Director Skills Criteria        
 Director Skills Criteria        
[END TABLE]
SELECTION OF CANDIDATES 
Director Skill Set Considerations; Use of Matrix 
In recruiting and selecting Board candidates, the Governance Committee takes into account the size of the Board and considers a skills matrix. This skills matrix helps the committee determine whether a particular Board member or candidate possesses one or more of the skill sets, as well as whether those skills and/or other attributes qualify him or her for service on a particular committee. The Governance Committee also considers a wide range of additional factors, including each director's and candidate's projected retirement date, to assist in Board succession planning; other positions the director or candidate holds, including other boards of directors on which he or she serves; and the independence of each director and candidate, to ensure that a substantial majority of the Board is independent. While the company does not have a formal policy on Board diversity, the Governance Committee considers the value of diversity on the Board in evaluating director nominees. Accordingly, the Governance Committee's evaluation of director nominees includes consideration of their ability to contribute to the diversity of personal and professional experiences, opinions, perspectives and backgrounds on the Board. 
BOARD REFRESHMENT 
On an ongoing basis, the Governance Committee considers potential director candidates identified on its own initiative as well as candidates referred or recommended to it by other directors, members of management, search firms, shareholders and others (including individuals seeking to join the Board). Shareholders who wish to recommend candidates may contact the Governance Committee in the manner described in "Shareholder 
Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and 2019 Proxy Statement | 5 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 BOARD OF  DIRECTORS (continued) 
[END TABLE]
 Communications to the Board." Shareholder nominations must be made according to the procedures required under our Bylaws and described in this Proxy Statement under the heading "Requirements for Submission of Shareholder Proposals for Next Year's Annual Meeting." Shareholder-recommended candidates and shareholder nominees whose nominations comply with these procedures and who meet the criteria referred to above will be evaluated by the Governance Committee in the same manner as the Governance Committee's nominees. 
In each of the director nominee and continuing director biographies that follow, we highlight the specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Board to conclude that the director nominee or continuing director should serve on our Board at this time.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  RISK MANAGEMENT 
 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND  RISK MANAGEMENT 
[END TABLE]
We are committed to good corporate governance and integrity in our business dealings. Our governance practices are documented in our Second Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, or Articles, our Bylaws, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, or the Code of Conduct, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of the committees of the Board, or the Committees. Aspects of our governance documents are summarized below. You can find our charters for each Committee of the board and our Code of Conduct on our website www.recropharma.com under "News & Investors—Corporate Governance—Governance Documents." 
BOARD INDEPENDENCE 
Our Board has determined all of our directors, except for Ms. Henwood, are "independent" directors, as defined under the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market, or NASDAQ. In making such determination, the Board considered the relationships that each such non-employee director has with the Company and all other facts and circumstances that the Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our common stock by each non-employee director. Our independent directors generally meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled board meeting. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chairman of the Board. It is the Board's view that rather than having a rigid policy, the Board, with the advice and assistance of the Governance Committee, and upon consideration of all relevant factors and circumstances, will determine, as and when appropriate, whether the two offices should be separate. Currently, our leadership structure separates the offices of CEO and Chairman of the Board with Ms. Henwood serving as our CEO and Mr. Weisman serving as Chairman of the Board. Our Board believes that the separation of the positions of CEO and Chairman of the Board reinforces the independence of the Board from management, creates an environment that encourages objective oversight of management's performance and enhances the effectiveness of our Board as a whole. 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
Our Board has established various Committees to assist in discharging its duties: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Governance Committee. Each member of our Committees is an independent director as that term is defined by the SEC and NASDAQ. The primary responsibilities of each of the Committees and the Committee memberships are provided below under the section entitled "Board Attendance, Committee Meetings and Committee Membership." 
Each of the Committees has the authority, as its members deem appropriate, to engage legal counsel or other experts or consultants in order to assist the Committee in carrying out its responsibilities. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
The Board's role in risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with management having day-to-day responsibility for assessing and managing our risk exposure and the Board actively overseeing management of our risks—both at the Board and Committee level. The risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from Committees and our executive officers to enable our Board to understand our risk identification, risk management and risk mitigation strategies with respect to areas of potential material risk, including operations (including cyber-security), finance, legal, regulatory, strategic and reputational risk.

The Board focuses on the overall risks affecting us. Each Committee has been delegated the responsibility for the oversight of specific risks that fall within its areas of responsibility. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee oversees management of financial reporting, compliance and litigation risks, including risks  related to our insurance, information technology, cybersecurity, human resources and regulatory matters, as well as the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive  compensation policies, plans and arrangements and the extent to which those policies or practices increase or decrease risk for the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Governance Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board, potential conflicts of  interest and the effectiveness of the Board.  
[END TABLE]
While each Committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through Committee reports about such risks. Matters of significant strategic risk are considered by our entire Board.

 The Governance Committee initiates and oversees the Board evaluation process, which is conducted in the early part of the calendar year.

AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
The Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, setting compensation for, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee's charter establishes a policy that all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm will be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
All such audit and permissible non-audit services were pre-approved in accordance with this policy during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee considers whether the provision of each non-audit service is compatible with maintaining the independence of our independent registered public accounting firm. The responsibility to pre-approve audit and non-audit services may be delegated by the Audit Committee to one or more members of the Audit Committee; provided that any decisions made by such member or members must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE  REPORT 
[END TABLE]
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its general oversight of the Company's financial reporting process. 
Management is primarily responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws and regulations. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, KPMG LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those consolidated financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles. 
The Audit Committee and the chairman of the Audit Committee have met with management during fiscal year 2018 to consider the adequacy of the Company's internal controls, and discussed these matters and the overall scope and plans for the audit of the Company with KPMG LLP. The Audit Committee also discussed with management and KPMG LLP the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls and the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management. The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communication with Audit Committees." In addition, KPMG LLP has provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG LLP's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP its independence. 
The Audit Committee also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from the Company and its management. Based on the considerations and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
 Compensation Committee, in consultation with Pay Governance and upon review of the recommendations of our CEO for our other named executive officers. Each officer is assigned a target bonus expressed as a percentage of his or her base salary. Actual bonus payments may be higher or lower than the target bonus amount, as determined by our Board or Compensation Committee, based on the achievement of corporate and individual objectives. The target bonus amounts in 2017 Ms. Henwood, Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake were 60%, 40% and 35%, respectively. The target bonus amounts in 2018 Ms. Henwood, Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake were 60%, 40% and 40%, respectively. 
In determining the amount of performance bonus awards, our Compensation Committee determines the level of achievement of the corporate goals and individual goals for each year. In determining the level of achievement for our other named executive officers, our Compensation Committee reviews and considers the recommendations of our CEO. These achievement levels are used to determine each named executive officer's bonus. 
Actual bonus amounts paid are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table above. To the extent that our Board or Compensation Committee determined that our named executive officers exceeded their respective corporate and individual performance goals, such amounts awarded in excess of the target bonus amounts are reflected in the "Bonus" column of the Summary Compensation Table above. 
Equity Compensation 
We award equity compensation to our named executive officers based on their performance in the form of time- vesting stock options and time- and performance-vested restricted stock units. We determine our equity award guidelines based on information and recommendations provided by our compensation consultant. With respect to our named executive officers other than our CEO, we also utilize recommendations provided by our CEO. In determining the amount of awards, we generally do not consider an employee's current equity ownership in our common stock or the prior awards that are fully vested. Rather, we evaluate each employee's awards based on the recommendations received from our compensation consultants and CEO and reference to other competitive market factors in our industry. 
Our stock option awards typically vest over a four-year period subject to the continued service of the employee with us. Shares subject to the options typically vest in 48 equal monthly installments, beginning one month from the date of grant. Our time-based restricted stock unit awards typically vest in equal annual installments over a four-year period subject to the continued service of the employee with us. Our performance-based restricted stock unit awards include vesting criteria relating to the achievement of certain development, commercialization and financial goals. We believe these vesting arrangements encourage our named executive officers to continue service with us for a longer period of time and remain focused on our multi-year long-term drug development and commercialization programs.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS 
We have entered into employment agreements with each of our named executive officers. 
The employment agreements provide for annual base salaries for each of our named executive officers, subject to adjustment from time to time, in the discretion of our Board and Compensation Committee. In January 2018, the Board approved the following base salaries for our named executive officers: $600,000 for Ms. Henwood, $416,300 for Mr. Celano, and $310,000 for Mr. Lake. In addition to base salaries, the employment agreements provide that each of our named executive officers is eligible to participate in our company's incentive bonus program. Our Board and our Compensation Committee consider a cash bonus opportunity each year for our named executive officers and potential target cash bonuses to Ms. Henwood, Mr. Celano, and Mr. Lake. Messrs. Celano and Lake each have a prescribed target bonus under their employment agreements of 40% and 35% of base salary, respectively. For 2018, the Board and our Compensation Committee established target bonuses of 60%, 40%, and 40% of base salary, respectively, for Ms. Henwood, Mr. Celano, and Mr. Lake, with actual payment dependent upon performance factors. 
Each of the employment agreements is for an initial term of one year and automatically renews for one-year periods, unless terminated by either party by delivery of 30 days written notice to the other party. Pursuant to each of the employment agreements, if we terminate one of our named executive officer's employment without cause (as defined below) or such named executive officer resigns for certain reasons described below within 12 months of a change of control (as defined below), such named executive officer will be entitled to receive: 
(i) such executive officer's base salary and health insurance benefits, at our expense, for a period of 12 months following the date of termination; 
(ii) with respect to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, any accrued but unused vacation and paid time off, any earned but unpaid bonus, reimbursement of any proper business expenses as of the date of termination and with respect to Ms. Henwood reimbursement of any proper business expenses as of the date of termination (referred to as the Accrued Benefits); 
(iii) with respect to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, a pro-rata annual bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which the effective date of termination occurs, with such annual bonus (if any) paid at the same time it would have otherwise been paid absent the executive officer's termination of employment; and 
(iv) with respect to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, outplacement services for a period of 12 months following the date of termination, which shall not exceed $25,000. 
If a named executive officer's employment is terminated as a result of such named executive officer's disability or death, such named executive officer or such named executive officer's estate will be entitled to receive: 
(i) such executive officer's base salary and health insurance benefits, at our expense, for a period of 6 months following the date of termination, with respect to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, and for a period of 12 months following the date of termination, with respect to Ms. Henwood;

[END TABLE]
(ii) the Accrued Benefits; and 
(iii) with respect to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, a pro-rata target bonus in respect of the fiscal year in which the effective date of termination occurs, with such annual bonus (if any) paid within 30 days of termination. 
If the severance and other benefits provided in a named executive officer's employment agreement or otherwise payable to a named executive officer would be subject to excise tax under Section 280(G) of the Code, then the named executive officer's severance benefits will be either delivered in full or delivered as to such lesser extent that would result in no portion of the severance benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever results in the receipt by the named executive officer on an after-tax basis of the greatest portion of such total severance and other benefits. 
For purposes of the employment agreements, "cause" generally means an named executive officer's (1) commission of an act of fraud or dishonesty against us; (2) failure to substantially perform his or her duties or material violation of the employment agreement, which failure or violation continues for 30 days or more following written notice to such named executive officer; (3) loss of any permit, license, accreditation or other authorization necessary for such named executive officer to perform his or her duties; (4) conviction of a felony or a plea of "no contest" to a felony; or (5) conduct that is likely, in the judgment of our Board, to materially adversely affect our reputation; with regard to each of Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, his employment agreement requires his conduct under item (2) above to be willful, and for his conduct to continue for five days or more following written notice by us of the conduct under item (5) above. 
For purposes of the employment agreements, a "change of control" shall be deemed to have occurred upon the happening of any of the following events: (1) the consummation by us of a plan of dissolution or liquidation; (2) the consummation of the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; (3) the consummation by us of a merger, consolidation or other shareholder-approved fundamental business transaction in which we are a participant with another entity where our shareholders, immediately prior to the referenced transaction, will not beneficially own, immediately after the referenced transaction, shares or other equity interests entitling such shareholders to more than 50% of all votes to which all equity holders of the surviving entity would be entitled in the election of directors; (4) the date any entity, person or group, (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or Section 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act), (other than (A) we or any of its subsidiaries or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by us or any of its subsidiaries or (B) any person who, on the date the Plan is effective, is the beneficial owner of our outstanding securities), shall have become the beneficial owner of, or shall have obtained voting control over, more than fifty percent (50%) of our outstanding shares of the common stock; or (5) the first day after the date hereof when directors are elected such that a majority of the Board shall have been members of the Board for less than twenty-four (24) months, unless the nomination for election of each new director who was not a director at the beginning of such twenty-four (24) month period was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of such period. A named executive officer will receive the payments and benefits described above if they terminate within 12 months of a change of control and during such twelve-month period we and/or our successor: (1) materially and adversely change such named executive officer's status, responsibilities or perquisites, subject to a 30 day cure period; (2) with regard to Mr. Celano and Mr. Lake, reduce such named executive officer's base salary except as part of an across the board decrease in which such executive officer's reduction is not more than any other executive officer; or (3) require such officer to be principally based at any office or location more than 50 miles from such named executive officer's principal office prior to the change of control.

The following table sets forth certain information regarding the beneficial ownership of common stock as of March 15, 2019 by (a) each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of common stock, (b) each named executive officer identified in the Summary Compensation Table above, (c) each director and nominee for director, and (d) all executive officers and directors as a group. 
The percentage of common stock outstanding is based on 21,990,735 shares of our common stock outstanding as of March 15, 2019. For purposes of the table below, and in accordance with the rules of the SEC, we deem shares of common stock subject to options that are currently exercisable or exercisable within sixty days of March 15, 2019 to be outstanding and to be beneficially owned by the person holding the options for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but we do not treat them as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Except as otherwise noted, each of the persons or entities in this table has sole voting and investing power with respect to all of the shares of common stock beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws, where applicable.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than ten percent shareholders are also required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on a review of the Company's records and written representations by the persons required to file such reports, all filing requirements of Section 16(a) were satisfied with respect to the 2018 fiscal year.

 ITEMS TO BE VOTED  ON 
[END TABLE]
ITEM 1: ELECTION OF CLASS II DIRECTORS FOR A THREE-YEAR TERM EXPIRING IN 2022 
At the Annual Meeting, our shareholders will vote on the election of three Class II director nominees named in this Proxy Statement as directors, each to serve until our 2022 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. Our Board has unanimously nominated Gerri Henwood, Karen Flynn and Bryan M. Reasons for election to our Board at the Annual Meeting. 
Each of the nominees has agreed to be named and to serve, and we expect each nominee to be able to serve if elected. If any nominee is unable to serve, the Governance Committee will recommend to our Board a replacement nominee. The Board may then designate the other nominee to stand for election. If you voted for the unavailable nominee, your vote will be cast for his or her replacement. 
ITEM 2: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF KPMG LLP AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed and engaged KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for the 2019 fiscal year, and to perform audit-related services. KPMG LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 2009. 
Shareholders are hereby asked to ratify the Audit Committee's appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. 
The Audit Committee is solely responsible for selecting our independent auditors. Although shareholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by law or our organizational documents, the Board has determined that it is desirable to seek shareholders ratification as a matter of good corporate governance in view of the critical role played by independent registered public accounting firms in maintaining the integrity of financial controls and reporting. If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection and whether to engage an alternative independent registered public accounting firm. 
Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to attend the Annual Meeting where they will be available to respond to appropriate questions and, if they desire, to make a statement.

The Annual Meeting is called for the purposes set forth in the Notice. Our Board does not know of any other matters to be considered by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting other than the matters described in the Notice.

REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBMISSION OF SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR NEXT YEAR'S ANNUAL MEETING 
In order to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, shareholder proposals must be received by us no later than November 22, 2019. If we change the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders by more than 30 days from the anniversary of this year's Annual Meeting, shareholder proposals must be received a reasonable time before we begin to make available the proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting in order to be considered for inclusion in our Proxy Statement. Proposals must be sent via registered, certified, or express mail (or other means that allows the shareholder to determine when the proposal was received by the Corporate Secretary) to the Corporate Secretary, Recro Pharma, Inc., 490 Lapp Road, Malvern, PA 19355. Proposals must contain the information required under our Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request to our Corporate Secretary, and also must comply with the SEC's regulations regarding the inclusion of shareholder proposals in Company-sponsored proxy materials. 
Alternatively, shareholders intending to present a proposal or nominate a director for election at next year's Annual Meeting of Shareholders without having the proposal or nomination included in our Proxy Statement must comply with the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. Our Bylaws require, among other things, that our Corporate Secretary receive the proposal or nomination no earlier than the close of business on the 150th day, and no later than the close of business on the 120th day, prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's Annual Meeting. Accordingly, for our 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our Corporate Secretary must receive the proposal or nomination no earlier than December 11, 2019 and no later than the close of business on January 10, 2020. The proposal or nomination must contain the information required by the Bylaws, a copy of which is available upon request to our Corporate Secretary. If the shareholder does not meet the applicable deadlines or comply with the requirements of SEC Rule 14a-4, we may exercise discretionary voting authority under proxies we solicit to vote, in accordance with our best judgment, on any such proposal.

Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board by writing to the Corporate Secretary, Recro Pharma, Inc., 490 Lapp Road, Malvern, PA 19355.

Communications received from shareholders are forwarded directly to Board members as part of the materials mailed in advance of the next scheduled Board meeting following receipt of the communications. The Board has authorized the Corporate Secretary, in his discretion, to forward communications on a more expedited basis if circumstances warrant or to exclude a communication if it is illegal, unduly hostile or threatening, or similarly inappropriate. Advertisements, solicitations for periodical or other subscriptions, and other similar communications generally will not be forwarded to the directors.
