 Type of Compensation   Earnings Opportunity   Relevant  Performance  Metric   2018 Outcomes  
 Cash   Annual Cash Incentive ("ICP")   Executive Incentive Pool funding is subject to attainment of 85% of Net Income goal at which the incentive pool will be funded at 50%. Maximum funding is 150% based on attainment of 115% of Net Income goal.   2018 Net Income compared to 2018 Budgeted Net Income   The Company achieved 102% of the Net Income goal (adjusted to exclude a non-recurring income tax benefit), which resulted in the pool being funded at 105% of target. In addition, the Company was able to add an additional 2.5% of funding due to exceeding a Customer Experience goal. The result was the overall incentive pool being funded at 107.5% of target. Individual payouts vary based on attainment of corporate, business plan, and personal goals.  
 Equity (subject to multi-year vesting)    2/3rds Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs")   0% to 150% of Performance Award earned at end of 3-year period   Actual compared to budget 3-Year Average ROA (2018, 2019, 2020)    Not yet earned

 Focus on the Long Term In 2018, the long term incentive plan design performance measure was 3-year average ROA. For our 2018 grant, 2/3 cliff vests based upon the attainment of our 3-year (2018, 2019, 2020) average ROA target.   Focus on Shareholder Support 99.74% approval from shareholders in our most recent Say on Pay vote for 2018. (vote submitted annually)  During 2018, the Company repurchased 1,155,157 shares of common stock, or approximately 3.8% of its common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017.  
 Focus on Improving Efficiencies We continue to focus on improving processes, upgrading systems and reducing expenses as evidenced by the continued improvement in the efficiency ratio. Efficiency ratio improved to 63.59% from 64.19% in 2017.   Focus on Data Monetize data analytics for revenue generation, cost efficiencies and improved productivity, data integrity and management through data governance.  
 Focus on the Employees In 2018 as a result of the benefit of the Tax Cuts and Job Act, we increased our starting pay rate twice to $15.25/hour on January 1, 2018 and $16.00/hour effective December 1, 2018. These changes support our focus on creating an environment in which employees are engaged and empowered to do their best every day.    Focus on the Customer Customer Experience continues to be a top initiative with the implementation of a Customer Experience Transformation Program to achieve process improvements, increase quality customer face time capacity, and create a customer-centric mind set.   
 Focus on Risk Take actions to manage and mitigate the Bank's top risks with a focus on compliance and information security.

 Executive Compensation Governance and Practices  
 Oversight and Governance          
• Independent Oversight of Executive Compensation. The Committee (comprised of independent directors) oversees and makes recommendations to the Board of Directors on compensation matters as it relates to all NEO's. The Committee also evaluates and recommends to the Board, appropriate policies and decisions relative to executive officer compensation and benefits, including oversight design and administration of executive compensation programs and the Company's compensation policies, practices, and incentive plans for non-executives. It also oversees preparation of executive compensation disclosures for inclusion in our Proxy Statement.  
• Independent Board Members. Subject to the recommendation of the Committee, all of the independent directors of the Board review and approve the compensation for the Chairman & CEO and the President.  
• Independent Compensation Consultant. The Committee has retained McLagan, an Aon company, an independent executive compensation consulting firm for the financial services industry, to provide advice and recommendations on Board and executive compensation matters under the oversight and responsibilities as defined by the Compensation Committee Charter. The Committee in its sole discretion selects the consultant, approves their fees and defines their scope of responsibilities.   
• Independent Legal Advisor. The Committee retains an independent legal advisor, Manatt Phelps & Phillips, LLP, to advise on executive compensation compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.  
• Active Committee engagement. In 2018, the Committee held five (5) meetings to discuss compensation matters.  
 Alignment with Shareholder Interests          
• Stock Ownership Guidelines. Our NEOs and Board members are subject to robust equity ownership guidelines.  
 Compensation Management & Risk Mitigation          
• Compensation Risk Management. Committee oversight includes evaluating and monitoring the Company's compensation programs, policies, and practices, which could have a material adverse effect on the risk profile of the overall Company. The Committee conducts at least semi-annual reviews with the Committee-appointed senior risk officer to confirm that all compensation plans, structures, and arrangements do not have a reasonable likelihood to encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking and do not pose a threat to the overall value of the Company. Reviews are conducted with the advice of the independent compensation consultant and independent legal advisor. The overall finding from these reviews is that the Company does not believe its plans, policies and practices individually or in their entirety encourage unnecessary or excessive risks that were reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company or threaten the overall value of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Compensation Governance and Practices  
• Incentive Plan Risk Management. Our Annual Cash Incentive Plan is subject to threshold performance at which the incentive pool is funded at 50% of target funding level. At maximum performance, the incentive pool is capped at 150% of target funding level.  
• Long Term Equity Grant Risk Management. Cliff vesting applies to the performance share portion of the 2018 Long Term Equity Grant, which comprises 2/3 of the total 2018 Long Term Equity Grant. The award is capped at 150% of target shares.  
• No Hedging. Pursuant to our Company Stock Trading Policy, executive officers and Board members are not permitted to engage in transactions that hedge their investments in Company equity.  
• Limitations on Pledging. Directors and executive officers of the Company may not pledge the Company's stock as collateral for a loan without the prior consent of the Company's Chairman and CEO or President.   
 Executive Compensation Features          
• Competitive Peer Analysis. Compensation decisions are made considering the compensation and performance data of our Compensation Peer Group. All components of executive compensation are reviewed at least annually in consultation with the Committee selected compensation consulting firm.  
• No Employment Agreements. None of the NEOs are covered under employment agreements that provide for any additional payments or benefits beyond what is generally available to all other employees if they terminate their employment for good reason, are terminated by the Company without cause, or voluntarily resign, assuming no change-in-control has occurred.   
• Executive Benefits. Our executives receive the same retirement, health and welfare and other benefits generally available to all employees. As noted in footnote (i) following the Summary Compensation Table, certain NEOs have received company-provided transportation services and relocation benefits.  
• No 280G Excise Tax Gross-ups. Our executives are not entitled to any Section 280G excise tax gross-up payments.  
• Executive Retirement Benefits. Our executives are eligible to participate in the same 401(k) Plan as all other employees and the same Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan available to a select group of management and highly compensated employees and are subject to the same eligibility requirements. Two NEOs earned a benefit under the Central Pacific Financial Corp. Defined Benefit Retirement Plan prior to the plan being frozen on December 31, 2002. Benefits under this plan were provided to all other employees eligible to participate in the plan prior to it being frozen.  
         One NEO is eligible to receive a fully vested nonqualified retirement benefit under a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) Agreement effective July 1, 2005.

 Annual Cash Incentives Provides variable compensation based on achievement of Company, Business Plan and Personal objectives.   At Risk   Annual   Cash / Equity   Funding of the 2018 Annual Incentive Compensation Plan ("ICP") Pool  
• No change in funding methodology from 2017 to 2018.  
• Funding of the pool is determined and approved by the Committee and is subject to Net Income performance against our annual target (budget).  
• Based on the Company's Net Income performance against target, it was calculated that the pool should be funded at 105% of target funding.   
• An additional multiplier was available in the plan if the average customer experience goal was exceeded. This resulted in an additional two and one-half percent (2.5%) funding of the incentive pool.   
• For 2018, 50% of the award is payable in cash, 50% in equity with a three year time vest. The percentage of the award payable in cash increases as performance exceeds target. The entire incentive award is payable in cash if 107% of target Net Income is achieved.  
                 Individual ICP Awards.  
• Individual awards are determined based on pool funding and overall corporate, business plan and personal performance.  
• Individual awards may range from 0% to 150% of target.  
• Plan allows for up to a plus or minus 15% adjustment to award.  
• For 2018, incentive plan payments for NEOs ranged between 21% to 71% of annual base salary.
