BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
2018 was another year of notable activity and continued growth for the Company. In January 2017, Park emerged as an independent, publicly traded company following its spin-off (referred to in this Proxy Statement as the "Spin-off") from Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. ("Hilton").  Immediately following the Spin-off, Park launched several strategic initiatives, including an aggressive asset management effort to improve margins across our portfolio and a capital recycling initiative to dispose of non-core assets. In accordance with this strategy, we successfully sold 13 non-core assets for approximately $520 million in 2018, greatly enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio while lowering our exposure to international markets.  Meanwhile, our focus on the operational excellence of our portfolio contributed to an increase in the Company's comparable revenue per available room (or RevPAR) of 2.9% in 2018 as compared to 2017.  Finally, we delivered on our stated goal of providing superior stockholder value by returning nearly $900 million of capital to stockholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and the HNA stock buyback, taking our total return of capital figure to approximately $1.9 billion since the Spin-off.  2018 BY THE NUMBERS

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation ("certificate of incorporation"), amended and restated by-laws ("by-laws") and corporate governance policies were modeled after those in place at Hilton at the time of the Spin-off.  Prior to January 2019, the Company was subject to an agreement with Hilton entered into prior to the Spin-off that restricted our ability to amend our certificate of incorporation and by-laws until January 2019, the second anniversary of the Spin-off. During this period, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee took the opportunity to carefully consider potential corporate governance enhancements that would demonstrate Park's commitment to the values of effective corporate governance.
Now that we are no longer constrained from amending our certificate of incorporation and by-laws by the terms of our pre Spin-off agreement with Hilton, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board have taken affirmative steps to modify aspects of our corporate governance structure with the intention of promoting the long-term interests of our stockholders. In particular, in February 2019, we amended our by-laws to provide for a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections and to add proxy access rights. Additionally, we are asking stockholders to vote at this annual meeting for proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation as set forth in Proposal 2 of this Proxy Statement that are intended to enhance Park's corporate governance. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
During 2018, management engaged in discussions with stockholders who held approximately 50% of our total outstanding shares of common stock.  During these discussions, stockholders were given the opportunity to share feedback on the Company's operations, its financial performance, governance practices and policies and compensation framework and programs.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS
We are committed to maintaining the following policies and practices which we believe demonstrate our commitment to executive compensation best practices.

 ✓      Use total stockholder return as the sole performance metric for our performance share units that are tied to multi-year performance     ×       No tax gross-ups upon a change in control 
 ✓      Maintain meaningful executive and independent director stock ownership policy• 6x for CEO• 3x for other executive officers• 5x annual cash retainer for directors     ×       No employment agreements with executives (other than our Chief Executive Officer, whose employment agreement was required in order to bring him to our Company from another chief executive officer position)

 ✓      Engage an independent compensation consultant     ×       No pledging or hedging activities permitted by our executives and directors 
 ✓      Conduct an annual peer group review to ensure total compensation is properly benchmarked     ×       No plan design features that encourage excessive or imprudent risk taking

COMMITMENT TO CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
We believe in our responsibility to be a good corporate citizen by striving to achieve a positive impact on the communities that we touch. To help us measure our progress towards a positive impact, we recently published our first Annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which describes Park's initiatives and goals to advance environmental and social progress.  In addition, in order to clarify how we would like to respond to complex environmental and social challenges, we adopted an environmental policy, a human rights policy and a vendor code of conduct in January 2019. 
For more information on our Corporate Responsibility initiatives, see our 2018 Annual Corporate Responsibility Report, which is available under the "Company—Responsibility" tab at http://www.pkhotelsandresorts.com.

 PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
INTRODUCTION
The Board currently consists of eight directors, each nominated for election at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders to serve until the Company's 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. Each nominee for director was recommended by our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, which considered a number of factors, including the criteria for Board membership approved by our Board, and then was nominated by our Board.
Each of our current directors has been previously elected by our stockholders. Seven of our directors joined the Board in December 2016 or January 2017 in connection with the Company's Spin-off. Our remaining director, Geoffrey M. Garrett, was originally elected as an independent director in June 2017 pursuant to the stockholder agreement (the "HNA Stockholder Agreement") between the Company and HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. ("HNA"). The HNA Stockholder Agreement terminated on March 9, 2018 following HNA's sale of all of its shares of the Company's common stock.
Each of our nominees has agreed to be named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. The Board anticipates that the nominees will serve, if elected, as directors. However, if any person nominated by the Board ceases to be a candidate for election by the time of the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, the proxies will be voted for the election of such other person as the Board may recommend.
VOTE REQUIRED
Under our by-laws, in an uncontested election, directors must be elected by a majority of all the votes cast. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that nominee. There is no cumulative voting. Abstentions and broker non-votes (if any) are not counted as votes cast.
In addition, under our by-laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, if a director nominee who is already serving as a director does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the director must tender his or her resignation to our Board and our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is required to consider all relevant factors and make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the recommendation or take other action. The Board is required to take action with respect to this recommendation within 90 days following certification of the election results.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
INTRODUCTION
Our Board believes that good corporate governance promotes the long-term interests of our stockholders and strengthens Board and management accountability. The Board is responsible for providing advice and oversight of the strategic and operational direction of the Company and overseeing its executive management to support the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders.
We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. Notable features of our corporate governance include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our Board is not classified and each of our directors is subject to re-election annually, and we do not intend to classify the Board in the future without the approval of our stockholders 
• under our by-laws and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors who fail to receive a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections will be required to submit their resignation to the Board 
• our non-management directors meet regularly in executive sessions, and 
• we do not have a stockholder rights plan, and if the Board were ever to adopt a stockholder rights plan in the future without prior stockholder approval, the Board would either submit the plan to stockholders for ratification or cause the rights plan to expire within one year. 
[END TABLE]
RECENT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE ENHANCEMENTS
As we move away from the Spin-off, corporate governance will continue to be a focus of the Company.  The Company's certificate of incorporation, by-laws and corporate governance policies were modeled after those in place at Hilton prior to the Spin-off.  Until January 2019, the Company was subject to an agreement with Hilton entered into at the time of the Spin-off that restricted our ability to amend our certificate of incorporation and by-laws.  Promptly following the expiration of that restriction, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board began taking affirmative steps to modify aspects of our corporate governance structure with the intention of promoting the long-term interests of our stockholders.
Accordingly, in February 2019, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended and the Board approved and adopted the following amendments to our by-laws: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Majority Voting/Director Resignation Policy. Our by-laws were amended to provide that in uncontested director elections each director nominee shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election. This majority voting standard compliments the preexisting policy in our Corporate Governance Guidelines that requires any director nominee in an uncontested election who fails to receive a majority of the votes cast to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board for the Board's consideration. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proxy Access. Our by-laws were amended to provide proxy access, allowing a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, who continuously owned an aggregate of at least 3% of our outstanding shares of common stock for at least three years to nominate and include in our annual meeting proxy materials director nominees constituting up to the greater two nominees or 20% of the number of directors then in office, provided that the stockholders and nominees otherwise satisfy the requirements in our by-laws.   
[END TABLE]
 In addition to these enhancements, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has recommended and the Board has proposed for consideration and voting by the stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting further corporate governance enhancements. For information regarding these further proposed corporate governance enhancements, see the section entitled "Proposal 2: Approval and Adoption of Amendments to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation" below.
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT
We believe that strong corporate governance practices should include regular outreach and conversations with our stockholders.  During 2018, we conducted stockholder and investor outreach by presenting investor road shows, conducting analyst meetings and attending investor conferences and meetings. We regularly discuss our operations, financial performance, industry, governance and compensation matters with stockholders. During 2018, we engaged with stockholders who held approximately 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock to obtain meaningful feedback on their perception and understanding of our business, markets and industry as well as our governance practices and compensation framework.  
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE
Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr. serves as the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer. Gordon M. Bethune serves as our Lead Independent Director. The Board believes at this time that the use of the Lead Independent Director, together with a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer position, is an effective leadership structure. The Company's Policy Regarding Board Leadership Structure is set forth below:
Our Board's leadership structure consists of a Chairman of the Board (who is also our CEO), a Lead Independent Director and Committee Chairs. The Board believes that the Company is best served by having the same individual serve as both Chairman and CEO in order to facilitate strategic discussion at Board meetings based on the extensive familiarity of the Chairman and CEO with our business. The Board also believes that a strong Lead Independent Director function is an important part of our corporate governance. Accordingly, the Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines which establish the responsibilities and authorities of the Lead Independent Director as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding at all meetings of the Board at which the Chair is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors 
• serving as a liaison between the Chair and the independent directors 
• approving information sent to the Board 
• approving meeting agendas for the Board 
• approving meeting schedules to assure there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items 
• authorization to call meetings of the independent directors, and 
• ensuring that he/she be available, if requested by stockholders for consultation and direct communication. 
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the independent directors to elect a Lead Independent Director on an annual basis. As well, our Board expects to periodically review the continued appropriateness of this Board leadership structure. DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE AND INDEPENDENCE DETERMINATIONS
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and NYSE rules, a director is not independent unless the Board affirmatively determines that he or she does not have a direct or indirect material relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries. In addition, the director must meet the bright-line tests for independence set forth by the NYSE rules.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines define independence in accordance with the independence definition in the current NYSE corporate governance rules for listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to review the independence of all directors at least annually.
In the event a director has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the objective tests set forth in the NYSE independence definition, the Board will determine, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, whether that relationship is material.
Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Bedient, Mr. Bethune, Mr. Garrett, Ms. Kelly, Sen. Lieberman, Mr. Naughton and Mr. Sadove is independent under the guidelines for director independence set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and under all applicable NYSE guidelines, including with respect to committee membership.  
BOARD COMMITTEES

The Board maintains three standing committees comprised entirely of independent directors: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.

The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to compensation matters, including with respect to the compensation of the Company's executive officers. The Compensation Committee has responsibility for overseeing the goals, objectives, compensation and benefits of our executive officers; our overall compensation structure, policies and programs; making recommendations to the Board with respect to director compensation; and our compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The duties and responsibilities of our Compensation Committee are more fully described in our Compensation Committee Charter, which is available under the "Investors" tab of the Company's website at http://www.pkhotelsandresorts.com, under the heading "Corporate Governance—Governance Documents."
Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Charter, and subject to compliance with applicable laws of our state of jurisdiction, the Compensation Committee may not delegate its authority to approve executive compensation or grant equity awards to directors or executive officers of the Company, except to subcommittees comprised solely of Compensation Committee members. The Compensation Committee also has the authority under its charter to retain outside consultants or advisors, as it deems necessary or advisable. A more detailed discussion of the Compensation Committee's use of outside advisors with respect to 2018 compensation matters is provided under the caption "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Role of Compensation Consultant."
The Board has determined that each of the members of the Compensation Committee is independent as defined by our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE listing standards applicable to boards of directors generally and compensation committees in particular. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The purpose of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to advise the Board concerning appropriate composition of the Board and its committees.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has responsibility for, among other things, identifying and recommending to the Board candidates for election to our Board, reviewing the composition of the Board and its committees, developing and recommending to the Board corporate governance guidelines that are applicable to us and overseeing Board evaluations. The duties and responsibilities of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are more fully described in our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, which is available under the "Investors" tab of the Company's website at http://www.pkhotelsandresorts.com, under the heading "Corporate Governance—Governance Documents."
The Board has determined that each of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is independent as defined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE listing standards.
MEETINGS
The Board discharges its responsibilities through regularly scheduled meetings, special meetings, actions taken by unanimous written consent and other communications with management as appropriate. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines currently provide that all directors are expected to make every effort to attend any meeting of stockholders. Mr. Baltimore is invited to attend meetings of the Board committees, but he does not have a vote on any committee matter. The Board and the Board committees regularly meet in executive sessions, at which no management representative is present. During 2018, the Board held six meetings, the Audit Committee held four meetings, the Compensation Committee held five meetings and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held two meetings. During 2018, each of our director nominees attended at least 75% of the aggregate of: (i) the total number of meetings of the Board and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she serves.  All eight of our directors then serving attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders in person. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES
Our commitment to good corporate governance is reflected in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which describe the Board's views on a wide range of governance topics. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are reviewed from time to time by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and revised as it considers appropriate, upon recommendation to and approval by the Board. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines is available under the "Investors" tab of the Company's website at http://www.pkhotelsandresorts.com, under the heading "Corporate Governance—Governance Documents."
CODE OF CONDUCT
The Board has adopted a Code of Conduct, which is available under the "Investors" tab of the Company's website at http://www.pkhotelsandresorts.com, under the heading "Corporate Governance—Governance Documents."
The Code of Conduct applies to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer and Controller, and sets forth our policies and expectations on a number of topics, including conflicts of interest, compliance with laws, use of our assets and business conduct and fair dealing. This Code of Conduct also satisfies the requirements for a code of ethics, as defined by Item 406 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Any substantive amendment to, or waivers from, certain provisions of our Code of Conduct for the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Principal Accounting Officer, Controller or persons performing similar functions or any director will be posted on the Company's website, at the address and location specified above.
The Company also maintains a Whistleblower Policy that establishes procedures for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints received by us regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters or practices that may include or result in any such questionable accounting or auditing matters.
RISK MANAGEMENT OVERSIGHT
The Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, including, as part of regular Board and committee meetings, general oversight of executives' management of risks relevant to the Company. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines currently provide as follows with respect to risk oversight:
The Board exercises direct oversight of strategic risks to the Company. While the full Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, it is supported in this function by its Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities by periodically reviewing the Company's accounting, reporting and financial practices, including the integrity of its financial statements, the surveillance of administrative and financial controls, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Company's enterprise risk management program and receiving reports from the Company's officers. The Compensation Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating risks related to the Company's compensation structure and compensation programs, including the formulation, administration and regulatory compliance with respect to compensation matters, and succession planning. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board by overseeing and evaluating programs and risks associated with Board organization, membership and structure and corporate governance. BOARD CANDIDATE QUALIFICATION AND SELECTION PROCESS
When evaluating candidates for nomination to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the factors set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, as amended from time to time. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines currently provide as follows:
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for reviewing the qualifications of potential director candidates and recommending to the Board those candidates to be nominated for election to the Board, subject to any obligations and procedures governing the nomination of directors to the Board that may be set forth in any agreement or arrangement to which the Company is party. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may consider:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    a.  relevant experience, skills and knowledge as well as minimum individual qualifications, including strength of character, judgment, industry knowledge or experience and an ability to work collegially with the other members of the Board; and b.  all other factors it considers appropriate, which may include existing commitments to other businesses, potential conflicts of interest with other pursuits, legal considerations, corporate governance background, financial and accounting background, executive compensation background and the size, composition and combined expertise of the existing Board. 
[END TABLE]
The Board should monitor the mix of skills and experience of its directors in order to assure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee expects to identify potential candidates through referrals and recommendations, including by incumbent directors, management and stockholders, as well as through business and other organizational networks. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also retain and compensate third parties, including executive search firms, to identify or evaluate, or assist in identifying or evaluating, potential director nominees.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee expects to consider current Board members by balancing the value of the director's continuity of service and familiarity with the Company with that of obtaining a new perspective. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also expects to consider each individual's contributions, performance and level of participation, the current composition of the Board, and the Company's needs. If any existing director does not want to continue in service or if the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee decides not to re-nominate a director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will identify and evaluate new candidates based on the qualifications set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Prior to recommending a new candidate to the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will (i) request that one or more of its members (or other members of the Board) interview the candidate, (ii) conduct an appropriate review of the background of the candidate and (iii) discuss the candidate. Once the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects a slate of Board candidates, it will present and recommend the slate to the full Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate candidates for nomination for election to the Board recommended by stockholders on a substantially similar basis as it considers other nominees.
STOCKHOLDER NOMINATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BOARD NOMINATIONS
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will accept for consideration qualified candidates properly recommended by stockholders. Stockholders who wish to recommend qualified candidates must do so by notifying the Company in writing, by notice delivered to the attention of the Secretary of the Company at the address of the Company's executive offices as set forth in the Company's periodic reports, of a recommended director candidate. Submissions may be by mail, overnight courier or personal delivery. E-mail submissions will not be considered. In order to ensure meaningful consideration of candidates, notice must be received not less than 90 calendar days and not more than 120 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the prior year's annual meeting of stockholders. In the event that the annual meeting date is advanced by more than 20 calendar days or delayed by more than 70 calendar days from the anniversary date of the previous year's meeting, then notice must  be received no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the 10th calendar day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.
The notice must set forth as to each recommended candidate all information required under our by-laws and any other information relating to the recommended candidate that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the recommended candidate's written consent to being named in the Company's proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected. The Company may require any recommended candidate to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required to determine the eligibility of the nominee to serve as a director, as well as a consent to be interviewed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
Submissions received through this process will be forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for review. Only those nominees whose submissions comply with these procedures and who satisfy the qualifications determined by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for directors of the Company will be considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Acceptance of a recommendation for consideration does not imply the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will nominate or recommend for nomination the recommended candidate. Nominees for director who are recommended by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as any other nominee for director.  In addition, stockholders may nominate directors for election to the board by following the procedures in our by-laws, as described below under "Other Matters—Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting."
Stockholders who would like to nominate a candidate for director by providing advance notice of the nomination pursuant to our by-laws must comply with the requirements described in this Proxy Statement and the Company's by-laws.
PROXY ACCESS
In February 2019, our Board adopted amended and restated by-laws which include a proxy access provision to permit a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, meeting specified eligibility requirements, to nominate and include director candidates constituting up to the greater of two nominees or 20% of the number of directors then in office in the Company's proxy materials for any annual meeting of stockholders. In order to be eligible to utilize these proxy access provisions, a stockholder, or group of stockholders, must, among other requirements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have owned 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• represent that such shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business and not with the intent to change or influence control at the Company and that such stockholder or group does not presently have such intent; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide a notice requesting the inclusion of director candidates in the Company's proxy materials and provide other required information to the Company not less than 120 days nor more than 150 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the Company's proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting (with adjustments if the date for the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting).  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders who would like to nominate a candidate for director via proxy access must comply with the requirements described in this Proxy Statement and the Company's by-laws. DIVERSITY POLICY
In April 2017, the Board adopted a Policy Regarding Diversity as a Consideration for Board Nominations. Pursuant to this policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board consider diversity – in terms of age, experience, industry, gender and ethnicity – to be an important factor in the consideration of candidates for nomination to the Board. However, as no new candidates have been nominated for the Board since the adoption of this policy (other than Mr. Garrett, who was originally nominated by HNA pursuant to the HNA Stockholder Agreement), the Board has not yet had an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of this policy.
POLICY REGARDING STOCKHOLDER RIGHTS PLANS
The Board affirms as a matter of corporate policy that it will not authorize or adopt any stockholder rights plan or similar plan or agreement without the prior approval of the Company's stockholders, unless any such plan or agreement would be submitted to the Company's stockholders to be ratified or, in the absence of such stockholder approval or ratification, would expire within one year of its adoption.
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD
As described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, stockholders and other interested parties who wish to communicate with our Lead Independent Director, the chairperson of the Audit, Compensation or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees, or to the non-management or independent directors as a group, may do so by addressing such communications or concerns to the Secretary of the Company, c/o Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 1775 Tysons Blvd, 7th Floor, Tysons, Virginia 22102, who will forward all such communication to the appropriate party.

 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Introduction
Our director compensation program is designed to compensate independent, non-employee directors fairly for work required for a company of our size, complexity and scope and to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. The program reflects our desire to attract, retain and use the expertise of highly-qualified people serving on our Board. In considering and ultimately recommending the compensation for our non-employee directors, the Compensation Committee reviewed and considered peer data and analysis and recommendations from the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. 
Program Details
Our independent directors receive director compensation for the period from the annual meeting at which they are elected until the next annual meeting.  For the 2018-2019 period, our annual compensation program for independent directors was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• cash retainer of $80,000 ($115,000 in the case of the Lead Independent Director) 
• additional cash retainer for serving on committees or as committee chairperson as follows: 
    o  $7,500 for serving as a member (other than the chairperson) of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and/or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee o  $25,000 for the chairperson of the Audit Committee o  $20,000 for the chairperson of each of the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and 
• equity award of $140,000 in the form of restricted stock, which generally vests on the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders that follows the grant date. 
[END TABLE]
Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer does not receive any additional compensation for serving as a director. On April 27, 2018, each independent director received a grant of restricted stock in an amount equal to the annual equity award for the service period from April 28, 2018 until April 26, 2019, the date of our 2019 annual meeting.  Our directors, as holders of restricted stock, will receive dividends on such restricted stock at the same time that regular dividend payments are made on the Company's common stock. We do not expect any changes to the director compensation program for the 2019-2020 period. The next equity award grant to our independent directors is expected to be made on the date of our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and will represent the directors' annual grant for their services as a director until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
All cash retainers will be paid to each independent director in quarterly installments. Any independent director may elect to receive 100% of his or her cash Board fees in fully vested shares of the Company's common stock of an equivalent value, which have a grant date that is five business days before the regular quarterly payment date of such cash fees. Additionally, all of our directors will be reimbursed for reasonable travel and related expenses associated with attendance at our Board or committee meetings. Program Rationale
The Company is the second-largest lodging real estate investment trust ("REIT") in the United States and was spun-off as a separate public company from Hilton to own complex lodging real estate held by Hilton in many instances for decades.  In recommending director compensation, the Compensation Committee considered the complexity of issues overseen by the Board that are not commensurate with smaller, less complex lodging REITs.  In particular, the Compensation Committee considered the following when determining the appropriate level of director compensation – 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the complexity of matters that arise from the Company's recent origin from a "propco/opco" spin-off from Hilton, including commercial, governance and tax matters that require ongoing Board awareness and attention 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the sophistication of the Company's portfolio, including international, joint venture and ground-leased assets; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the potential for substantial transactions in the future (including complex merger or portfolio acquisitions) requiring substantial Board attention in order to effect meaningful growth in Park's asset base.  
[END TABLE]
As a result, the Company's director compensation was adjusted in April 2018 in recognition of the amount of time and attention required of Board members in order for them to fulfill their responsibilities to the Company. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP POLICY
To align the interests of directors with stockholders, the Board has adopted a requirement that each of our independent directors will be required to own stock in an amount equal to five times his or her annual cash retainer. For purposes of this requirement, a director's holdings include shares held directly or indirectly, individually or jointly, shares underlying unvested time-vesting restricted stock, and shares held under a deferral or similar plan. Independent directors are expected to meet this ownership requirement within five years of the later of (a) February 23, 2017 (i.e., the date on which the Company made its first broad-based equity incentive grants following the Spin-off) or (b) the date he or she first becomes subject to this stock ownership policy.
DIRECTOR TRAVEL
In order to encourage our independent directors to better understand our hotel assets and provide feedback on our portfolio, our independent directors are entitled to up to 30 complimentary room nights per calendar year (including associated room taxes and fees) at properties owned by the Company for their own use or use by family members accompanying them. Direct, incremental costs of the director's room stay charge (i.e., the cost of cleaning the room daily) are considered compensatory to the director and the Company does not provide tax gross-ups to the directors with respect to these benefits. DIRECTOR COMPENSATION FOR 2018
The table below sets forth information regarding non-employee director compensation for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Mr. Baltimore is compensated as an executive officer and did not receive any compensation from the Company for serving as a director during fiscal year 2018. Additionally, Xianyi Mu, who was appointed to the Board as a designee pursuant to the HNA Stockholder Agreement and who resigned from the Board effective March 5, 2018 upon the closing of HNA's public offering of its shares of the Company's common stock, did not receive any compensation from the Company for his service as a director during fiscal year 2018.

 PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL AND ADOPTION OF AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
[END TABLE]
INTRODUCTION
Our Board is committed to strong and effective corporate governance and has concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to adopt amendments to the Company's existing certificate of incorporation (the "Existing Charter") to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reduce the affirmative vote required for stockholders to amend the by-laws from 80% of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to a majority vote (referred to below as the "By-law Change Amendment"); 
• increase the ownership limit for our common stock and preferred stock from 4.9% to 9.8% (referred to below as the "Ownership Limit Amendment"); 
• reduce the threshold for our stockholders to demand a special meeting be called from a majority to 25% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (referred to below as the "Special Meeting Amendment"); 
• "opt out" of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), an anti-takeover protection that currently limits the Company's ability to engage in transactions with "interested stockholders" (referred to below as the "DGCL 203 Amendment"); and  
• remove certain provisions that are no longer applicable to the Company and make certain conforming and/or immaterial changes, in each case as more fully described below (referred to below as the "Other Charter Amendments").  
[END TABLE]
The overall goal of these amendments is to enhance the governance rights of stockholders, improve the Company's corporate governance and simplify the Existing Charter.
The proposed amendments to the Existing Charter are being submitted for approval through five separate proposals – Proposal 2A, Proposal 2B, Proposal 2C, Proposal 2D and Proposal 2E.  Under the  Existing Charter and applicable Delaware law, the proposed amendments included in Proposal 2A (which is the By-law Change Amendment) must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.  The proposed amendments included in Proposals 2B through 2E must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon.
The amendments to the Existing Charter are summarized in Proposals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E below.  A form of amended and restated certificate of incorporation incorporating all of the proposed amendments to the Existing Charter summarized in Proposals 2A through 2E (the "Amended and Restated Charter") is attached to this Proxy Statement as Exhibit A, with deletions indicated by strikethroughs and additions indicated by underlining (with such marks against the Existing Charter).  The summaries of the proposed amendments set forth in Proposals 2A, 2B, 2C, 2D and 2E below are qualified in their entirety by reference to the corresponding provisions in Exhibit A. 
Approval by stockholders of any of the above-referenced proposals will result in the filing of an amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware promptly after the 2019 annual meeting.  If stockholders approve some but not all of the above-referenced proposals, we will file an amended and restated certificate of incorporation containing only the amendments referenced in the proposals that were approved. PROPOSAL 2A – BY-LAW CHANGE AMENDMENT
INTRODUCTION
Proposal 2A constitutes the amendments to our Existing Charter reflected in Article V of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement (collectively, the "By-law Change Amendment").  Currently, Article V, Section 5.1 of the Existing Charter provides that our by-laws may be amended by our Board or by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least 80% of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has declared advisable and approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the By-Law Change Amendment, which will lower the stockholder vote required to amend our by-laws. Specifically, if stockholders approve Proposal 2A, the By-Law Change Amendment would provide that our by-laws may be amended by the Board or by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 
Our by-laws establish a number of fundamental corporate governance operating principles, including rules for meetings of directors and stockholders, the election of directors and the powers of officers, among other provisions.  After careful consideration, we believe that reducing the stockholder vote required to amend the by-laws through the By-law Change Amendment is in our best interest and in the best interests of our stockholders.
VOTE REQUIRED
Under Section 242(b)(4) of the DGCL and the Existing Charter, approval of Proposal 2A requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. Abstentions and other shares not voted (whether broker non-votes, if any, or otherwise) will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE BY-LAW CHANGE AMENDMENT. PROPOSAL 2B – OWNERSHIP LIMIT AMENDMENT
INTRODUCTION
Proposal 2B constitutes the amendments to our Existing Charter reflected in Article VII of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement (collectively, the "Ownership Limit Amendment").  The Existing Charter provides for limitations on the transfer and ownership of the Company's stock. Such restrictions are intended to assist the Company in maintaining and monitoring its qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. The requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), for qualification as a REIT include certain rules relating to the ownership of the REIT's stock. One such requirement is that, in general, no five or fewer "individuals," which term includes certain types of entities, may directly or constructively own more than 50% of the value of a REIT's stock.
The Existing Charter currently includes a common stock ownership limit and a preferred stock ownership limit, which, subject to certain exceptions, restricts any individual or corporation, or any other entities, and includes a "group" as such term is defined under the SEC's beneficial ownership rules, from "beneficially owning" or "constructively owning," as each term is defined in the Existing Charter, more than 4.9% of the Company's common stock and the Company's preferred stock.  
As a result of the separate sales by both The Blackstone Group L.P. ("Blackstone") and affiliates and HNA of all their shares of the Company's common stock, the Board believes the ownership limit can be increased to 9.8%, which would bring the Company's ownership limit in line with the majority of its peers, without risking compliance with the Code.  Accordingly, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board has declared advisable and approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the Ownership Limit Amendment to increase the common stock ownership limit and preferred stock ownership limit to 9.8%. 
The Ownership Limit Amendment also makes conforming changes to Article VII, Section 7.2.10 of the Existing Charter, which contains the text of the legend required to be included on each certificate for shares of the Company's capital stock, in order to reflect the increased ownership limit, as well as several additional immaterial changes to clarify existing language.  Lastly, the Ownership Limit Amendment makes technical changes to clarify the manner of determining beneficial ownership (as shown in Sections 7.2 and 7.3 of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A).
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal 2B requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon.  Abstentions and other shares not voted (whether broker non-votes, if any, or otherwise) will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE OWNERSHIP LIMIT AMENDMENT. PROPOSAL 2C - SPECIAL MEETING AMENDMENT
INTRODUCTION
Proposal 2C constitutes the amendments to our Existing Charter reflected in Article VIII of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement (collectively, the "Special Meeting Amendment").  Currently, Article VIII, Section 8.1 of the Existing Charter provides that a special meeting may be called by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or by holders of stock representing not less than a majority of the total voting power of the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. 
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has declared advisable and approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the Special Meeting Amendment which will reduce the threshold required for stockholders to demand a special meeting be called from a majority to 25% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. If stockholders approve this Proposal 2C, Article VIII of the Existing Charter would be revised in the manner set forth in Exhibit A to permit holders of stock representing not less than 25% of the total voting power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to demand that the Secretary of the Company call a special meeting of stockholders.  As reflected in Exhibit A, the Special Meeting Amendment would also require such stockholders to include the purpose or purposes of the special meeting in their request for the Secretary of the Company to call a special meeting.
The Board believes that lowering the ownership threshold will expand the stockholder special meeting right so that stockholders with a substantial economic interest in the Company can take advantage of the right to have significant concerns addressed by stockholders without waiting until the next annual meeting. The Board determined that the 25% threshold strikes an appropriate balance between enhancing stockholder rights while avoiding the enactment of a mechanism for individual stockholders to pursue special interests that are not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders in general.
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal 2C requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon.  Abstentions and other shares not voted (whether broker non-votes, if any, or otherwise) will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE SPECIAL MEETING AMENDMENT. PROPOSAL 2D – DGCL 203 AMENDMENT
INTRODUCTION
Proposal 2D constitutes the amendments to our Existing Charter reflected in Article X of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement (collectively, the "DGCL 203 Amendment").  Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section 203") generally prohibits certain public companies from entering into a business combination (including a merger, sale of assets or transfer of stock) with an "interested stockholder" for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, unless certain conditions apply. An "interested stockholder" is defined as a person or group of persons who beneficially acquire 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation. Section 203 does not apply if the corporation's board of directors preapproves the transaction by which a stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, or if, at or subsequent to the time the business combination with an interested stockholder is approved by the board of directors, it is authorized at a stockholder meeting by an affirmative two-thirds vote of the corporation's outstanding voting stock (excluding the stock held by the interested stockholder). Further, a stockholder who acquires 85% or more of the voting stock of a corporation (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and certain employee stock plans) in the first transaction in which it becomes an interested stockholder is not subject to the three-year waiting period for any subsequent business combination.
Under the terms of Article X, Section 10.1 of the Existing Charter, the Company had previously elected not to be governed by Section 203 while Blackstone and HNA beneficially owned at least 5% of the total voting power of the Company's common stock. However, this "opt out" automatically terminated and the Company became subject to Section 203 after Blackstone and HNA no longer beneficially owned at least 5% of the total voting power of the Company's common stock following sales of all of our common stock beneficially owned by Blackstone in 2017 and HNA in 2018.
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board has declared advisable and approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the DGCL 203 Amendment in order for the Company to "opt out" of Section 203.
A Delaware corporation may amend its certificate of incorporation to "opt out" of Section 203's anti-takeover protection. The Board believes the DGCL 203 Amendment is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders because it would eliminate a potential hurdle to a potential transaction with an interested stockholder in the future that may be in the best interests of stockholder. The proposed amendment to opt out of the provisions of Section 203 is not prompted by any specific contemplated stockholder action of which the Board is aware.  If this proposal is adopted, pursuant to Section 203(b)(3) of the DGCL, the Company's decision to opt out of Section 203 will become effective 12 months after the DGCL 203 Amendment is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and becomes effective. 
VOTE REQUIRED
Approval of Proposal 2D requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon.  Abstentions and other shares not voted (whether broker non-votes, if any, or otherwise) will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE DGCL 203 AMENDMENT. PROPOSAL 2E – OTHER CHARTER AMENDMENTS
INTRODUCTION
Proposal 2E constitutes the amendments to our Existing Charter reflected in the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A to this Proxy Statement (other than Articles V, VII, VIII and X) (collectively, the "Other Charter Amendments").  In addition to the amendments reflected in Proposals 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D, the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A reflects deletions of sections of the Existing Charter that are no longer applicable and makes certain other conforming and/or immaterial changes, collectively constituting the Other Charter Amendments. These include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deletion of Article XI of Existing Charter.  Article XI of the Existing Charter contains formerly applicable provisions related solely to Blackstone and HNA as stockholders of the Company.  Because neither Blackstone nor HNA is currently a stockholder of the Company, Article XI of the Existing Charter is no longer relevant to the Company or its stockholders and may be deleted in its entirety. Its removal will have no impact on the remaining stockholders of the Company.  As a result of the deletion of Article XI, Articles XII, XIII and XIV of the Existing Charter are renumbered as Articles XI, XII and XIII, respectively. 
• Removal of Reference to Current Number of Directors.  Section 6.1(A) of Article VI of the Existing Charter is being amended to remove an unnecessary reference to the number of directors that the Company currently has in order to simplify the charter and instead provide that the number of directors shall be fixed only by the Board and only in the manner set forth in the by-laws.  Since the Existing Charter already provides that the number of directors will be increased or decreased only by the Board in accordance with the provisions set forth in the by-laws, this amendment does not effect a substantive change to the Company's corporate governance. 
• Additional Other Conforming Changes and/or Immaterial Modifications.  Section 2.1 of the Existing Charter is being amended to integrate the current address of the Company's registered agent (as shown in Section 2.1 of the Amended and Restated Charter included in Exhibit A), which provision of the Existing Charter was automatically amended on June 19, 2017 pursuant to a Certificate of Change of Address of Registered Office of Registered Agent filed by the Registered Agent with the Delaware Secretary of State on May 30, 2017. In addition, Section 4.1, Section 6.1(C) and Section 12.1 of the Existing Charter are being amended to update defined terms and Section 4.3(B) of the Existing Charter is being amended to acknowledge that the Company will pay dividends and distributions necessary for the Company to continue to qualify as a REIT.   
[END TABLE]
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board has declared advisable and approved, and recommends that stockholders approve, the Other Charter Amendments. We believe that none of the changes included in the Other Charter Amendments would materially affect the rights or preferences of our stockholders.
VOTE REQUIRED 
Approval of Proposal 2E requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote thereon.  Abstentions and other shares not voted (whether broker non-votes, if any, or otherwise) will have the same effect as votes against the proposal.

THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE OTHER CHARTER AMENDMENTS. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 PROPOSAL 3: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
[END TABLE]
INTRODUCTION
We are asking stockholders to vote, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, and related SEC rules. This non-binding advisory vote is commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote.
The Company has in place a comprehensive executive compensation program. Please refer to the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement for a detailed discussion of the Company's executive compensation program, practices and philosophy. The Compensation Committee intends to continually monitor executive compensation programs and adopt changes to reflect the dynamic marketplace in which the Company competes for talent, as well as general economic developments affecting executive compensation.
You have the opportunity to vote "for," "against" or "abstain" from voting on the following resolution relating to executive compensation:
"RESOLVED, that the holders of common stock of Park Hotels & Resorts Inc. approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and related material disclosed in the Proxy Statement."
As provided by the Dodd-Frank Act, this vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and Compensation Committee value the views of our stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officer compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, we will consider our stockholders' concerns and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns.
VOTE REQUIRED
Under our by-laws, approval of the say-on-pay proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, are not counted as votes "FOR" or "AGAINST" and will have no effect on the result of this vote.  
Our current policy is to provide our stockholders with an opportunity to approve the compensation of our named executive officers each year at the annual meeting of stockholders.  Accordingly, we anticipate that the next such vote will occur at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

 COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
[END TABLE]
INTRODUCTION
2018 was another notable year for Park, as we completed our second year as an independent company – continuing our transformative journey while delivering strong results.  
After the completion of the Spin-off on January 3, 2017, the Compensation Committee (in this section, the "Committee") undertook a careful review of our business and competitive environment and began a comprehensive effort to develop a new executive compensation program for the Company. To assist with that effort, the Committee engaged FPL Associates L.P. ("FPL"), a compensation consultant with substantial experience working with REITs. In developing the Company's executive compensation program, the Committee established goals of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• creating programs that align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders to maximize stockholder value 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• properly motivating management to balance short-term objectives with long-term value creation to stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attracting and retaining the best executive talent by remaining competitive with programs that executives may be offered by other potential employers in the marketplace in which we compete for talent.  
[END TABLE]
Following the completion of this process, the Committee adopted and approved the Company's executive compensation program. After reviewing the function and results of the new executive compensation program for fiscal year 2017, the Committee determined that the program fit the needs of the Company and did not implement changes to its structure for fiscal year 2018. 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides an overview of the compensation for each of Park's named executive officers ("NEOs") under the executive compensation programs adopted by the Committee. For fiscal year 2018, our NEOs were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr.   Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer 
 Sean M. Dell'Orto  Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer 
 Thomas C. Morey  Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary 
 Matthew A. Sparks  Executive Vice President and Chief Investment Officer 
 Robert D. Tanenbaum  Executive Vice President, Asset Management 
[END TABLE]
 COMPANY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS
During 2018, we continued to effectively execute on the initiatives we launched in 2017, delivering solid results for the Company, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We successfully sold 13 non-core assets for approximately $520 million in 2018, greatly enhancing the overall quality of our portfolio while lowering our exposure to international markets.   
• Our focus on the operational excellence of our portfolio contributed to an increase in the Company's comparable revenue per available room (or RevPAR) of 2.9% in 2018 as compared to the 2017.   
• We delivered on our stated goal of providing superior stockholder value by returning nearly $900 million of capital to stockholders in the form of regular and special cash dividends and the HNA stock buyback, taking our total return of capital figure to approximately $1.9 billion since the Spin-off.  
[END TABLE]
Through these efforts, we were able to achieve superior total stockholder return, outperforming all but one of the other companies on the FTSE NAREIT Lodging Resorts Index that have a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion in 2018 (see Total Stockholder Return – 2018 chart below) and since the time of our Spin-off through 2018 (see Total Stockholder Return - Spin-off through 2018 chart below).
For more information on our 2018 results and other related financial measures, see our 2018 Annual Report.

[END TABLE]
 COMPENSATION PROCESS AND PHILOSOPHY
Our executive compensation programs are designed and administered under the direction and control of the Committee. The Committee is comprised solely of independent directors who review and approve our overall executive compensation programs and practices and set the compensation of our executive officers. In determining compensation for our executive officers, other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Committee considers, among other things, the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. The Committee is, however, solely responsible for making the final decisions on compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers.
The Company's executive compensation programs strive to achieve the following philosophy, principles and business objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders to maximize stockholder value 
• To attract and retain top talent 
• To reinforce our business objectives and the Company's values 
• To motivate management to balance short-term objectives with long-term value creation to the stockholders, and 
• To provide competitive compensation to management based on the marketplace in which the Company competes for talent. 
[END TABLE]
ROLE OF COMPENSATION CONSULTANT
In 2017, following the Spin-off, the Committee engaged the services of FPL as its independent compensation consultant. FPL provides the Committee with advice and resources to help it assess the effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation strategy and programs. A representative of FPL typically attends meetings of the Committee and communicates with the Committee Chair between meetings. FPL reports directly to the Committee, and the Committee has the sole power to terminate or replace FPL at any time. The Committee assessed the independence of FPL in 2018 in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC and the NYSE. After considering the foregoing, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to engage FPL as its independent compensation consultant.
During 2018, FPL did not work for management and did not receive any compensation from the Company other than for its work in advising the Committee. In January 2018, Ferguson Partners L.P., an affiliate of FPL, was retained by the Company, with the Committee's approval, to provide recruitment services relating to an executive search for a senior officer position for our Design and Construction department. The Company paid approximately $205,000 for such services.
USE OF PEER GROUP DATA
The Committee uses compensation data compiled from Park's peer groups of companies for benchmarking purposes.  The Committee reviews such data annually.  As well, the Committee updates, as necessary and upon recommendation of FPL, the companies in our peer groups. Traditionally, companies compare their compensation practices and performance against the performance of a single group of companies whose business model and industry are relatively similar to those of the company. However, in recognition of the size and complexity of the Company, the Committee, at FPL's recommendation, determined that it would be appropriate to utilize two peer groups — one for size and one for the lodging industry — in designing and administering the Company's compensation programs.  In January 2018, the Committee approved the 13-company size-based peer group and a 10-company lodging REIT-based peer group set forth below. The size-based peer group took into account comparability in size in terms of market/total capitalization and similar revenue streams (i.e., generally real estate businesses with short-term "lease/rental" durations). The lodging REIT-based peer group includes REITs with a strategic focus on hotel assets. The Committee expects to continue to annually review the composition of our peer groups and make changes when appropriate.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Size-Based Peer Group       Lodging REIT-Based Peer Group   
 Size-Based Peer Group       Lodging REIT-Based Peer Group   
 Apartment Investment and Management Company     JBG SMITH Properties     Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.     Pebblebrook Hotel Trust 
 Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.     LaSalle Hotel Properties     Chesapeake Lodging Trust     RLJ Lodging Trust 
 Camden Property Trust     RLJ Lodging Trust     DiamondRock Hospitality Company     Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc. 
 Extra Space Storage Inc.     Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.     Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.     Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. 
 Federal Realty Investment Trust     Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc.     LaSalle Hotel Properties     Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. 
             Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc.     Pebblebrook Hotel Trust 
 Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.     Wyndham Worldwide Corporation             
 Hyatt Hotels Corporation                   
[END TABLE]
The size-based peer group has been utilized in designing pay programs calculated to attract and retain key employees in recognition of the greater responsibilities involved in managing a company of our size and complexity. The lodging REIT-based peer group has been utilized to assess Company executive compensation practices against other lodging REITs. We believe the peer group companies represent the size and industry with which we currently compete for executive talent. The peer group companies also include many of our principal business peers.
FPL's benchmarking compared the compensation of our executive officers based on base salary and total target compensation (including base salary, target short-term annual incentive compensation and an annualized long-term incentive compensation) with that of executive officers of similar titles and job roles across the peer companies. The Committee considered and expects to continue to consider the amount and mix of base and variable compensation by referencing, for each executive officer position, the prevalence of each element and the level of compensation that is provided in the market based on FPL's comparison analysis.
In January 2019, the Committee reviewed the composition of our size-based peer group and our lodging REIT-based peer group. Based on the recommendation of FPL, the Committee determined to keep LaSalle Hotel Properties in the peer groups set by the Committee in January 2019, notwithstanding its acquisition by merger, since relevant data from its 2018 proxy statement was available.
ROLE OF EXECUTIVES
The Committee believes management input is important to the overall effectiveness of the Company's executive compensation programs. The Committee believes the advice of an independent compensation consultant should be combined with management input and the business judgment of the Committee members to arrive at a proper alignment of our compensation philosophy, principles and business objectives. The Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Vice President and General Counsel, the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and the Executive Vice President, Human Resources are the officers of the Company who interact most closely with the Committee. These individuals work with the Committee to provide their perspective on aligning executive compensation strategies with our business objectives. When determining compensation for our executive officers, other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee considered individual performance as summarized and assessed by the Chief Executive Officer. The performance of the Chief Executive Officer is assessed directly by the Committee in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer present.
SAY-ON-PAY
In 2018, we provided our stockholders with an advisory (non-binding) vote on our executive compensation program (a "say-on-pay" vote). At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, approximately 96% of the votes cast approved our advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, throughout 2018, we engaged in proactive outreach efforts with major institutional investors holding approximately 50% of our outstanding shares, providing our stockholders the opportunity to share feedback on the Company and its compensation framework and programs.
After considering our 2018 say-on-pay voting results and the advice from our compensation consultant, the Committee determined that it was appropriate to maintain the core design of our executive compensation program and, therefore, did not make any changes to the Company's executive compensation program in response to the 2018 say-on-pay voting results. The Committee expects to consider future annual say-on-pay votes and investor feedback when making decisions relating to our executive compensation program, policies and practices.  
COMPENSATION FRAMEWORK
The primary components of our executive compensation program, which commenced in fiscal year 2017, are base salary, short-term incentive compensation (cash) and long-term incentive compensation (equity). These components are described in more detail below. The following charts illustrate the mix between the compensation elements (base salary, short-term incentive in the form of cash and long-term incentive in the form of RSAs and PSUs) for our Chief Executive Officer and the average of our other NEOs, in each case based on target levels of compensation. Consistent with our compensation philosophy, approximately 83.3% of our CEO's compensation was performance based or at risk and approximately 74.6% of the average compensation of our other NEOs was performance-based or at risk.
Base Salary
Structure
The base salary payable to each executive officer provides a fixed component of compensation that reflects the executive's position and responsibilities. Base salary levels are intended to be comparable with the competitive market, as determined by the Committee in its judgment, but are not targeted to specific market levels. The Committee expects to review base salaries annually and may make adjustments to better match competitive market levels or to recognize an executive's professional growth and development or increased responsibilities.
2018 Actual Base Salaries
For fiscal year 2018, the Committee reviewed and approved the base salaries shown below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Base Salary(1) ($)

    (1)  The amounts shown reflect annualized base salary amounts. Actual base salary amounts received by the NEOs are reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table below. 
    (2)  In February 2018, Mr. Morey was promoted to Executive Vice President and his annual base salary starting in March 2018 was increased to $475,000. 
[END TABLE]
Short-Term Incentive
Structure
The Company's executive short-term incentive program (the "STIP") is designed to reward Company executives designated at the level of senior vice president and above who are members of the Company's executive committee or are subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act based on our Company's overall performance and the individual's contribution to that performance. Pursuant to the STIP, each fiscal year, the Committee will determine a target  bonus (the "Target Bonus") for each such participant. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Target Bonus for each participant (other than the Chief Executive Officer) will be up to 75% (for officers at the senior vice president level) or up to 100% (for officers at the executive vice president level) of his or her base salary, with the actual bonus range that may be earned by each participant being determined by the Committee each fiscal year. Pursuant to Mr. Baltimore's Executive Employment Agreement with the Company, dated April 26, 2016 (the "CEO Employment Agreement"), his Target Bonus will be 150% of his base salary, with the actual bonus range that may be earned by Mr. Baltimore ranging from 75% to 225% of his base salary. In January 2019, the Committee modified the STIP such that the Committee may determine a higher high end of the bonus range for Mr. Baltimore (i.e., above the 225% level required by the CEO Employment Agreement). The Committee determined that this modification was advisable in order to give Mr. Baltimore a bonus opportunity commensurate with executives at companies of similar size and complexity. 
Annual STIP bonuses will be earned based on the achievement of both individual and Company performance objectives each fiscal year, as follows: (i) 25% (for officers at the senior vice president level), 20% (for officers at the executive vice president level) or 10% (for the Chief Executive Officer) of the bonus will be earned based on the achievement of individual performance objectives; and (ii) the remainder of the bonus will be earned based on the achievement of corporate performance objectives determined by the Committee at the beginning of such fiscal year. Individual objectives will be approved and scored by the Committee for the Chief Executive Officer and by the immediate supervisor for each other participant (with the Chief Executive Officer having the authority to revise any individual objectives or the scoring of such objectives for participants for whom the Chief Executive Officer is not the immediate supervisor). Corporate objectives will be approved and scored by the Committee.
To receive an award, participants must be employed by the Company through December 31 of the relevant fiscal year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to December 31 of the relevant fiscal year (i) due to death or "disability" (as defined in the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan), the participant will receive a bonus for such fiscal year based on achievement of target performance but prorated for the actual days worked during such year, or (ii) due to "retirement" (as defined in the STIP), the participant will receive a bonus for such fiscal year based on actual achievement but prorated for the actual days worked during such year. In the event of a participant's termination of employment by the Company for "cause" (as defined in the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan) following the end of the relevant fiscal year but prior to the payment of STIP bonuses for such fiscal year, the participant will forfeit his or her right to receive an annual STIP bonus for such fiscal year.
2018 Company Performance Objectives
The Committee adopted 2018 corporate performance objectives pursuant to the STIP following a review of the Company's 2018 annual budget. The Committee also assigned each performance objective a relevant weighting.  The Committee selected the specific performance objectives because they complement various parts of the Company's overall strategy and business goals as explained further below –
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Comparable RevPAR Growth focuses on revenue growth on a "same-store" basis within our portfolio – one of the Company's core pillars of aggressive asset management 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin focuses on "same store" margin improvement – as expense reduction is another of our core pillars of aggressive asset management 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDA focuses on the Company's overall earnings profile, which is affected by both asset management and acquisition and disposition activity, and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA focuses on our overall net leverage position to align with maintaining a strong, conservative balance sheet. 
[END TABLE]
 The Committee then adopted adjusted 2018 corporate performance objectives after (and to account for) the sale by the Company of 12 of the 66 assets owned by the Company when the original performance objectives were set (the Hilton Rotterdam, which was sold in January 2018, was not included in the original 2018 budget set by the Committee so no adjustment was necessary for the sale of that hotel).  The adjusted 2018 corporate performance objectives and corresponding Company results recognized by the Committee are each set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Objective  Weighting  Threshold  Target  High  Results 
 Comparable RevPAR Growth  20%  0.0%  2.0%  3.0%  2.9% 
 Comparable Hotel Adjusted EBITDA Margin  30%  27.4%  28.1%  28.4%  28.8% 
 Adjusted EBITDA  30%  $702 million  $732 million  $747 million  $754 million 
 Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA  20%  4.15x  4.00x  3.90x  3.67x 
[END TABLE]
2018 Actual STIP Awards
In February 2018, pursuant to the CEO Employment Agreement, the Committee approved a Target Bonus for fiscal year 2018 for Mr. Baltimore of 150% of his base salary, with his bonus range being set at 75% to 225% of his base salary. The Committee also approved 2018 Target Bonuses of 100% of base salary (with bonus ranges of 75% to 150% of base salary) for each of Messrs. Dell'Orto, Morey, Sparks and Tanenbaum. 
In February 2018, the Committee determined individual performance objectives for Mr. Baltimore. Thereafter, individual performance goals for each other executive officer were determined by Mr. Baltimore.  At the beginning of 2019, Mr. Baltimore reviewed and determined each NEO's individual performance score.  In February 2019, the Committee discussed and determined Mr. Baltimore's individual performance score. Based on these individual performance scores and the achievement of the corporate performance objectives set forth above, the Committee approved the following 2018 actual STIP awards:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name  Corporate Objective Payout ($)  Individual Performance Payout ($)  Total 2018 STIP Award ($) 
 Thomas J. Baltimore, Jr.  2,011,500  225,000  2,236,500

Long-Term Incentive
Structure
The Company's executive long-term incentive program (the "LTIP") is intended to focus our executive officers and other eligible employees on, and reward them for, achieving our long-term goals and enhancing stockholder value. In addition to the Target Bonus determined pursuant to the STIP, each fiscal year, the Committee will also determine an aggregate target value (the "Aggregate Target Value") under the LTIP for each participant. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, the Aggregate Target Value for fiscal year 2018 for each participant (other than the Chief Executive Officer) will be up to 100% (for officers at the senior vice president level) or up to 200% (for officers at the executive vice president level) of his or her base salary. Pursuant to the CEO Employment  Agreement, the Aggregate Target Value for the Chief Executive Officer will be equal to at least $3,500,000, as determined each year by the Committee. In January 2019, the Committee modified the LTIP to increase the Aggregate Target Value for officers at the executive vice president level from up to 200% to up to 275%. The Committee determined that this modification was advisable in order to give Mr. Dell'Orto an Aggregate Target Value commensurate with executives at companies of similar size and complexity.
The illustration below sets forth the structure of our LTIP:
As shown in the illustration above, for each fiscal year, the Aggregate Target Value for each participant is allocated such that (i) 50% of the value is granted in the form of a time-based award consisting of shares of restricted stock ("RSAs") and (ii) 50% of the value is granted in the form of a performance-based award consisting of performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs"). The terms of each RSA award and PSU award are described below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each fiscal year's RSA award will vest ratably on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the continued employment of the participant through the applicable vesting date. In the event of a participant's termination of employment (i) without "cause" (as defined in the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan) or due to "retirement" (as defined in the RSA award agreement), in each case after the first anniversary of the grant date, all of the remaining unvested shares will become vested, (ii) without cause within 12 months following a "change in control" (as defined in the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan), all of the remaining unvested shares will become vested and (iii) due to death or "disability" (as defined in the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan), a prorated amount of the shares will vest based on the actual days worked during the vesting period. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer's RSA awards, the vesting upon termination of employment will be as set forth in the CEO Employment Agreement, as described below. Participants will receive dividends on the RSAs at the same time that regular dividend payments are made on the Company's common stock. 
• Each fiscal year's PSU award will vest based on the Company's total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder returns of the companies that comprise the FTSE NAREIT Lodging Resorts Index and that have a market capitalization in excess of $1 billion as of the first day of the applicable performance period (the "PSU TSR metric"), in each case over a three-year performance period beginning on January 1 of the fiscal year of such grant (each a "Performance Period"), subject to the participant's continued employment through the end of the Performance Period. The number of PSUs that may become vested will range from 0% to 200% of the number of PSUs granted to the participant, based on the level of achievement of the foregoing performance measure, as determined by the Committee. In the event of a participant's termination of employment (i) without cause, due to retirement or due to death or disability, a prorated amount of the PSUs will vest based on the actual days worked during the Performance Period (and calculated based on actual performance through the end of the Performance Period) and (ii) without cause within 12 months following a change in control, the PSUs will vest based on actual performance through the end of the Performance Period and will not be prorated based on actual days worked during the Performance Period, provided that if the PSUs are not substituted or assumed following a change in control, then the PSUs will vest on the day immediately prior to the consummation of such change in control based on actual performance through such day. With respect to the Chief Executive Officer's PSU awards, the vesting upon termination of employment will be as set forth in the CEO Employment Agreement, as described below. After the end of the Performance Period once the Committee has determined total stockholder return performance and the actual number of PSUs that have vested based on such performance, participants will receive accrued dividends on the shares underlying the vested PSUs based on each regular cash dividend declared on the Company's common stock during the Performance Period. 
[END TABLE]
 2018 Actual LTIP Awards
The following table presents the dollar value of the LTIP awards granted to each NEO in February 2018, including the specific threshold, target and high PSU opportunities for each NEO and the value of the RSAs granted in 2018.  PSU awards are denominated in units that convert into shares of our common stock upon vesting (rather than being denominated as a dollar value). As a result, the actual value received by the NEO upon vesting will take into account the value of our common stock at such time.

    (1)  In January 2019, the Committee approved for Mr. Baltimore an Aggregate Target Value of 400% of his base salary for fiscal year 2019.  As a result, Mr. Baltimore's RSA award value for fiscal year 2019 was increased to $2,000,000 and his PSU award value for fiscal year 2019 was increased to $500,000 for threshold level, $2,000,000 for target level and $4,000,000 for high level.  
    (2)  In January 2019, the Committee approved for Mr. Dell'Orto an Aggregate Target Value of 275% of his base salary for fiscal year 2019.  As a result, Mr. Dell'Orto's RSA award value for fiscal year 2019 was increased to $687,500 and his PSU award value for fiscal year 2019 was increased to $171,875 for threshold level, $687,500 for target level and $1,375,000 for high level.

CEO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT
We have an employment agreement with our Chief Executive Officer, pursuant to which he is entitled to receive severance benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment and we are provided with the protections of certain restrictive covenants. The material terms of this agreement are described below in the section entitled "Compensation Tables—Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table—CEO Employment Agreement."
OTHER COMPENSATION PROGRAM ELEMENTS
Other Benefits and Perquisites
We maintain medical and dental insurance, accidental death insurance and disability insurance for all of our employees. Executives are eligible to participate in the same welfare benefit plans as our other employees and are covered by the same vacation, leave of absence and similar polices. Our executives may participate in Hilton-sponsored arrangements for executives of designated major hotel owners, including guaranteed access at Hilton-branded hotels at a 25% discount off best available rate, up to 30 nights per year at cost, up to 70 nights per year at 50% off best available rate and 50% off food and beverage. In addition, our executives may participate in similar programs offered by other hotel operators. We also provide our executive officers with the opportunity for an annual physical examination at our expense. We also may pay for or reimburse our executives for insurance covering losses they may suffer as a result of their service as Company executives. Severance Benefits
In April 2017, the Committee adopted and approved the Park Hotels & Resort Inc. Executive Severance Plan (the "Executive Severance Plan") for employees of the Company at the level of senior vice president and above designated for participation by the Committee. At such time, the Committee designated each of the NEOs as participants of the Executive Severance Plan, other than the Chief Executive Officer whose severance arrangements will continue to be governed by the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement. For a further description of the Chief Executive Officer's severance and change in control terms, see the discussion under the caption "Compensation Tables—Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table—CEO Employment Agreement."
The Executive Severance Plan sets forth the terms for payment of severance and other benefits to participants in the event of a termination of employment with the Company under certain circumstances. In the event of a termination of employment "without cause" (other than due to death or disability) or for "good reason" (each as defined in the Executive Severance Plan), the participant is entitled to the following payments and benefits:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A cash payment, payable in a single lump sum payment, equal to 2.0x (for executive vice presidents) or 1.5x (for senior vice presidents who are also members of the Company's Executive Committee) the sum of the participant's annual base salary and his or her average annual bonus for the most recent two fiscal years (or one fiscal year if applicable). A participant who was not eligible for a bonus in the prior fiscal year will remain eligible to receive an actual bonus for the year of termination (prorated for the actual period of service during such year). 
• The vesting of the participant's outstanding equity and equity-based awards in accordance with the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) and applicable award agreements. A participant's termination of employment for good reason will be treated as a termination by the Company without cause under the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) and applicable award agreement. 
• A cash amount equal to the difference between the participant's monthly COBRA premium cost and the monthly contribution paid by similarly situated active Company executives for the same coverage, payable in equal installments over a twelve-month period following the participant's termination date. These payments will cease earlier than the expiration of such twelve-month period if the participant becomes eligible to receive group health coverage from another employer or ceases to be eligible to receive COBRA coverage. 
• A cash payment of the participant's accrued pay through the date of termination. 
[END TABLE]
Receipt of all severance payments and benefits under the Executive Severance Plan is contingent upon the NEO complying with various requirements, including non-solicitation and non-competition obligations to the Company (which apply for a period of twelve-months following the NEO's termination of employment) and the NEO's timely execution and delivery to the Company of an effective release of claims. Subject to certain exceptions, the Company shall pay or commence providing all severance benefits within 10 days following the effectiveness of the required release of claim. The Executive Severance Plan superseded and terminated any prior severance plans applicable to participants, including any Hilton severance plan.
Stock Ownership Policy
Our minimum stock ownership guidelines require each executive officer to maintain equity investment in the Company based upon a multiple (six times, in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, and three times, in the case of all other executive officers) of his or her base salary. For purposes of this requirement, an executive officer's holdings include shares held directly or indirectly, individually or jointly; shares underlying unvested time-vesting restricted stock and restricted stock units; and shares held under a deferral or similar plan. Each executive officer is expected to meet this ownership requirement within five years of the later of (a) February 23, 2017 (i.e., the date on which the Company made its first broad-based equity incentive grants following the Spin-off) or (b) the date he or she first becomes subject to this stock ownership policy. Clawback Policy
We have adopted an incentive compensation clawback policy, which allows the Company to recover annual and/or long-term incentive compensation in specified situations. If the Committee determines that incentive compensation of our current and former officers subject to reporting under Section 16 of the Exchange Act or any other employee designated by the Board or the Committee was overpaid, in whole or in part, as a result of a restatement of the reported financial results of the Company or any of its segments due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements (unless due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law) caused or contributed to by such employee's fraud, willful misconduct or gross negligence, the Committee will review the incentive compensation paid, granted, vested or accrued based on the prior inaccurate results and determine whether to seek recovery of any excess incentive compensation paid or earned as a result of such inaccurate results.
No Pledging Policy
The Company maintains a policy that prohibits independent directors and executive officers from purchasing any Company securities on margin, borrowing against Company securities held in margin accounts or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan.
No Hedging Policy
The Company maintains a policy that prohibits directors and executive officers from completing any short sales of Company securities or from purchases or sales of puts, calls or other derivative instruments or securities based on the Company's securities.
Tax Implication on Executive Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)") generally limits the deductibility of annual compensation over $1 million for any of the Company's "covered employees," which includes the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and the three other most highly paid executive officers.  The Committee believes it is appropriate to retain the flexibility to authorize payments of compensation that may not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m) if, in the Committee's judgment, it is in the Company's best interest to do so. Accordingly, the Committee has awarded, and may continue to award, compensation as it considers appropriate that does not qualify for deductibility under Section 162(m).
COMPENSATION RISK REVIEW
The Committee reviewed and considered risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees. This review included consideration of the following specific elements of the Company's executive compensation policies and procedures:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive compensation program is structured as a balanced mix among salary, cash bonus and equity 
• the STIP and LTIP are each based upon pre-existing, defined goals set at the beginning of the year or three-year performance period, as applicable 
• the STIP and LTIP contain multiple financial targets, including performance against a pre-approved budget 
• the STIP and LTIP performance goals include both absolute and relative-to-peer performance 
• the STIP annual goals balance financial and non-financial performance goals 
• the STIP and LTIP performance goals include achievement against both single-year and multi-year metrics 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the STIP and LTIP include maximum payouts at each executive level 
• STIP and LTIP awards are not determined on an "all or nothing" basis, but rather on a graduated basis against stated targets 
• the STIP includes a goal addressing an appropriate leverage ratio 
• the executive compensation program mandates stock ownership by executive officers 
• the executive compensation program includes an appropriate "clawback policy" to recoup overpayments of incentive compensation arising from restatements due to material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, and 
• the Committee retains discretion to adjust STIP payouts as warranted by circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
Following this review, the Committee concluded that any risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company at this time.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
None of the members of our Committee is or has at any time been one of our executive officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the disclosures contained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this report. Based upon this review and discussion, the Committee recommended to the Board that this Compensation Discussion & Analysis section be included in this Proxy Statement.

 (4)  The amounts shown in the Stock Awards column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of awards of RSAs, RSUs and PSUs, as computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, using the assumptions discussed in Note 11 ("Share-Based Compensation") of the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. The grant date fair value of the RSAs and RSUs is determined using the fair value of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The grant date fair value of the PSUs is based upon the probable outcome of the applicable performance conditions and is reported at target level. If the maximum level of performance was achieved for PSUs granted in 2018, the grant date fair value of such PSUs would be $3.5 million for Mr. Baltimore, $1 million for Mr. Dell'Orto, $831,250 for Mr. Morey, $1 million for Mr. Tanenbaum and $1 million for Mr. Sparks.  For additional information on the RSAs and PSUs granted to our NEOs in fiscal year 2018, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis —Long-Term Incentive —2018 Actual LTIP Awards." If the maximum level of performance was achieved for PSUs granted in 2017, the grant date fair value of such PSUs would be $3.5 million for Mr. Baltimore, $1 million for Mr. Dell'Orto, $450,000 for Mr. Morey, $1 million for Mr. Tanenbaum and $1 million for Mr. Sparks. 
 (5)  The amounts shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column reflect the cash award that each NEO earned in fiscal year 2018 that was paid in March 2019.  For additional information on these cash awards, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis —Short-Term Incentive —2018 Actual STIP Awards." 
 (6)   The amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 reflect: (i) for Mr. Baltimore, group term life insurance premiums valued at $960, dividend equivalent and dividend payments of $579,511 on RSUs and RSAs granted to him and payments of $58,281 related to accrued dividend equivalents in respect of the shares underlying RSUs that vested during 2018 for each regular cash dividend declared on the Company's common stock (the "Accrued RSU Dividend Equivalent") from the period of May 16, 2016 to March 31, 2017 for such vested RSUs; (ii) for Mr. Dell'Orto, group term life insurance premiums valued at $960, our matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan of $16,192, dividend equivalent and dividend payments of $175,337 on RSUs and RSAs granted to him and Accrued RSU Dividend Equivalent payments from the period of February 2016 to March 31, 2017 of $1,374; (iii) for Mr. Morey, group term life insurance premiums valued at $912, our matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan of $16,240, dividend payments of $115,152 on RSAs granted to him; (iv) for Mr. Sparks, group term life insurance premiums valued at $960, our matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan of $9,231, dividend equivalent and dividend payments of $107,922 on RSUs and RSAs granted to him and Accrued RSU Dividend Equivalent payments from the period of February 2016 to March 31, 2017 of $1,202; and (v) for Mr. Tanenbaum, group term life insurance premiums valued at $960, our matching contributions under the Company's 401(k) plan of $19,308, and dividend payments of $176,935 on RSAs granted to him.

In providing the estimated potential payments below, we have assumed that there are no (1) accrued but unpaid salary and annual bonuses amounts outstanding or (2) unpaid reimbursements for expenses incurred prior to the date of termination.
Because the disclosures in the table assume the occurrence of a termination or CIC as of a particular date and under a particular set of circumstances and therefore make a number of important assumptions, the actual amount to be paid to each of our NEOs upon a termination or CIC may vary significantly from the amounts included herein. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the continued availability of benefit policies at similar prices and the type of termination event that occurs.

 (1)  In relation to Mr. Baltimore, the above table summarizes the severance benefits that would have been owed to him pursuant to the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement if his employment had terminated under certain circumstances. For a further description of such benefits, see "Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table—CEO Employment Agreement." 
 (2)  Under the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Baltimore would have been entitled to receive a cash severance amount equal to 2.99 times the sum of his base salary and target annual cash incentive opportunity, paid in a lump sum. 
 (3)  Under the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Baltimore would have been entitled to receive a prorated portion of the annual cash bonus that he would have otherwise been entitled to receive had his employment not terminated.  Assuming his termination occurred on December 31, 2018, he would have been entitled to receive the full amount of the annual cash bonus that he would have otherwise been entitled to receive had his employment not terminated. 
 (4)  Under the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Baltimore is entitled to accelerated vesting of any then-held unvested time-based restricted stock and unvested stock options and a prorated portion of the target number of any then-held unvested PSUs and performance shares, provided that such target number will not be prorated if the termination occurs within 12 months following a change in control.  Amounts represent the value of the acceleration of any unvested RSUs, RSAs and PSUs, assuming the acceleration occurred on December 31, 2018 and based on the closing price of Park's common stock on the NYSE as of December 31, 2018 ($25.98). 
 (5)  Under the terms of the CEO Employment Agreement, Mr. Baltimore would have been entitled to receive, subject to his election of COBRA continuation coverage, payment for a period of twelve months following his termination date (subject to earlier termination in certain cases) of an amount equal to the difference between the monthly COBRA premium cost and the monthly contribution paid by active employees for the same coverage. 
 (6)  In relation to Messrs. Dell'Orto, Morey, Tanenbaum and Sparks, the above table summarizes the severance benefits that would have been owed to him pursuant to the terms of our Executive Severance Plan if his employment had terminated under certain circumstances.  For a further description of such benefits, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis— Other Compensation Program Elements—Severance Benefits" above. 
 (7)  Under our Executive Severance Plan, whether or not in connection with a change in control, Messrs. Dell'Orto, Morey, Sparks and Tanenbaum would each have been entitled to receive a cash severance amount equal to 2.0x the sum of his annual base salary and average annual bonus for the most recent two fiscal years and  
 (8)  Under our Executive Severance Plan, a participant's outstanding equity and equity-based awards will vest in accordance with the Company's 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (or any successor plan) and applicable award agreements.  Amounts represent the value of the acceleration of any unvested RSUs, RSAs, PSUs and stock options, assuming the acceleration occurred on December 31, 2018 and based on the closing price of Park's common stock on the NYSE as of December 31, 2018 ($25.98). Pursuant to the terms of the applicable award agreements: 
• RSAs: If the NEO's employment terminates (i) without cause or due to retirement, in each case after the first anniversary of the grant date, all of the remaining unvested shares will become vested, (ii) without cause within twelve months following a change in control, all of the remaining unvested shares will become vested, or (iii) due to death or disability, a prorated amount of the shares will vest based on the actual days worked during the vesting period. 
• PSUs: If the NEO's employment terminates (i) without cause, due to retirement or due to death or disability, a prorated amount of the PSUs will vest based on the actual days worked during the performance period (and calculated based on actual performance through the end of the performance period) and (ii) without cause within 12 months following a change in control, the PSUs will vest based on actual performance through the end of the performance period and will not be prorated based on actual days worked during the performance period, provided that if the PSUs are not substituted or assumed following a change in control, then the PSUs will vest on the day immediately prior to the consummation of such change in control based on actual performance through such day.  For purposes of the above table, we have assumed that the target level of performance will be achieved for all outstanding PSUs.  
• Stock options: If the NEO's employment terminates without cause within 12 months following a change in control or due to the executive's death or disability, all unvested options will immediately vest and become exercisable. In the table above, amounts reported reflect the "spread," or difference between the exercise price and closing price as of December 31, 2018. 
 (9)  Under our Executive Severance Plan, whether or not in connection with a change in control, Messrs. Dell'Orto, Morey, Tanenbaum and Sparks would each have been entitled to receive a cash amount equal to the difference between the NEO's monthly COBRA premium cost and the monthly contribution paid by similarly situated active Company executives for the same coverage, payable in equal installments over a twelve-month period following his termination date.

    (1)  In addition to shares issuable upon exercise of stock options, amount also includes 1,247,408 shares that may be issued upon settlement of RSUs, RSAs and PSUs. The number of shares to be issued in respect of PSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2018 has been calculated based on the assumption that target levels of performance applicable to the PSUs would have been achieved. At December 31, 2018, our PSU TSR metric performance achieved a greater than target level. 
    (2)  The weighted-average exercise price of outstanding options relates solely to stock options, which are the only currently outstanding exercisable security. 
[END TABLE]
PAY RATIO
The chart below sets forth the SEC's required pay ratio and our supplemental pay ratio that factors in only our full-time corporate employees, which we believe facilitates comparison to our lodging REIT-based peer group.  Both pay ratios are further explained below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2018 Median Employee Total Annual Compensation ($)  Pay Ratio 
    2018 Median Employee Total Annual Compensation ($)  Pay Ratio 
 Required Pay Ratio (All Employees)  25,280  301:1 
 Supplemental Pay Ratio (Corporate Employees Only)  172,119  44:1 
[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, the date used to determine our median employee, Park had 1,198 worldwide employees (including full-time, part-time, temporary and seasonal employees).  Of this amount –
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 1,114 employees are facility employees at our hotels or laundries, and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 84 employees are corporate employees at our corporate office. 
[END TABLE]
Required Pay Ratio
The Required Pay Ratio compares the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer to the annual total compensation of our median employee, as required by Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act.  
As permitted by Regulation S-K, this ratio is based on a reasonable estimate.  In identifying our median employee, we calculated annual total direct compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2018.  Total direct compensation for these purposes included base salary, cash incentives, stock grants, commissions and comparable cash elements of compensation in non-U.S. jurisdictions and was calculated using internal human resources records.  We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. The same method was used to calculate our Required Pay Ratio in our 2018 proxy statement.  The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Regulation S-K for our median employee was $25,280. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Regulation S-K for our Chief Executive Officer was $7,601,165. Supplemental Pay Ratio
We present a Supplemental Pay Ratio to assist stockholders in comparing Park to our 10-company lodging REIT-based peer group.  We identified the median employee for purposes of our Supplemental Pay Ratio in the same way we identified the median employee for purposes of computing the Required Pay Ratio, except that the Supplemental Pay Ratio was based on only the 84 employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer) that are corporate employees at our corporate office. This is the same method used to calculate our Supplemental Pay Ratio presented in our 2018 proxy statement.  As background, we note the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At eight of our hotels and at our three laundry facilities, Park is the employer company for the facility employees. At many other lodging REITs, we believe facility employees are employed by hotel management companies rather than the REIT itself.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For example, all of the companies in our lodging REIT-based peer group except one (Ryman Hospitality Properties) had significantly fewer total employees (as reported in their most recent Annual Reports on Forms 10-K): Apple Hospitality REIT, Inc (62 employees), Chesapeake Lodging Trust (13), DiamondRock Hospitality Company (31), Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (184), LaSalle Hotel Properties (36) (based on 2017 Form 10-K), Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (50), RLJ Lodging Trust (84), Sunstone Hotel Investors, Inc. (48) and Xenia Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (51). Based on its 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Ryman Hospitality Properties had 1,113 employees, which it said primarily includes full- and part-time employees employed by its Entertainment segment, which owns concert venues, a radio station, a golf course and other properties. 
[END TABLE]
With this background in identifying the median employee for our Supplemental Pay Ratio, we included only our 84 full-time corporate employees (excluding our Chief Executive Officer). The annual total compensation as determined under Regulation S-K for our median full-time corporate employee (excluding our Chief Executive officer) was $172,119. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Regulation S-K for our Chief Executive Officer was $7,601,165.

 PROPOSAL 4: RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG 
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to audit the books, records and accounts of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Board recommends that the stockholders ratify this appointment.
In the event stockholders do not ratify this appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection, but still may determine that the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. Even if the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP is ratified by stockholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent public accounting firm to act as the Company's auditor at any time during the year if the Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the annual meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.
VOTE REQUIRED
Under our by-laws, ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast. This means that the number of votes cast "FOR" the proposal must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" the proposal. Abstentions will not be treated as votes cast "FOR" or "AGAINST" and therefore will have no impact on the ratification of Ernst & Young as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING
DECEMBER 31, 2019.
AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES
In connection with the audit of the 2018 financial statements, we entered into an agreement with Ernst & Young LLP, which sets forth the terms by which Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, will perform audit services for the Company. The following table sets forth the fees billed to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP in 2018 and 2017. The audit fees are for services that are normally provided by Ernst & Young LLP in connection with statutory or regulatory filings or engagements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
       2018        2017    
 Audit fees (1)      $  1,876,761        $  1,856,903

The Audit fees set forth in the table above do not include $205,032 received by Ernst & Young for services, including the issuance of comfort letters, provided in connection with the secondary offering of our common stock by HNA, as such fees were paid directly by HNA. 
[END TABLE]
 AUDIT COMMITTEE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence and the Audit Committee's Charter, the Audit Committee has responsibility for engaging and preapproving all audit services to be provided to the Company by setting compensation for and reviewing the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee Charter requires it to preapprove all audit services to be provided to the Company. In exercising this responsibility, the Audit Committee approves all audit, audit-related and tax services provided by any independent registered public accounting firm prior to each engagement. Such pre-approvals are provided by the Audit Committee and relate to a particular category and are subject to a specified budget. Our Audit Committee has delegated authority to the Chair of the Audit Committee to pre-approve additional services in-between Audit Committee meetings, with any such pre-approvals then communicated to the full Audit Committee during its next scheduled meeting.  
All audit, audit-related, tax and other fees incurred in fiscal year 2018 and after the Spin-off in fiscal year 2017 were approved by the Audit Committee or the Chair of the Audit Committee pursuant to the policy described above. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee assists the Board with its oversight responsibilities regarding the Company's financial reporting process. The Company's management is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements and the reporting process, including the Company's accounting policies, internal audit function, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an audit of the Company's financial statements.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements and internal control over financial reporting of the Company with management and with the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16 "Communications with Audit Committee." In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letters from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence. 
Based upon the review and discussions described in the preceding paragraph, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements of the Company be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the SEC.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and directors, a company's chief accounting officer and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a company's common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Executive officers, directors and beneficial owners with more than 10% of our common stock are required by the SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and written representations from our executive officers and directors (including former directors), we believe that our executive officers, directors and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock have timely filed all required Section 16(a) reports during 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
[END TABLE]
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS POLICY
We recognize that related-party transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest and have adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy to which all related-party transactions shall be subject. Pursuant to the policy, a "related person" (as defined as in Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, which includes security holders who beneficially own more than 5% of our common stock) must promptly disclose to our General Counsel any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The General Counsel will then promptly communicate that information to our Board. No related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our Board or a duly authorized committee of our Board (currently the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee). If we become aware of an existing related person transaction that has not been approved under this policy, the transaction will be referred to our Board or a duly authorized committee of our Board (currently the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee), which will evaluate all options available, including ratification, revision or termination of such transaction. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest.
Certain types of transactions, which may have otherwise required individual review, were pre-approved or ratified (as applicable) pursuant to the terms of our Related Person Transaction Policy. These types of transactions included transactions with and payments to or from Hilton or HGV pursuant to agreements that were in effect at the time of the Spin-off, including without limitation, hotel management and franchise agreements with Hilton and the Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement, the Transition Services Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement (each as discussed further below). Additionally, the Related Person Transaction Policy pre-approved certain transactions with or related to HNA, including, without limitation: (1) transactions in which HNA may have had a direct or indirect material interest entered into or in effect at the effective time of the Spin-off; and (2) the purchase or sale of products or services involving HNA's portfolio company, provided that (a) the appropriate officers reasonably believed the transaction to be on market terms, (b) the subject products or services were of a type generally made available to other customers by the portfolio company and (c) either the aggregate value involved in such purchase or sale was expected to be less than $10 million over five years or the transaction involved a new or assumed hotel management or franchise agreement with Hilton or its affiliates to commence or be assumed following the Spin-off. Furthermore, a transaction between (i) HNA or a HNA portfolio company and (ii) a Hilton-branded or HGV-branded property (or owner thereof) in which the Company does not have an ownership interest was not considered a "related person transaction" that was subject to our Related Person Transaction Policy. On March 9, 2018, following the closing of both the secondary public offering by HNA of all of its shares of the Company's common stock and the repurchase by the Company of the Company's common stock from HNA, each of HNA, Hilton and HGV were no longer deemed to be related parties of the Company.   
INTERNAL REORGANIZATION AND SPIN-OFF RELATED AGREEMENTS
Introduction
As part of the Spin-off, Hilton underwent an internal reorganization, pursuant to which, among other things and subject to limited exceptions: (i) all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the owned real estate business of Hilton were retained by or transferred to Park or our subsidiaries; (ii) all of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) associated with the Hilton's timeshare business were retained by or transferred to HGV or its subsidiaries; (iii) all other assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) of Hilton were retained by or transferred to Hilton or its subsidiaries (other than Park, HGV and our respective subsidiaries); and (iv) Park distributed all of the stock of HGV and Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc. to Hilton Worldwide Finance LLC, a subsidiary of Hilton. Following the Spin-off, we and Hilton operate independently, and neither have any ownership interest in the other. To govern certain ongoing relationships between us and Hilton after the Spin-off and to provide mechanisms for an orderly transition, we, Hilton and HGV entered into agreements pursuant to which certain services and rights are provided for following the Spin-off, and we, Hilton and HGV will indemnify each other against certain liabilities arising from our respective businesses.
Distribution Agreement
Our Distribution Agreement with Hilton and HGV governs certain transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities by each of Park, Hilton and HGV and the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among the three companies. In particular, substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the separated real estate business were retained by or transferred to Park or its subsidiaries. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities associated with the timeshare business were retained by or transferred to HGV or its subsidiaries. All other assets and liabilities were retained by or transferred to Hilton or its subsidiaries. Hilton, Park and HGV also agreed that losses related to certain contingent liabilities that generally are not specifically attributable to any of the three companies (the "Shared Contingent Liabilities") will be apportioned as follows: 65%, 26%, and 9% for each of Hilton, Park and HGV, respectively.  Examples of Shared Contingent Liabilities may include uninsured losses arising from actions (including derivative actions) against current or former directors or officers of Hilton or its subsidiaries in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the distribution date, or against current or former directors or officers of any of Hilton, HGV or us, or any of their or our respective subsidiaries, arising out of, in connection with or otherwise relating to, the spin-offs and the distribution, subject to certain exceptions described in the Distribution Agreement.  In addition, costs and expenses of, and indemnification obligations to, third party professional advisors arising out of the foregoing actions may also be subject to these provisions.  Subject to certain limitations and exceptions, Hilton shall generally be vested with the exclusive management and control of all matters pertaining to any such Shared Contingent Liabilities, including the prosecution of any claim and the conduct of any defense. 
The Distribution Agreement also provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of each business with the appropriate company.
Employee Matters Agreement
Our Employee Matters Agreement with Hilton and HGV governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and HGV after the Spin-offs with respect to transferred employees, defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans, non-qualified retirement plans, employee health and welfare benefit plans, incentive plans, equity-based awards, collective bargaining agreements and other employment, compensation and benefits-related matters. The Employee Matters Agreement provides for, among other things, the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities arising out of incentive plans, retirement plans and employee health and welfare benefit plans in which Park and HGV employees participated prior to the Spin-offs, and continued participation by Park and HGV employees in certain of Hilton's compensation and benefit plans for a specified period of time following the Spin-offs. Generally, other than with respect to certain specified compensation and benefit plans and liabilities, Park assumed or retained sponsorship of, and the liabilities relating to, compensation and benefit plans and employee-related liabilities relating to its current and former employees. The Employee Matters Agreement also provides that outstanding Hilton equity-based awards were equitably adjusted or converted into Park or HGV awards, as applicable. Following the Spin-off, our employees no longer actively participate in Hilton's benefit plans or programs (other than specified compensation and benefit plans for a transition period under the Employee Matters Agreement), and we have established or will establish plans or programs for our employees as described in the Employee Matters Agreement. Effective as of January 1, 2018, the Company has implemented separate benefit plans for our employees. We have also established or maintained plans and programs outside of the United States as may be required under applicable law or pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement. Tax Matters Agreement
Our Tax Matters Agreement with Hilton and HGV governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Hilton, Park and HGV with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. Under the Tax Matters Agreement, which is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), each of Park and HGV will continue to have several liability with Hilton to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Hilton consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which Park and HGV were part of that group. The agreement also specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which Park and HGV will bear responsibility and provides for certain indemnification provisions with respect to amounts for which they are not responsible. In addition, under the agreement, each party is expected to be responsible for any taxes imposed on Hilton that arise from the failure of the Spin-offs and certain related transactions to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to the extent that the failure to qualify is attributable to actions taken by such party (or with respect to such party's stock). The parties will share responsibility in accordance with sharing percentages under the Distribution Agreement for any such taxes imposed on Hilton that are not attributable to actions taken by a particular party.
The Tax Matters Agreement also provided for certain covenants that may restrict Park's ability to pursue strategic or other transactions that otherwise could maximize the value of our business, including, for two years after the Spin-off: engaging in any transaction involving the acquisition of shares of Park common stock or in certain issuances of shares of Park common stock (other than with respect to the distribution of our estimated share of C corporation earnings and profits attributable to the period prior to Spin-off; merging or consolidating with any other person or dissolving or liquidating in whole or in part; selling or otherwise disposing of, or allowing the sale or other disposition of, more than 35% of our consolidated gross or net assets; or repurchasing our shares, except in certain circumstances. These strategic and other transactions may be allowed within the two-year timeframe in the event that the IRS has granted a favorable ruling to Hilton, HGV or Park or in the event that Hilton, HGV or Park have received an opinion from a tax advisor that Park can take such actions without adversely affecting the tax-free status of the Spin-off and related transactions.  These covenants in the Tax Matters Agreement also restricted our ability to modify our organizational documents (i.e., our certificate of incorporation and by-laws) in a manner that affects the voting rights of our stockholders for the same period of two years after the Spin-off.
Transition Services Agreement
We entered into a Transition Services Agreement ("TSA") with Hilton to provide us with certain services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the distribution. The services that Hilton provided include certain finance, information technology, human resources and compensation, facilities, legal and compliance and other services. We paid Hilton for such services utilized at agreed amounts as set forth in the TSA. In addition, for a term set forth in the TSA, we and Hilton could mutually agree on additional services to be provided by Hilton to us that were provided to us by Hilton prior to the distribution but were omitted from the TSA at pricing based on market rates that are reasonably agreed by the parties.  The majority of the services provided pursuant to the TSA were terminated effective January 1, 2018 and the TSA expired by its terms on December 31, 2018. 
MANAGEMENT AND FRANCHISE AGREEMENTS WITH HILTON
In order for us to qualify as a REIT, independent third parties must operate our hotels. Except for four self-managed hotels that we own (the "Select Hotels"), we lease substantially all of our hotels to our taxable REIT subsidiary lessees, which, in turn have engaged Hilton to operate these hotels pursuant to management agreements. We operate the Select Hotels pursuant to franchise agreements with Hilton. We may, in the future, re-flag existing properties, acquire properties that operate under other brands and/or engage other third-party hotel managers and franchisors.
The general terms of the management and franchise agreements that we and Hilton have enter into are described in the "Business—Our Principal Agreements—Management Agreements" and "—Franchise Agreements" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 28, 2019. AGREEMENTS WITH HNA
HNA Stockholder and Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with the sale by the Blackstone Group L.P. of approximately 25% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to HNA (the "HNA Acquisition"), which closed on March 15, 2017, the Company entered into the HNA Stockholders Agreement. Under the HNA Stockholders Agreement, for so long as HNA beneficially owned at least 15% of our outstanding common stock, it had the right to designate two directors to our Board, only one of which could be affiliated with HNA (but not its hospitality business, unless our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee otherwise agreed) and the other of which must meet the independence standards of the NYSE with respect to our Company and must not have been, for two years, an employee, director or officer of, or consultant to, HNA or any of its affiliates. The HNA Stockholder Agreement automatically terminated pursuant to its terms when HNA closed on the sale of its shares of common stock as discussed below.  Also, in connection with the HNA Acquisition, we also entered into a registration rights agreement with HNA (the "HNA Registration Rights Agreement") that became effective upon the closing of the HNA Acquisition. The HNA registration rights agreement provided HNA with customary "demand" and "piggyback" registration rights, beginning two years after the closing of the Sale. 
Master Amendment and Option Agreement
On March 5, 2018, the Company, HNA and HNA HLT Holdco I LLC, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of HNA, entered into a Master Amendment and Option Agreement (the "Master Amendment and Option Agreement") to make certain amendments to the HNA Registration Rights Agreement and HNA Stockholders Agreement. The Master Amendment and Option Agreement amended the Registration Rights Agreement to, among other things, provide that HNA had customary "demand" registration rights effective March 5, 2018. In addition, the Master Amendment and Option Agreement required HNA to pay all of the Company's expenses in connection with performance or compliance under the HNA Registration Rights Agreement for registrations or offerings occurring prior to the original registration rights effective date, including reasonable fees and disbursements of the Company's advisors, in connection with any underwritten offerings by HNA.
In addition, pursuant to the Master Amendment and Option Agreement, HNA and HNA HLT Holdco I LLC (the "selling stockholder") granted the Company a right to repurchase up to 15,750,000 shares of the Company's common stock held by the selling stockholder (the "Repurchase") in connection with the first underwritten public secondary offering of common stock by HNA.  The Company announced on March 6, 2018 that it was exercising its right to repurchase 14,000,000 shares of common stock in connection with the underwritten public secondary offering of shares of the Company's common stock held by HNA announced on March 5, 2018. The Company facilitated this underwritten public secondary offering of shares of the Company's common stock held by HNA, including by entering into a related underwriting agreement among the Company, HNA, the HNA selling stockholder and the representatives of the several underwriters. 
The Master Amendment and Option Agreement also amended the HNA Stockholders Agreement effective on March 9, 2018 to, among other things, eliminate HNA's right to designate directors to the Company's Board.  For further description of the Master Amendment and Option Agreement, see the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the SEC on March 5, 2018. 
INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS
We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers. These agreements require us to indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law against liabilities that may arise by reason of their service to us, and to advance expenses incurred as a result of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors or executive officers, we have been informed that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public policy and is therefore unenforceable. There is currently no pending material litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought.
REAL ESTATE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH HILTON AND HGV
In October 2016, we transferred a hotel tower containing approximately 600 rooms at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to a wholly owned subsidiary of Hilton for a conversion to a timeshare project. Following the Spin-off, the subsidiary was transferred and is now wholly-owned by HGV. The net book value of these assets was approximately $177 million. At the time of the transfer, we entered into a lease with the subsidiary that acquired the building by which we retained the right to continue to use these 600 rooms as part of our hotel operation until December 2019, subject to the obligation to turn some of the rooms over for the subsidiary's use prior to the expiration of the term. Due to our continuing involvement, this transaction was not recognized as a sale and was accounted for as a sales-leaseback liability under the financing method. The assets will be derecognized at the end of lease term. During 2017, 134 of the 600 rooms at the Hilton Waikoloa Village previously transferred to HGV and leased back by us were released to HGV; accordingly, we derecognized $38 million of property and equipment, net, and the related $39 million liability due to HGV.  During 2018, we transferred a restaurant at the Hilton Waikoloa Village to HGV and derecognized $3 million of property and equipment, net and $3 million of the related liability due to HGV.
The remaining sale-leaseback liability as of December 31, 2018 related to the Hilton Waikoloa Village was $135 million.
Certain of our hotels charge HGV and Hilton for rental fees related to the provision of office space and equipment at such hotels. For the year ended December 31, 2018, approximately $4.5 million and $0.4 million was recognized from such rental fees paid to Park by HGV and Hilton, respectively. 
Additionally, in 2018, the Company had arrangements whereby we provided hotel-type management services to certain time-share projects of HGV, the provision of such services which were then subcontracted to Hilton by the Company.  The Company also charged maintenance fees to HGV related to HGV's home-owners accessing Park's properties. The Company recognized approximately $4.9 million in revenue from such arrangements. 
OTHER RELATIONSHIPS
From time to time, we have engaged JLL and/or its subsidiaries to provide construction management services for capital projects such as rooms renovations at certain of our hotels. We have also engaged JLL and/or its subsidiaries to provide services related to the sales of our properties.  These services include finding purchasers for specific hotels to be sold by the Company. Each of these engagements was entered into solely on a transactional basis (i.e., JLL is only engaged with respect to a specific property to be sold and will only be paid a commission upon such sale being completed).  As well, none of the JLL engagements was entered into on a "company-wide" basis (and the Company routinely engages various other vendors on a similar transactional basis for other assets to be sold). And lastly, none of these JLL engagements involve strategic decision making or consulting to the Company.  In 2018, we made aggregate payments to JLL of approximately $2.4 million. Ms. Kelly, who is a director on our Board, was the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of JLL until September 2018. The payments were substantially below 2018 reported revenues for both the Company ($2.737 billion) and JLL ($16.3 billion).  As well, all transactions in excess of $120,000 were approved by our Nominating & Corporate Governance Committee as required by our Related Person Transaction Policy (and Ms. Kelly does not serve on such committee).

Our proxy materials are also available under the "Investors" tab of the Company's website at www.pkhotelsandresorts.com starting on or about March 29, 2019.
Instead of receiving future copies of our Proxy Statement and Annual Reports by mail, stockholders of record and most beneficial owners can elect to receive an email that will provide an electronic link to these documents. Choosing to receive your proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and reduce the environmental impact of our annual meeting. Your election to receive future proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you revoke it.
I share an address with another stockholder of the Company and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy?
We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which the SEC has approved. Under this procedure, we deliver a single copy of the proxy materials to multiple stockholders of the Company who share the same address unless we received contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. This procedure reduces our printing and mailing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate Proxy Cards.
Upon written request, we will promptly deliver, free of charge, a separate copy of the proxy materials to any stockholder of the Company at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these documents. To receive a separate copy of the proxy materials, stockholders of record may send a request to Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 1775 Tysons Blvd, 7th Floor, Tysons, VA 22102, Attention: Investor Relations; e-mail us with your request at ir@pkhotelsandresorts.com; or call us with your request at (571) 302-5757.
Additionally, stockholders who share the same address and receive multiple copies of the proxy material can request a single copy by contacting us at the address, email address or telephone number above. If you hold your shares in a brokerage account or through a broker, bank, or other nominee, you may contact your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other nominee to request information about householding. What does it mean if I receive more than one Proxy Card or Voting Instruction Form?
It generally means your shares are registered differently or are held in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all Proxy Cards and Voting Instruction Forms that you receive.

Most of our stockholders hold their shares beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and these proxy materials are being sent directly to you. As the stockholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to us, to submit proxies electronically or by telephone or to vote in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Beneficial Owner. If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and these proxy materials are being forwarded to you by your broker, bank or nominee. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or nominee on how to vote and are also invited to attend the annual meeting. However, since you are not the stockholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the annual meeting unless you request, complete and deliver a legal proxy from your broker, bank or nominee. If you requested printed proxy materials, your broker, bank or nominee has enclosed a Voting Instruction Form for you to use in directing the broker, bank or nominee regarding how to vote your shares. 
[END TABLE]
May I attend the meeting?
All stockholders of record of shares of our common stock at the close of business on the record date, or their designated proxies, are authorized to attend the annual meeting. Each stockholder and proxy will be asked to present a valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport, before being admitted.
If you are the beneficial owner of our common stock then you should provide proof of beneficial ownership as of the record date, such as an account statement reflecting your stock ownership as of the record date, a copy of the Voting Instruction Form provided by your broker, bank or other nominee, or other similar evidence of ownership. We reserve the right to determine the validity of any purported proof of beneficial ownership. If you do not have proof of ownership, you may not be admitted to the annual meeting. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted, and attendees may be subject to security inspections and other security precautions.
How do I vote?
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting in Person at the Meeting. If you are a stockholder of record and attend the annual meeting, you may vote in person at the meeting. If your shares of Park common stock are held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares of Park common stock of record. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting by Proxy for Shares Registered Directly in Your Name. If you are a stockholder of record, you may instruct the proxy holders named in the enclosed Proxy Card how to vote your shares of Park common stock by using the toll-free telephone number or the website listed on the Proxy Card or by signing, dating and mailing the Proxy Card in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
    ➣  Vote by Telephone. You may authorize a proxy to vote your shares by telephone by calling the toll-free number listed on the accompanying Proxy Card. Authorizing a proxy by telephone is available 24 hours per day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 25, 2019. When you call, please have your Proxy Card in hand, and you will receive a series of voice instructions that will allow you to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of common stock. You will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. IF YOU AUTHORIZE A PROXY BY TELEPHONE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD. 
    ➣  Vote by Internet. You also have the option to authorize a proxy to vote your shares via the Internet. The website for authorizing a proxy is printed on your Proxy Card. Authorizing a proxy by Internet is available 24 hours per day until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 25, 2019. As with telephone voting, you will be given the opportunity to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. IF YOU AUTHORIZE A PROXY VIA THE INTERNET, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RETURN YOUR PROXY CARD. 
    ➣  Vote by Mail. If you would like to authorize a proxy to vote your shares by mail, mark, sign and date your Proxy Card and return in the postage-paid envelope provided. 
• Voting by Proxy for Shares Registered in Street Name. If your shares of common stock are held in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee which you must follow in order to have your shares of common stock voted in accordance with your instructions. The broker, bank or other nominee for your shares is required to follow your voting instructions. Accordingly, you will need to follow the directions you receive from your broker, bank or other nominee. Under the current rules of the NYSE if you do not give instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee, it will still be able to vote your shares with respect to certain "discretionary" items, but will not be allowed to vote your shares with respect to certain "non-discretionary" items. The ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm (Proposal 4) is considered to be a "discretionary" item under the NYSE rules and your broker, bank or other nominee will be able to vote on that item even if it does not receive instructions from you. The election of directors (Proposal 1), the approval and adoption of amendments to the amended and restated certificate of incorporation (Proposal 2) and the vote on the compensation of our named executive officers (Proposal 3) are "non-discretionary" items. If you do not instruct your broker, bank or other nominee how to vote with respect to these items, it may not vote with respect to these proposals and those votes will be counted as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes are shares that are held in street name by a broker, bank or other nominee that returns a properly executed proxy but does not have discretionary authority to vote on a particular matter. 
[END TABLE]
May I revoke or change my vote after I have voted?
If you are a stockholder of record, you may revoke or change your proxy at any time before it is voted at the annual meeting by (i) submitting a revised proxy by Internet, telephone, or duly executed paper ballot after the date of the previously submitted proxy, (ii) attending the annual meeting and voting in person or (iii) delivering a signed notice of revocation of the Proxy Card to the Secretary of the Company at the following address: Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 1775 Tysons Blvd, 7th Floor, Tysons, VA 22102, Attention: Corporate Secretary.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may revoke or change your voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other nominee and following their instructions. Where can I find the voting results of the annual meeting?
We will announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting. We will publish the final voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days following the annual meeting.
Whom should I call if I have questions or need assistance voting my shares?
Please call 571-302-5757 or email ir@pkhotelsandresorts.com if you have any questions in connection with voting your shares.
Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the annual meeting?
Park is making this solicitation and will bear the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing these proxy materials and soliciting votes. Our officers and employees may solicit proxies in person, by mail, by telephone or by electronic communication, but they will not receive any additional compensation for these activities. We will, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms and other custodians, fiduciaries, and nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of shares of Park common stock. We have engaged the services of MacKenzie Partners, Inc., with respect to proxy soliciting matters at an expected cost of approximately $10,000, not including incidental expenses.

 OTHER MATTERS 
[END TABLE]
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING
If any stockholder wishes to propose a matter for consideration at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, the proposal should be mailed by certified mail return receipt requested, to our Office of Corporate Secretary, Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 1775 Tysons Blvd., 7th Floor, Tysons, VA 22102.
As a general rule, stockholders wishing to submit a proposal for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders and have the proposal included in the proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8(e) under the Exchange Act must submit the proposal not less than 120 days prior to the one-year anniversary of the release date of the proxy statement in connection with the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, or November 29, 2019. Failure to deliver a proposal in accordance with this procedure may result in it not being deemed timely received.
In addition, our by-laws permit stockholders to nominate directors and present other business for consideration at our annual meeting of stockholders. To make a director nomination or present other business for consideration at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2020, you must submit a timely notice in accordance with the procedures described in our by-laws. As a general rule, to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of our Company not less than 90 days or more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or no earlier than December 28, 2019 or later than January 27, 2020 for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. Any such proposal will be considered timely only if it is otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in our by-laws. The proxy solicited by the Board for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will confer discretionary authority to vote as the proxy holders deem advisable on such stockholder proposals which are considered untimely.
In order for an eligible stockholder or group of stockholders to nominate a director nominee for election at our 2020 annual meeting pursuant to the proxy access provision of our by-laws, notice of such nomination and other required information must be received by our Company between October 31, 2019 and November 29, 2019. Our by-laws state that such notice and other required information must be received by the Company not earlier than 150 days nor later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date of the proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting (with adjustments if the date for the upcoming annual meeting of stockholders is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the anniversary date of the prior year's annual meeting).
The mailing address of our principal executive offices is 1775 Tysons Blvd., 7th Floor, Tysons, VA 22101.
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
SEC rules permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for proxy statements and notices with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement or a single notice addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," provides cost savings for companies and helps the environment by conserving natural resources. Some brokers household proxy materials, delivering a single proxy statement or notice to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker that they will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement or notice, or if your household is receiving multiple copies of these documents and you wish to request that future deliveries be limited to a single copy, or if you wish to request delivery of a copy of this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report, please contact (i) our Investor Relations Department by calling 571-302-5757 or emailing ir@pkhotelsandresorts.com, or writing to the Office of the Corporate Secretary, Park Hotels & Resorts Inc., 1775 Tysons Blvd., 7th Floor, Tysons, VA 22102 if you are a record holder or (ii) your broker, bank or other nominee if you own your shares of Park common stock in street name.

(2)such Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of Capital Stock would (or in the sole judgment of the Board, could) result in (a) the Corporation owning (directly, indirectly or as a result of Constructive Ownership) an interest in a tenant that is described in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code if the income derived by the Corporation (either directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships or limited liability companiessubsidiaries of the Corporation) from such tenant for the taxable year of the Corporation during which such determination is being made would (or in the sole judgment of the Board, could) reasonably be expected to equal or exceed one percent (1%) of the Corporation's gross income (as determined for purposes of Section 856(c) of the Code) or (b) any manager or operator of a "qualified lodging facility," within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9)(D) of the Code, leased by the Corporation (or any subsidiary of the Corporation) to one of the Corporation's taxable REIT subsidiaries failing to qualify as an "eligible independent contractor," within the meaning of Section 856(d)(9)(A) of the Code, if, in the case of either clause (a) or (b), the income derived by the Corporation from such tenant or such taxable REIT subsidiary, taking into account any other income of the Corporation that would (or in the sole judgment of the Board, could) not qualify under the gross income requirements of Section 856(c) of the Code, would (or in the sole judgment of the Board, could) cause the Corporation to fail to satisfy any of such gross income requirements; or

A-6

Section 7.2.2  Remedies for Breach.

Section 7.2.3  Notice of Restricted Transfer. Any Person who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire Beneficial Ownership or Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock that will or may violate Section 7.2.1(a), or any Person who would have owned shares of Capital Stock that resulted in a transfer to the Charitable Trust pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.2.1(b), shall immediately give written notice to the Corporation of such event or, in the case of such a proposed or attempted transaction, shall give at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice, and shall provide to the Corporation such other information as the Corporation may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of such acquisition or ownership on the Corporation's status as a REIT.
