LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
We invite you to attend our company's annual meeting of shareholders, which will be held on May 9, 2019 in Phoenix, Arizona. Please see page 69 for details on attending.
2018 was a year of great progress on many fronts for DTE Energy, driven by the energy and focus of our 10,000 dedicated employees.
Topping the list is our safety performance. Our employees' commitment to working safely and watching out for the safety of their coworkers and the public resulted in DTE leading our industry in preventing severe injuries. That stellar performance is only possible when employees are fully engaged in their work, which was confirmed by engagement surveys that ranked DTE's employees in the top four percent across all industries worldwide.
Our employees also delivered on our commitment to our customers and communities. In addition to making significant progress in our ongoing work to modernize our energy grid and gas distribution system while keeping our customers' bills affordable, we also made landmark progress toward achieving our goal of reducing carbon emissions by more than 80 percent by 2050. In March 2018 DTE announced plans to double its renewable energy generation by investing more than $1.7 billion by 2022. And, in August, we took our single largest step toward reducing emissions when we broke ground on the Blue Water Energy Center, a state-of-the-art natural gas-fueled power plant that will come on line in 2022 as we retire multiple coal-fired plants.
In addition to delivering for our customers, we produced record results for you, our shareholders. After raising our earnings guidance twice during the year, we achieved record operating earnings of $1.1 billion, up 14 percent versus 2017.
Our operational and financial strength gives us the opportunity to look beyond the walls of our company to the role we aspire to play in building healthy, strong and sustainable communities. DTE is working to harness the economic engine of the private sector to the task of revitalizing our neighborhoods, strengthening our local economies, and preparing our youth to succeed in the workforce. One standout accomplishment in this area is that more than 50 percent of our employees spent hours volunteering in our communities, including thousands of hours of skills-based volunteerism, where employees apply skills gained from their work at DTE to community projects and organizations.

PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY
DTE Energy Aspiration and System of Priorities
At DTE Energy Company ("DTE Energy," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our"), we aspire to be the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve. This aspiration drives everything we do and has led us to develop a system of corporate priorities that guide our daily, monthly and annual plans which help us to achieve this aspiration. Our Board of Directors (the "Board") evaluates our Company's and executives' performance based upon goals that align with this system of priorities, and we will refer to this system of priorities as we discuss DTE Energy's performance and our compensation programs throughout this proxy statement.
Becoming the best-operated energy company means having great corporate governance, competitive compensation and excellent shareholder relations.

  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      1 
[END TABLE]
Shareholder Engagement
We have continued our shareholder engagement activities this year and, as a result of those discussions, we've learned a lot about what is important to our shareholders. The shareholder engagement team consists of members from the Corporate Secretary's office, the General Counsel organization, Investor Relations, Environmental Management, and Corporate Communications. Shareholder engagement is a year-round process for us.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Every spring we reach out to large shareholders to discuss issues related to proxy season and the proposals to be presented at our annual meeting. In the fall we conduct another round of conversations to discuss general governance issues and trends. We also discuss pressing matters on an ad hoc basis.  Our shareholder engagement activities help us identify governance and compensation policies and practices that are most important to our shareholders. 
The shareholder engagement team reports directly to the Corporate Governance Committee and other committees as needed, conveying the feedback received from shareholders and proposing implementation of best practices. The committees and the full Board of Directors deliberate over proposed governance changes, adopt best practices and provide guidance to the shareholder engagement team in their communications with shareholders. 
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Company held discussions with shareholders who collectively own or exercise voting control over 45% of the Company's outstanding shares. In addition, the Company routinely contacts shareholders who have submitted proposals for inclusion in our annual proxy statement, in an effort to understand their concerns and to address, where possible, the issues behind their proposals. We will continue to look for opportunities to provide more information about the Company's approach on topics of interest to shareholders, and to stimulate more conversations with shareholders.
Governance Highlights
The Board is committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders while operating in an ethical, legal, environmentally sensitive and socially responsible manner. The Board follows sound governance practices, some of which are highlighted below. For more detail, see the "Corporate Governance" section of this proxy statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ten of eleven director nominees, 91%, are independent; our Chairman & Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is the only management director. 
• All Board committees are composed exclusively of independent directors. 
• We have implemented a proxy access provision, which makes it possible for a group of shareholders meeting certain criteria to nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials a candidate for the Board. 
• We have a Lead Independent Director, elected by the independent members of the Board. The Lead Independent Director maintains final approval authority over Board agendas, meeting materials and schedules. The Lead Independent Director is also available for consultation and direct communication with large shareholders. 
• Independent directors met in executive sessions chaired by the Lead Independent Director at six of the seven 2018 Board meetings. 
• All of our directors are elected annually. 
• We have a majority vote requirement for uncontested director elections. 
• The Board and its committees conduct annual self-assessments. In addition, each independent director who has served for one year or more undergoes an annual peer review. 
• Our executive officers and directors are all subject to robust stock ownership requirements. 
• We have instituted anti-hedging policies applicable to all Company directors, officers and employees.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Board's Mission and Governance Guidelines recommend that the Board consider diversity of characteristics including experience, gender, race, ethnicity and age when evaluating nominees for the Board. 
• We limit our directors who are CEOs of public companies to a total of not more than three public company boards and all other directors to a total of not more than four public company boards. 
[END TABLE]
Performance Highlights
The Company continued to deliver on its objectives to provide strong earnings per share and dividend growth in 2018, while maintaining a strong balance sheet, employee engagement and improving customer service. Some highlights of the Company's 2018 performance include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieved 9.0% compound operating earnings per share growth during the five years ending in 2018 (see discussion of operating earnings on page 39). 
• Increased our dividend payment to $3.60 per share in 2018, representing a 7% increase over the dividend in 2017. 
• Provided our shareholders with a five-year total shareholder return of 196% (indexed with 2013 as the base year = 100%). 
• Delivered cash from operations of 2.7 billion in 2018. 
• Ranked second in residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest from J.D. Power for both electric and gas utilities. 
• Received Gallup Great Workplace Award for the sixth consecutive year. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Highlights
Our executive compensation programs are designed to be competitive with our peers, have a meaningful performance component linked to the achievement of short-term and long-term goals that align with our shareholders' long-term interests and encourage executives to have an ownership interest in the Company. Our Chairman and CEO's total compensation shows strong pay-for-performance alignment with growth in long-term shareholder value creation. Our CEO's compensation growth trend is consistent with the growth in value of a $100 investment in DTE Energy Company stock made at the beginning of 2013.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2016 2017 2018 
CEO Total Compensation ($000s) 12,499 15,836 10,987 
Total Shareholder Return (Indexed, Base Period 2013=100) 164.41 188.40 196.30 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      3 
[END TABLE]
The Company's compensation programs are also designed to clearly align performance objectives for our Named Executive Officers with the interests of shareholders and with our system of priorities. Our performance measures are designed to help move our Company toward achieving these priorities. For more details, see our priorities alignment chart in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis Summary on page 32.
Other highlights from our compensation program include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO received 67% of his 2018 total compensation in contingent, performance-based incentives. For our other Named Executive Officers, the average percentage of contingent, performance-based compensation was 57%. See more details on page 33. 
• Our short-term and long-term performance metrics all tie directly to our system of priorities (see above). These are the same metrics that management uses to assess the Company's progress toward our aspiration of becoming the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve. 
• Our long-term plan awards include a mix of restricted stock and performance shares designed in part to encourage executive stock ownership. The Board's Organization and Compensation Committee has not issued stock options since 2010. 
• Our equity compensation plan forbids buyouts of "underwater" stock options. The Company has never bought or repriced "underwater" stock options. 
• Our equity compensation plan requires a minimum one-year vesting period for equity awards. The Company's typical practice is to require a three-year vesting period for equity awards and the Company has never issued equity awards with less than a one-year vesting period. 
• Our Board has adopted a "clawback" policy that provides that, in the event of an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with federal securities laws, the Company may recover excess performance-based compensation awarded to current or former officers during the three-year period preceding the restatement. 
• Our executive Change-In-Control Severance Agreements do not include excise tax gross-ups. 
• We have eliminated the automatic vesting of equity issued under our Long-Term Incentive Plan upon a change in control of the Company, unless an acquiring or surviving entity fails to replace or affirm the existing equity awards with awards by the surviving company.

Corporate Governance
Governance Guidelines
At DTE Energy, we are committed to operating in an ethical, legal, environmentally sensitive and socially responsible manner, while creating long-term value for our shareholders. The foundation of our governance practices begins at the top, with the DTE Energy Board of Directors Mission and Guidelines ("Governance Guidelines"). The Governance Guidelines set forth the practices the Board follows with respect to Board composition and selection, Board meetings, the performance evaluation and succession planning for DTE Energy's Chief Executive Officer, Board committees, Board compensation and communicating with the Board, among other things. The Governance Guidelines are also intended to align the interests of directors and management with those of our shareholders. The following is a summary of the Governance Guidelines, along with other governance practices at DTE Energy.
Election of Directors and Vacancies
The Company has a declassified board of directors. Directors are elected annually for terms which expire upon election of their successor at the next year's annual shareholder meeting.
If a vacancy on the Board occurs between annual shareholder meetings, the vacancy may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office. The new director's term will expire upon election of their successor at the next year's annual shareholder meeting.
Under the Governance Guidelines, the Corporate Governance Committee periodically assesses the skills, characteristics and composition of the Board, along with the need for expertise and other relevant factors as it deems appropriate. In light of these assessments, and in light of the standards set forth in the Governance Guidelines, the Corporate Governance Committee may seek candidates with specific qualifications and candidates who satisfy other requirements set by the Board. We believe our Board should be comprised of directors who have had high-level executive experience, have been directors on other boards and have been tested through economic downturns and crises. Industry experience, regional relationships and broad diversity of experience and backgrounds are also factors in Board nominee selection. The Board's Governance Guidelines confirm that we believe it is desirable for Board members to possess diverse characteristics of gender, race, ethnicity and age, and we consider these factors in Board evaluation and in the identification of candidates for Board membership. We believe this type of composition enables the Board to oversee the management of the business and affairs of the Company effectively. Information about the skills, experiences and qualifications of our directors is included in their biographies beginning on page 6.
The Corporate Governance Committee considers candidates who have been properly nominated by shareholders, as well as candidates who have been identified by Board members and Company personnel. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee may use a search firm to assist in the search for candidates and nominees and to evaluate the nominees' skills against the Board's criteria. Based on its review of all candidates, the Corporate Governance Committee recommends a slate of director nominees for election at the annual meeting of shareholders. The slate of nominees may include both incumbent and new nominees.
Potential candidates are reviewed and evaluated by the Corporate Governance Committee, and selected candidates go on to be interviewed by one or more Corporate Governance Committee members. An invitation to join the Board is extended by the Board itself, through the Chairman and the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee.
During 2018, the Corporate Governance Committee screened director candidates and recommended to the Board that Valerie M. Williams be elected as a director. Ms. Williams was recommended as a potential candidate by an independent search firm. Ms. Williams was elected by the Board to serve for a term effective May 31, 2018 and expiring at the 2019 annual meeting.
Under our Bylaws, a group of up to 20 shareholders owning 3% or more of the Company's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three (3) years may nominate and include in the Company's proxy materials a candidate for the Board of Directors (a Shareholder Nominee), provided that the shareholder(s) and the nominee satisfy the requirements 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
12      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
specified in the Bylaws. The total number of Shareholder Nominees that the Company must include in the Company's proxy materials in a given year shall not exceed 20% of the number of directors in office at the time of the nomination.
Composition of the Board
Our Governance Guidelines and our Bylaws state that the exact size of the Board will be determined by resolution of the Board from time to time. Our Board currently has twelve members. As noted above, James B. Nicholson's retirement will be effective as of May 9, 2019, at which time the size of the Board will be reduced to eleven.
Director Independence and Categorical Standards
As a matter of policy and in accordance with New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") listing standards, we believe that the Board should consist of a majority of independent directors. The Board must affirmatively determine that a director has no material relationship with the Company, either directly or indirectly, or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. The Board has established the following categorical standards for director independence, which are more stringent than the NYSE independence standards for former Company executives:
A director for whom any of the following is true will not be considered independent:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A director who is currently, or has been at any time in the past, an employee of the Company or a subsidiary. 
• A director whose immediate family member is, or has been within the last three years, an executive officer of the Company. 
• A director who receives, or whose immediate family member receives, more than $120,000 in direct compensation from the Company during any twelve-month period within the last three years, other than director and committee fees and pension or other forms of deferred compensation for prior service (provided such compensation is not contingent in any way on continued service). 
• A director who is, or whose immediate family member is, a current partner of a firm that is the Company's internal or external auditor; the director is a current employee of such a firm; the immediate family member is a current employee of such a firm and personally works on the Company's audit; or the director or immediate family member was, within the last three years, a partner or employee of such a firm and personally worked on the Company's audit within that time. 
• A director who is employed, or whose immediate family member is employed, or has been employed within the last three years, as an executive officer of another company where any of the Company's present executives at the same time serves or served on that company's compensation committee. 
• A director who is a current employee, or whose immediate family member is a current executive officer, of a company that has made payments to, or received payments from, the Company for property or services in an amount which, in any of the last three fiscal years, exceeds the greater of $1 million or 2% of such other company's consolidated gross revenues is not independent until three years after the company falls below such threshold. 
[END TABLE]
Contributions by the Company to a tax-exempt organization will not be considered to be a material relationship that would impair a director's independence if a director serves as an executive officer of a tax-exempt organization and, within the preceding three years, contributions in any single fiscal year were less than $1 million or 2% of such tax-exempt organization's consolidated gross revenues (whichever is greater).
Applying these standards and considering all relevant facts and circumstances, the Board has affirmatively determined that all of our director nominees other than Gerard M. Anderson qualify as independent and have no material relationship with the Company. The independent directors are David A. Brandon, W. Frank Fountain, Jr., Charles G. McClure, Jr., Gail J. McGovern, Mark A. Murray, Ruth G. Shaw, Robert C. Scaggs, Jr., David A. Thomas, James H. Vandenberghe, and Valerie M. Williams. Mr. Anderson is not an independent director and may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company under the categorical standards. Mr. Anderson is not considered independent due to his current employment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. There were no material relationships that the Board considered when determining the independence of the directors other than Mr. Anderson.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      13 
[END TABLE]
Assessment of Board and Committee Performance
The Board evaluates its performance annually. In addition, each Board committee performs an annual self-assessment to determine its effectiveness. Each Board member also performs an intensive annual peer review of every other director who has served one year or more. The results of the Board and committee self-assessments are discussed with the Board and each committee, respectively. The results of the individual peer review are reviewed by the Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee and discussed with the Corporate Governance Committee. The Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee discusses the results of the peer review with individual directors, as directed by the Corporate Governance Committee.
Terms of Office
The Board has not established term limits for directors. We assure the independence and ongoing effectiveness of each independent director through the individualized peer assessment process described above, in which each Board member annually undergoes a rigorous evaluation by the other members. In addition, the Corporate Governance Committee of the Board has established policies that independent directors should not stand for election after attaining the age of 75, unless the Board waives this provision when circumstances exist which make it prudent to continue the service of the particular independent director. Directors who are retired CEOs of the Company or its subsidiaries shall not stand for election after attaining the age of 70. Except for the CEO, who may continue to serve as a director after retirement for so long as he is serving as Chairman, any other employees who are also directors will not stand for re-election after retiring from employment with the Company.
Election of the Chairman and the CEO; Lead Independent Director
Our Bylaws currently provide that the Chairman may simultaneously serve as the CEO of the Company and shall preside at all meetings of the Board. Our Bylaws also provide that the independent members of the Board may elect an independent director as Lead Independent Director, which has been our practice since 2004.
The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and shareholders for the Board to have flexibility in determining whether to separate or combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer based on the Company's circumstances. The Board has strong governance structures and processes in place to ensure the independence of the Board, eliminate conflicts of interest and prevent dominance of the Board by senior management. The Governance Guidelines and various committee charters provide for independent discussion among directors and for independent evaluation of, and communication with, many members of senior management.
The Board members have considerable experience and knowledge regarding the challenges and opportunities facing the Company and shareholders. The Board believes, therefore, that separating the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is unnecessary at this time. The Board believes that Mr. Anderson is well qualified through his experience and expertise to be the person who generally sets the agenda for (subject to the approval of the Lead Independent Director) and leads Board discussions of strategic issues for the Company. Nevertheless, the Board will separate these functions when it considers the separation to be in the best interests of the Company and shareholders.
With both the Chairman and CEO positions held by Mr. Anderson, the Board continues to believe a good governance practice is to elect a Lead Independent Director from the independent directors. The Lead Independent Director has such responsibilities as required under the NYSE listing standards, as well as such other responsibilities as determined by the Board. The Lead Independent Director serves in that capacity until replaced. There is no defined term of office, and the assignment does not rotate among the directors. On September 18, 2014, the Board unanimously elected James B. Nicholson to serve as Lead Independent Director. When Mr. Nicholson's retirement becomes effective on May 9, 2019, the Board will elect a new Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director's duties include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Calling regularly scheduled executive sessions; presiding at Board executive sessions of non-management directors or independent directors; and providing feedback regarding such sessions, as appropriate, to the Chairman and CEO; 
• Serving as the liaison between the Chairman and CEO and the independent directors; 
• Approving the general scope and type of information to be presented at Board meetings; 
• Reviewing shareholder communications addressed to the Board or to the Lead Independent Director;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Making himself or herself available if requested by major shareholders, for direct consultation and communication with shareholders; 
• Organizing Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman and presiding at any session of the Board where the Chairman is not present; 
• Designating one or more directors as alternate members of any committee to replace an absent or disqualified member at any committee meeting, provided that, in the event an alternate member is designated for the Audit, Corporate Governance or Organization and Compensation Committee, the designate meets the Company's categorical standards for director independence and SEC and NYSE requirements; 
• Consulting with the Chairman and CEO in the selection of topics to be discussed when developing the annual Board calendar; 
• Retaining independent advisors in consultation with the Board, on behalf of the Board as the Board determines to be necessary or appropriate; 
• Participating in the Organization and Compensation Committee's annual review and approval of the CEO's corporate goals and objectives and evaluation of the CEO's performance; 
• Approving Board meeting agendas after consulting with the Chairman and CEO and the Corporate Secretary; and 
• Collaborating with the Chairman and CEO and the Corporate Secretary on scheduling Board and committee meetings and approving the schedule of Board and Committee meetings. 
[END TABLE]
Board Meetings and Attendance
The Board met seven times in 2018. All of the incumbent directors attended at least 89% of the Board meetings and the meetings of the committees on which they served, six of whom had a 100% attendance record. The Board does not have a policy with regard to directors' attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders. All twelve directors standing for election at the 2018 annual meeting attended.
Executive Sessions
It is the Board's practice that the independent directors meet in executive session at most regular Board meetings and meet in executive session at other times whenever they believe it appropriate. The independent directors met in executive sessions (sessions without the Chairman and CEO or any representatives of management present) at six of the seven Board meetings in 2018. The independent directors meet in executive session on an annual basis to review the Organization and Compensation Committee's performance review of the CEO. The Lead Independent Director chairs the executive sessions of the independent directors.
Codes of Business Conduct and Ethics
The DTE Energy Board of Directors Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Officer Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the DTE Energy Way are the standards of behavior for Company directors, officers and employees. Any waiver of, or amendments to, the Board of Directors Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Officer Code of Business Conduct and Ethics as it pertains to the CEO, the Chief Financial Officer, senior financial officers and other Executive Officers, as defined in the "Security Ownership of Directors and Officers" section on page 25, will be disclosed promptly by posting such waivers or amendments on the Company website, dteenergy.com. There were no waivers or amendments during 2018.

Committees of the Board of Directors
The Board has standing committees for Audit, Corporate Governance, Finance, Nuclear Review, Organization and Compensation, and Public Policy and Responsibility. The Board committees act in an advisory capacity to the full Board, except that the Organization and Compensation Committee has direct responsibility for the CEO's goals, performance and compensation along with compensation of other executives, and the Audit Committee has direct responsibility for appointing, replacing, compensating and overseeing the independent registered public accounting firm. Each committee has adopted a charter that clearly establishes the committee's respective roles and responsibilities. In addition, each committee has authority to retain independent outside professional advisors or experts as it deems advisable or necessary, including the sole authority to retain and terminate any such advisors, to carry out its duties. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit, Corporate Governance, and Organization and Compensation Committees is independent under our categorical standards and that each member is free of any relationship that would interfere with his or her individual exercise of independent judgment. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee meets the independence requirements under the SEC rules and NYSE listing standards applicable to audit committee members. The Board has also determined that each member of the Organization and Compensation Committee meets the independence requirements under the SEC rules and NYSE listing standards applicable to compensation committee members.

Board of Directors Risk Oversight Functions
The Board receives, reviews and assesses reports from the Board committees and from management relating to enterprise-level risks. Each Board committee is responsible for overseeing and considering risk issues relating to their respective committee and reporting their assessments to the full Board at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. When granting authority to management, approving strategies and receiving management reports, the Board and committees consider, among other things, the risks we face.
Each Board committee reviews management's assessment of risk for that committee's respective area of responsibility. As part of its oversight function, the Board discusses any risk conflicts that may arise between the committees or assigns to a committee risk issues that may arise which do not fall within a specific committee's responsibilities.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Committee   Areas of Risk Oversight 
Audit Committee   Overall review of risk issues, policies and controls associated with our overall financial reporting and disclosure process and legal compliance, and review policies on risk control assessment and accounting risk exposure, as well as cybersecurity risk.  
Finance Committee   Review of financial, capital, credit and insurance risk. 
Organization and Compensation Committee   Assess and discuss with the Board the relationship between the inherent risks in executive compensation plans, executive compensation arrangements and executive performance goals and payouts, and how the level of risk corresponds to the Company's business strategies. 
Corporate Governance Committee   Review risks associated with the Company's governance practices and the interaction of the Company's governance with enterprise risk-level management. 
Nuclear Review Committee   Review risks relating to the operation of our nuclear power facilities. 
Public Policy and Responsibility Committee   Review risks associated with regulatory, social responsibility, political activity, economic conditions, reputation, safety and the environment. 
[END TABLE]
All Board committees meet periodically with members of senior management to discuss the relevant risks and challenges facing the Company. In addition to its regularly scheduled Committee meetings, the Audit Committee meets with the Chief Financial Officer, the General Auditor and the independent registered public accounting firm in executive sessions at least semi-annually, and meets with the General Counsel and the Chief Compliance Officer at least annually in separate executive sessions. The Company's General Auditor attends all Audit Committee meetings. The Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer meets annually with either the Audit Committee or the full Board to update the members on the Company's enterprise-level risk management. The General Auditor and the Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer also periodically meet with the other Board committees and the full Board as may be required.
The Company also utilizes an internal Risk Management Committee, chaired by the Chairman and CEO and comprised of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, General Counsel, Treasurer and Chief Risk Officer, General Auditor and other senior officers. Among other things, the internal Risk Management Committee directs the development and maintenance of comprehensive risk management policies and procedures, and sets, reviews and monitors risk limits on a regular basis for enterprise-level risks, counter-party credit and commodity-based exposures.
The Board believes that the committee structure of risk oversight is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Each committee member has expertise on risks relative to the nature of the committee on which he or she sits. With each committee reporting on risk issues at full Board meetings, the entire Board is in a position to assess the overall risk implications, to evaluate how they may affect the Company and to provide oversight on appropriate actions for management to take.
With regard to risk and compensation programs and policies, the Company's Energy Trading segment has compensation programs and policies that are structured differently from those in other units within the Company. These compensation programs and policies are designed to discourage excessive risk taking by the Energy Trading employees and are subject to specific written policies and procedures administered by members of the Company's senior management. The Company has determined that the Energy Trading compensation programs and policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Board of Directors Compensation
Elements of Director Compensation
Employee directors receive no payment for service as directors. The goal of our compensation policies for non-employee directors is to tie their compensation to your interests as shareholders. Accordingly, approximately 50% of a director's annual compensation is in the form of equity-based compensation, including phantom shares of our common stock. Generally, the compensation program for non-employee directors is reviewed on an annual basis by the Corporate Governance Committee and the Board. This review includes a review of a comparative peer group of companies that is identical to the peer group used to review executive compensation (See "Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 31). Based on its December 2018 review, the Board made no modifications to the existing compensation program.

Annual equity compensation   A variable number of phantom shares of DTE Energy common stock valued at $130,000 annually, with the actual number of phantom shares to be granted each year determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the first business day of each calendar year(1) 
(1) Phantom shares of DTE Energy common stock are credited to each non-employee director's account in January of each year. Phantom share accounts are also credited with dividend equivalents which are reinvested into additional phantom shares. For phantom shares granted after 2004, payment of the cash value is made three years after the date of grant unless otherwise deferred by voluntary election of the director. For phantom shares granted before 2005, payment of the cash value occurs only after the date a director terminates his or her service on the Board. 
[END TABLE]
Payment of Non-Employee Director Fees and Expenses
Retainers for non-employee directors are either (i) payable in cash or (ii) at the election of the director, deferred into an account pursuant to the DTE Energy Company Plan for Deferring the Payment of Directors' Fees. Non-employee directors may defer up to 100% of their annual retainer into an unfunded deferred compensation plan. Deferred fees may accrue for future payment, with interest accrued monthly at the 5-year U.S. Treasury Bond rate as of the last business day of each month or, at the election of the director, they may be invested in phantom shares of our common stock with all dividend equivalents reinvested.
In addition to the retainers, non-employee directors are reimbursed for their travel expenses incurred in attending Board and committee meetings, along with reimbursement for fees and expenses incurred when attending director education seminars or special meetings requested by management. Non-employee directors of the Company, along with full-time active employees and retirees, are also eligible to participate in the DTE Energy matching gift program, whereby the DTE Energy Foundation matches certain charitable contributions.

Director Life Insurance
The Company provides each non-employee director with group term life insurance in the amount of $20,000 and travel accident insurance in the amount of $100,000.
Director Stock Ownership
We have established stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors to more closely tie their interests to those of shareholders. Under these guidelines, the Board requires that each director own shares of the Company's common stock beginning no later than 30 days after election to the Board. In addition, directors are required to own, within five years after initial election to the Board, shares of Company stock having a value equal to two times the sum of a director's annual cash retainer plus the value of a director's annual phantom stock compensation. Based on the 2018 director compensation program, a director with five years of service will be required to hold a minimum of $500,000 in stock under these guidelines. This ownership requirement is greater than four times the amount of a director's cash retainer under the 2019 compensation program. Common stock, time-based restricted stock and phantom shares held by a director are counted toward fulfillment of this ownership requirement. As of December 31, 2018, all directors met the initial common stock ownership requirement and all those directors who have served as a director for at least five years after their initial election fulfilled the five-year requirement.

Prohibition on Pledging and Hedging Company Securities
The Company maintains policies which expressly prohibit hedging Company securities by all employees, executive officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. For purposes of these policies, hedging includes purchases and sales of derivatives or any monetization transaction involving DTE securities that has the effect of limiting or eliminating the full risks of ownership of DTE securities. Our directors and officers are also prohibited from pledging their shares of Company stock as collateral for any loan or indebtedness. This prohibition includes, but is not limited to, holding such shares in a margin account.
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and certain 10% shareholders (if any) to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with respect to our securities with the SEC and to furnish copies of these reports to us. We reviewed the filed reports and written representations from our directors and executive officers regarding the necessity of filing reports.
Based upon our review, all of our current executive officers' and directors' required Section 16 filings during 2018 were filed on a timely basis.

Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Related-person transactions have the potential to create actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Company has policies in place to address related-party transactions. In addition, our Corporate Governance Committee and Audit Committee review potential dealings or transactions with related parties. In conducting such reviews, the committees consider various factors they deem appropriate, which may include (i) the identity of the related party and his or her relationship to the Company, (ii) the nature and size of the transaction, including whether it involved the provision of goods or services to the Company that are unavailable from unrelated third parties and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available from unrelated third parties, (iii) the nature and size of the related party's interest in the transaction, (iv) the benefits to the Company of the transaction and (v) whether the transaction could involve an apparent or actual conflict of interest with the Company.
In general, employees and directors may not be involved in a business transaction where there is a conflict of interest with the Company. The DTE Energy Way requires non-officer employees to report conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to their respective superiors; the Officer Code of Conduct and Ethics requires officers to report conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to the Company's General Counsel or to the Company's Board of Directors; and the Board of Directors Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires directors to disclose conflicts of interest or potential conflicts of interest to the Company's Corporate Governance Committee or the Chairman of the Board. For directors and officers, any waivers of the Company's conflict of interest policy must be approved by the Board or a Board committee, as required under the Officer Code of Conduct and Ethics or Board of Directors Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, disclosed to shareholders and posted to our website at dteenergy.com/ethics.
Proposal No. 2 — Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Subject to ratification by the shareholders, the Audit Committee has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and to perform other audit-related services. Following the Audit Committee's appointment, the Board voted unanimously to recommend that our shareholders vote to ratify the Audit Committee's selection of PwC as our independent auditors for 2019.
The reports of PwC on the consolidated financial statements of DTE Energy for the year ended December 31, 2018 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 did not contain adverse opinions or a disclaimer of opinions and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.
During the Company's two most recent fiscal years, ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and from January 1, 2019 through February 7, 2019, there were no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to PwC's satisfaction, would have caused PwC to make reference to the subject matter of such disagreements in connection with its reports on the Company's consolidated financial statements for such years.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Consistent with SEC policies regarding the independence of the registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee is responsible for appointing, approving professional service fees of, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has established a policy regarding pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm.
Prior to engaging the independent registered public accounting firm to perform specific services, the Audit Committee pre-approves these services by category of service. The Audit Committee may delegate to the Chair of the Audit Committee, or to one or more other designated members of the Audit Committee, the authority to grant pre-approvals of all permitted services or classes of these permitted services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm up to, but not exceeding, a pre-defined limit. The decisions of the designated member to pre-approve a permitted service are reported to the Audit Committee at each scheduled meeting. At least quarterly, the Audit Committee reviews:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A report summarizing the services, or groupings of related services, including fees, provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
• A listing of new services requiring pre-approval, if any. 
• As appropriate, an updated projection for the current fiscal year, presented in a manner consistent with the proxy disclosure requirements, of the estimated annual fees to be paid to the independent registered public accounting firm. 
[END TABLE]
All audit, audit-related, tax and other services performed by PwC were pre-approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with the regulations of the SEC. The Audit Committee considered and determined that the provision of the non-audit services by PwC during 2018 was compatible with maintaining independence of the registered public accounting firm.

Report of the Audit Committee
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board's oversight of the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence and the performance of the Company's internal audit function. All members of the Audit Committee meet the criteria for independence as defined in our categorical standards and the audit committee independence requirements under the SEC rules. The Audit Committee Charter also complies with requirements of the NYSE.
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including the system of internal controls, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). Management is also responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing these consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with GAAP. The independent registered public accounting firm is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes, acting in an oversight capacity, and the Audit Committee does not certify the consolidated financial statements or internal control over financial reporting or guarantee the independent registered public accounting firm's reports. The Audit Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it including representations made by management and the reports of the independent registered public accounting firm.
The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by audit standards, SEC regulations and NYSE requirements.

Proposal No. 3 — Advisory Proposal — Nonbinding Vote to Approve Executive Compensation
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires the Company to provide shareholders with an opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" ("CD&A") section of this proxy statement and in the tabular and narrative disclosure regarding Named Executive Officer compensation, all contained under the heading "Executive Compensation" in this proxy statement.
The Company's executive compensation program is designed to include elements of cash and equity-based compensation to motivate and reward executives who achieve short-term and long-term corporate and financial objectives leading to the success of the Company. We emphasize competitive, performance-based compensation to attract and retain talented executives and align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. At each of the 2018 and 2017 annual meetings, 94.6% and 94.8%, respectively, of voting shareholders approved the compensation of the Named Executive Officers.
Shareholders have in the past approved the incentive plans that we use to motivate and reward our executives, including the Annual Incentive Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition, the Company has enhanced our disclosures related to executive compensation to provide more detail to our shareholders about our compensation programs, including expanded disclosures relating to these plans in this proxy statement.
Our executive compensation programs have been important in driving the Company's success in achieving its corporate and financial objectives by tying executive compensation to achieving very specific goals in each of our key priority areas. Progress against these objectives is necessary for the Company to achieve its ultimate goal of becoming the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve. We explain each of our performance targets and measures in detail in our CD&A, but a few examples of Company success in areas related to our targets and measures include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieved 9.0% compound operating earnings per share growth during the five years ending 2018 (see discussion of operating earnings on page 39). 
• Increased our dividend payment to $3.60 per share in 2018, representing a 9% increase over the dividend in 2017. 
• Provided our shareholders with a five-year total shareholder return of 196% (indexed with 2013 as the base year = 100%). 
• Delivered cash from operations of 2.7 billion in 2018. 
• Ranked second in residential customer satisfaction in the Midwest from J.D. Power for both electric and gas utilities. 
• Received Gallup Great Workplace Award for the sixth consecutive year. 
[END TABLE]
Each of these accomplishments is related to a specific performance goal in our short- or long-term compensation programs, which in turn support the Company's aspiration of becoming the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve.
The Organization and Compensation Committee ("O&C Committee") employs the highest standards of corporate governance when implementing and reviewing our executive compensation programs. The O&C Committee ensures independence of committee members and compensation consultants, avoids conflicts of interest and has enhanced shareholder disclosure in accordance with SEC and NYSE requirements.
For these reasons, the Board recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the overall executive compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers of the Company, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the tabular and narrative disclosure regarding Named Executive Officer compensation contained in this proxy statement."

Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company or the Board. The O&C Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL 
TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Executive Summary
The Company believes in executive compensation that is competitive with our peers, has a meaningful performance component and has equity-based elements to encourage executives to maintain an appropriate ownership interest in the Company. Our performance-based compensation programs result in a majority of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (as identified below) being linked to the achievement of a combination of short-term and long-term Company and personal goals and shareholder value creation.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Elements of Compensation   How this Element Serves the Company's Objectives 
Base Salary   Provides a stable, fixed source of income that reflects an executive's job responsibilities, experience, value to the Company and demonstrated performance.   We target median base salaries for our peer group, taking into account differences in company size within the peer group.

Annual Incentive Awards   Intended to compensate individuals yearly based on the achievement of specific near-term, annual goals, which are established at the beginning of each year and approved by the O&C Committee.   The Board and management have identified several priority areas that management and the Board discuss regularly when reviewing Company performance. Our performance measures for annual incentive awards are the measurements that the Board uses to track progress in these key priority areas. Achievement of these performance objectives is a critical measure of the Company's progress towards its goal of becoming the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve.

Pay for Performance Alignment
The Company's compensation programs are designed to clearly align performance objectives for our Named Executive Officers with the interests of shareholders and with management's system of priorities. (See image of system of priorities on page 1.) Our Company's aspiration is to be the best-operated energy company in North America and a force for growth and prosperity in the communities where we live and serve. We follow a system of priorities to achieve this objective, and our performance measures are designed to help move our Company towards achieving these priorities. The following table demonstrates how our annual and long-term performance measures map to our system of priorities.

CEO Total Actual Compensation for 2018: Fixed vs. At-Risk
Our pay mix puts a high weight on performance-based compensation. This means that the majority of compensation is variable and will go up or down based on company performance. For 2018, 67% of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's compensation was performance-based or "at risk."
Overview
Your understanding of our executive compensation program is important to us. The goal of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis is to explain:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation philosophy and objectives for executives of the Company, including our Named Executive Officers; 
• The roles of our O&C Committee and management in the executive compensation process; 
• The key components of the executive compensation program; and 
• The decisions we make in the compensation process that align with our philosophy and objectives. 
[END TABLE]
Throughout this proxy statement, the term "Named Executive Officers" means: (1) the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Gerard M. Anderson; (2) the Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Peter B. Oleksiak; (3) the President and Chief Operating Officer—DTE Electric, Trevor F. Lauer; (4) the Vice Chairman and Chief Administrative Officer, David E. Meador; and (5) the President and Chief Operating Officer, Gerardo Norcia. In addition, the term "executive" includes the Named Executive Officers, other key employees of the Company as designated by management from time to time and Executive Officers as defined by the Exchange Act.
Philosophy and Objectives
Our executive compensation philosophy is to motivate and reward executives who achieve short-term and long-term corporate and financial objectives leading to the success of the Company. We will continue to emphasize performance-based compensation for results that are consistent with shareholder and customer interests. The main objectives underlying this philosophy are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation must be competitive in order to attract and retain talented executives — data from peer group companies are taken into consideration when analyzing our compensation practices and levels;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      33 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation should have a meaningful performance component — a portion of an executive's total compensation opportunity is linked to predefined short-term and long-term corporate and financial objectives along with an executive's individual performance; and  
• Compensation must include equity-based elements to encourage executives to have an ownership interest in the Company. 
[END TABLE]
Role of the Organization and Compensation Committee
The Board has a long-standing process for determining executive compensation that is performance-based, objective and transparent. The process is designed to serve the purpose of recruiting, retaining and motivating executives for the benefit of shareholders and customers. The Board delegates to the O&C Committee the responsibility to determine and approve the CEO's compensation, and to approve the compensation of certain other executives. The O&C Committee makes all decisions regarding compensation for the Named Executive Officers. Although the responsibilities have been delegated, the entire Board maintains oversight and receives direct reports after each O&C Committee meeting.
The O&C Committee is composed entirely of independent directors, none of whom derives a personal benefit from the compensation decisions the O&C Committee makes. Generally, the O&C Committee is responsible for our executive compensation programs throughout the enterprise (including subsidiaries). The O&C Committee responsibilities are more fully detailed in its charter, which is available at dteenergy.com/governance. The O&C Committee continually monitors the executive compensation program and adopts changes to reflect the dynamic marketplace in which we compete for talent. To the extent necessary, the O&C Committee also works with other Board committees to review or approve reports, awards and other matters relating to compensation. For example, the Finance Committee reviews the financial components of performance measures and metrics, the Corporate Governance Committee assists in the review of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the Audit Committee reviews the internal controls over the data reported herein.
The O&C Committee uses information from several external sources to monitor and achieve an executive compensation program that supports our business goals and attracts executives whose performance will be measured against those goals. Independent outside consultants and external information enable the O&C Committee to maintain impartial decision-making regarding performance and pay. The O&C Committee annually reviews each component of the Named Executive Officers' compensation and is advised directly by the outside compensation consulting firm, discussed in further detail below, in connection with such review. Based on input from its consultant and from management and based on a review of competitive data from peer group companies (as discussed below), the O&C Committee believes that the current structure is appropriately balanced and competitive to accomplish the important tasks of recruiting, retaining and motivating talented executives in the energy industry in which we compete.
The O&C Committee also reviews and considers the results from the most recent shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. At the 2018 and 2017 annual meetings, 94.6% and 94.8%, respectively, of voting shareholders approved the compensation of the Named Executive Officers. As part of our shareholder engagement program, we seek feedback from shareholders about our compensation practices. 
Independent Review of Compensation Program
The O&C Committee directly employs an outside consulting firm to advise the O&C Committee on various executive compensation matters, including current compensation trends, and provide objective recommendations as to the design of our executive compensation program. During 2018, the O&C Committee engaged two compensation consultants who reported directly to the O&C Committee. For the period of January 1, 2018 through June 19, 2018, the O&C Committee engaged the services of Mercer Human Resources Consulting LLC ("Mercer HR"), a subsidiary of Marsh & McClennan Companies, Inc., and for the period of June 20, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the O&C Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners LLC ("Meridian"). Use of an outside consultant is an important component of the compensation setting process, as it enables the O&C Committee to make informed decisions based on market data and practices. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

34      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
The respective representatives from each outside consulting firm, both of whom are considered leading professionals in the compensation field, attended O&C Committee meetings, met with Committee members in executive session, consulted with the members as required and provided input with regard to the CEO's compensation and performance.
Mercer HR served as the O&C Committee's outside consultant from 2002 until June 19, 2018. The O&C Committee has determined Mercer HR to be an independent consultant. Mercer HR has no affiliations with any of the Named Executive Officers or members of the Board other than in its role as an outside consultant. The lead consultant and partner in charge for Mercer HR, who provided executive compensation consulting services to the O&C Committee, did not provide any other services to the Company. To help ensure that the consultant maintained the highest level of independence from the Company, all work performed by Mercer HR and its affiliates (a) which fell outside the scope of work performed for the O&C Committee on executive compensation matters, and (b) which had a total cost of $750,000 or greater, required pre-approval by the O&C Committee based upon the recommendation of management.
In 2018, we paid Mercer HR $39,327. In addition, in 2018 the Company paid $90,000 for services unrelated to human resources consulting to affiliates of Mercer HR. In 2018, the O&C Committee followed its process to pre-approve certain work awarded to affiliates of Mercer HR.
Effective June 20, 2018, Meridian began serving as the O&C Committee's outside consultant. The O&C Committee has determined Meridian to be an independent consultant with no affiliations with any of the Named Executive Officers or members of the Board separate its role as an outside consultant. The lead consultant and partner in charge for Meridian, who provided executive compensation consulting services to the O&C Committee, did not provide any other services to the Company.
In 2018, the Company paid $41,763.06 to Meridian for services related to the O&C Committee. The Company did not engage Meridian or its affiliates for any other services.
Management's Role
Our management works closely with the O&C Committee in the executive compensation process. Excluding the CEO's compensation, management's responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recommending performance measures and metrics that are formulated based on our corporate strategy and priorities; 
• Reporting executive performance evaluations; 
• Recommending base salary levels and other compensation, including equity awards; and 
• Recommending appointment of executives. 
[END TABLE]
The CEO's compensation is determined solely by the O&C Committee, which bases its decisions on performance and market studies along with participation and recommendations from its independent outside consultant. 
Compensation and Peer Group Assessment
Each component of executive compensation (see "Key Components of Executive Compensation" below) is compared, measured and evaluated against a peer group of companies. The O&C Committee approves the peer group and periodically reviews and updates the companies included in that group.
The most recent peer group was approved by the O&C Committee in June 2018. That peer group, which is applicable for 2018, consisted of the companies listed below. Most of these companies, along with DTE Energy, participate in the same independent compensation surveys. The surveys provide data needed for accurate compensation comparisons. The peer group consists primarily of utilities (including utility holding companies), broad-based energy companies, and significant non-energy companies selected on the basis of revenues, financial strength, geographic location and availability of compensation information. The O&C Committee reviews the peer group data when making compensation decisions relating to the Named Executive Officers and the Company's mix of compensation components.
Management also retains an external consulting firm to conduct a market study covering compensation practices for similar positions in the peer group. The most recent market study was completed in October 2018 by Aon, whose

Key Components of Executive Compensation
The key components of the compensation program include the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary 
• Annual and Long-Term Incentives 
• Pension and Deferred Compensation 
• Post-Termination Agreements (Severance and Change-In-Control) 
[END TABLE]
While the programs and pay levels reflect differences in job responsibilities, the structure of the compensation and benefits program is applied consistently to our Named Executive Officers, including the CEO. Differences in compensation between the CEO and the other Named Executive Officers are due, in part, to an analysis of peer group benchmark data, as well as differences in the responsibilities of each Named Executive Officer. We review each element of total compensation, both individually and on a combined basis, for each Named Executive Officer and make adjustments as appropriate based on these comparisons. The following is a more detailed discussion of the components of the Company's executive compensation program:
Base Salary
The objective of base salary is to provide a stable, fixed source of income that reflects an executive's job responsibilities, experience, value to the Company, and demonstrated performance. When setting individual base salary levels, we consider several factors, including (i) the market reference point for the executive's position, (ii) the responsibilities of the executive's position, (iii) the experience and performance of the executive, and (iv) retention issues. Market reference points target the median for most positions, adjusted to take into account differences in company size within the peer group. In addition, we establish midpoints for each executive group level for determining base salary for those executives whose jobs cannot be easily matched in the marketplace. These midpoints are consistent with the market reference points for other executives in the same executive group. We review these midpoints annually to ensure they are consistent with the market and make salary adjustments, when appropriate.
[BEGIN TABLE]

36      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
Annual and Long-Term Incentives
We have two primary types of incentives that reward executives for performance. The incentives are designed to tie compensation to performance and encourage executives to align their interests with those of the shareholders and customers of the Company. Our annual incentives allow us to reward executives with annual cash bonuses for performance against pre-established objectives based on work performed in the prior year. Our long-term incentives allow us to grant executives long-term equity incentives to encourage continued employment with DTE Energy, to accomplish pre-defined long-term performance objectives and to create shareholder alignment.
We believe the current mix among base salary, annual incentives, and long-term incentives is appropriately set to provide market-competitive compensation when Company performance warrants. The mix is more heavily weighted toward incentive compensation at higher executive levels within DTE Energy. The interplay between the annual incentives and the long-term incentives provides a balance to motivate executives to achieve our business goals and objectives and to properly reward executives for the achievement of such goals and objectives.
The Board has implemented a "clawback" policy enabling the Company to recover some or all of the performance-based compensation awarded to current or former executives. Under the policy, if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with federal securities laws, and the O&C Committee determines it appropriate, the Company may recover from any current or former executive any previously awarded performance-based compensation the executive received (including awards under the Annual Incentive Plan, the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Executive Performance Plan) in excess of performance-based compensation that would have been awarded under the restatement. This "clawback" would apply to performance-based compensation during the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement, in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Annual Incentives
The objective of the annual incentives is to compensate individuals yearly based on the achievement of specific annual goals and tie compensation to near-term performance. Annual incentive awards are paid to our executives under the DTE Energy Annual Incentive Plan ("Annual Incentive Plan"). The O&C Committee sets individual performance measures, metrics and targets for the Named Executive Officers for each year using the measure, metrics, targets and procedures described below, and the Named Executive Officer's performance against those measures, metrics and targets is considered when the O&C Committee determines the officer's annual incentive award under the Annual Incentive Plan for that year.
Under the terms of the Annual Incentive Plan, participating executives and other select employees may receive annual cash awards based on performance compared against pre-established Company and business unit objectives. Objectives that management proposes are reviewed and approved or revised by the O&C Committee, with financial goal recommendations reviewed by the Board's Finance Committee, usually within the first 90 days of the performance period. The objectives include performance measures in several categories that are critical to our success. When setting these objectives, management and the O&C Committee determine the elements of our business that require the focused attention of the executives. The weights, which can change from year to year, are determined based on the Company's key priorities and areas of focus for the upcoming year. The final awards, if any, are paid after the O&C Committee approves the final results of each objective.
The amount of an executive's Annual Incentive Plan award is determined as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's most recent year-end base salary is multiplied by an Annual Incentive Plan target percentage to arrive at the target award. 
• The overall performance payout percentage, which can range from 0% to 175%, is determined based on final results compared to threshold, target and maximum levels for each objective. 
• The target award is then multiplied by the performance payout percentage to arrive at the pre-adjusted calculated award. 
• The pre-adjusted calculated award is then adjusted by an individual performance modifier (assessment of an individual executive's achievements for the year), which can range from 0% to 150%, to arrive at the final award. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      37 
[END TABLE]
Each objective has a threshold, target and maximum level. The Company or relevant business unit must attain a minimum level of achievement for an objective before any compensation is payable with respect to that objective. The minimum established level of each objective will result in a payout of 25% of target and the maximum established for each level (or better) will result in a payment of 175% of target.
The operating earnings per share and cash flow measures were chosen as indicators of the Company's financial strength. The customer satisfaction, employee engagement and safety performance and effectiveness measures were selected to make the Company more responsive to our customers' needs and to make the Company a safer and better place to work. For Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak, Meador and Norcia, the Utility Operating Excellence measures were chosen as representative of (a) electric generation and distribution reliability and (b) gas system reliability, gas system availability and the pace of gas system improvements. For Mr. Lauer, the DTE Electric Operating Excellence measures were chosen as representative of electric generation and distribution reliability. 
For 2018, the performance objectives and the related weightings, thresholds, targets, maximums and results for calculating the Named Executive Officers' pre-adjusted annual incentive award amounts were as follows.

The aggregate weighted payment percentage for the pre-adjusted calculated award was 119.67% for Mr. Lauer.
The pre-adjusted awards are adjusted by an individual performance modifier for each of the Named Executive Officers. Individual performance criteria are set at the beginning of each calendar year for each of the Named Executive Officers. For 2018, qualitative criteria include, as applicable, leadership performance, overall operational performance, employee engagement and customer performance, diversity and inclusion, continuous operational improvements and other appropriate operating measures. The O&C Committee evaluates the individual performance of each of the Named Executive Officers and approves an adjustment to the annual award based on the individual contribution and performance. The individual performance modifier adjusts a Named Executive Officer's annual cash bonus such that the Named Executive Officer's actual cash bonus ranges between zero and 150% of the pre-adjusted calculated award. For 2018, the individual performance modifiers for the Named Executive Officers ranged from 115% to 120%.
Long-Term Incentives
Long-term incentives provide the O&C Committee the ability to align programs that focus on our long-term performance over a three-year period, with the objective of aligning executives' interests with those of our shareholders. Our principles for ownership of stock, discussed on page 46, ensure that the executives and other employees have a vested interest in the long-term financial health, management and success of the Company.
The long-term incentives are awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan and reward executives and other employees with stock-based compensation.
Named Executive Officers are eligible to receive restricted stock, performance shares, performance units, stock options or a combination of these awards. Since the creation of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, we have granted only performance shares, time-based restricted stock and nonqualified stock options. However, the O&C Committee has not granted stock options under the Long-Term Incentive Plan since 2010. Executives receive long-term incentive grants based upon a target percentage of base salary. The targeted award levels for the Named Executive Officers for 2018 were as follows: Mr. Anderson, 485% of base salary; Mr. Oleksiak, 250% of base salary; Mr. Lauer, 210% of base salary; Mr. Meador, 240% of base salary; and Mr. Norcia, 350% of base salary. In addition to the targeted award levels, the O&C Committee also considers previous years' grants, career potential and retention issues in determining the final number of awards granted.
The value of each element of these long-term incentive grants for 2018 was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Performance Shares    Approximately 70% 
Restricted Stock    Approximately 30% 
[END TABLE]
This mix was designed to provide a balance of incentives to executives for creating long-term shareholder value through strong financial and operating performance and to align executive interests with shareholder interests.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Shares Granted in 2018:     In 2018, performance shares represented approximately 70% of the overall long-term incentive grant value. Granting of performance shares allows us to tie long-term performance objectives with creating shareholder value. Performance shares entitle the executive to receive a specified number of shares, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of the shares, or a combination of the two, in the plan administrator's discretion, depending on the level of achievement of performance measures. The performance measurement period for the 2018 grants is January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. Payments earned under the 2018 grants and the related performance measures are described in footnote 2 to the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards" table on page 50. In the event a participant retires (age 65 or age 55 or older with at least 10 years of

service), dies or becomes disabled, the participant or beneficiary retains the right to a pro-rated number of the performance shares that would otherwise have been payable based upon actual results for the entire performance period. In the event employment terminates for any other reason, the participant forfeits all rights to any outstanding performance shares. In June 2009, the O&C Committee decided that, beginning with the 2010 performance share grants, dividends or dividend equivalents would not be paid on unvested or unearned performance shares. During the period beginning on the date the performance shares are awarded and ending on the certification date of the performance objectives, the number of performance shares awarded will be increased, assuming full dividend reinvestment at the fair market value on the dividend payment date. The cumulative number of performance shares will be adjusted to determine the final payment based on the performance objectives as certified by the Committee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Shares Paid in 2018:     The performance shares granted in 2015 were paid in early 2018. The payout amounts were based upon performance measures, each of which was weighted to reflect its importance to the total calculation. The Company had to attain a minimum level for each measure before any compensation was payable with respect to that measure. The minimum established level of each measure would have resulted in a payout of 50% of target, and an established maximum (or better) for each level would have resulted in a payout of 200% of target. The payout amount was based upon the following performance measures (and related weighting):

The peer group for the performance shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive Plan, as approved by the O&C Committee, consists of the companies set forth below. These companies were selected because of a combination of the following: (1) their operations being largely regulated; (2) their size (based on market capitalization); and (3) their business strategies being similar to those of DTE Energy. In creating this peer group, the Company started with 55 national public utilities with market capitalization above $1.5 billion. The Company then focused on companies with value concentrated in regulated electric and gas with at least 50% in regulated electric, and eliminated companies with large merchant and/or other non-regulated exposure as well as those overly concentrated in gas midstream. In addition, companies that were in the process of being acquired were also eliminated. The O&C Committee reviews and approves this peer group annually.

Total shareholder return compared to the Peer Group is the primary measure because it reflects how well our Company has performed on total return to its shareholders relative to the total shareholder returns of similar companies.
As displayed above, the 2018 payout levels approved by the O&C Committee were 114.4% for Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak, Meador and Norcia and 116.8% for Mr. Lauer. Payouts for the NEOs under the Long-Term Incentive Plan for 2016 and 2017 ranged from 92.6% to 163.2%.

• Restricted Stock:    The restricted stock grants are time-based and generally include a three-year vesting period. The granting of restricted stock allows us to grant executives long-term equity incentives to encourage continued employment. In 2018, restricted stock was granted, representing approximately 30% of the overall Long-Term Incentive Plan grant value, with the restriction period ending on January 31, 2021. The three-year vesting period focuses on long-term value creation and executive retention. The three-year vesting period requires continued employment throughout the restriction period. In the event a participant retires (age 65 or age 55 or older with at least 10 years of service), dies or becomes disabled, the participant or beneficiary retains the right to a pro-rated number of restricted shares. In the event employment terminates for any other reason, the participant forfeits all rights to any outstanding restricted shares. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options:    The O&C Committee has not granted stock options under the Long-Term Incentive Plan since 2010. In 2010, nonqualified stock options represented approximately 20% of the overall Long-Term Incentive Plan grant value. The granting of stock options allowed us to grant executives long-term equity incentives that align long-term performance with creating shareholder value. These stock options have a ten-year exercise period and vest one-third on each anniversary of the grant date over a three-year period. The stock option exercise price is based on the closing price on the date the options are granted. In the event a participant retires (age 65 or age 55 or older with at least 10 years of service) or becomes disabled, the participant retains the rights to all outstanding vested and unvested stock options in accordance with the original terms of the grant. In the event a participant dies, the beneficiary has three years from the date of death to exercise the stock options. In the event employment terminates for any other reason, the participant forfeits all rights to any unvested stock options and has 90 days to

Pension and Deferred Compensation
Pension Benefits
Substantially all non-represented employees hired prior to 2012, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in our tax-qualified pension plan, the DTE Energy Company Retirement Plan. Named Executive Officers are also eligible to participate in our nonqualified pension plans, the DTE Energy Company Supplemental Retirement Plan and the DTE Energy Company Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan.
Deferred Compensation 
Substantially all employees, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to participate in one of our tax-qualified 401(k) plans. The Named Executives Officers participate in the DTE Energy Company Savings and Stock Ownership Plan. Our Named Executive Officers are also eligible to participate in our nonqualified 401(k) plan, the DTE Energy Company Supplemental Savings Plan. 
Providing supplemental pension and deferred compensation benefits for our executives is in keeping with our philosophy and objectives to attract and retain talented executives. The Pension Benefits Table and related footnotes beginning on page 52 describe both the tax-qualified and nonqualified pension benefits for which certain executives are eligible and which are commonly offered by other employers in our peer group. 
For further description of the nonqualified supplemental pension and deferred compensation benefits, see "Pension Benefits" beginning on page 52.
Executive Benefits
We provide executives with certain benefits generally not available to our other employees as a matter of competitive practice and as a retention tool. The O&C Committee periodically reviews the level of benefits provided to executives against a peer group to ensure they are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation objectives.
We provide a cash allowance to certain executives in lieu of executive benefits typically provided by other companies. The executive is permitted to use the allowance as he or she deems appropriate. Although the allowance is taxable for income tax purposes, it is not considered as compensation for any Company incentive or benefit program.
During 2018, we provided various benefits for a limited number of officers that included the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Security driver for business: Based on our executive security policies and a security risk assessment by the Company's chief security officer, the Board requires Mr. Anderson to use a Company car and security driver while on Company business. The Company has also provided Mr. Norcia with a Company car and security driver to use while on Company business. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate aircraft for limited business travel: We lease a fractional share of an aircraft for limited business travel by executives and other employees when there is an appropriate business purpose. Personal use of the aircraft is not allowed except in unusual circumstances and requires the prior approval of the CEO. During 2018, there was no personal use of the corporate aircraft by any executive. 
[END TABLE]

Post-Termination Agreements
We have entered into indemnification agreements and change-in-control agreements with each of the Named Executive Officers and certain other executives. The indemnification agreements require that we indemnify these individuals for certain liabilities to which they may become subject as a result of their affiliation with the Company. The change-in-control agreements are intended to provide continuity of management in the event there is a change in control of the Company and to align executive and shareholder interests in support of corporate transactions. The important terms of, and the potential payments provided under, the change-in-control agreements are described beginning on page 56.
Stock Ownership Policy
Our principles for ownership of stock ensure that the executives and other employees have a vested interest in the financial health, management and success of the Company. We expect most executives and certain other employees to own, within five years of their appointment to such position, shares of our stock having a value equal to a multiple of their annual base salary. Common stock, time-based restricted stock, phantom stock and unvested performance shares (assuming achievement of target levels of performance) are counted toward the fulfillment of this ownership requirement. The following are the requirements for the Named Executive Officers: (i) for Mr. Anderson, five times his base salary; (ii) for Messrs. Meador and Norcia, four times their respective base salary; and (iii) for Messrs. Lauer and Oleksiak, three times their respective base salary. Other executives and employees may be required to hold from one to three times their base salaries as determined by their executive group level within the Company. As of December 31, 2018, 100% of the Named Executive Officers and all of the other required employees who have served in their position for at least five years have met the stock ownership guidelines.
Internal Revenue Code Limits on Deductibility of Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 places an annual limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation we can deduct as a business expense on our federal income tax return with respect to each "covered employee." Statutory changes to Section 162(m) effective for compensation paid after December 31, 2017 significantly reduced the Company's ability to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million paid to each "covered employee."
Performance-Based Compensation Exception
For compensation paid before January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) provided an exception to the $1 million limit for compensation that was (i) based on performance and (ii) paid under a program that meets Internal Revenue Code requirements. This exception was generally repealed for compensation paid after December 31, 2017.
The DTE Energy Executive Performance Plan ("Executive Performance Plan"), the material terms of which were approved by shareholders at the 2015 Annual Meeting, is the Company's umbrella plan that was designed to enable certain payments under the Annual Incentive Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan to satisfy the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) and to serve as the funding vehicle for all of the annual and certain long-term incentive compensation paid to the designated executive officers selected to participate in the plan.
With the repeal of the performance-based compensation exception to Section 162(m) for compensation paid after December 31, 2017, the Company no longer realizes any tax benefit from paying any annual or long-term incentive compensation under the Executive Performance Plan. Accordingly, no awards were made under the Executive Performance Plan for 2018; all annual incentive compensation awards were made directly under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 and all long-term incentive compensation awards were made directly under the Long-Term Incentive Plan for 2018. The Company does not expect to make any awards under the Executive Performance Plan for any future years unless the performance-based compensation exception to the Section 162(m) deduction limit is reinstated.
"Covered Employees" Definition
Beginning in 2018, "covered employees" for purposes of Section 162(m) are our CEO, our CFO and the three highest paid executive officers named in the "Summary Compensation Table" on page 48 other than the CEO and CFO. In addition, once an individual becomes a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that individual will remain a covered employee for all future years, including after termination of employment or even death. This change expands the group of "covered employees" whose compensation will be subject to the Section 162(m) deduction limit. As a 
[BEGIN TABLE]
46      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
46      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
result, post-termination and post-death payments, severance, deferred compensation and payments from nonqualified plans paid to an executive who was a "covered employee" at any time after 2016 will be subject to the Section 162(m) deduction limit; a limited exception remains for compensation paid under binding written agreements in effect on November 2, 2017 that meet certain requirements.
For the 2018 tax year, the Company paid the Named Executive Officers and other current or former executives treated as "covered employees" under Section 162(m) a total of $27.5 million which was not deductible.
The O&C Committee continues to believe that tying the Named Executive Officers' compensation to the Company's performance is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. As a result, the O&C Committee does not expect these changes to Section 162(m) to significantly affect the design of the Company's compensation program, and expects to authorize compensation exceeding $1 million to the Named Executive Officers even though it will not be deductible under Section 162(m).
In addition, the Company will no longer request shareholder approval that was required solely to satisfy 
Section 162(m) requirements, but will continue to seek shareholder approval of compensation plans as required by other applicable law or regulation.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Programs
We have structured all of our nonqualified deferred compensation programs to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, as added by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Internal Revenue Code Section 409A imposes additional tax penalties on our executive officers for certain types of nonqualified deferred compensation that are not in compliance with the form and timing of elections and distribution requirements of that section.
Accounting Considerations
Accounting considerations also play a role in our executive compensation program. Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC Topic 718") requires us to expense the fair value of our stock option grants over the vesting period, which reduces the amount of our reported profits. Because of this stock-based expensing and the impact of dilution to our shareholders, we closely monitor the number and the fair values of the option shares.
Report of the Organization and Compensation Committee
The O&C Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K. Based on that review and discussion, we recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Company's 2019 proxy statement.

(4) The amounts in this column represent the aggregate change in the actuarial present values of each Named Executive Officer's accumulated benefits under the DTE Energy Company Retirement Plan ("Qualifed Plan"), the DTE Energy Company Supplemental Retirement Plan ("SRP"), and the DTE Energy Company Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan ("ESRP"). The measurement period for each of 2016, 2017 and 2018 was the calendar year. Amounts in this column change from year to year based on a number of different variables. The primary variable is the discount rate used for valuation purposes. The discount rate used for 2016 valuations was 4.25%  for all plans. The discount rates used for 2017 valuations were 3.70% for the Qualified Plan and 3.60% for the SRP and ESRP. The discount rates used for 2018 valuations were 4.40% for the Qualified Plan, 4.12% for the SRP and 4.18% for the ESRP. SEC rules indicate that if the change in pension value is negative, the result should be displayed as $0 in the Summary Compensation Table.  For Messrs. Anderson and Meador the actual change in pension value was $(693,477) and $(546,783), respectively.  These plans are described in more detail beginning on page 52.

*** The value attributable to executive benefits for the Named Executive Officers. Beginning in 2007, the executives receive an annual cash executive benefit allowance in lieu of certain non-cash executive benefits. The cash executive benefit allowance paid to each Named Executive Officer during 2018 was $35,000. Other executive benefits made available to certain of the Named Executive Officers during 2018 included such things as security services and limited personal use of corporate event tickets, the corporate condominium, and the corporate leased jet.

(2) For purposes of calculating the benefit under the MSBP only, Mr. Meador has 10 years of additional awarded service. Mr. Meador's eligibility for the additional awarded service, granted at the time of hire, is subject to his meeting the eligibility requirements of the MSBP, which he has met. This additional time was granted to Mr. Meador as compensation for his unearned pension benefits from his previous employer. If additional service is awarded, the MSBP benefit is reduced by any benefit from the noncontributory portion of a prior employer's retirement plan.

Tax-Qualified Retirement Plan
The Retirement Plan is closed to non-represented employees hired after December 31, 2011. The Retirement Plan includes a number of different benefit accrual formulas including the Traditional Retirement Plan and the Cash Balance Plan. Messrs. Anderson and Meador participate in the Traditional Retirement Plan. Messrs. Lauer, Oleksiak and Norcia participate in the Cash Balance Plan. All Named Executive Officers are currently 100% vested in the Retirement Plan. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Traditional Retirement Plan:     The benefits provided under the Traditional Retirement Plan are based on an employee's years of benefit service, average final compensation and age at termination of employment. Compensation used to calculate the benefits under the Traditional Retirement Plan consists of (i) base salary and (ii) lump sums in lieu of base salary increases for the highest five consecutive calendar years within the last 10 years prior to termination of employment. The monthly benefit at age 65 equals 1.5% for each year of credited service times the average final compensation. Early pension benefits are immediately available to any employee who has at least 15 years of service and has attained age 45. The benefit can be paid in one of various annuity options or in an immediate 100% lump sum payment. Messrs. Anderson and Meador are currently eligible for early pension benefits. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash Balance Plan:    The benefits provided under the Cash Balance Plan are expressed as a lump sum. The cash balance benefit increases each year with contribution credits and interest credits. Contribution credits equal 7% of eligible earnings (base salary and annual corporate incentive payments under the Annual Incentive Plan) for an employee with 30 years or less of credited service and 7.5% of eligible earnings for an employee with more than 30 years of credited service. Interest credits are based on the average 30-year Treasury rates for the month of September prior to the plan year. Interest on each year's January 1 benefit is added the following December 31. The interest credit does not apply to the contribution for the current year. Upon termination of employment, a vested employee may, at any time, elect to receive the value of his benefit. If an employee elects to defer the benefit, interest credits will continue to accrue on the deferred benefit until the distribution of the benefit begins. An employee may elect to receive the benefit as a lump sum payout or as a monthly annuity, but not both. If an employee elects the lump-sum option, the entire lump sum is eligible to be rolled over to another qualified plan or IRA. Messrs. Lauer, Oleksiak and Norcia are currently eligible for the full value of their plan benefit. 
[END TABLE]
Nonqualified Retirement Plans
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SRP:     The benefits provided under the SRP are those benefits that would otherwise have been paid under the Retirement Plan but for the limitations imposed on qualified plans by the Internal Revenue Code. The benefits under the SRP are payable in a lump sum, in equal monthly installments for life or in annual installments from two to fifteen years. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ESRP:     The ESRP includes two components, the MSBP and the DC ESRP. Under the current terms of the ESRP, certain participants, including Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak and Meador, will receive a choice at termination of employment of either the MSBP or DC ESRP benefit, but not both. Messrs. Lauer and Norcia are only eligible to participate in the DC ESRP component of the ESRP and not the MSBP component. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
▪ MSBP:     Prior to January 1, 2001, many Company executives, including Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak and Meador, participated in the MSBP. The MSBP was incorporated into the ESRP as of January 1, 2001. The MSBP requires an executive to be at least age 55 with 10 years of service to receive benefits. Messrs. Anderson and Meador are currently eligible for MSBP benefits.   
[END TABLE]
The benefit provided under the MSBP is based on a Traditional Retirement Plan benefit equal to 60% of average final compensation, subject to various adjustments for Retirement Plan participation, age at termination, years of service and payment option selected, for the Named Executive Officers (other than Messrs. Lauer and Norcia, who are not covered under the MSBP component of the ESRP). The adjusted amount is offset by the amount that is paid from the Retirement Plan, SRP and any benefit from the noncontributory portion of a prior employer's pension plan (if awarded service has been granted). Mr. Meador has 10 years of additional awarded service. Compensation used to calculate the benefits under the MSBP includes the highest 260 weeks of base salary, lump sums in lieu of base salary increases and, for 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      53 
[END TABLE]
years prior to 2001, the annual incentive bonus paid under the Shareholder Value Improvement Plan. Subsequent to 2000, when the Shareholder Value Improvement Plan was eliminated, the highest 260 weeks includes 10% of an executive's base salary in lieu of a bonus. The benefits under the MSBP are payable in equal monthly installments for life. In the event of a change in control of the Company, executives who have entered into Change-In-Control Severance Agreements with the Company would receive an additional two years of age and service credits for purposes of the MSBP or any successor plan. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment" beginning on page 56 for further explanation of the change-in-control provision of the MSBP.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• DC ESRP:     Effective January 1, 2001, we implemented the DC ESRP, a defined-contribution approach to nonqualified supplemental pension benefits. The DC ESRP approach was effective for most of the executives newly hired or promoted after that date. The DC ESRP provides for a benefit equal to a stated percentage of base salary and annual corporate incentive payments under the Annual Incentive Plan that is credited to a bookkeeping account on behalf of eligible executives. For the Named Executive Officers, the contribution percentage is 10%. The account value will increase or decrease based on the performance of the investment elections under the plan, as directed by the participants. Vesting of the benefit under the DC ESRP occurs at a rate of 20% per anniversary year. All of the Named Executive Officers are 100% vested in their DC ESRP accounts. The benefits under the DC ESRP are payable in a lump sum or annual installments from two to fifteen years. In the event of a change in control of the Company, executives who have entered into Change-In-Control Severance Agreements with the Company would receive an additional two years of compensation credits for purposes of the DC ESRP or any successor plan. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment" beginning on page 56 for further explanation of the change-in-control provision of the DC ESRP. 
[END TABLE]
Deferred Compensation
For purposes of the following discussion concerning the tax-qualified and nonqualified deferred compensation for which our Named Executive Officers are eligible, we will be using the following terms:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "Savings Plan" means the DTE Energy Company Savings and Stock Ownership Plan (tax-qualified 401(k) plan). The Savings Plan is made up of three distinct subdivisions, which originate from the merger of former plans. These subdivisions are generally referred to as the DTE Electric Savings Plan, the MCN Savings Plan and the Citizens Savings Plan. None of the Named Executive Officers participate in the MCN Savings Plan or the Citizens Savings Plan. 
• "Supplemental Savings Plan" means the DTE Energy Company Supplemental Savings Plan (nonqualified 401(k) plan). 
[END TABLE]
Tax-Qualified Deferred Compensation
All Named Executive Officers participate in the Savings Plan. A participant may contribute up to 100% (less applicable FICA taxes and other legally required or voluntary deductions) of eligible compensation to the Savings Plan as pre-tax, Roth, after-tax and, if applicable, a catch-up contribution basis. Participants are 100% vested at all times in the value of their contributions. In the DTE Electric Savings Plan (including all of the Named Executive Officers), we contribute $1 to the participant's Savings Plan account for each $1 the participant contributes on the first 4% of eligible compensation. We contribute $0.50 for each $1 contributed on the next 4% of eligible compensation. Company contributions are made in DTE Energy stock.  All of the Named Executive Officers are vested in their Company matching contributions. 
Participants may direct their contributions and redirect from DTE Energy stock any related company contributions to any investment option available under the Savings Plan, subject to the trading restriction on Section 16 insiders. Under this trading restriction, participants designated as Section 16 insiders are restricted from transactions involving DTE Energy stock except during the four open window periods that occur each year after corporate earnings are announced. Investment directions and exchanges may be made daily.

(3) These earnings represent the total investment income earned in 2018 on the various investment alternatives that can be selected and directed by participants. The aggregate earnings are not reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table. 
[END TABLE]
Participants are 100% vested at all times in the value of their contributions and Company matching contributions.
We maintain bookkeeping accounts for participants in the Supplemental Savings Plan. In order to comply with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, there are separate accounts for monies deferred for participant contributions and Company matching contributions, on or after January 1, 2005. A participant's benefit will be comprised of separate bookkeeping accounts evidencing his or her interest in each of the investment funds in which contributions and related Company contributions have been invested. No actual "contributions" are made to the funds themselves. Earnings or losses are calculated using the daily valuation methodology employed by the record keeper for each corresponding fund under the Savings Plan.
When a participant terminates employment with the Company, the participant will be eligible to receive the full value of his or her Supplemental Savings Plan account, including all of his or her own contributions and all Company contributions, adjusted for investment earnings and losses. In the event of death, a lump sum distribution will be paid to the participant's spouse or other designated beneficiary.
Distributions from the Supplemental Savings Plan will be paid in cash. Distributions will be made in accordance with the participant's distribution election. A participant may elect to take a lump sum distribution or annual payments over a period of not less than two years and not more than 15 years. Lump sums and the first annual installment payments from the participant's pre-2005 account will be made no later than March 1 of the plan year following the year of termination. Subsequent annual installments will be made no later than March 1 of the installment period. In practice, lump sums, the first annual installment payment and subsequent annual installment payments are made in January. Lump sums and the first annual installment payments from the participant's post-2004 account will be made as of January 1 of the plan year following the year of termination or next following the latest date to which the participant deferred the distribution under the terms of the plan; however, Named Executive Officers and certain other executives must wait a minimum of six months after termination prior to receiving a distribution from post-2004 balances. Subsequent annual installments will be made as of January 1 of the installment period.

Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment
Other than the Change-In-Control Severance Agreements discussed below, we have not entered into any other severance agreements or other arrangements with the Named Executive Officers and do not maintain any other severance benefit programs for the Named Executive Officers.
Change-in-Control Benefits
We have entered into Change-In-Control Severance Agreements with certain executives, including the Named Executive Officers. The agreements are intended to provide continuity of management in the event there is a change in control of the Company and to align executive and shareholder interests in support of corporate transactions.
For purposes of these agreements, a change in control occurs if (i) we or our assets are acquired by another company or if we merge, consolidate, or reorganize with another company and less than 55% of the new or acquiring company's combined voting stock is held by holders of the voting stock of the Company immediately prior to the change in control transaction, (ii) a "person" becomes the beneficial owner of at least 20% of the Company's voting stock, (iii) a majority of the Company's Board members change within a period of two consecutive years, (iv) the Company's shareholders approve a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or (v) the Company executes, at the direction of the Board, one or more definitive agreements to engage in a transaction that will result in one of the events described in (i) through (iv).
The Change-In-Control Severance Agreements provide for severance compensation in the event that the executive's employment is terminated (actually or constructively) within two years after a change in control of the Company. The severance compensation provided to an executive following a qualifying termination is the same for all of the change-in-control events. The cash severance benefit is the sum of (i) a multiple of the executive's base salary plus annual bonus, assuming target performance goals for such year would be met, plus (ii) a lump sum payment of the executive's pro-rated annual bonus (reduced by any pro-rated annual bonus otherwise paid because of the executive's termination). The multiple for the Named Executive Officers is 200%. An additional amount is paid as consideration for the prohibition against engaging in any competitive activity for one year after termination that is imposed by the Change-In-Control Severance Agreement. The additional amount for the Named Executive Officers is 100% of the executive's base salary plus annual bonus, assuming target performance goals for such year would be met. The Change-In-Control Severance Agreement does not provide any gross-up payments for the purposes of payment of excise taxes.
The Company's retiree health and life insurance plans separately provide that any non-represented employee who receives severance pay because of a change in control will be credited with additional years of service after age 45 for purposes of eligibility for retiree health and life insurance equal to individual's "benefit continuation period" under the applicable severance agreement or program. Under these provisions, the Named Executive Officers would be credited with an additional two years of service after age 45 for purposes of eligibility for retiree health and life insurance benefits.
The severance payment includes payment by the Company for outplacement services by a firm selected by the Named Executive Officer in an amount up to 15% of the Named Executive Officer's base pay.
In addition, the executive would receive an additional two years of age and service credits for purposes of the MSBP (if the executive is a participant in the MSBP, as are Messrs. Anderson, Oleksiak and Meador), or an additional two years of compensation credits for purposes of the ESRP, and a cash payment representing health care and other welfare benefits for two years. If the executive is subject to the Company's mandatory retirement policy (as are the Named Executive Officers), the benefits provided under a Change-In-Control Severance Agreements are subject to reduction depending on the executive's age at termination. Executives who have Change-In-Control Severance Agreements and are participants in the MSBP who meet certain age and service requirements at the time of their termination would receive an immediate distribution of their benefit under the MSBP.
In addition, the Long-Term Incentive Plan provides that all options, restricted stock awards and performance shares will become exercisable or vested or will be earned (as applicable) upon the occurrence of a change-in-control event (iv) described above or upon the occurrence of a change-in-control event (i) described above if the new or acquiring entity fails to replace or continue the awards. Performance shares will be based on the greater of target performance or actual performance through the change in control date. If a change in control event (i) described above occurs and the new or acquiring entity replaces or 
[BEGIN TABLE]
56      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
56      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
continues the awards, all options, restricted stock awards and performance shares will become exercisable or vested or will be earned (as applicable) as of the earlier of the date specified in the award agreement or the executive's qualifying termination, which generally must occur within two years after the change in control date.
We have an irrevocable trust established to provide a source of funds to assist us in meeting our obligations under the Change-In-Control Severance Agreements and certain other director and executive compensation plans described previously. We may make contributions to the trust from time to time in amounts determined sufficient to pay benefits when due to participants under such plans. Notwithstanding the trust, these plans are not qualified or fully funded, and amounts on deposit in the trust are subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors.
The following table provides the estimated lump-sum or present values of the various change in control protections as if a qualifying termination had occurred on December 31, 2018.

CEO Pay Ratio
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we identified the median of all our employees, excluding our CEO, by using annual total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table as our consistently applied compensation measure.  We computed annual total compensation for all active employees as of December 31, 2018, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not annualize the compensation for any full-time employees who were not employed by us for all of 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The resulting median employee is a union employee in our electric distribution operations group; 
• The median employee had a base salary rate, exclusive of overtime, of $86,623;  
• The annual total compensation of the median employee of the Company (other than Mr. Anderson, the Company's Chairman and CEO) was $120,861; and 
• The annual total compensation of Mr. Anderson, our Chairman and CEO, was $10,986,808. 
[END TABLE]
The difference between the employee's salary, wages, and overtime pay and the employee's annual total compensation represents the reported value of the employee's:
- Section 401(k) Employer matching contributions of $5,289
- Other taxable benefits of $278
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of DTE's Chairman and CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees is 91 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.

[END TABLE]
(1) Salary includes base salary and overtime pay per the SEC disclosure rules (Rule 402(u)(2)(i)).
As permitted under SEC rules, we changed our methodology from the prior fiscal year, when we calculated annual total compensation only for a group of 21 employees identified as the median of all employees based on Form W-2, Box 1 wages. The median employee for the prior fiscal year had the median annual total compensation of the group of 21 employees. We made a change in methodology because we believe that the use of annual total compensation for all employees provides a more robust analysis of our total compensation package. 
Because the SEC rules for identifying the median of the annual total compensation of our employees and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio for our Company.

Proposal No. 4 — Shareholder Proposal — Independent Board Chairman
The Company expects a proposal to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting by John Chevedden of Redondo Beach, California, who beneficially owned not less than 50 shares of the Company's common stock as of October 11, 2018. The proposal, along with the supporting statement, is included below.
Proposal 4--Independent Board Chairman
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement.
If the Board determines that a Chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.
This proposal topic won impressive 42%-support at the 2015 DTE annual meeting. Thus it could have won more than 50%-support from the large shareholders who have ready access to independent information on the importance of this topic.
Caterpillar is an example of a company changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman. Now is a good time to take the first step to transition to an independent board chairman given the following concerns at DTE:
Product Concerns - Regulator investigation into weather-related outages in Michigan 
May 2018
Environmental Impact Concerns - Opposition to proposed Nexus high pressure natural gas transmission pipeline
November 2017
Air Pollution/Gas Leak -Natural gas leak from Harmony Station due to failed pilot on discharge valve 
September 2017
Trash or Hazardous Waste Disposal - Increased chlorine emissions into Lake Erie from Fermi 2 Nuclear Plant 
July 2017
Air Pollution/Gas Leak - Legal challenge against EPA enforcement of Clean Air Act New Source Review Air Permit Program
May 2017
Adoption of this proposal will cost our company virtually nothing - yet it can improve board independence and company performance.
Please vote yes:

Board of Directors Response
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OPPOSES THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST IT FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW:
The Board and Company recognizes the critical importance of independent oversight of management along with effective and efficient operation of the Board. Under the Company's current circumstances, leadership provided by our Lead Independent Director paired with our Chairman and CEO is the best fit to achieve our objectives. Our Board has the flexibility to elect an independent chairman if there were circumstances in which an independent chairman would be the optimal way to achieve these goals. 
Effective corporate governance is best achieved by preserving the Board's ability to determine on a case-by-case basis a leadership structure that will work best for the Company and its shareholders, considering the unique dynamics facing senior management, shareholders and the Board at any given time. This shareholder proposal is unnecessary and would restrict the Board's decision-making ability and limit the options available to the Board in structuring Company leadership. 
A vast majority of the current directors standing for reelection—ten of eleven—are independent directors. Our bylaws provide that the Board may elect any director as Chairman, whether independent or not. In the event that the Chairman is not an independent director, the independent directors also elect a Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director has clearly delineated and comprehensive duties that are described in detail on page 14, and include:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Collaborating with the Chairman and CEO and the Corporate Secretary on scheduling Board and committee meetings and approving the schedule of Board and Committee meetings.  
[END TABLE]
Any shareholder can communicate with the Lead Independent Director or any of the other directors in the manner described on page 16. The Board also has a strong committee structure composed of independent directors. Prior to each committee meeting, each of the committee chairs reviews the agenda and materials to be covered at the upcoming meeting with various members of management. In addition, the independent directors have significant input into upcoming meeting agendas: at each committee meeting, all of the members of that committee are provided the 
[BEGIN TABLE]
60      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
60      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
opportunity to review and comment on the agendas for the committee meetings scheduled to occur up to twelve months in the future. 
In addition to the oversight measures described above, the Corporate Governance Committee, on which the CEO does not sit, oversees an annual performance evaluation of the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee also develops and recommends the Board's governance policies and practices, such as the robustness and effectiveness of the Lead Independent Director structure during periods when the Chairman is not an independent director, such as the present time. 
The proponent cites several well-known public companies whose boards have recently appointed independent chairmen. He fails to note that the boards of those companies did so in order to address serious failures in management that made national headlines. Moreover, the boards of those companies did not amend their bylaws to require an independent chairman in perpetuity. Rather, they chose an independent chairman to navigate a turbulent period, while retaining the option of returning to a non-independent chairman if circumstances warrant it in the future. DTE Energy has experienced a period of tremendous growth and prosperity under the current Board leadership structure, headed by our Chairman and CEO, together with the Lead Independent Director. If, in the future, the independent directors of the Board determine that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders for a person other than the CEO to perform the role of Chairman, the Board has the flexibility under the Company's Bylaws to elect an independent director to fulfill that role. 
We believe that the rigid policy proposed by the shareholder would unduly impair the Board's flexibility to determine the optimal Board leadership structure and select the individual it deems best suited to serve as Chairman depending on the circumstances. We believe that preserving such flexibility for your Board, while maintaining an effective, balanced corporate governance structure, will continue to best serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REQUIRING AN INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIRMAN.
Proposal No. 5 — Shareholder Proposal — Disclosure of Political Contributions
The Company expects a proposal to be presented for consideration at the annual meeting by Mercy Investment Services, Inc. of St. Louis, Missouri, who beneficially owned 120,998 shares of the Company's common stock as of November 16, 2018. The proposal, along with the supporting statement, is included below.
DTE Energy Political Disclosure Shareholder Resolution
Resolved, that the shareholders of DTE Energy ("DTE" or "Company") hereby request that the Company provide a report, updated semiannually, disclosing the Company's:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Policies and procedures for making, with corporate funds or assets, contributions and expenditures (direct or indirect) to (a) participate or intervene in any campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, or (b) influence the general public, or any segment thereof, with respect to an election or referendum. 
2. Monetary and non-monetary contributions and expenditures (direct and indirect) used in the manner described in section 1 above, including: 
[END TABLE]
a.The identity of the recipient as well as the amount paid to each; and b.The title(s) of the person(s) in the Company responsible for decision-making.
The report shall be presented to the board of directors or relevant board committee and posted on the Company's website within 12 months from the date of the annual meeting. This proposal does not encompass lobbying spending.
Supporting Statement
As long-term shareholders of DTE, we support transparency and accountability in corporate electoral spending. This includes any activity considered intervention in a political campaign under the Internal Revenue Code, such as direct and 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      61 
[END TABLE]
indirect contributions to political candidates, parties, or organizations, and independent expenditures or electioneering communications on behalf of federal, state, or local candidates.
Disclosure is in the best interest of the company and its shareholders. The Supreme Court recognized this in its 2010 Citizens United decision, which said, "[D]isclosure permits citizens and shareholders to react to the speech of corporate entities in a proper way. This transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight to different speakers and messages."
Publicly available records show DTE has contributed at least $13,250,000 in corporate funds since the 2010 election cycle (CQMoneyLine: http://monevline.cq.com; National Institute on Money in State Politics: http://www.followthemonev.org). 
However, relying on publicly available data does not provide a complete picture of the Company's electoral spending. For example, the Company's payments to trade associations that may be used for election-related activities are undisclosed and unknown. This proposal asks the Company to disclose all of its electoral spending, including payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, which may be used for electoral purposes. This would bring our Company in line with a growing number of leading companies, including Ameren Corporation, PG&E Corporation, and Kellogg Company, which present this information on their websites.
The Company's Board and shareholders need comprehensive disclosure to fully evaluate the use of corporate assets in elections. We urge your support for this critical governance reform.
Board of Directors Response
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OPPOSES THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL AND RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST IT FOR THE REASONS SET FORTH BELOW:
DTE Energy has a long tradition as a responsible corporate citizen. The Board believes the Company has a responsibility to shareholders to be engaged and to participate in the political process on issues that affect the Company or are significant to our industry. The Board also believes that it is in the best interests of our shareholders to support the legislative process by making corporate political contributions to organizations consistent with the Company's objectives as permitted by federal, state and local laws. While we are fully committed to complying with the law regarding political contributions and expenditures, the overly specific disclosure contemplated by this proposal is unnecessary, would hold the Company to a higher standard and could have negative consequences for the Company. We have communicated with the proponent in an attempt to address their concerns, but did not reach an agreement for withdrawal of the proposal. 
A different shareholder submitted substantially the same proposal in each of our Annual Meetings from 2008 to 2016 and the Board opposed the proposal on all occasions. Since the time the proposal was first submitted in 2008, it has been considered nine times and has never been approved by shareholders. The Company expanded its political contribution information and disclosures on our website in 2008 and again in 2017. The Board continues to believe that adoption of this resolution is unnecessary. Detailed information concerning the Company's political contributions are available on our website at dteenergy.com/political-participation and are available through various political contribution disclosure laws. 
In addition, the Company adopted a formal policy on corporate political participation that applies to all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and is incorporated in our daily business practices. A copy of this policy is available on our website at dteenergy.com/political-participation. Among other things, the policy provides as follows: 
A. Corporate Contributions - Our policy mandates that corporate contributions to political organizations be made only as permitted by applicable laws and authorized by our Vice President - Corporate & Government Affairs. Disclosure of the aggregate amount of these contributions will be annually posted on our website. 
B. Political Action Committee Contributions - Political contributions to federal, state and local candidates, political party committees, and political action committees are made by the DTE Energy Political Action Committee ("PAC"), which is funded by voluntary contributions from eligible DTE Energy employees. The PAC's activities are guided by a steering committee comprised of PAC members elected by all PAC members and are subject to comprehensive regulation, including 
[BEGIN TABLE]
62      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
62      DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT    
[END TABLE]
detailed disclosure requirements. PAC contributions are reported to the Federal Election Commission and the Michigan Secretary of State's Bureau of Elections. Links to these organizations are available on our website. 
C. Trade Associations - DTE Energy belongs to a number of trade associations that participate in the political process. DTE Energy's sole purpose in becoming a member of these trade associations is not for political purposes, as DTE Energy may not agree with all positions taken by trade associations on issues. The benefits that DTE Energy does receive from trade associations are primarily expertise and the ability to gain insight on industry setting standards. Our policy on political participation provides that DTE Energy will request that trade associations to which our dues or other payments are significant provide a breakdown of the portion of our dues or payments that were used for political contributions. This information is included in the annual Board report of PAC and political activities. 
D. Board Oversight and Disclosure - The Company's political activities are reviewed annually by the Public Policy and Responsibility Committee of the DTE Energy Board of Directors. We believe this oversight process ensures accountability and transparency for the Company's corporate political activities. The Company also posts on its website the annual aggregate amount of trade association dues or payments utilized for political activities. This additional disclosure, above and beyond what is required by law, ultimately convinced the previous proponent that it was no longer prudent to submit the proposal. 
Given the Company's policy on corporate political participation discussed above, the mandatory public disclosure requirements already required under the law, and the supplemental disclosure the Company makes on a voluntary basis, the Board has again concluded that the Company's policy and disclosures exceed what is required by the law. This ample public information regarding DTE Energy's political participation appropriately addresses the concerns cited in the proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE AGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL RELATING TO ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE OF POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS.
Consideration of Any Other Business That May Come Before the Meeting
Our management does not intend to bring any other business before the meeting for action and has not been notified of any other business proposed to be brought before the meeting. However, if any other business should be properly presented for action, it is the intention of the persons named on the enclosed proxy card to vote in accordance with their judgment on such business.

2019 PROXY STATEMENT OF DTE ENERGY COMPANY
INFORMATION CONCERNING VOTING AND PROXY SOLICITATION
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Why did I receive proxy materials?
You received these materials because you own DTE Energy common stock. As a shareholder, you have the right to vote your shares on matters presented at the annual shareholder meeting to be held on May 9, 2019, or at any adjournments or postponements of this meeting.
What is a proxy?
The Board is asking you to give us your "proxy" to vote your shares at the annual shareholder meeting to be held on May 9, 2019, or at any adjournments or postponements of this meeting. Giving us your proxy means that you authorize us to vote your shares of our common stock at the annual meeting in the manner you direct. You will grant this permission by mail, the Internet, telephone or in person.
Through the mail, you may grant us permission to vote your shares on your behalf using a "proxy card" or a "voting instruction form" depending on how the ownership of your shares is reflected in our records.
If you are a Registered Shareholder, a "proxy card" is the document used to designate your proxy to vote your shares. If you are a Beneficial Shareholder, a "voting instruction form" is the document used to designate your proxy to vote your shares. See "What is the difference between a "Registered Shareholder" and a "Beneficial Shareholder"? below for further information.
In addition, all shareholders may vote their shares through the Internet, by telephone or in person at the annual meeting.
In this proxy statement, the term "proxy card" refers to the proxy card itself or the voting instruction form used by beneficial holders, unless otherwise indicated.
What is the difference between a "Registered Shareholder" and a "Beneficial Shareholder"?
A "Registered Shareholder" (also referred to as a "shareholder of record") is a shareholder with shares registered in their name with Equiniti Trust Company (EQ), our transfer agent. Individuals who hold physical certificates and/or are participants in the DTE Energy Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRIP"), make up the largest portion of Registered Shareholders. 
A "Beneficial Shareholder" (also referred to as a "street name holder") is a shareholder with shares held in a stock brokerage account by a brokerage firm, bank or another nominee. Beneficial Shareholders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee how to vote their shares using a method described under "How do I vote?" below.
Please note that within this section if no "Registered" or "Beneficial" designation is given to the term "Shareholder" we are referring to all DTE Energy Shareholders as of the Record Date.
What are the purposes of this annual meeting?
At the meeting, our shareholders will be asked to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Elect eleven directors. The nominees are Gerard M. Anderson, David A. Brandon, W. Frank Fountain, Jr., Charles G. McClure, Jr., Gail J. McGovern, Mark A. Murray, Ruth G. Shaw, Robert C. Skaggs, Jr., David A. Thomas, James H. Vandenberghe and Valerie M. Williams for terms expiring in 2020. (See "Proposal No. 1 - Election of Directors" on page 5);

[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote?
Only DTE Energy common stock shareholders of record at the close of business on March 12, 2019 (the "Record Date") are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each share of common stock has one vote with respect to each matter coming before the meeting.
How do I vote?
Registered Shareholders - You will receive voting instructions directly from EQ. You may vote your shares held as of the Record Date through the Internet, by telephone, by mail or by casting a ballot in person at the annual meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote through the Internet or by telephone, follow the instructions attached to your proxy card or meeting notice. 
• To vote by mail, sign and date each proxy card (if you receive a paper copy) and return it in the enclosed prepaid envelope. 
• To vote in person at the annual meeting, please see the instructions under "How do I attend the annual meeting?" on page 69 below. You may use your own proxy card to vote or use a blank one provided at the meeting. 
[END TABLE]
Note that if you vote more than once, your last vote counts and supersedes all others. See "Can I change or revoke my vote?" below for further information.
If you sign and return your proxy card, but do not specify how you wish to vote, your shares will be voted as the Board recommends. Your shares will also be voted as recommended by the Board, in its discretion, on any other business that is properly presented for a vote at the meeting. See "Consideration of Any Other Business That May Come Before the Meeting" on page 63.
Beneficial Shareholders - You must vote your shares in the manner prescribed by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee. Your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee should have enclosed, or should have provided a "Notice Card" or "Voting Instruction Form" for you to direct them how to vote your shares. Unlike the Registered Shareholders, you will not be able to vote your shares in person at the annual meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee. See "How do I attend the annual meeting?" on page 69 below for information regarding legal proxies.
If your DTE Energy shares are owned through the DTE Energy Company Savings and Stock Ownership Plan, the DTE Electric Company Savings & Stock Ownership Plan for Employees Represented by Local 223 of the Utility Workers Union of America, the DTE Electric Company Savings & Stock Ownership Plan for Employees Represented by Local 17 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers or the DTE Gas Company Investment and Stock Ownership Plan ("401(k) plans"), see "What shares are included on my proxy card or meeting notice?" below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      65 
[END TABLE]
What shares are included on my proxy card or meeting notice?
Registered Shareholders - The proxy card or meeting notice you received covers all shares eligible to be voted in your account as of the Record Date regardless of type, including any shares held in certificated form or shares held in the DRIP.
401(k) plan Participants - The proxy card serves as a voting instruction to the Trustee for DTE Energy common stock owned by employees and retirees of DTE Energy and its affiliates in their respective 401(k) plans. Please note that if you are also a Registered Shareholder, shares held in the 401(k) plans will be listed separately and will be voted together with your registered shares on one proxy card.
Beneficial Shareholders - Separate voting instructions will be provided by each of your brokerage firms, banks or other nominees for shares held in street name. 
Can I change or revoke my vote?
Yes. If you are a Registered Shareholder and/or own DTE Energy shares within a 401(k) plan, any subsequent vote or revocation received by the voting deadline will supersede your prior vote. For example, if you voted by telephone, a subsequent Internet vote will change your vote. Deadlines for voting are indicated on the proxy card or meeting notice.
If you are a Registered Shareholder and wish to change your vote using a new proxy card, please call 1-866-388-8558 to request a new proxy card.
Registered Shareholders may also change their vote on their registered shares by voting in person at the annual meeting.
If you wish to revoke any prior vote you must submit a letter addressed to our tabulator, EQ, P.O. Box 64873, St. Paul, MN 55164-9397. It must be received prior to the meeting to be processed.
Beneficial Shareholders should contact their brokerage firm, bank or other nominee regarding the timing and method to change or revoke their vote.
Is my vote confidential?
Yes, your vote is confidential. Your vote is received and counted by the tabulator and inspector of election, EQ. Your vote will not be disclosed except as required by law or in other limited circumstances.
Will I receive an Annual Report?
DTE Energy no longer provides a separate "Annual Report." The Company's Form 10-K, filed with the SEC, is provided to Shareholders with the proxy materials and serves as our "Annual Report" to our Shareholders.
What does it mean if I get more than one set of proxy materials or meeting notices?
In addition to reducing mailing costs by providing meeting notices, we also try to reduce costs relating to mailing duplicate sets of proxy materials by a method called householding. See "What is "householding" and how am I affected?" below. Despite these efforts, you may receive multiple copies of proxy materials if your shares are registered differently (i.e. trust, joint, name spelling variation, etc.) or if they are in more than one account (i.e., broker, bank, transfer agent, etc.). Please vote all proxies that you receive and consider consolidating your accounts.
If you are a Registered Shareholder receiving multiple sets of materials and wish to consolidate your accounts please contact EQ at 1-866-388-8558.
If you are a Beneficial Shareholder receiving multiple sets of materials and wish to consolidate your accounts, please contact your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee.

[END TABLE]
What is "householding" and how am I affected?
For those Shareholders receiving paper copies of the Form 10-K and proxy statement, the SEC permits delivery of a single copy of these statements to Shareholders who have the same address and last name. This procedure, called "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information mailed and reduces printing and postage costs.
Despite "householding" of printed material, each Shareholder living at the same address will continue to receive a separate proxy card.
Registered Shareholders and DTE Energy 401(k) plan Participants: If you prefer to receive separate copies of our annual reports and proxy statements, now or in the future, please submit a written request to: EQ, Attn: Householding/DTE Energy, P.O. Box 64854, St. Paul, MN 55164-0854. Separate sets of documents will be promptly delivered to you.
Beneficial Shareholders can request information about "householding" by contacting their brokerage firm, bank or other nominee of record.
Can I elect to receive or view DTE Energy's annual report (Form 10-K) and proxy statement electronically?
Yes. If you are a Registered Shareholder and you received printed proxy materials, you may elect to receive future proxy materials electronically. To do so you must provide your consent and enroll in this service at investorelections.com/dte, where step-by-step instructions will prompt you through the enrollment process.
By consenting to electronic delivery, you are stating that you currently have, and expect to have, access to the Internet. If you do not currently have, or do not expect to have, access to the Internet, please do not elect to have documents delivered electronically.
If you have previously enrolled, you will receive an email notification directing you to the website where you can view, search and print the annual report and proxy materials and vote your shares.
If this is your first time registering for electronic delivery, your enrollment will be effective for the 2020 annual meeting.
Beneficial Shareholders should contact their brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and inquire about their electronic delivery options.
All DTE Energy Shareholders can view, search and print the current year's proxy statement and Form 10-K at proxydocs.com/dte.
What constitutes a quorum?
There were 183,214,472 shares of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Each share is entitled to one vote with respect to each matter coming before the annual meeting. A majority of these outstanding shares present or represented by a proxy at the meeting constitutes a quorum. A quorum is necessary to conduct an annual meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
  DTE ENERGY 2019 PROXY STATEMENT      67 
[END TABLE]
What are abstentions and broker non-votes and how do they affect voting?
Abstentions - If you specify on your proxy card that you wish to "abstain" from voting on an item, your shares will not be voted on that particular item. Abstentions are counted toward establishing a quorum, but not toward determining the outcome of the proposal to which the abstention applies.
Broker Non-Votes - Under New York Stock Exchange rules, if your broker holds your shares in its name and does not receive voting instructions from you, your broker has discretion to vote these shares on certain "routine" matters, including the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. Voting to elect directors in an uncontested election, to approve executive compensation and to consider any shareholder proposals are all non-routine matters. Consequently, your broker must receive voting instructions from you in order to vote with respect to proposals 1, 3, 4 and 5 at our 2019 annual meeting. On routine matters, including proposal 2, shares voted by brokers without instructions are counted toward the outcome.
How does the voting work?
For each item, voting works as follows:
Proposal No. 1—Election of Directors. The election of each director requires approval by a majority of the votes cast, i.e., each of the eleven nominees for director must receive more than fifty percent of the votes cast at the meeting to be elected. You may withhold votes from one or more directors by writing their names in the space provided for that purpose on your proxy card. Withhold votes are counted as votes cast and treated as votes against the relevant director. Failure to vote and broker non-votes will not be considered as votes cast for the election of directors and will not be counted either for or against each director. If you vote by telephone or the Internet, follow the instructions attached to the proxy card or meeting notice. Your broker is not entitled to vote your shares on this matter unless instructions are received from you. You cannot vote for more than eleven directors.
Proposal No. 2—Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. Ratification of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm requires approval by a majority of the votes cast. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will not be counted either for or against this matter. Your broker is entitled to vote your shares on this matter if no instructions are received from you.
Proposal No. 3—Nonbinding Vote to Approve Executive Compensation. Approval of the Management Proposal requires approval from a majority of the votes cast. Your broker is not entitled to vote your shares unless instructions are received from you. Abstentions are not considered votes cast and will not be counted either for or against this proposal.
Proposal No. 4—Shareholder Proposal—Independent Board Chairman. Approval of the Shareholder Proposal requires approval from a majority of the votes cast. Your broker is not entitled to vote your shares unless instructions are received from you. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will not be counted either for or against this proposal.
Proposal No. 5—Shareholder Proposal—Disclosure of Political Contributions. Approval of the Shareholder Proposal requires approval from a majority of the votes cast. Your broker is not entitled to vote your shares unless instructions are received from you. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not considered votes cast and will not be counted either for or against this proposal.

How do I attend the annual meeting? 
All Shareholders as of the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the annual meeting. You must pre-register in order to attend. Please contact DTE Energy Shareholder Services by email at shareowner@dteenergy.com or by telephone at (313) 235-4200 and provide your name, address, telephone number with area code, and note that you plan to attend the annual meeting. DTE Energy will independently verify the status of Registered Shareholders as of the Record Date. Beneficial Shareholders must provide evidence of share ownership to DTE Energy Shareholder Services.
Beneficial Shareholders—Beneficial Shareholders must contact their brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and obtain a legal proxy in order to vote their shares in person at the meeting. Generally, there will be a box that you can check on the voting instruction card or website to indicate that you wish to attend and vote your shares at the annual meeting. You must provide a copy of the legal proxy to DTE Energy Shareholder Services as definitive proof of ownership as of the Record Date in order to attend the meeting and to vote your shares in person.
If a Beneficial Shareholder does not obtain a legal proxy but still wants to attend the annual meeting (and not vote their shares in person), they may provide other evidentiary material, such as broker statements, trade advices or a letter from their broker proving ownership as of the Record Date. DTE Energy reserves the right to restrict admission if evidentiary material is not definitive proof of proper and timely ownership.
DTE Energy will respond to all pre-registration requests and will maintain a list of verified Shareholders at the annual meeting. To gain admission at the meeting, you must present government-issued photo identification that matches the name on the pre-registration list.
Annual meeting pre-registration requests must be received by the end of business on Thursday, May 2, 2019.
Seating is limited and admission is on a first-come basis.
Location of the annual meeting:
The meeting will be held at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel, 2400 East Missouri Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85016.
How will the annual meeting be conducted?
The Chairman of the Board ("Chairman"), or such other director as designated by the Board, will call the annual meeting to order, preside at the meeting and determine the order of business. The only business that will be conducted or considered at this meeting is business discussed in this proxy statement, as no other shareholder complied with the procedures set forth in our Bylaws (as amended) for proposing other matters to be brought at the meeting.
How does a shareholder recommend a person for election to the Board for the 2020 annual meeting?
Recommendations for nominations by shareholders should be in writing and addressed to our Corporate Secretary at our principal business address. See the "Shareholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors" section of this proxy statement on page 70 for further information on submitting nominations. Once the Corporate Secretary properly receives a recommendation for nomination, the recommendation is sent to the Corporate Governance Committee for consideration. Candidates for directors nominated by shareholders will be given the same consideration as candidates nominated by other sources.

If a shareholder notice is nominating a person (a "Shareholder Nominee") for election to the Board, the notice must also include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the information that would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement to comply with all applicable requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder as if each Shareholder Nominee had been nominated by the Board;

[END TABLE]
Any shareholder notice to nominate a Shareholder Nominee must be accompanied by a written and signed consent of the Shareholder Nominee to serve as a director of the Company if elected.
If a shareholder notice is proposing any other items of business, the notice must also include as to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a description in reasonable detail of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; and 
• any material interest the shareholder or the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, has in the matter. 
[END TABLE]
A shareholder must also comply with all the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act for shareholder proposals, including matters covered by SEC Rule 14a-8. Nothing in our Bylaws affects any rights of shareholders to request inclusion of proposals in the proxy statement pursuant to SEC Rule 14a-8.
Proxies solicited by the Company for the 2020 annual meeting may confer discretionary authority to vote on an untimely proposal without express direction from the shareholders giving proxies.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES
We will pay the cost to solicit proxies.  Directors and officers of DTE Energy and employees of its affiliates may solicit proxies either personally or by telephone, facsimile transmission or via the Internet, but no additional remuneration will be paid by the Company for the solicitation of those proxies. We have also retained Morrow Sodali, LLC, 470 West Ave., Stamford, Connecticut 06902 to help distribute proxy materials and solicit votes in that same manner, for a fee of $15,500 plus reimbursement of certain out-of-pocket expenses.
IMPORTANT
The interest and cooperation of all shareholders in our affairs are considered to be of the greatest importance by your management. Even if you expect to attend the annual meeting, it is urgently requested that, whether your share holdings are large or small, you promptly vote by telephone or on the Internet or fill in, date, sign and return the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided. If you do so now, we will be saved the expense of follow-up notices.
