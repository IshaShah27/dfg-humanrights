PROXY STATEMENT
For the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to Be Held on January 29, 2019
INTRODUCTION
Why You Received these Materials
We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Versum Materials Inc. ("Versum Materials" or the "Company") for use at the Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders (the "annual meeting") and at any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting. You are cordially invited to attend the annual meeting, which will be held at our offices located at 8555 South River Parkway, Tempe, Arizona 85284, on January 29, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Mountain Standard Time. For driving directions to our offices, please call (602) 282-1000. 
Stockholders Entitled to Vote
The record date for the annual meeting is December 6, 2018. If at the close of business on December 6, 2018, you were a stockholder of record, you may vote your shares by proxy through the Internet, by telephone or by mail, or you may vote in person at the annual meeting. For shares held through a broker, bank or other nominee, you may vote by submitting voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee. Please refer to information from your broker, bank or other nominee on how to submit voting instructions. To reduce our administrative costs and help the environment by conserving natural resources, we ask that you vote through the Internet or by telephone, both of which are available 24 hours a day. You may find information on voting procedures on page 3 of this proxy statement. You may revoke your proxies at the times and in the manners described on page 3 of this proxy statement. As of December 6, 2018, the record date for the annual meeting, there were 109,111,564 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
If you are a stockholder of record or hold shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and are voting by proxy, your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 28, 2019.
Quorum Requirements
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote at the annual meeting is necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. Each stockholder is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held as of the record date on each matter to be voted upon. Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary power with respect to that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 
BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
Delaware law and the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws (our "by-laws") govern the vote on the proposals to be considered at the annual meeting. The Board's recommendation is set forth together with a description of each item in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board's recommendations and approval requirements are: 
PROPOSAL ONE 
Election of Directors 
The first item to be voted on is the election of the seven director nominees listed herein to serve until our annual meeting in 2020 and their successors are duly elected and qualified. The Board has nominated seven people as directors, each of whom is currently serving as a director of Versum Materials. You may find information about these nominees beginning on page 6. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT      1
BOARD RECOMMENDATIONS AND APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS
Pursuant to our by-laws, a director nominee must receive a majority of votes cast with respect to that director's election at the annual meeting in uncontested elections at which a quorum is present. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee. If the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected (i.e., in contested elections), as determined by the Secretary of the Company as of the record date for an annual meeting, our directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast. 
Assuming a quorum is present, each share of common stock may be voted for as many nominees as there are directors to be elected. Stockholders may not cumulate their votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes "for" or "against" a director nominee and will have no effect on the outcome of the vote on election of directors at the annual meeting. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" EACH DIRECTOR NOMINEE. 
PROPOSAL TWO 
Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The second item to be voted on is the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. You may find information about this proposal beginning on page 9. 
You may vote in favor of the proposal, vote against the proposal or abstain from voting. Assuming a quorum is present, the proposal will pass if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted against the proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. As this proposal is considered a discretionary matter, brokers are permitted to exercise their discretion to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF KPMG AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019.
PROPOSAL THREE 
Advisory Vote on the Compensation Paid to Our Named Executive Officers 
The third item to be voted on is a non-binding advisory vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers ("say-on-pay"). You may find information about this proposal beginning on page 9. 
You may vote in favor of the proposal, vote against the proposal or abstain from voting. Assuming a quorum is present, the proposal will pass if the number of shares voted in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of shares voted against the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
OTHER MATTERS TO COME BEFORE THE ANNUAL MEETING
As of the date of this proxy statement, the Board was not aware of any other business to be presented for a vote of the stockholders at the annual meeting. If any other matters are properly presented for a vote, the people named as proxies will have discretionary authority, to the extent permitted by law, to vote on such matters according to their best judgment.

In particular, we encourage stockholders to consider the following in determining whether to vote for this proposal:

Although this advisory "say-on-pay" resolution is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. If there are a significant number of negative votes, we will seek to understand the concerns that influenced the vote, and address them in making future decisions about executive compensation programs. We currently conduct an advisory say-on-pay vote annually and intend to continue to do so.
THE BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION PAID TO OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
OTHER MATTERS 
As of the date of this proxy statement, we know of no business that will be presented for consideration at the annual meeting other than the items referred to above. If any other matter is properly brought before the annual meeting for action by stockholders, proxies in the enclosed form returned to Versum Materials will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board, or in the absence of such a recommendation, in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holder.

Meetings of the Board of Directors 
All directors are expected to participate in person or by telephone in all meetings of the Board, meetings of the committees of which they are members and the annual meeting of stockholders. Each of our directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, except for one director who was unable to attend. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board held eight meetings, the Audit Committee held eight meetings, the Compensation Committee held seven meetings and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee held five meetings. Excluding one self-recused absence from a Board teleconference to avoid a potential conflict of interest, Mr. Ghasemi attended at least 75% of the Board meetings during fiscal 2018, and each of the other directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and of the committees of the Board on which such director served.
Board Role in Risk Management 
The Board actively oversees risk management related to the Company and its business. The Board accomplishes this oversight with the assistance of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Our Board reviews our enterprise risk management program at least annually and considers whether risk management processes are functioning properly and are appropriately adapted to the Company's strategy, culture, risk appetite and overall objectives. The Company's enterprise risk management program includes reviews of cybersecurity vulnerability and the actions necessary to enhance the security of our information systems. Consideration of risk is inherent in the Board's consideration of our long-term strategies and in the transactions and other matters presented to the Board, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures, and environmental, health and safety updates. 
Our Board provides guidance to management regarding risk management as appropriate. The senior executives manage and mitigate, to the extent possible, material risks on a day-to-day basis. The roles of the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Audit Committeeโthe Audit Committee is generally responsible for oversight of guidelines and policies with respect to risk assessment and the oversight of material financial risk exposures; and 
โข Compensation Committeeโthe Compensation Committee is generally responsible for considering any risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices. 
[END TABLE]
Each of these committees along with our senior executives are responsible for periodically reporting to the Board the material risks facing the Company and highlighting any new material risks that may have arisen since they last met.
Audit Committee 
Our Audit Committee currently consists of Jacques Croisetiรจre, Dr. Yi Hyon Paik and Susan C. Schnabel. Mr. Croisetiรจre is the chairperson of our Audit Committee. The Board has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are financially literate and meet the independence requirements mandated by the applicable NYSE listing standards, Section 10A(m)(3) of the Exchange Act and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board has also determined that Mr. Croisetiรจre and Ms. Schnabel are each "audit committee financial experts" under applicable listing standards of the NYSE and applicable rules of the SEC.
Our Audit Committee is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข carrying out the responsibilities and duties delegated to it by the Board, including its oversight of our financial reporting policies, our internal controls and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements applicable to financial statements and accounting and financial reporting processes;

[END TABLE]
Our Audit Committee has adopted a formal policy concerning the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that all services to be performed by KPMG LLP and its affiliates, including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and permitted non-audit services, be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to one year, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is subject to a budget. Specific services being provided by the independent registered public accounting firm are regularly reviewed in accordance with the pre-approval policy and the Audit Committee may pre-approve particular services on a case-by-case basis. The Audit Committee has delegated the authority to grant pre-approvals to Mr. Croisetiรจre, the Audit Committee chairperson, when the full Audit Committee is unable to do so. At each subsequent Audit Committee meeting, the Audit Committee reviews these pre-approvals, receives updates on the services actually provided by the independent accountants, and management may present additional services for approval. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the amount of fees to be paid to the independent registered public accounting firm for audit, audit-related, tax compliance and other permissible non-audit services for fiscal 2019. The Audit Committee has concluded that KPMG LLP providing such services is consistent with maintaining KPMG LLP's independence. Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of our consolidated annual financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting and reviews of our quarterly financial statements, as well as audits of subsidiary financial statements (including statutory audits), regulatory filings, consents and other SEC-related matters. 
Our Board has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, which is available on our website at www.versummaterials.com in the "Governance" section, and upon written request by our stockholders at no cost.
14     2019 PROXY STATEMENT
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is governed by the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Company's Board. The Board has determined that each current member of the Audit Committee, Jacques Croisetiรจre, Dr. Yi Hyon Paik and Susan C. Schnabel, is an "independent" director based on Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act, the listing standards of the NYSE and our Corporate Governance Guidelines, and that Mr. Croisetiรจre and Ms. Schnabel are each "audit committee financial experts" under applicable listing standards of the NYSE and applicable rules of the SEC.
The Audit Committee reviews the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on those audited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence and the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee is also directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight and termination of the independent auditor and appointed KPMG LLP to serve in that capacity for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. KPMG has been retained as the Company's independent auditor since the Company became an independent, publicly traded company on October 1, 2016. The Audit Committee believes the appointment of KPMG LLP is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
As part of that role, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10โK for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 with the Company's management and independent registered public accounting firm;  
โข discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the applicable auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, including any critical audit matters; and  
โข received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm as required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committees concerning independence, and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor's independence from Versum Materials and its management.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee approved the audited consolidated financial statements and recommended to the Board that they be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee has also appointed KPMG LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019 and is presenting its appointment to the stockholders for ratification.

Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Thomas J. Riordan, Jacques Croisetiรจre and Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff. Mr. Riordan is the chairperson of the Compensation Committee. The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee meets the independence requirements of the SEC and NYSE applicable to compensation committee members.
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข establishing and reviewing the overall compensation philosophy of the Company;  
โข reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers' compensation, including annual performance objectives, if any;  
โข evaluating the performance of the Chief Executive Officer in light of these corporate goals and objectives and, either as a committee or together with the other independent directors (as directed by the Board), determining and approving the annual base salary, bonus, equity-based incentives and other benefits, direct and indirect, of the Chief Executive Officer;  
โข reviewing and approving or making recommendations to the Board on the annual base salary, bonus, equity-based incentives and other benefits, direct and indirect, of the other executive officers;  
โข considering policies and procedures pertaining to expense accounts of senior executives;  
โข reviewing and approving, or making recommendations to the Board with respect to incentive-compensation plans and equity-based plans that are subject to the approval of the Board, and overseeing the activities of the individuals responsible for administering those plans;  
โข reviewing and making recommendations to the Board, or approving, all equity-based awards, including pursuant to the Company's equity-based plans;  
โข monitoring compliance by executives with the rules and guidelines of the Company's equity-based plans; 
โข reviewing and monitoring all employee retirement, profit sharing and benefit plans of the Company; and  
โข reviewing and recommending to the Board the form and amount of compensation to be paid to our non-employee directors.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee which is available on our website at www.versummaterials.com in the "Governance" section, and upon written request by our stockholders at no cost.
With respect to our reporting and disclosure matters, the responsibilities and duties of the Compensation Committee include overseeing the preparation of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis for inclusion in our annual proxy statement or Annual Report on Form 10-K in accordance with applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The charter of the Compensation Committee permits the Compensation Committee to delegate any or all of its authority to one or more subcommittees and to delegate to one or more officers of the Company the authority to make awards to any non-Section 16 officer of the Company under the Company's incentive-compensation or other equity-based plans, subject to compliance with the plan and the laws of the state of the Company's jurisdiction. 
Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee is authorized to engage an outside advisor to assist in the design and evaluation of our executive compensation program, as well as to approve the fees paid to such advisor and other terms of the engagement. Prior to the retention of an outside advisor, the Compensation Committee assesses the prospective advisor's independence, taking into consideration all relevant factors, including those factors specified in the NYSE listing standards.
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee again engaged Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook") as its compensation consultant. FW Cook advised the Compensation Committee on executive officer and non-employee director compensation. The Compensation Committee did not engage any other compensation consultant in fiscal 2018. At the direction of the Compensation Committee, FW Cook provided advice on the development of incentive compensation programs, compensation trends, regulatory developments and governance issues and other matters of interest to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee assessed FW Cook's independence, taking into account a number of factors such as: (1) the provision of other services to Versum Materials by FW Cook; (2) the amount of fees received from Versum Materials; (3) FW Cook's policies and procedures to prevent conflicts of interest; (4) any business or personal relationship between the FW Cook team members and the members of the Compensation Committee; (5) any Versum Materials stock owned by FW Cook or by the FW Cook team members; and (6) any business or personal relationship between any employee of FW Cook and any Versum Materials executive officer. FW Cook provided the Compensation Committee with appropriate assurances regarding its independence. The Compensation Committee concluded that FW Cook has been independent throughout its service to the Compensation Committee and that there are no conflicts of interest.

The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee oversees the management succession planning process. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews and evaluates succession plans relating to the CEO and other executive officer positions and makes recommendations to the Board with respect to the selection of individuals to occupy these positions. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is working with an executive search firm to assist with our CEO succession planning process. A comprehensive review of executive talent determines readiness to take on additional leadership roles and identifies developmental and coaching opportunities needed to prepare our executives for greater responsibilities.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also oversees our environmental, health and safety performance and our sustainability program. As part of that oversight, management periodically reports on key environmental, health and safety metrics and trends, certain safety incidents and learnings, program enhancements and safety culture. Management also reports to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee on its sustainability program, including program structure and management, key environmental, social and governance metrics and targets and future actions. 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT      17
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND RELATED MATTERS
In nominating candidates to serve as directors, the Board's objective, with the assistance of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, is to select individuals whose particular experience, qualifications, attributes and skills can be of assistance to management in operating our business and enable the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibility effectively. When evaluating director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers, among other things, whether individual directors possess (a) minimum individual qualifications, including strength of character, mature judgment, familiarity with the Company's business and industry, independence of thought and an ability to work collegially and (b) all other factors it considers appropriate, which may include age, gender and ethnic and racial background, existing commitments to other businesses, potential conflicts of interest with other pursuits, legal considerations such as antitrust issues, corporate governance background, relevant career experience, relevant technical skills, relevant business or government acumen, financial and accounting background, executive compensation background and the size, composition and combined expertise of the existing Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates candidates recommended by stockholders on a substantially similar basis as other nominees. In considering the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board monitors the mix of specific experience, qualifications and skills of its directors in order to assure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively in light of the Company's business and structure. In addition, although the Board does not have a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees, among the many factors that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee carefully considers are the benefits to the Company of national origin, gender, race, as well as differences in perspective, global business experience and cultural diversity in board composition. Further, the Board does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, gender, religion, disability or sexual preference in selecting director candidates. 
When considering whether the directors and nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of the Company's business and structure, the Board focused primarily on the biographical information set forth on pages 6 through 8. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considered the following characteristics about each director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Seifi GhasemiโMr. Ghasemi has deep experience in the specialty chemicals industry. His prior executive leadership of an international specialty chemicals and materials company provides the Board with broad experience in navigating many of the challenges Versum Materials faces, such as portfolio management, strategic planning, talent management and international operations.  
โข Guillermo NovoโMr. Novo has over thirty years of leadership experience in the specialty materials industry and brings to the Board detailed insight into the Company's worldwide customers, markets, operations and strategies.  
โข Jacques CroisetiรจreโAs the former chief financial officer of multinational companies, Mr. Croisetiรจre brings extensive financial expertise and leadership experience to the Board, including experience in the global specialty materials industry.  
โข Dr. Yi Hyon PaikโAs the former president of a multinational company, Dr. Paik provides the Board with extensive leadership experience in the electronic materials industry including strategic planning and global business expertise with a deep technical understanding. 
โข Thomas J. RiordanโMr. Riordan provides the Board with the benefit of over 40 years of senior executive experience with global companies including legal, human resources and specialty materials experience.  
โข Susan C. SchnabelโMs. Schnabel provides the Board with her extensive financial and management expertise, experience with global transactions and significant board of directors experience.  
โข Alejandro D. WolffโAmbassador Wolff brings to the Board substantial experience in governmental and international affairs, strategic planning, human resources and distinguished leadership experience.

For a description of the procedures for stockholders to submit proposals regarding director nominations, see "Director Candidate Recommendations by Stockholders" below.
Our Board has adopted a written charter for the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee which is available on our website at www.versummaterials.com in the "Governance" section, and upon written request by our stockholders at no cost.
Board Structure 
Our Board is led by the non-executive Chairman. The Chief Executive Officer position is currently separate from the Chairman position. The Board believes that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions is appropriate corporate governance for us at this time. Accordingly, Mr. Ghasemi serves as Chairman, while Mr. Novo serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our Board believes that this structure best encourages the free and open dialogue of competing views and 
18     2019 PROXY STATEMENT
provides for strong checks and balances. Additionally, Mr. Ghasemi's attention to Board and committee matters allows Mr. Novo to focus more on overseeing the Company's day to day operations as well as strategic opportunities and planning. 
Whenever the Chairperson of the Board is also the Chief Executive Officer or is a director who does not otherwise qualify as an "independent director," the independent directors may elect annually from among themselves a Lead Director of the Board. Service as Lead Director is generally for one year. The Lead Director helps coordinate the efforts of the independent and non-management directors in the interest of ensuring that objective judgment is brought to bear on sensitive issues involving the management of the Company and, in particular, the performance of senior management. The Lead Director's responsibilities, which are described in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข presiding over all meetings of the Board at which the Chairperson is not present, including any executive sessions of the independent directors or the non-management directors; 
โข assisting in scheduling Board meetings and approve meeting schedules to ensure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; 
โข requesting the inclusion of certain materials for Board meetings; 
โข communicating to the CEO, together with the Chairperson of the Compensation Committee, the results of the Board's evaluation of CEO performance; 
โข collaborating with the CEO on Board meeting agendas and approving such agendas; 
โข collaborating with the CEO in determining the need for special meetings of the Board; 
โข providing leadership and serving as temporary Chairperson of the Board or CEO in the event of the inability of the Chairperson of the Board or CEO to fulfill his/her role due to crisis or other event or circumstance which would make leadership by existing management inappropriate or ineffective, in which case the Lead Director shall have the authority to convene meetings of the full Board or management; 
โข being available for consultation and direct communication if requested by major stockholders; 
โข acting as the liaison between the independent or non-management directors and the Chairperson of the Board, as appropriate; 
โข calling meetings of the independent or non-management directors when necessary and appropriate; and 
โข recommending to the Board, in concert with the chairpersons of the respective Board committees, the retention of consultants and advisors who directly report to the Board, including such independent legal, financial or other advisors as he or she deems appropriate, without consulting or obtaining the advance authorization of any officer of the Company. 
[END TABLE]
Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff has served as Lead Director since May 2017. The next election of Lead Director is currently scheduled for the date of the Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders.
Executive Sessions of Non-Management and Independent Directors 
Non-management directors meet in executive sessions of the Board in which management directors and other members of management do not participate. These sessions are periodically scheduled for non-management directors at meetings of the Board. In addition, generally several times a year, the independent directors of the Board meet in a private session that excludes management and non-independent directors.

Cash(1) $ 100,000

Audit Committee Chairperson $ 20,000

(1) Cash compensation is paid quarterly in arrears. We also reimburse all of our board members for their expenses in attending Board and committee meetings.  
(2) In November 2018 our Board increased the annual equity compensation of each non-employee director from a grant date fair value of $100,000 to a grant date fair value of $115,000 for grants made on or after the date of our 2019 annual meeting. 
(3) In November 2018 our Board increased the annual Chair retainer from $50,000 to $57,500 effective for fiscal 2019. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee believes that a mix of cash-based and equity-based compensation best serves the Company because it aligns the interests of our non-employee directors with the interests of our stockholders and allows us to be competitive in a tight market for the services of qualified non-employee directors. This pay mix is generally aligned with peer median. For information about our peer group companies, please see "Executive CompensationโCompensation Discussion and AnalysisโCompensation Program for Executive Officers โSetting Compensation Levels" on pages 29 and 30. 
The Board adopted the Versum Materials Deferred Compensation Program for Directors ("Director DCP") which became effective on January 1, 2017. Under the Director DCP, our non-employee directors may voluntarily defer all or a part of their equity compensation. At the election of the director, a number of deferred stock units equal to the number of shares of our common stock the participant would have received on the date the compensation would otherwise have been granted will be credited to an account which is deemed to be invested in the Company's common stock. The deferred stock units are subject to any vesting conditions that would have applied absent the deferral election. Each deferred stock unit entitles the director to receive one share of Company stock upon payout, which generally occurs within 60 days of the first anniversary of the date the director's service on the Board ends or within 30 days of a change in control. Deferred stock units earn dividend equivalents in an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid on the shares of common stock underlying the deferred stock units held in the participating director's account. The number of dividend equivalents credited to the director's account is equal to the amount of the dividend payment divided by the closing price of our common stock reported on the NYSE on the dividend payment date. Deferred stock units and dividend equivalents thereon have no voting rights until the common stock underlying such deferred stock units and dividend equivalents are delivered and settled in shares of our common stock.

(1) Represents the grant date fair value of common stock computed in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, without taking into account estimated forfeitures, based on the closing price on the NYSE of our common stock on the grant date. Only Ambassador Wolff elected to defer his fiscal 2018 equity compensation. For fiscal 2018, each non-employee director was entitled to receive $100,000 in equity compensation. In fiscal 2018, the Board moved from granting fully vested common stock to directors quarterly in arrears to granting time-vesting restricted stock units in a single annual grant. Due to the timing of this shift, in accordance with SEC rules, the amounts reported in this column represent two grants - (i) one award of fully vested common stock granted in arrears for the first four months of fiscal 2018 (for service from October 1, 2017 through the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders) in respect of a number of shares equal to $33,000 divided by the closing price of our common stock reported on the NYSE on the grant date and (ii) an award on the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders of a number of time-vesting restricted stock units ("RSUs") equal to $100,000 divided by the closing price of our common stock reported on the NYSE on the grant date (for service from January 30, 2018 through the date of the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders). As of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, each of our non-employee directors (other than Ambassador Wolff who elected to defer his fiscal 2018 equity compensation and therefore held 2,919 deferred stock units) held 2,919 unvested RSUs (including accrued dividend equivalents).

Roles of the Compensation Committee, Management and Compensation Consultant in the Compensation Process 
Our Compensation Committee retained FW Cook as its independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on compensation programs for the Company's executive officers. FW Cook advises the Compensation Committee on executive as well as director compensation. See pages 24 and 25 for a description of our director compensation. In addition, the Compensation Committee considers input from our CEO regarding compensation of our executive officers (except as to his own compensation). 
Benchmarking Compensation of our NEOs 
FW Cook benchmarked the compensation of each of our NEOs for fiscal 2018 against those serving in similar capacities within the Versum Materials Peer Group described on pages 29 and 30 and with general industry survey data of similarly sized companies. The Compensation Committee reviewed and considered this data in setting the compensation programs for our NEOs for fiscal 2018. The combined base salary, short-term cash incentives and long-term equity incentive awards (together, "Total Direct Compensation") for fiscal 2018 of our NEOs was positioned in a range around the median of the Versum Materials Peer Group and general industry survey data.
Overview of the Versum Materials Executive Compensation Program 
Our Compensation Committee has established compensation programs which are designed to support the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Target Total Direct Compensation within a range around the median of the Versum Materials Peer Group

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In setting compensation, the Compensation Committee has adopted certain compensation practices that it viewed as in the best interests of our stockholders: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Objective Performance Criteria. Our performance-based compensation for our NEOs is based upon objective criteria - Adjusted EBITDA for our short-term incentives and relative and absolute total stockholder return for our long-term incentives. 
โข Stock Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements. We have stock ownership guidelines and retention requirements to more closely align the interests of our NEOs with our stockholders. 
โข Compensation Recovery Clawbacks. We have adopted an incentive compensation clawback policy. In addition, our employment agreements and equity award agreements with our NEOs as well as our short-term and long-term incentive plans contain clawback provisions. 
โข No Tax Gross-Ups. No agreements with our executive officers contain tax gross-ups, nor does the Compensation Committee intend to award tax gross-ups in the future other than as part of relocation benefits provided under Company policy.  
โข Commitment to Strong Governance Practices. Our strong governance practices reflect our commitment to thoughtful stewardship of the Company's resources. The following practices, among others, demonstrate our commitment to this principle: 
Substantial "At Risk" Compensation Short-term (cash) incentives and long-term incentives (equity awards) are "at risk." There is no minimum award or guaranteed payment.  
Independent Compensation ConsultantOur Compensation Committee is advised by FW Cook, an independent compensation consultant. 
Independent Compensation ConsultantOur Compensation Committee is advised by FW Cook, an independent compensation consultant. 
Independent Directors Our Compensation Committee consists of independent directors responsible for compensation decisions. 
Executive Sessions Our Compensation Committee meets in executive sessions. 
No Hedging or Pledging We prohibit hedging or pledging of Company stock. 
"Double Trigger" Equity awards accelerate vesting in the event of a change in control only upon a "double trigger." 
Capped Payouts Capped payouts under short-term and long-term incentive plans. 
No Repricing No repricing of stock options or issuance of discount stock options (i.e. the exercise price must be at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant) without stockholder approval. 
Limited Perquisites No excessive or unusual perquisites.

[END TABLE]
The fiscal 2018 allocation of the three primary components of executive compensation for our CEO and for our other NEOs as a group was targeted as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Compensation Mix Other NEOs Compensation Mix 
[END TABLE]
As a result of this target allocation, approximately 81% of the Total Direct Compensation of our CEO was "at risk" compensation. Long-term incentive awards consisted of Market Stock Units ("MSUs") and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs"). See pages 32 through 34 for a description of these awards. For our other NEOs, the fiscal 2018 target allocation included approximately 69% of "at risk" compensation. The actual weighting of the elements of the compensation mix for fiscal 2018 awarded to our CEO and other NEOs will ultimately depend on Company performance. In setting the NEOs' compensation, the Compensation Committee generally targets Total Direct Compensation in a range around the median of the Versum Materials Peer Group, which peer group is further discussed below under "โSetting Compensation Levels." Our NEOs have the opportunity to earn above-median pay if our financial results and stock performance exceed our pre-established target achievement levels and below median pay if our financial results and stock performance are below such target achievement levels. 
Setting Compensation Levels
With input from the Company's management, FW Cook proposed an industry peer group for fiscal 2018 consisting of 15 specialty chemicals and electronic equipment companies for reference in determining fiscal 2018 compensation, and developed benchmark executive officer compensation data. The Compensation Committee reviewed and approved the peer group for fiscal 2018. The companies in this peer group were selected based on screening criteria that included similarity to Versum Materials on revenue, market capitalization, total assets, international presence, number of employees, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. For fiscal 2018 compensation planning, the Compensation Committee determined to remove LANXESS Solutions and FEI Company from the Company's peer group, as both companies were acquired and, as a result, no longer served as appropriate peers.

Overall, the Compensation Committee seeks to provide a target Total Direct Compensation opportunity for Versum Materials executive officers in a range around the median for companies in the Versum Materials Peer Group. The individual components of target Total Direct Compensation may be established at a higher or lower amount than the median level depending on several other factors considered by the Compensation Committee such as the NEO's experience, skill set, expected future contributions, retention criticality, responsibilities relative to the market benchmark and internal parity among the NEOs. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee set the target Total Direct Compensation for the Versum Materials NEOs in a range around the median of the Versum Materials Peer Group to recognize the Company's status as an independent publicly-traded company. Total Direct Compensation realized may vary significantly from target opportunities for short-term and long-term incentives based on the financial performance of the Company and/or its share price movement. 
Fiscal 2018 Compensation Components 
Base Salary
We believe it is important to provide a competitive level of fixed pay to attract and retain experienced and successful executives. The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries annually or at other times when appropriate, and may adjust base salaries from time to time pursuant to such review based upon the executive's current compensation, time in position, any change in the executive's position or responsibilities, including complexity and scope and the relation of his or her position to those of other executives within the Company and in similar positions at peer companies. The base salaries approved for our NEOs for fiscal 2018 are positioned in a range around the median base salaries of the Versum Materials Peer Group and in a range around the median of the general industry survey data:

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Short-Term Incentives
Our Amended and Restated Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "STIP") is an annual cash incentive plan that rewards NEOs for their contributions towards specific annual financial goals. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee chose Adjusted EBITDA as the financial performance measure for our NEOs' annual bonus opportunity under the STIP. The Compensation Committee believes Adjusted EBITDA is both a key financial measure for our stockholders, and also the most appropriate financial measure to assess our annual operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that management and the Board of Directors believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated based upon our reported net income excluding interest expense, the write-off of financing costs, income tax provision, depreciation and amortization expense, non-controlling interests, and business separation, restructuring and cost reduction actions. 
Fiscal 2018 Short-Term Incentive Opportunity
For fiscal 2018, target bonus payouts under the STIP were based on meeting the Company's Adjusted EBITDA target, which was $415 million. The 2018 Adjusted EBITDA target for our NEOs was set based upon our consolidated annual budget at constant exchange rates approved by our Board of Directors and reflected an 11.7% increase over fiscal 2017 actual Adjusted EBITDA. The fiscal 2018 incentive opportunity provided for a range of potential payouts both above and below the bonus target. Threshold payout for earning any short-term annual cash incentive award required attaining at least 90% of the targeted level of Adjusted EBITDA. The payout amount is interpolated linearly for results between 90% and 110% of the targeted levels of Adjusted EBITDA, with a 50% award payout at 90% of the targeted level of Adjusted EBITDA, a 100% award payout at 100% of the targeted level of Adjusted EBITDA, and a 200% award payout at 110% or more of the targeted level of Adjusted EBITDA. After the annual incentive payout amount is calculated based on Adjusted EBITDA, the Compensation Committee may then, at its discretion, decrease the calculated incentive payout amount otherwise payable to each NEO for safety performance or other factors.
Each NEO's target annual bonus is expressed as a percentage of his or her fiscal 2018 base salary. The target bonus opportunities as a percentage of each executive's fiscal 2018 base salary and a maximum bonus of twice the target were approved by the Compensation Committee. The only changes over 2017 were 10% target bonus increases for Mr. Bitto and Mr. Shober in connection with their promotions. For fiscal 2018, the NEOs' threshold, target and maximum bonus opportunities, as a percentage of fiscal 2018 base salaries, were as follows:

2019 PROXY STATEMENT      31
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Fiscal 2019 Short-Term Incentive Opportunity
In November 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that the fiscal 2019 annual incentive opportunity for NEOs would be subject to the STIP, and like the fiscal 2018 short-term incentive opportunity, would be based on an Adjusted EBITDA financial performance measure, the same range of payouts and the same payout thresholds expressed as percentages of the targeted level of Adjusted EBITDA. See "Short-Term Incentives" above. In determining the final payout amount for each NEO, the Compensation Committee may consider the Company's safety performance, individual performance or other factors. The Compensation Committee approved the following fiscal 2019 target bonus percentages for our NEOs who are currently executive officers (as a percentage of fiscal 2019 base salary) which are unchanged from fiscal 2018 target bonus percentages: Mr. Novo-100%; Mr. Bitto-85%; Mr. Valente-75%; and Mr. Shober-75%.
Long-Term Incentives
Long-term incentive awards are a key component of our executive compensation program. Long-term incentive compensation is awarded under the Versum Materials, Inc. Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "LTIP") and provides an opportunity for executive officers, including our NEOs and other key employees, to increase their ownership interest in the Company through grants of equity-based awards. Under the LTIP, equity-based awards may be awarded in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and other equity-based awards. Ownership of equity interests by our NEOs is a fundamental part of our compensation philosophy and furthers the goal of aligning management's interests with the interests of stockholders in value creation. In addition, our long-term equity compensation is designed to reward sustained financial performance and provide our executive officers and key employees with a retention incentive which, in turn, contributes to stability in key leadership roles. Each NEO's target long-term incentive opportunity is approved annually by the Compensation Committee. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee granted the following awards under the LTIP: 
Fiscal 2018 Annual Awards
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs"). The PSUs are designed primarily to reward total stockholder return performance relative to the Versum Materials Peer Group, and to a lesser extent, continued service with the Company; and  
โข Market Stock Units ("MSUs"). The MSUs are a type of restricted stock unit that are designed primarily to reward contributions in increasing the market value of our common stock, and to promote continued service with the Company.  
[END TABLE]
Upon vesting, each PSU and MSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock, which aligns the interests of management with the interests of stockholders in stock price appreciation and value creation. Dividend equivalents accrue in an amount equal to the aggregate cash dividends paid with respect to our common stock divided by the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on each dividend record date and are delivered if and when the underlying awards vest.
For each NEO, the Compensation Committee set the target long-term incentive opportunity for fiscal 2018 at approximately the median of the Versum Materials Peer Group and set the threshold and maximum potential payout based on a percentage of the dollar value target recommended by FW Cook. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee implemented a long-term incentive program with awards consisting of 60% PSUs and 40% MSUs. The number of units granted to each NEO was calculated based upon the 10-trading-day average closing price of our common stock prior to the date of grant. The Compensation Committee determined that the size and nature of the award was appropriate in light of our goal to retain executives, drive financial performance and align management's interests with the interests of our stockholders in creating value. The following table summarizes the allocation of fiscal 2018 and 2017 annual equity-based awards granted to our NEOs:

These awards include a clawback provision whereby participant awards may be reduced or recouped in certain situations. See "โEmployee Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Practices and PoliciesโClawback Policy" on page 37. 
Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units. The number of PSUs granted represents a number of shares to be received upon vesting assuming target level of performance achievement. Pursuant to the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, the number of PSUs that vest, if any, is based on the Company's total stockholder return or "TSR" (measured using the average closing stock price of our common stock over the first 20 trading days of the period compared to the last 20 trading days of the period, including for the purposes of such calculation all dividends and distributions made or declared (assuming that such dividends or distributions are reinvested in the common stock of the Company)) over the period beginning on October 1, 2017 and ending on September 30, 2020 as compared to the TSR for the Versum Materials Peer Group during the same performance period. Depending upon the Company's total stockholder return percentile rank as compared against the TSR of the Versum Materials Peer Group, between 0 and 200% of the target number of PSUs will vest on the vesting date. The maximum number of PSUs that may vest with respect to each of these grants is twice the target number awarded, and the maximum number of PSUs eligible to vest is capped at the target number granted if our absolute total stockholder return over the performance period is negative. The PSUs vest on the date that the Compensation Committee certifies the payout under the performance goals, subject to the executive's continued employment through such certification date and continued compliance with our code of conduct. Vesting of PSUs earned, if any, is subject to certain exceptions in the event of specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company (see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" on pages 50 and 51), and is based upon the table below. The "% of Target Award Vesting" is interpolated linearly between points.

Market Stock Units. The number of MSUs granted represents a number of shares to be received upon vesting assuming target level of performance achievement. Pursuant to the Market-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, the number of MSUs that will vest, if any, is determined based on the product of (1) the Company's stock price multiplier (the "Company Stock Price Multiplier"), which is based on the percentage change in the price of the Company's common stock over the period October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2020 (measured using the average closing stock price of our common stock over the first 20 trading days of the period and the last 20 trading days of the period), and (2) the target number of MSUs. If the Company Stock Price Multiplier is less than 0.5, reflecting a common stock price decrease of more than 50%, no MSUs will vest. The maximum number of MSUs that may vest with respect to each of these grants is 150% of the target number of MSUs granted. The MSUs vest on the date the Compensation Committee certifies the payout under the performance goals, subject to the executive's continued employment through such certification date and continued compliance with our code of conduct. Vesting of MSUs earned, if any, is subject to certain exceptions in the event of specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company (see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" on pages 50 and 51), and is based upon the table below.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
In fiscal 2018, our NEOs were granted the following number of MSUs, assuming a target level of performance achievement: Mr. Novoโ20,966 MSUs; Mr. Bittoโ8,405 MSUs; Mr. Valenteโ5,036 MSUs; Mr. Shoberโ5,036 MSUs; and Mr. Loughlinโ3,357 MSUs. 
The Compensation Committee believes the PSUs and MSUs granted in fiscal 2018 are consistent with the Compensation Committee's concept of pay for performance. We believe that this equity-based pay for performance philosophy, coupled with our stock ownership guidelines, aligns the interests of senior management with stockholders by tying compensation to our financial performance and stockholder return over the three-year performance period, while simultaneously providing incentives designed to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers. The number of awards we granted under the Existing LTIP as a percentage of our annual weighted average shares outstanding (commonly referred to as the "burn rate") was 0.2% for fiscal 2018 (based upon target achievement and without regard to forfeitures). 
Converted Performance Shares
Air Products performance shares granted in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 were converted into Versum Materials performance shares with the same general terms and vesting schedule as the Air Products performance shares. See page 39 for additional information regarding the treatment of long-term incentive awards outstanding at the time of our separation from Air Products on October 1, 2016, when Versum Materials became an independent, publicly traded company. Performance shares entitle the recipient to receive one share of stock and accumulated dividend equivalents for each performance share earned upon the satisfaction of performance objectives and other conditions to earning the award. The shares were delivered after the three-year performance period based on actual performance.  The Compensation Committee aligned the performance measures to the portions of the three-year performance period that elapsed prior to and after our separation from Air Products. 
FY2015-2017 Performance Shares. For the shares granted in fiscal 2015, the Compensation Committee determined that two-thirds of the payout factor was based upon the Air Products TSR percentile rank compared to the TSR of the Air Products Peer Reference Group members over the pre-separation (October 1, 2014 to September 30, 2016) portion of the performance period, and one-third was based upon the Versum Materials TSR percentile rank compared to the TSR of the Versum Materials Peer Group members over the post-separation (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2017) portion of the performance period. The Air Products Peer Reference Group consists of chemical and industrial companies with similar capital structures, asset intensity, and profitability to Air Products (size adjusted, based on data from Farient Advisors, LLC, external compensation consultant to Air Products). The Versum Materials Peer Group is described on pages 29 and 30. The payout factor could range from 0% to 200% percent based on relative TSR percentile rank. The "Payout%" is interpolated linearly between points. In November 2017, the Compensation Committee certified the payout factor for the fiscal 2015 performance shares at 198% based on TSR performance during the three-year performance. The number of shares of stock earned by our eligible NEOs under these awards were as follows: Mr. Novo - 36,664; Mr. Bitto - 13,167; Mr. Valente - 4,217; Mr. Shober - 4,138; and Mr. Loughlin - 7,595. Our eligible NEOs also received cash payments equal to the dividend equivalents received with respect to these shares as follows:  Mr. Novo - $42,305; Mr. Bitto - $15,193; Mr. Valente - $4,866; Mr. Shober - $4,775; and Mr. Loughlin - $8,764.
FY2016-2018 Performance Shares. For the performance shares granted in fiscal 2016, the Compensation Committee determined that one-third of the payout factor was based upon the Air Products TSR percentile rank compared to the TSR of the Air Products Peer Reference Group members over the pre-separation (October 1, 2015 to September 30, 2016) portion of the performance period, and two-thirds was based upon the Versum Materials TSR percentile rank compared to the TSR of the Versum Materials Peer Group members over the post-separation (October 1, 2016 to September 30, 2018) portion of the performance period. The payout factor could range from 0% to 200% percent based on relative TSR percentile rank. The "Payout%" is interpolated linearly between points. In November 2018, the Compensation Committee certified the payout factor for these converted performance shares at 97% based on TSR performance during the three-year performance period as shown below:

Fiscal 2017 Founders RSUs
Founders Grant of Restricted Stock Units ("Founders RSUs"). The Founders RSUs were a one-time award of time-vesting restricted stock units granted at the time of our separation from Air Products and were designed to support alignment with stockholders, to retain key executives in a period of our transition to a new public company and to recognize the contributions of our NEOs to the successful spin-off transaction. One-third of the Founders RSUs vested on October 1, 2018, one-third vest on October 1, 2019 and one-third vest on October 1, 2020, subject to continued employment. Vesting is subject to exceptions in the event of specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company (see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" on pages 50 and 51).  These awards include a clawback provision whereby participant awards may be reduced or recouped in certain situations. See "โEmployee Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Practices and PoliciesโClawback Policy" on page 37.
Fiscal 2019 Long-Term Incentive Awards
For fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee implemented a long-term incentive program with awards consisting of 60% performance-based restricted stock units and 40% time-vesting restricted stock units with the following approximate aggregate values for our NEOs who are currently executive officers: Mr. Novoโ$2,700,000; Mr. Bittoโ$1,000,000; Mr. Valenteโ$600,000; and Mr. Shoberโ$600,000. These awards were composed of the following number of PSUs and RSUs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units ("PSUs"): Our NEOs who are currently executive officers were granted the following number of PSUs, assuming a target level of performance achievement: Mr. Novoโ35,034 PSUs; Mr. Bittoโ12,975 PSUs; Mr. Valenteโ7,785 PSUs; and Mr. Shoberโ7,785 PSUs.  
โข Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"): Our NEOs who are currently executive officers were granted the following number of RSUs: Mr. Novoโ32,073 RSUs; Mr. Bittoโ11,878 RSUs; Mr. Valenteโ7,127 RSUs; and Mr. Shoberโ7,127 RSUs. In addition, in recognition for their efforts in successfully completing our enterprise resource planning system implementation and the administrative separation from Air Products, Mr. Bitto was granted a one-time award of 4,454 RSUs and Mr. Valente was granted a one-time award of 2,969 RSUs.  
[END TABLE]
The structure and terms of the fiscal 2019 PSU awards is the same as the fiscal 2018 annual awards described under "Fiscal 2018 Annual Awards," except that the performance measurement period for the fiscal 2019 PSU awards is from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021.
For fiscal 2019, the Compensation Committee decided to award RSUs in lieu of MSUs. The Compensation Committee, with the advice of FW Cook, determined that awarding RSUs was more consistent with the practices of the Versum Materials Peer Group, while still supporting alignment with stockholders and the retention of executive officers. Upon vesting, each RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock, which aligns the interests of management with the interests of stockholders in stock price appreciation and value creation. Dividend equivalents accrue in an amount equal to the aggregate cash dividends paid with respect to our common stock divided by the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on each dividend record date and are delivered if and when the underlying awards vest.
2019 PROXY STATEMENT      35
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Subject to the terms of the Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement, including the executive's continued employment through the vesting date and continued compliance with our code of conduct, the RSUs will vest on September 30, 2021. Vesting of RSUs is subject to certain exceptions in the event of specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company (see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" on pages 50 and 51).  These awards include a clawback provision whereby participant awards may be reduced or recouped in certain situations. See "โEmployee Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Practices and PoliciesโClawback Policy" on page 37.
Granting Practices
The Compensation Committee generally determines annual executive officer long-term incentive awards each year at a meeting of the Compensation Committee in the first calendar quarter of such fiscal year. In addition to annual awards, other grants may be awarded at other times:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข to attract new hires, to recognize employees for special achievements or for retention purposes; 
โข to new employees as a result of the acquisition of another company; or 
โข as may be desirable and prudent in other special circumstances. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee generally approves equity grants based on estimated fair market values, therefore the actual market value of such awards may vary nominally from the approved amounts. The exercise price of any option grant will not be less than the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. If at the time of any planned equity grant any member of the Compensation Committee is aware of any material nonpublic information concerning Versum Materials, the Compensation Committee will generally delay the planned grant until such time as the material non-public information has been fully disseminated in the market. We monitor and periodically review our equity grant policies to ensure compliance with plan rules and applicable law.
Employee Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Practices and Policies 
Retirement Benefits. The Company maintains a tax-qualified 401(k) plan (the "Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan") under which the Company matches 66 2/3% for each 1% contributed up to 6% of an employee's contributions, for a maximum employer match of 4%. The Company may also make a discretionary profit sharing contribution to the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan which can range from 0-5%.  The Company made a 3% profit sharing contribution for fiscal 2018 and will make at least a 2% profit sharing contribution for fiscal 2019. In addition to the Company match and the discretionary profit sharing, the Company makes a contribution of 4% of each employees' base pay into the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. The Compensation Committee adopted the Versum Materials Deferred Compensation Plan ("Versum DCP") which became effective on January 1, 2017. The Versum DCP provides the executive officers and certain other highly compensated employees with the opportunity to defer, annually, the receipt of a portion of their annual base salary and bonus as a future supplemental retirement benefit in addition to that provided under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. The Company makes a contribution of 4% of each participant's annual bonus into the Versum DCP. Any Company match and other contributions to the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan that are tax limited under applicable law are instead contributed by the Company to the Versum DCP on behalf of participants. For additional information about the Versum DCP, see the description on page 47.
Welfare Benefits. Our executive officers, including our NEOs, are eligible for specified benefits, such as group health, dental and disability insurance and basic life insurance premiums. These benefits are intended to provide competitive and adequate protection in case of sickness, disability or death, and our NEOs participate in these plans on the same basis as all other employees. All participating employees, including our NEOs, pay a portion of the cost of these welfare benefits. 
Executive Personal Benefits. The Compensation Committee believes that executive personal benefits should be limited. Our executive officers, including our NEOs, are eligible to participate in an executive physical examination program that offers an annual comprehensive physical examination at a nominal cost to Versum Materials.
Severance, Retirement and Change in Control Arrangements. Severance and change in control arrangements are provided to support major corporate and management transitions. The Compensation Committee believes these arrangements benefit Versum Materials and its stockholders. Our severance and change in control arrangements with our NEOs are set forth in each NEOs' employment agreement, as described starting on page 48. See "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a summary of the arrangements in our incentive plans and the other benefits applicable to our executive officers. 
Executive Officer Stock Ownership. We have adopted a stock ownership policy for our executive officers, including our NEOs. The ownership guidelines are six times annual base salary for Mr. Novo, three times annual base salary for Messrs. Bitto, Valente, Shober and for our other senior vice presidents, and one times annual base salary for our vice presidents. Until the guidelines are met, each 
36     2019 PROXY STATEMENT
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
executive officer is required to retain a percentage of net profit shares (i.e., shares retained after satisfying tax obligations and exercise price, if any) from each equity award on exercise, vesting or payment. Our Chief Executive Officer is expected to retain 75% of such net profit shares and our other executive officers are expected to retain 50% of such net profit shares. If the ownership level drops below the ownership guideline after the ownership guideline is initially met, the retention requirement applies until the executive officer is back in compliance. Our executive officers may count towards these requirements the value of shares owned (including shares owned jointly with, or separately by, the executive officer's spouse), shares held in trust for the benefit of the executive officer or the executive officer's family members; and shares or share equivalents held in qualified or nonqualified savings, profit-sharing, or deferred compensation accounts if fully vested. Stock options, unvested restricted stock, unvested restricted stock units, and unearned performance-based shares and units are not counted for purposes of the ownership requirement. 
Hedging and Pledging Policy. Our executive officers and directors may not purchase or sell options, warrants, puts, calls or engage in similar transactions with respect to our stock, or sell our stock short. It is also our policy that shares of our stock owned by executive officers or directors may not be held in a margin account or pledged as collateral on a loan. In addition, our executive officers and directors may not engage in any transactions (including variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds) that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's equity securities. 
Clawback Policy. We have adopted an incentive compensation clawback policy. Consistent with the Company's core values, the Compensation Committee determined that it may be appropriate to recoup or "claw back" certain annual and long-term incentive compensation in specified situations. The Company may recoup paid incentive compensation if an executive officer or other employee's conduct leads to a restatement of the Company's financial results. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, seek to recoup the difference between the incentive compensation paid and the lower amount that would have been paid based upon accurate information or restated financial results. The policy also provides that the Company may recoup a reasonable amount of incentive compensation for activity detrimental to the Company resulting from a material breach of employment arrangements or violations of our code of conduct. The Compensation Committee has flexibility to update the policy to be consistent with any subsequent SEC rules on this topic. In addition, the Company generally includes a clawback right in its employment agreements, equity award agreements and incentive plans. 
Employment Agreements
Effective October 1, 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with each of our NEOs. Other than the amounts of annual base salary and target annual bonus award provided in each agreement and as indicated in the descriptions below, each of the employment agreements are substantially the same. For a description of termination and change in control provisions in the employment agreements, see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" starting on page 48. The employment agreements contain customary restrictive covenants relating to confidentiality, non-competition, non-disparagement, non-solicitation and intellectual property, and provide for the following compensation arrangements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข annual base salary, which shall be reviewed at least annually by the Board or the Compensation Committee;  
โข target annual bonus as a percentage of base salary, with payout based on attaining Board-established performance goals;  
โข eligibility for participation in the Company's long-term and short-term incentive plans;  
โข participation in the Company's employee benefit plans; and  
โข vacation subject to Company policy. 
[END TABLE]
IRC Section 162(m) 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), generally disallows public companies a tax deduction for federal income tax purposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to certain specified executive officers. For taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข these executive officers consisted of a public company's chief executive officer and each of the three other most highly compensated executive officers (other than the chief financial officer) whose compensation is required to be disclosed to stockholders under the Exchange Act; and  
โข qualifying "performance-based compensation" was not subject to this deduction limit if specified requirements were met. 
[END TABLE]
On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" ("TCJA") that significantly reformed the Code. Among other things, the TCJA eliminated the performance-based compensation exception formerly available under Section 162(m) of the Code, effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and expanded the scope of covered employees, such that the remuneration of a public company's chief financial officer is also subject to the deduction limit. As a result, compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1 million will not be deductible except to the extent it may be grandfathered under the TCJA or qualifies for other transition relief.
2019 PROXY STATEMENT      37
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Prior to the TCJA, our compensation plans were structured so that performance-based compensation paid under the plans was generally intended to be tax deductible. The TCJA provides a transition rule with respect to certain remuneration which is provided pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on November 2, 2017 and which was not materially modified after that date. The Company also remains subject to a transition rule applicable to newly public companies. To the extent applicable, the Company will seek to avail itself of these transition rules. Because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder (as amended by the TCJA), including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the TCJA, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) of the Code will in fact meet those requirements. While our Compensation Committee is mindful of the benefit of compensation deductibility in its compensation decisions, our Compensation Committee believes that we should not be constrained by such considerations where they would impair our flexibility in compensating our executive officers in a manner that can best promote our corporate objectives and attract and retain executive talent.

โช Treatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Outstanding at the Time of Separation 
[END TABLE]
Prior to our separation from Air Products on October 1, 2016, when Versum Materials became an independent, publicly traded company, our NEOs were compensated by Air Products. Long-term incentive awards granted to employees under Air Products' Long-Term Incentive Plan that were outstanding on October 1, 2016, other than restricted stock, were adjusted using the following principles:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Awards were adjusted to maintain the economic value of those awards before and after the separation from Air Products; and 
โข Other than certain performance shares, treatment of which is described below, the terms of equity awards, such as the vesting schedule and dividend equivalent rights, generally continued unchanged. 
[END TABLE]
The following table provides additional information regarding conversion of each type of Air Products equity award:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Award Type Conversion Methodology 
Stock Options Air Products stock options were converted into options to purchase Versum Materials common stock, with the number and exercise price adjusted to maintain economic value. 
Restricted Stock Units Air Products restricted stock units were converted into Versum Materials restricted stock units, with the number adjusted to maintain economic value. 
Performance Shares Air Products performance shares were converted into Versum Materials performance shares, with the number adjusted to maintain economic value. 
[END TABLE]
With respect to historical equity awards granted to our NEOs and reflected in the compensation tables that follow:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Converted Air Products Stock Options.  Air Products stock options granted to Versum Materials NEOs were converted into options to purchase Versum Materials stock, with the number and exercise price adjusted to maintain economic value. These stock options vested in three consecutive, equal annual installments on the first, second, and third anniversary of the grant dates. Dividends do not accrue with respect to stock options.  
โข Converted Air Products Restricted Stock Units.  Air Products restricted stock units granted to certain Versum Materials NEOs in fiscal years 2014, 2015 and 2016 were converted into Versum Materials restricted stock units, with the number adjusted to maintain economic value. The converted restricted stock units generally vest in full four years after the grant date. Each restricted stock unit entitles the holder to one share of stock and accrued dividends upon vesting. Accrued dividends are paid in cash on or about the vesting date in an amount equal to the dividends that accrued from the grant date of the restricted stock units to the vesting date. Vesting of converted Air Products restricted stock units is subject to certain exceptions in the event of specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company (see "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" on pages 50 and 51).  
โข Converted Air Products Performance Shares. Air Products performance shares granted in fiscal years 2015 and 2016 to Versum Materials NEOs were converted into Versum Materials performance shares with generally the same terms as the Air Products performance shares in an amount adjusted to maintain their economic value. For additional information on the terms of these converted awards, see "- Versum Materials Fiscal 2018 Compensation Components - Long-Term Incentives - Converted Performance Shares." Each converted performance share entitled the holder to one share of Versum Materials stock and accrued dividend equivalents upon satisfaction of performance conditions. Dividend equivalents were paid in cash on or about the vesting date in an amount equal to the dividends that accrued from the grant date of a performance share to the vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with the October 2016 conversion of the Air Products stock options and performance shares into Versum Materials stock options and performance shares, we recognized incremental fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for each of Messrs. Novo, Bitto, Valente, Shober and Loughlin in the aggregate amounts of $50,890, $41,849, $7,190, $12,394 and $23,468, respectively, in fiscal 2017.

(3)  For fiscal 2017, as described above under "Treatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Outstanding at the Time of the Separation," stock options granted by Air Products and that remained outstanding at the time of our separation from Air Products were adjusted to maintain the economic value of those awards and converted into converted stock options that vest and are exercisable for shares of Versum Materials stock.  In connection with this conversion, we recognized incremental fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 for each of Messrs. Bitto, Shober and Loughlin in the amounts of $23,576, $6,837 and $13,264, respectively.

(2) These amounts are determined using the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on September 28, 2018 of $36.01, the last trading day of fiscal 2018.  
(3) This column includes equity-based awards that, as of the fiscal year end, remained subject to performance-vesting conditions. These awards were granted in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 and are conditioned upon performance achievement following a three-year performance period that ends, as to the awards granted in fiscal 2017, on September 30, 2019, and as to the awards granted in fiscal 2018, on September 30, 2020, in each case, subject to the executive's continued employment through the date after the performance period on which the Compensation Committee certifies performance achieved. The number of fiscal 2017 PSUs and MSUs reported reflects the number of shares deliverable assuming maximum performance, because actual performance during the performance periods was between target and maximum. The number of fiscal 2018 PSUs and MSUs reported reflects the target number of shares deliverable, because actual performance during the performance periods was below target. The amount reported also includes dividend equivalents that accrued with respect to the PSUs and MSUs. The actual number of shares that will be delivered with respect to such awards is not yet determinable. All of these performance-vesting equity awards are subject to special vesting treatment upon specified termination events, retirement or upon a change in control of the Company. See "โPotential Payments Upon Termination or Change in ControlโTreatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control" starting on page 50. 
(4) Converted awards include the following: 
(i) Converted performance shares granted in fiscal 2016 that, as of the fiscal year end, remained subject to the executive's continued employment through the date after the performance period ending on September 30, 2018, on which the Compensation Committee certifies performance achieved. The number of shares included in the table above and reported below is based on actual performance at the end of the performance period which was 97% of target. As these awards remained subject to time-vesting conditions at fiscal year end, they are reported in the column "Number of Shares or Units of Stock Held That Have Not Vested" in the table above. Converted awards do not accrue dividend equivalents, but instead accrue cash dividends to be delivered only upon vesting of the underlying shares.

(ii) A special recruiting grant of 965 converted restricted stock units granted to Mr. Valente on June 1, 2015. These units are forfeited upon termination of employment other than due to death or disability prior to vesting. Mr. Valente's restricted stock units are scheduled to vest in full on June 1, 2019. As these awards remained subject to time-vesting conditions at fiscal year end, they are reported in the column "Number of Shares or Units of Stock Held that Have Not Vested" in the table above.  Converted awards do not accrue dividend equivalents, but instead accrue cash dividends to be delivered only upon vesting of the underlying shares. 
(iii) Time-vesting converted restricted stock units granted to Messrs. Bitto, Valente, Shober and Loughlin that vest in full four years after the grant date. As these awards remained subject to time-vesting conditions at fiscal year end, they are reported in the column "Number of Shares or Units of Stock Held that Have Not Vested" in the table above.  Converted awards do not accrue dividend equivalents, but instead accrue cash dividends to be delivered only upon vesting of the underlying shares.

The number of fiscal 2018 PSUs and MSUs reported reflects the target number of shares deliverable, because actual performance during the performance periods was below target.

Versum Materials adopted the Versum DCP, which became effective January 1, 2017. The purpose of the Versum DCP is to provide certain management and highly compensated employees with the opportunity to defer, annually, the receipt of a portion of their cash compensation as a way of supplementing the retirement benefits provided under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. Currently, U.S. tax laws limit the amounts that may be contributed to tax-qualified savings plans and the amount of compensation that can be taken into account in computing benefits under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. The Versum DCP is intended to make up, out of general assets of the Company, an amount substantially equal to the benefits an eligible employee did not receive under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan due to these limits.
Participants may elect to defer up to 50 percent of base salary on a before-tax basis (offset by amounts deferred under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan). The Versum DCP provides a matching credit in the same amounts as matching contributions under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. In addition to base salary, participants may elect to defer up to 100% of STIP awards. No matching credit is provided for these elective deferrals. Accrued benefits under the Versum DCP would be paid out in a lump sum, subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, within 90 days of a change in control of Versum Materials. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, participants may elect from time to time to have their Versum DCP balance invested in the same investment choices as available under the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan. Participants may elect to receive payments of their Versum DCP balance in a lump sum or in up to five annual installments, in either case commencing twelve months following termination from service.

(3) a merger or consolidation involving the Company or its stock or an acquisition by the Company, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, of another entity or its stock or assets in exchange for the stock of the Company is consummated, unless, immediately following such transaction, 50.1% or more of the then outstanding Voting Securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or entity will be (or is) then beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by the individuals and entities who were the beneficial owners of the Company's outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to such transaction (treating, for purposes of determining whether the 50.1% continuity test is met, any ownership of the Voting Securities of the surviving or resulting corporation or entity that results from a stockholder's ownership of the stock of, or other ownership interest in, the corporation or other entity with which the Company is merged or consolidated as not owned by persons who were beneficial owners of the Company's outstanding Voting Securities immediately prior to the transaction); or

Treatment of Long-Term Incentive Awards Upon Termination, Death or Disability, Retirement and Change in Control
Voluntary Termination or Termination for Cause 
The outstanding Air Products awards converted to Versum Materials equity awards, along with the Founders RSUs and the annual award of PSUs and MSUs granted by the Company, will generally be forfeited upon a voluntary termination or upon any termination by the Company for cause, including all unvested stock options, all restricted stock units and all performance shares, whether or not earned. Exercisable stock options would continue to be exercisable for 90 days following a voluntary termination and, if not timely exercised, would be forfeited. 
Involuntary Termination Without Cause 
Upon involuntary termination or termination without cause of a Versum Materials NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Exercisable stock options remain exercisable for 180 days. 
โข Founders RSUs vest pro rata through termination and are delivered on the next original vesting date together with accrued dividend equivalents.  
โข Converted time-vesting restricted stock units vest pro-rata and are delivered immediately together with accrued cash dividends.  If the NEO is retirement eligible, the converted time-vesting restricted stock units continue to vest per their original terms (as if the employee remained an active employee) and are paid together with accrued cash dividends at the end of the four-year vesting period. 
โข A pro rata portion of all performance-vesting equity awards will vest based on actual performance and be delivered on the original vesting date.  
[END TABLE]
Death or Disability 
Upon termination due to death or disability of a Versum Materials NEO: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Exercisable stock options remain exercisable for the rest of their term as if the NEO remained employed.  
โข Founders RSUs immediately vest.  
โข Converted time-vesting restricted stock units are paid together with accrued cash dividends immediately in the event of death, and on the original vesting date in the event of disability.  
โข A pro rata portion of all performance shares and annual grant PSUs and MSUs vest based on actual performance and are delivered on the original vesting date along with accrued dividends and dividend equivalents, as applicable.  
[END TABLE]
Retirement 
Upon retirement (as further described below), a retirement-eligible Versum Materials NEO (i.e. having attained the age of 55 for Air Products plans and 62 for Versum Materials plans and having satisfied a combined Air Products and Versum Materials five-year service requirement) would receive the following treatment of their outstanding long-term incentive awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข Exercisable stock options remain exercisable for the rest of their term as if the NEO remained employed.  
โข Founders RSUs vest pro rata through termination and are delivered on the next original vesting date together with accrued dividend equivalents.

โข All performance-vesting equity awards and dividend equivalents thereon would be delivered on the original vesting schedule. A pro-rata portion of performance shares for the portion of the performance period that the individual was employed based on actual performance and associated dividend equivalents would be paid in accordance with the original schedule and at the original payout level if performance thresholds are met.  
[END TABLE]
Definitions 
For purposes of each of the long-term incentive awards, the following definitions apply. 
"Cause" has the meaning set forth in the employment agreement described above.
"Disability" means
(1) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months, or 
(2) the receipt of income replacement benefits for a period of not less than three months under an accident and health plan of the Company by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. An Employee shall be deemed to have suffered a Disability if determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration.
"Good Reason" has the meaning set forth in the employment agreement described above.
Change in Control
Converted Awards
For awards granted on or after October 1, 2014, the awards provide for "double trigger" vesting upon a change in control of Versum Materials instead of automatic vesting on an accelerated basis upon a change in control (i.e. "single trigger vesting"). These awards will not automatically vest on an accelerated basis as a result of a change in control if they are replaced by the surviving entity. For the double trigger provisions to apply, the replacement awards must be issued by a publicly listed company and preserve the value of, and be on terms as favorable as the existing award; performance conditioned awards must be replaced by time-based vesting awards; and the replacement awards must provide that if the participant is terminated without Cause or voluntarily terminates for Good Reason within 24 months following the change in control, the award will vest immediately upon termination. The awards also provide that, pursuant to an agreement associated with a change in control or in the discretion of the Versum Materials board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof, awards may be settled for cash at the change in control price. 
Awards Granted by the CompanyโAnnual Awards and Founders Awards 
Versum Materials' equity awards provide for "double trigger" vesting upon a change in control of Versum Materials instead of automatic vesting on an accelerated basis upon a change in control. Upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company prior to the end of the performance period, unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, each of the respective award units converts into the right to receive a cash payment equal to the sum of (a) the product of the number of award units that would vest based on performance through the end of a shortened performance period ending on the date of the change in control of the Company and the price per share paid in such change in control and (b) interest through the end of the original Performance Period, with such payments to be made no later than 10 business days following the end of the original performance period; provided that the executive remains employed with the Company or any successor through the end of the original performance period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the executive's employment is terminated without cause by the Company or a resignation by the executive for good reason, in each case, during the 24-month period following such change in control but prior to the end of the original performance period, the cash payment will be paid within 10 days of such termination. 
Other Benefits 
Upon retirement (i.e. having attained the age of 62 and satisfied a combined Air Products and Versum Materials five-year service requirement), a Versum Materials employee, including our NEOs, would be entitled to unpaid base salary and accrued vacation, and to their vested benefits in the Versum Materials Retirement Savings Plan described under "โCompensation Program for Executive OfficersโEmployee Benefit Plans and Other Compensation Practices and PoliciesโRetirement Benefits" on page 36. Our executive officers would be entitled to their vested benefits in the Versum DCP described on page 47.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following table describes the potential payments and benefits that would have been payable to our NEOs assuming a termination of employment and/or a change in control occurred, in each case, on September 30, 2018.
Because the disclosures in the table assume the occurrence of a termination or change in control as of a particular date and under a particular set of circumstances and therefore make a number of important assumptions, the actual amount to be paid to each of our NEOs upon a termination or change in control may vary significantly from the amounts included herein. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event, the continued availability of benefit policies at similar prices and the type of termination event that occurs. Distributions of any plan balances that would be made upon retirement, if applicable, are set forth under "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" on page 47 and are not reflected in the following table.

(1) Includes the cost of COBRA payments for the Company's medical and dental plans based on rates in effect in fiscal 2018 and the value of outplacement benefits pursuant to each NEO's Employment Agreement and an amount equal to what the Company's matching and non-elective contributions to the executive's qualified and non-qualified plans would have been based on the executive's most recent deferral elections and base salary, respectively, for the 12 months following such termination. In the event of death of an NEO, in addition to amounts reported in the table above, each NEO will receive benefits from third-party payors under our employer-paid premium life insurance plans. All of our executives are eligible for two times their regular annual eligible wages, up to a maximum of $1 million, at death. If such benefits were triggered for the NEOs on September 30, 2018, under our life insurance plans the legally designated beneficiary(ies) of each NEO would have received the following amounts: Mr. Novo ($1,000,000); Mr. Bitto ($1,000,000); Mr. Valente ($800,000); Mr. Shober ($700,000); and Mr. Loughlin ($600,000).    
(2) These amounts reflect the value of the acceleration of any unvested time-based restricted stock units and dividend equivalents thereon, assuming the acceleration occurred on September 28, 2018, and based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on such date ($36.01).  
(3) Includes converted performance shares granted in fiscal 2016 reflected at the actual payout level. Amounts include accrued dividend equivalents.  
(4) The amount reported assumes no interest is paid on the accelerated shares, however, the actual amount of interest payable would be based on interest through the end of the vesting period. Unearned performance shares are reflected at the target payout level.  
(5) Converted time-vesting restricted stock units are paid together with accrued cash dividends immediately in the event of death and on the original vesting date in the event of disability.  Founders RSUs together with accrued dividends vest immediately in the event of death or disability. 
[END TABLE]
Departure of Named Executive Officer
Mr. Loughlin served as the Company's Senior Vice President, Operations and Supply Chain, through October 31, 2018. In connection with his departure and contingent on the conditions of his employment agreement, he will be entitled to receive the following:  $261,000 fiscal 2018 annual bonus paid within 90 days of departure; one-twelfth of his fiscal 2019 annual bonus based on actual performance to be paid when normally paid; payment of healthcare benefits under COBRA for 12 months or, if sooner, until his COBRA eligibility ceases (such medical, dental and vision benefits estimated at $8,099); $10,000 lump sum for outplacement services; $34,412 for the Company's matching and non-elective contributions to its qualified and non-qualified plans based on his most recent deferral elections and base salary, respectively, paid 12 months following his departure; and monthly cash payments over 12 months equal to $542,000 (representing his base salary in effect on September 30, 2018 plus 1/12th of his average annual bonus over the last three full fiscal years (i.e., $242,000)) to be paid in accordance with normal payroll practices and subject to lawful deductions and withholdings.
Because Mr. Loughlin was retirement-eligible under the Air Products plans on the date of our separation from Air Products, his outstanding equity awards will be treated as follows: (i) exercisable stock options remain exercisable for the rest of their term as if he remained employed; (ii) Founders RSUs will be delivered on October 1, 2019, calculated on a pro rata basis through Mr. Loughlin's departure date, together with accrued dividend equivalents; (iii) converted time-vesting restricted stock units vest per their original terms and will be paid together with accrued cash dividends pursuant to the terms of the award agreement; and (iv) unearned performance-vesting restricted share units and market share units (and dividend equivalents thereon) remain outstanding and will be delivered on the original vesting schedule based on actual Company performance for the applicable award cycle, calculated on a pro rata basis to account for Mr. Loughlin's service during the applicable performance period. See "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End" for a description of Mr. Loughlin's equity awards.
Since Mr. Loughlin was vested in the Versum DCP as of his departure date, he was entitled to his vested amounts.  See "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" for a description of Mr. Loughlin's Versum DCP balance.
2019 PROXY STATEMENT      53
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE
We are providing the following information about the ratio of the median annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. Novo, our CEO, for the year ended September 30, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
โข the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company was reasonably estimated to be $82,544. 
โข the annual total compensation of Mr. Novo was $4,809,960. 
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all other employees is approximately 58 to 1.
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC requirements under Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.
Excluding our CEO, we identified the median employee by examining fiscal 2018 total target cash compensation, which includes annual base salary and target annual cash bonus or sales incentives, for all individuals who we employed on September 28, 2018. We believe that the use of total target cash compensation paid to all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure that reasonably reflects compensation for our employee population because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. We used our global human resource information system of record for all of our employees worldwide. We included all of our employees, whether full-time or part-time, including any interns, and temporary employees, but excluding independent contractors such as individuals that we employ through an agency. For part-time workers, we did not adjust base cash compensation to the equivalent for a full-time employee. For full-time hourly employees, annual base salary was calculated using each individual's hourly pay rate assuming a normal full-time work schedule, and not the actual number of hours worked. We annualized the total target compensation for any individual that works full-time that we hired after October 1, 2017. We did not adjust for global cost of living differences.
After identifying the median employee based on the above methodology, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. To calculate our ratio, we divided Mr. Novo's annual total compensation, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table, by the median employee's annual total compensation.

STOCK OWNERSHIP
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, principal accounting officer and beneficial owners of more than 10% of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC. These parties are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all Forms 3, 4 and 5, and amendments thereto, that they file with the SEC. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms and amendments thereto we have received, and written representations from our directors and executive officers, we believe that with respect to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, all of these parties complied with all applicable filing requirements.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Review and Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Board has adopted a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our "related person policy." Our related person policy requires that a "related person" (as defined as in paragraph (a) of Item 404 of Regulation S-K) must promptly disclose to our general counsel, or such other person designated by our Board, any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) and all material facts with respect thereto. The general counsel, or such other person, will then promptly communicate that information to our Board. No related person transaction will be executed without the approval or ratification of our Board or a duly authorized committee of our Board. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest. 
Agreements with Air Products 
In connection with our separation from Air Products, when Versum Materials became an independent, publicly traded company, on September 29, 2016, we entered into a Separation Agreement, a Transition Services Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement, an Employee Matters Agreement, Intellectual Property Agreements and several other commercial agreements with Air Products to effect the separation and provide a framework for the allocation between us and Air Products of Air Products' assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits, and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation and that govern certain relationships between Air Products and Versum Materials after the separation. 
Indemnification and Insurance 
The Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL") authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breaches of directors' fiduciary duties as directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws provide that we must indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL. We are also expressly authorized to advance certain expenses (including attorneys' fees and disbursements and court costs), subject to certain undertakings. In any action by a director or officer to enforce a right to indemnification or by us to recover advances made, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified is placed on the Company. We maintain liability insurance for its directors and officers to provide protection where we cannot legally indemnify a director or officer and where a claim arises under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 against a director or officer based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty or other wrongful act and directors' and officers' liability insurance for our directors and officers. We believe that these indemnification provisions and insurance are useful to attract and retain qualified directors and officers. 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, no director shall be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability (1) for any breach of the director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its stockholders, (2) for acts or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (3) under Section 174 of the DGCL, or (4) for any transaction from which the director derived any improper personal benefit. Under the DGCL, to the extent that a person is successful on the merits in defense of a suit or proceeding brought against such person because they are or were one of the Company's directors or officers, such person shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in connection with such action. If unsuccessful in defense of a third-party civil suit or a criminal suit, or if such a suit is settled, that person shall be indemnified against both expenses, including attorneys' fees, and judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement if they acted in

good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the Company's best interests and, with respect to any criminal action, had no reasonable cause to believe their conduct was unlawful. If unsuccessful in defense of a suit brought by or in the Company's right, or if such suit is settled, that person shall be indemnified only against expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in the defense or settlement of the suit if they acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the Company's best interests, except that if they are adjudged to be liable for negligence or misconduct in the performance of their duty to the Company, they cannot be made whole even for expenses unless the court determines that they are fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses.
