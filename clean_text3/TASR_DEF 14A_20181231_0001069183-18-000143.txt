Table of Contents
What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name?
Shareholder of Record
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and the proxy statement and proxy card were sent directly to you by the Company. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name
If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the proxy statement and proxy card were forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the shareholder of record for purposes of voting at the Special Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to direct that organization how to vote the shares held in your account. 
How do I vote?
There are four ways to vote:
: Via the Internet. You may vote via the Internet by following the instructions on your enclosed proxy card.
( By telephone. You may vote by telephone by following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card.
, By mail. You may vote by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the envelope provided.
I In person. If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote in person at the Special Meeting. Bring your printed proxy card if you received one by mail. Otherwise, the Company will provide shareholders of record a ballot at the Special Meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and you wish to vote in person at the Special Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the organization that holds your shares. 
What constitutes a quorum in order to hold and transact business at the Special Meeting?
Under Delaware law and the Company's bylaws, the holders of a majority of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, at a meeting constitutes a quorum. Abstentions, but not broker non-votes, will be counted as present to determine whether a quorum has been established. Once a share of the Company's common stock is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and any adjournments or postponements. If a quorum is not present, the Special Meeting may be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.
How are proxies voted?
All valid proxies received prior to the Special Meeting will be voted. All shares represented by a proxy will be voted and, where a shareholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the shareholder's instructions.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
Shareholder of Record. If you are a shareholder of record and you indicate when voting on the Internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, or sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Special Meeting.

Table of Contents
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the proposal with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote."
Is this proposal considered "routine" or "non-routine"?
The proposal to approve the 2019 Plan is considered "non-routine." A broker or other nominee cannot vote without specific instructions from the beneficial owner on non-routine matters, and therefore we anticipate there will be broker non-votes in connection with this proposal.
Can I change my vote after I have voted?
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote at the Special Meeting by voting again via the Internet or by telephone (only your latest Internet or telephone proxy submitted prior to the Special Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or vote instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Special Meeting and voting in person. However, your attendance at the Special Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Special Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering to the Company's Corporate Secretary at 17800 North 85th Street, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255, a written notice of revocation prior to the Special Meeting. 
What is the voting requirement to approve the proposal?
Assuming the existence of a quorum at the Special Meeting, the proposal to approve the 2019 Plan requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes of shares of common stock properly cast for or against the proposal, in person or by proxy at the Special Meeting.
What if I don't vote? What if I abstain? How are broker non-votes counted?  
If you have not provided directions to your broker, you are strongly encouraged to vote your shares and exercise your right to vote as a shareholder. Abstentions and broker non-votes are generally not considered votes cast and will have no effect on the proposal to approve the 2019 Plan. 
Is my vote confidential?
Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within the Company or to third parties, except as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements; to allow for the tabulation and certification of votes; and to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.
Who will serve as the inspector of election?
The inspector of election will be Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.
Where can I find the voting results of the Special Meeting?
The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and, within four business days after the Special Meeting, the Company expects to report the final results on Form 8-K with the SEC.
Who will pay the cost of soliciting proxies?
The Company will bear the cost of solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting. Our Board is soliciting your proxy on our behalf. In addition to the use of mails, proxies may be solicited by personal interview, telephone, facsimile, e-mail or otherwise, by our officers, directors and other employees. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities. We have engaged Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee not to exceed of $35,000, plus reimbursement of reasonable expenses, and we have agreed to indemnify Innisfree M&A Incorporated against certain losses, costs and expenses. We also will request persons, firms and corporations holding

Members of the Board who are employees of the Company are not separately compensated for serving on the Board. Board compensation is reviewed periodically by the Company's Compensation Committee. In March of 2017, the Company retained Compensia Inc. to assist the Compensation Committee with reviewing peer group data and updating the Company's Board compensation. As a result of this analysis, the Compensation Committee approved updated compensation plans bringing the Company's total Board compensation levels in line with the median level of its peer group.

New Board members are eligible to receive an initial grant of RSUs with a grant date fair value equal to $160,000 in their first year of service vesting in equal annual installments over four years. The Chairman of the Board receives an additional $5,000 in cash per quarter and RSUs of the Company's stock with a grant date fair value equal to $20,000 vesting over one year. Board members that provide any special Board advisory consultations in their official capacity as a Board member (other than Board and committee meetings) are paid compensation at the rate of $2,500 per day or $1,250 per half day, with no pay for travel days. All directors are reimbursed for reasonable expense incurred in connection with their attendance at meetings.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
The purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis is to provide material information about our compensation objectives and policies and to explain and provide context for the material elements of the disclosure which follows in this proxy statement with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers ("NEOs").
Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee (in this section, the "Committee") assists the Board of Directors ("Board") in addressing matters relating to the fair and competitive compensation of our NEOs and non-employee directors, together with matters relating to our other benefit plans. The Committee is currently composed of three independent directors: Hadi Partovi (Chairman), Matthew McBrady, and Michael Garnreiter. The Committee makes the sole decision regarding compensation for the Chief Executive Officer and each NEO.
The Committee met five times in 2017. All Committee members were present for each meeting. 
Two members of management, Patrick W. Smith, CEO, and Luke Larson, President, attended portions of the meetings. The agendas for these meetings were determined by the Committee members prior to the meetings. The Committee generally receives and reviews materials in advance of each meeting. Depending on the agenda for the particular meeting, materials may include:
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  8
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial reports; 
• Reports on levels of achievement of corporate performance objectives; 
• Schedules setting forth the total compensation of the NEOs, including base salary, cash incentives, equity awards, perquisites and other compensation and any potential amounts payable to the NEOs pursuant to employment, severance and change of control agreements; 
• Summaries which show the NEOs' total accumulated stock awards and stock option holdings; 
• Information regarding compensation paid by comparable companies identified in executive compensation surveys; and 
• Reports from Compensation Committee consultants. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee's primarily responsibilities are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of NEOs, evaluate the performance of the NEOs in light of these goals and objectives and determine and approve the compensation level of NEOs based on that evaluation; 
• Evaluate and establish the incentive components of the CEO's compensation and related bonus awards, taking into account the Company's performance and relative shareholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to CEOs at comparable companies, the services rendered by the CEO and the awards given to the CEO in past years; 
• Review and approve the design of the compensation and benefit plans that pertain to the CEO and other NEOs who report directly to the CEO; 
• Administer equity-based plans, including stock incentive plans; 
• Approve the material terms of all employment, severance and change of control agreements for NEOs; 
• Retain compensation consultants and advisors as necessary, or appropriate, on an advisory basis to establish comparator groups, benchmarking and targets for compensation related matters; 
• Recommend to the Board the compensation for Board members, such as retainers, committee fees, chairman fees, stock awards and other similar items; 
• Provide oversight regarding the Company's benefit and other welfare plans, policies and arrangements; 
• Form and delegate authority to subcommittees when appropriate; and 
• Approve the Compensation Committee report to be included in the Company's SEC filings. 
[END TABLE]
The Committee's charter reflects these responsibilities, and the Committee and the Board periodically review and revise the charter. The full text of the Compensation Committee charter is available on our website at http://investor.axon.com/corporate-governance.
Role of Management and Consultants in Determining Executive Compensation
Our executive management supports the Committee in carrying out its responsibilities by preliminarily outlining compensation levels for NEOs, administering our benefit and other welfare plans and providing data to the Committee for analysis. Annually, compensation is initially proposed by the CEO for each executive (excluding the CEO), consisting of base salary, annual and long-term performance-based compensation and long-term equity compensation, which is then provided to the Committee for review and approval.
Our Committee has sole authority to engage the services of outside consultants and advisors, as it deems necessary or appropriate in the discharge of its duties and responsibilities. The Committee has budgetary authority to authorize and pay for the services of outside consultants and advisors, and such consultants and advisors report directly to the Committee. In 2014, the Committee retained compensation consulting firm, Aon Hewitt, who provided research, data analyses, benchmarking and design expertise in developing and structuring compensation programs for its executives. The Company continued to utilize that information as the core of its compensation structures, and engaged Compensia, Inc. to provide consulting services in the design of its 2017 and 2018 executive compensation plans.

Peer Comparator Group
The scope of Aon Hewitt's review in 2014 included determining an appropriate comparator group to compare the Company's executive compensation to, based primarily on the following criteria: Industry and Global Industry Classification code, revenue, EBITDA, market capitalization, and number of employees. Aon Hewitt selected companies in both manufacturing and technology to match the evolving nature of the Company's business. Companies selected typically had annual sales between $60 million and $250 million, with market capitalization of $450 million to $2.5 billion. Total employees of the comparator companies were targeted at between 300 and 700. In addition to the comparator group, Aon Hewitt gathered benchmark data for the Committee's review from the manufacturing and technology industries with similar revenue.
The Committee has selected the following comparator group when reviewing executive compensation:
[BEGIN TABLE]
AeroVironment, Inc.    IntraLinks Holdings, Inc.    SIFCO Industries Inc. 
Astronics Corp.    Limelight Networks, Inc.    Smith Micro Software Inc. 
CalAmp Corp.    LogMeIn, Inc.    Sparton Corp. 
Carbonite, Inc.    Numerex Corp.    The KEYW Holding Corp. 
CPI Aerostructures Inc.    Proofpoint, Inc.    VASCO Data Security International, Inc. 
Guidance Software, Inc.    Qumu Corp.      
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Philosophy
The Committee is in place to address matters relating to the fair and competitive compensation of our NEOs and non-employee directors, together with matters relating to our other benefit plans. The Committee believes that executive compensation should be aligned with the values, objectives and financial performance of the Company.
Objectives of NEO compensation include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain highly qualified individuals who are capable of making significant contributions critical to our long-term success; 
• Promote a performance-oriented environment that encourages Company and individual achievement; 
• Reward NEOs for long-term strategic management and the enhancement of shareholder value; 
• Strengthen the relationship between pay and performance by emphasizing variable, at-risk compensation that is dependent upon the achievement of specified corporate and personal performance goals; and 
• Align long-term management interests with those of shareholders, including long-term at-risk pay. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Programs
We utilize various non-cash compensation programs, in addition to traditional cash-based compensation methods. Specifically, we have utilized stock-based awards.
The principal components of compensation in 2017 and 2018 for our NEOs (other than the CEO) consist of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual salary; 
• Annual performance-based incentive plans, comprised of: 
• Commissions on sales growth and bookings; and 
• Payouts under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan based on the achievement of annual financial goals, including goals related to: consolidated revenue, Software and Sensors bookings (as defined in SEC filings), international combined bookings, operating income for the TASER Weapons segment, cumulative active booked seats, percentage of U.S. customers on a CEW service plan, and the number of new high value targets with greater than a 20 percent adoption rate; 
[END TABLE]
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  10
Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive equity compensation in the form of performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs") awarded pursuant to the TASER International, Inc. 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2016 Plan"); and 
• Long-term equity compensation in the form of service-based restricted stock units ("RSUs") awarded pursuant to the 2016 Plan. 
[END TABLE]
Any decision to materially increase compensation is based upon the objectives listed above, taking into account all forms of compensation, as well as based upon individual achievement of performance goals. These goals include revenue and pretax earnings targets as well as specific management tasks. Decisions regarding the CEO's compensation are made by the Committee and reflect the same considerations used for the other NEOs. The Board has not adopted any clawback policies, but adopted stock ownership guidelines in December 2018. Mr. Smith's compensation for 2018, following the approval of his non-qualified stock options subject to certain milestone vesting periods at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders (the "CEO Performance Award"), consists of an annual base salary of $24,000, consistent with the minimum wage requirements of Arizona law and the CEO Performance Award.
Benchmarking
For 2017, it was the Committee's intent that the total compensation for our NEOs be targeted between the 50th and the 75th percentile in relation to our established comparator group. The Committee believes that targeting this range will reflect competitive market pay practices, which balances our "pay for performance" strategy with our desire to offer competitive compensation with respect to our comparator group, thus allowing us to attract and retain management talent.
The table below compares the Company's continuing NEOs' target total direct compensation to our comparator group:

(2)  Positions and responsibilities reported for NEOs of comparator group companies varied, with not all companies reporting data for positions similar in nature and scope to those of the Company's NEOs (other than CEO and CFO). Judgment was used in calculating comparator group information by role, using blends of reported positions and excluding certain comparator group companies from comparisons when appropriate.  
(3)  Mr. Ahsan was appointed Chief Financial Officer of the Company effective April 3, 2017. 
(4)  Mr. Klint resigned from his roles as Senior Vice President and General Counsel, effective August 20, 2018.

The objective of the annual incentive payment plan and the use of equity-based awards in the form of PSUs have been to provide executives with a competitive total compensation opportunity, as well as to align executive rewards with results.
2017 Structure
The 2017 executive compensation structure included: payments under the annual cash incentive plan; PSUs that cliff vest based on three-year revenue goals; for Mr. Isner, sales-based commissions, paid quarterly; and, for Mr. Klint amounts based on the attainment of certain legal department operating metrics. Each component was designed to incentivize specific Company goals.
Payouts under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan were based on the achievement of annual financial goals, including goals related to: consolidated revenue, Software and Sensors bookings (as defined in SEC filings), international combined bookings, operating income for the TASER Weapons segment, cumulative active booked seats, percentage of U.S. customers on a CEW service plan, and the number of new high value targets with greater than a 20 percent adoption rate.The Committee believed the criteria for the annual cash incentive plan were challenging, but achievable.

Sales commissions were earned based upon specific sales targets for each eligible NEO. Because the sales commissions are tied to metrics such as sales growth and other operating results, the Committee did not set a maximum amount that could be paid under the plans for the NEOs.

[END TABLE]
The 2017 performance-based cash incentive plan metrics were measured and paid quarterly after the Company released its quarterly earnings. The first three fiscal quarters are weighted at 15% of the annual total with the fourth quarter equaling the remaining 55%. Each metric has a threshold, target and maximum goal with corresponding base payouts of 50%, 100% and 150% of target, respectively.The weighted average payout achieved under the 2016 performance-based cash incentive plan was 123%.
Payouts under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan for Mr. Isner were primarily based on growth of the Company's revenue and bookings. For 2017, approximately $320,000 was based on the growth of total 2017 consolidated revenue as compared to 2016, $130,000 was based on the growth of 2017 international combined bookings as compared to 2016, and $50,000 based on the completion of certain leadership courses.
Of the total payouts under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan for Mr. Klint, $100,000 was based on predetermined amounts of savings against the legal budget for 2017 as compared to 2016. No amounts were earned under this plan during 2017.
For PSUs granted during 2017, 50% of the awards vest based upon the compounded annual revenue growth rates for the total Company and 50% vest based on total international bookings, both metrics as compared to target for the three-year period ending December 31, 2019. Earned PSUs cliff vest and would be released in February 2020. Should actual performance metrics exceed targeted metrics, executives will receive additional PSUs, for a total of up to 200% of target. The Committee decided to introduce sales targets related to three-year growth rates to promote and reward the achievement of long-term objectives and long-term strategic planning by our NEOs. The 2019 consolidated revenue and international bookings metrics have threshold, target and maximum goals, based on compound annual growth rates, with payouts for each of these goals having payouts of 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively. If the threshold levels are not achieved, no amounts will be considered earned.

Pursuant to the employment agreements, the Company may terminate each of these officers with or without cause. The conditions or events triggering the payment of severance benefits include the executive's death, disability, termination without cause, termination for good reason, or termination due to change in control of the Company (i.e., double-trigger). Conditions to the payment of severance benefits include covenants relating to assignment of inventions, nondisclosure of Company confidential information, and non-competition with the Company for a period of 12 months after termination of employment.

Prior to the repeal of Section 162(m)'s performance-based exemption, we in general sought to structure our compensation programs in a manner intended to comply with Section 162(m), although our Compensation Committee reserved the right to provide compensation (such as base salary and service-based vesting RSUs) if, in its judgment, such payments were necessary to achieve our compensation objectives and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. However, despite the Compensation Committee's efforts to structure certain compensation elements in a manner 
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  17
Table of Contents intended to be exempt from Section 162(m) and therefore not subject to its deduction limits and because of ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m) and the regulations issued thereunder, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the legislation repealing Section 162(m)'s exemption from the deduction limit, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) in fact will.
Moreover, despite the availability of transition relief described above, the Committee believes that shareholder interests are best served by not restricting the Committee's discretion and flexibility in structuring its compensation programs. As such, the Committee has always, and continues to, reserve the right to amend arrangements that were initially intended to qualify as performance-based compensation for purposes of Section 162(m) if the Committee determines such amendments are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, even though such changes may cause the arrangements to fail to qualify for transition relief, resulting in a non-deductible compensation expense for the Company.
Going forward, the Committee will continue to monitor the impact that the repeal of the performance-based pay exception to Section 162(m) will have on the Company's compensation programs and contracts, including whether and to what extent our existing contracts and programs qualify for the transition relief described above.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
We adopted stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers and Board members in December 2018.  The stock ownership guidelines require that non-employee directors hold at least 8,000 shares of Company stock and that named executive officers own at least 50,000 shares of the Company's stock. For purposes of these guidelines, stock ownership includes shares for which the executive or director has direct or indirect ownership or control, including Axon common stock plus vested and unvested Axon stock options and restricted stock units, including unvested performance-based restricted stock units. Executives and directors are expected to meet their ownership guidelines once they have received enough grants to add up to the required minimum. 
2018 Compensation
CEO Performance Award 
On May 24, 2018, Axon's shareholders approved the Board of Directors' grant of stock options to purchase 6,365,856 shares of common stock to Patrick W. Smith. The CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational goals (performance conditions) and market capitalization goals (market conditions), assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the CEO Performance Award have a 10-year contractual term and will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization goal for such tranche, which begins at $2.5 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $1.0 billion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational goals focused on revenue or eight operational goals focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.

Annual Salary
Mr. Smith's annual base salary following shareholder approval of the CEO Performance Award was reduced to $24,000, consistent with the minimum wage requirements of Arizona law. 
Performance-Based Incentive Plans
The objective of the annual incentive payment plan and the use of equity-based awards in the form of PSUs have been to provide executives with a competitive total compensation opportunity, as well as to align executive rewards with results.
2018 Structure
In 2018, each component of incentive compensation is designed to incentivize specific Company goals.
Payouts under the 2018 annual cash incentive plan will be based on the achievement of annual financial goals, including goals related to: consolidated revenue, Axon bookings (as defined in SEC filings), international combined bookings targets (which will include TASER Weapons and Software and Sensors segment contracts), TASER Weapons segment operating income, active booked seats, the achievement of a certain percentage of U.S. agencies on TASER Weapons service plans, and achieving specified deployment targets with designated high value agencies. The Committee believes the criteria for the annual cash incentive plan are challenging, but achievable. Sales commissions are earned based upon specific sales targets for each eligible NEO. Because sales commissions are tied to metrics such as sales growth, the Committee has not set a maximum amount that can be paid under the plans for the NEOs. In 2018, the metrics tied to the annual cash incentive plan are typically capped at a 150% payout. However, agency adoption and active booked seats are calculated on a linear payout and therefore have no maximum payout.
Terms and conditions of the performance-based incentive plans for NEOs are established by the Committee. The following table sets forth the target performance-based incentive compensation of our continuing NEOs for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Long-Term Service-Based Equity Compensation
The Committee believes that service-based equity compensation with multi-year vesting periods ensures that our NEOs have a continuing stake in our long-term success. As such, the Committee granted RSUs, which generally vest over a three-year service period, to align our NEOs interests with those of shareholders and to motivate our NEOs to make strategic long-term decisions.
In determining the total number of RSUs to award to each NEO, the Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the strategic objectives of the Company over the next three years, and the practice of comparator group companies. The following table sets forth the service-based RSU awards made to our continuing NEOs in February and December 2017.

PAY RATIO OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION TO MEDIAN EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION 
The Company has determined that the 2017 annual total compensation of the estimated median compensated employee who was employed as of December 31, 2017, excluding the CEO, Patrick W. Smith, was $92,730. Mr. Smith's annual total compensation for 2017 was $3,765,675. Mr. Smith's annual total compensation is forty-one times (or a ratio of 41 to 1) that of the estimated median compensated Axon employee. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in accordance with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. Historically, the Company's annual grant of stock awards was in February of each year, but it was shifted to the preceding December to better coincide with the Company's internal budgeting process. The 2018 grants were made in December 2017. Accordingly, although these grants are intended as 2018 compensation, because they were granted in December 2017, they are reflected as compensation for 2017 in the Summary Compensation Table, which resulted in an increase in both the median employee and the CEO's compensation for 2017.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company's population consisted of 949 full-time employees. To identify the median compensated employee, we used a consistently applied compensation measure; in our case this has been defined as base salary, bonus and the grant date fair value of RSUs, which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of compensation received. Salaries are annualized for employee starting employment in 2017, but not adjusted for part-time or temporary status. This is reported in local currency and is then consistently converted using the 2017 exchange rates at the time of payment. To arrive at the median employee for Axon; actual total compensation of all selected employees was calculated in alignment with the method for calculating NEO total compensation. The resulting median from this population is identified as the 2017 median compensated employee as disclosed above.
The Company's compensation practices and programs are designed with the goal of ensuring compensation programs are fair, equitable, globally compliant and are aligned with its business objectives. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of

Table of Contents methodologies, exclusions, and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported above may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies, even those in a related industry or of a similar size and scope. Other companies may have different employment practices, regional demographics or may utilize different methodologies and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

(2)  RSUs granted vest annually over a period of three years from the grant date.  
(3)  The amount of PSUs that will ultimately vest, if any, is based upon the Company's compounded annual revenue growth rate (50% of target shares) and its compounded annual international bookings growth rate (50% or target shares) both compared to target for the three-year period ending December 31, 2019. Earned PSUs cliff vest at the end of that period. Should actual performance metrics exceed targeted metrics, executives will receive additional PSUs, up to a maximum of 200% of target.  
(4)  The amount of PSUs that will ultimately vest, if any, is based upon the Company's compounded annual revenue growth rate (80% of target shares) and its compounded annual EBITDA growth rate (20% of target shares) both compared to target for the three-year period ending December 31, 2020. Earned PSUs cliff vest at the end of that period. Should actual performance metrics exceed targeted metrics, executives will receive additional PSUs, up to a maximum of 200% of target. 
(5)  Payouts under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan were based on the achievement of annual financial goals, including goals related to: consolidated revenue, Software and Sensors bookings (as defined in SEC filings), operating income for the TASER Weapons segment, international revenue, the number of active users on the Company's Evidence.com platform, cumulative active booked seats, percentage of U.S. customers on a CEW service plan, and number of new high value targets with greater than a 20 percent adoption rate. However, cumulative active booked seats and number of high value targets were calculated on a linear payout and therefore had no maximum payout. Actual awards earned in 2017 were included in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table. 
(6)  Mr. Isner was eligible for commissions based on sales growth for the Company. There was no maximum amount related to these commissions. 
(7)  Mr. Behrendt's notice period under his employment agreement with the Company ended on March 15, 2018, and in accordance with his severance arrangement, his payout under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan was consistent with note (5) above. 
(8)  Mr. Womack's employment with the Company ended on November 4, 2017, at which time he became a part time international consultant. In connection with his consultant arrangement, 16,011 of the 48,038 service-based RSUs granted vested on February 28, 2018, while the remaining 32,027 RSUs were forfeited. The 8,006 performance-based RSUs granted were forfeited in full. Additionally, in connection with his consulting arrangement, Mr. Womack's payout under the 2017 annual cash incentive plan was consistent with note (5) above. 
(9)  Ms. Masenga's employment with the Company ended on September 1, 2017, and in connection with her severance agreement, the 1,509 service-based performance RSUs were forfeited. Amounts earned under the annual cash incentive plan through the second quarter of 2017 were paid with no additional amounts owed or payable under her severance agreement. 
(10)  RSUs granted vest annually over a period of one year from the grant date.  
(11)  Payouts under the 2018 annual cash incentive plan will be based on the achievement of annual financial goals, including goals related to: consolidated revenue, Axon bookings (as defined in SEC filings), international combined bookings targets (which will include TASER Weapons and Software and Sensors segment contracts), TASER Weapons segment operating income, active booked seats, the achievement of a certain percentage of U.S. agencies on TASER Weapons service plans, and achieving specified deployment targets with designated high value agencies.  
(12)  For 2018, Mr. Isner will be eligible for commissions based on sales growth for the Company. There is no maximum amount related to these commissions.

On July 1, 2013 the Company adopted the TASER International, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan ("DCP"). The DCP allows eligible executives, key employees and non-employee directors through which participants may elect to defer the receipt and taxation of a portion of their compensation.

Table of Contents
APPROVAL OF THE AXON ENTERPRISE, INC. STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN
At the Special Meeting, shareholders will be asked to approve the Axon Enterprise, Inc. 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"), which was approved by the Board on December 19, 2018, subject to shareholder approval at this Special Meeting. The full text of the 2019 Plan is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A-1.
General Information
The terms of the 2019 Plan generally mirror the terms of the 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"), which was approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting.  If approved by shareholders, the 2019 Plan will replace the 2018 Plan and no further awards will be made under the 2018 Plan following the effective date of the 2019 Plan (the "Effective Date").  The Board adopted the 2019 Plan in order to reserve a sufficient number of shares to facilitate the Company's new Axon eXponential Stock Performance Plan (the "XSPP"), which was adopted by the Board pursuant to the 2019 Plan, as well as to continue to allow the Company to make ordinary course equity incentive awards to eligible participants in the 2019 Plan in amounts previously approved by the shareholders under the 2018 Plan.  Under the XSPP, employees will be granted, subject to shareholder approval of the 2019 Plan at the Special Meeting, awards of eXponential stock units ("XSU"), a special type of performance-based restricted stock unit award modeled on the CEO Performance Award that was granted to Patrick W. Smith in February 2018 and approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting.  Pursuant to the XSPP, all eligible full-time employees will  be granted an award of 60 XSUs in January 2019 and certain employees have the opportunity to elect to receive a percentage of the value of their target compensation over the next nine years (2019-2027) in the form of additional XSUs.  For employees who elect to receive XSUs, the XSU grants will be made as an up front, lump sum grant in January 2019 and are intended to replace that portion of the target compensation they elect to receive in the form of XSUs for the next nine years. Accordingly, their go forward compensation will be reduced until 2027 by the amount of such compensation that the employees elect to receive in the form of XSUs.  Therefore, we expect that our future burn rate will decrease as we reduce the number of equity awards to be made to these employees over the next nine years. XSU awards under the XSPP will be granted subject to shareholder approval of the 2019 Plan at the Special Meeting and, if shareholder approval is not obtained, the XSU awards will be cancelled and employees who elected to received XSU awards will instead receive an award of restricted stock units under the 2018 Plan on the first business day after the Special Meeting or will have any target compensation amounts that were elected to be received in the form of XSUs reinstated.  For employees who received an automatic grant of 60 XSUs under the XSPP, such XSU awards will terminate and be forfeited if the shareholders do not approve the 2019 Plan. No replacement grants will be made for the automatic grants.  Like the CEO Performance Award previously approved by shareholders, the XSPP program and the XSU awards made thereunder will help the Company continue to grow and achieve its mission, which will in turn facilitate the creation of significant shareholder value. The Compensation Committee engaged Aon Equity Services in designing and modeling the XSU program. There are five main reasons why the Board recommends that shareholders approve the 2019 Plan. The XSPP and equity incentive awards under the 2019 Plan:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. Clearly substitute short-term guaranteed share-based compensation and cash compensation for long-term, performance-vesting share-based compensation to deliver market competitive total pay, 
2. Align the entire Company around clearly defined market cap, revenue and EBITDA performance goals through a broad-based plan that is offered to every employee, 
3. Strengthen Axon's ability to retain and recruit top technical talent, 
4. Further align the interests of employees with those of the Company's other shareholders, and 
5. XSUs are offered through a plan design that incorporated shareholder feedback and input. 
[END TABLE]
Employee retention and incentivization is instrumental to the success of the Company. The Company has an even bolder vision for the next ten years: to make the bullet obsolete and to enhance transparency in society's justice systems ensuring fair, effective justice for all.

The Company's wearable cameras and cloud services have transformed public safety, bringing the light of transparency to corners of society where brave men and women confront dangers most people never see. The Company plans to revolutionize this sector further with artificial intelligence technology to help law enforcement save time and save lives.
The XSPP ensures employee commitment and focus on delivering on a ten-year vision that can significantly increase shareholder value.
The XSUs are grants of restricted stock units, each with a term of approximately nine years, that vest in 12 equal tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests if, and only if, one market capitalization goal and one operational goal are attained and, subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a qualifying termination of employment, the recipient remains employed with the Company through achievement of the goals. The XSPP and the XSU grants are modeled after the CEO Performance Award, which was approved by the Company's shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market Capitalization Goals: There are 12 separate market capitalization goals and the initial market capitalization goal will be attained if, and only if, the Company's six-month and thirty-day average market capitalization equals or exceeds $2.5 billion. For each of the remaining 11 goals to be attained, the Company's market capitalization must continue to increase in $1 billion increments. For the full number of XSUs to vest, the Company's market capitalization must increase to $13.5 billion on both a six-month and thirty-day average market capitalization, nearly four times the Company's current market capitalization using the same six-month average. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operational Goals: There are 16 separate operational goals, based on escalating revenue and adjusted EBITDA, which the Compensation Committee believes will motivate top-line and bottom-line operational rigor. The initial revenue goal of $710,058,227, as adjusted for the acquisition of VIEVU in May 2018, reflects a significant increase over the Company's expected 2018 revenue and the initial adjusted EBITDA goal of $125,000,000 reflects more than double the Company's expected 2018 adjusted EBITDA. As described below, the revenue and adjusted EBITDA goals are not matched to each other and any 12 of the 16 can be paired with a market capitalization goal for a tranche to vest. The Compensation Committee believes this structure ensures a focus on proving the profitability of new lines of business while not becoming a constraint against investment flexibility in the long run. 
[END TABLE]
By combining market capitalization, revenue, and adjusted EBITDA goals, employees should be motivated to generate long-term value for shareholders by delivering operational results, without incentives to engage in short-term measures. If none of the market capitalization or operational goals are attained, no portion of the XSUs shall vest.  Further, no portion of the award is eligible to vest prior to the one-year anniversary of the grant date.
In addition, the XSPP contains an anti-dilution provision, which is used to calculate a maximum number of shares outstanding for purposes of determining achievement of the market capitalization goals whereby the maximum number of shares used to calculate the market capitalization goal is calculated by organically growing the current number of shares outstanding by 3% per year (the "XSU Maximum"). Any shares of Stock issued to Patrick W. Smith, the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("Mr. Smith"), upon the exercise of the stock options granted to Mr. Smith on February 26, 2018, shall increase the XSU Maximum. The XSU Maximum shall also be adjusted for acquisitions, spin-offs or other changes in the number of outstanding shares of common stock, if such changes have a corresponding adjustment on the market capitalization goals.

  Vesting Each of the 12 tranches vests only when both a market capitalization goal and an operational goal are certified by the Compensation Committee as having been met. Any one of the 16 operational goals can be matched with any one of the 12 market capitalization goals, but any single operational goal may only satisfy the vesting requirement for one tranche. A market capitalization goal and an operational goal that are matched together can be achieved at different points in time and vesting will occur at the later of the achievement certification dates for such market capitalization goal and operational goal.   Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms described in the XSU Award Agreement, once a goal is achieved, it is forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche. No vesting can occur before the one-year anniversary of the grant date.

Anti-Dilution Protection The XSPP contains an anti-dilution provision, which is used to calculate a maximum number of shares outstanding for purposes of determining achievement of the market capitalization goals whereby the current number of shares outstanding and grows organically by 3% per year. Any shares of Stock issued to Mr. Smith, upon the exercise of the stock options granted to Mr. Smith on February 26, 2018, shall increase the XSU Maximum. The XSU Maximum shall also be adjusted for acquisitions, spin-offs or other changes in the number of outstanding shares of common stock, if such changes have a corresponding adjustment on the market capitalization goals. 
Post-Vesting Holding Period 2.5 years with limited exceptions for amounts necessary to satisfy withholding taxes or in connection with a change in control or termination of employment. For certain highly compensated employees at least one tranche remains subject to the post-vesting holding period restrictions until the expiration date of the award. 
Employment Requirement For Continued Vesting Vesting eligibility is contingent upon continued employment with the Company through the achievement of the applicable goals. 
Termination of Employment No acceleration of vesting upon termination of employment. The holding period requirement may be waived in the event of a termination of employment without cause and is automatically waived upon a termination of employment due to death or disability (as such term is defined in the 2019 Plan). In addition, the Company may, in its discretion, accelerate the vesting of up to one tranche upon termination of employment. In the event of a termination of employment due to death, any additional tranches for which the performance goals are achieved within 24 months after the employee's death will be deemed vested and any applicable holding period requirement will be waived.

Change in Control No automatic acceleration of vesting upon a change in control, but in connection with a change in control, whether any unvested tranches vest will depend solely on the Company's attainment of the market capitalization goals at the time of the change in control (and the operational goals will be disregarded). For employees with employment agreements that provide for double-trigger acceleration of unvested equity awards, in the event that the employee's employment is terminated for any reason or the employee resigns for good reason (as defined in the relevant employment agreement), in either case within 90 days preceding or 12 months following a change in control, (1) in addition to any tranches that vest as a result of the preceding sentence, the XSUs shall accelerate and be deemed earned by one additional unvested tranche and (2) the holding period requirement shall automatically be deemed waived. The treatment of the XSUs upon a change in control is intended to align employees' interests with Axon's other shareholders with respect to evaluating potential transactions.

It is not possible to reliably estimate the value that could be realized under the XSPP because that value depends on the amount of dilution the Company experiences and the change in the value of the Company over the course of the nine-year term of the XSUs. The more dilution, the less value that employees will realize. While the Company has no way of predicting either future changes in the value of the Company or how much dilution there will be, some amount of future dilution is a certainty, whether due to additional issuances of equity as part of (i) regular compensation awards to the Company's employees, directors and consultants, including options that could become exercisable pursuant to the CEO Performance Award and XSUs that may vest under the XSPP, (ii) capital-raising activities, or (iii) mergers or acquisitions. Thus, it is not possible to know the actual value that employees will realize from the XSUs even if one were to assume that they were to fully vest in them.
Nevertheless, the table below depicts the maximum theoretical value up to the attainment of all of the market capitalization and operational goals, both in dollar value and as a percentage of total value created, that could be realized by employees holding XSU awards and Axon shareholders over various vesting scenarios. This table only takes into account the fully diluted share count as of September 30, 2018 and the closing stock price as of December 28, 2018, and models an annual adjustment for anticipated dilution of 2%. The table includes those awards that are anticipated to be granted under the 2019 Plan in January 2019 pursuant to elections made under the XSPP as shown under "New Plan Benefits" included in this proxy statement. Importantly, this table does not take into account any other future dilutive events over the next nine years even though such events may occur. Accordingly, this table should only be used for illustration purposes, recognizing that future dilutive events would significantly decrease the maximum value that employees would realize from the award over the various vesting scenarios, both in dollar value and as a percentage of total value created.

Historical Equity Award Data
The following tables illustrate the Company's three-year historical burn rate for 2015-2017 as well as the Company's anticipated 2018 burn rate. Burn rate is calculated as (i) the number of stock options and time-based restricted stock units ("TBRSUs") granted, plus (ii) the number of performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs") earned (assuming vesting at 100% for the 2018 burn rate), divided by (iii) the weighted average basic common shares outstanding in the year indicated. The Company's burn rate was as follows:

If the 2019 Plan is approved, the Company expects that its burn rate for the eight years after 2019 will decrease as we reduce the number of equity awards to be granted to employees outside of the XSU program.
In preparing the 2019 Plan, the Company has taken into consideration current best practices with respect to equity-based compensation plans. In this regard, the 2019 Plan contains the following provisions, which we believe reflect best practices for equity-compensation plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prohibits the repricing of stock options and stock appreciation rights ("SARs") without shareholder approval and prohibits the grant of stock options and SARs with discounted exercise prices.  
• No liberal share recycling. 
• Contains a definition of change in control whereby potential acceleration of awards will only occur in the event of an actual change in control transaction. 
• Includes, as a general rule, double-trigger vesting following a change in control 
• Provides that no portion of any award will vest prior to the 12-month anniversary of the grant date, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
• Provides that no dividend equivalent may be awarded in connection with any option or SAR granted under the 2019 Plan and that no dividends or dividend equivalents will be paid on full value awards until the underlying award vests.

[END TABLE]
The following is a summary of the material terms of the 2019 Plan that may be of importance to you. The summary is qualified by reference to the full text of the 2019 Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A-1.
Summary of Plan Features
Purpose
The Board believes that the 2019 Plan will promote the success and enhance the value of the Company by linking the personal interests of participants to those of Company shareholders. In particular, the 2019 Plan will allow the Company to implement the XSPP, which has been designed to maximize employee commitment and focus on delivering on a ten-year vision that can significantly increase shareholder value. The Board also believes that the 2019 Plan will enhance the Company's ability to attract and retain qualified persons to perform services for the Company, by providing incentives to such persons to put forth maximum efforts for the Company and by rewarding persons who contribute to the achievement of the Company's economic objectives.
Administration
The 2019 Plan will be administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee must be comprised of at least two (2) independent members of the Board. Each Compensation Committee member must be a "non-employee director" as defined in Rule 16b-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1943 (the "Exchange Act") and an "independent" director for purposes of the applicable NASDAQ Listing Rules. The Compensation Committee, by majority action, is authorized to interpret the 2019 Plan, to prescribe, amend, and rescind rules and regulations relating to the 2019 Plan, to provide for conditions and assurances deemed necessary or advisable to protect the interests of the Company, and to make all other determinations necessary or advisable for the administration of the 2019 Plan, to the extent they are not inconsistent with the 2019 Plan.
Subject to the express provisions of the 2019 Plan, the Compensation Committee will have the authority, to determine the participants who are entitled to receive awards under the 2019 Plan, the types of awards, the times when awards shall be granted, the number of awards, the purchase price, exercise price, or base value, if any, the period(s) during which such awards shall be exercisable (whether in whole or in part), the restrictions applicable to awards, and the form of each award agreement. Neither the award agreement nor the other terms and provisions of any award must be identical for each participant. The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, make a limited delegation of its authority to the Company's Chief Executive Officer to grant awards under the 2019 Plan to individuals who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee also will have the authority to modify existing awards, subject to specified provisions of the 2019 Plan and the listing requirements of NASDAQ. The 2019 Plan prohibits the Compensation Committee from repricing any previously granted option or SAR without first obtaining shareholder approval.
In the case of awards made to non-employee directors, the Board, and not the Compensation Committee, shall administer the 2019 Plan. 
Stock Subject to 2019 Plan 
The total number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2019 Plan is 6,000,000 shares of stock needed to fulfill the maximum vesting of awards under the XSPP, plus the number of shares of stock that are authorized but unissued under the 2018 Plan and all Prior Plans (as defined in the 2019 Plan) as of the Effective Date (1,718,802 as of December 
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  36
Table of Contents
27, 2018). Subject to the express provisions of the 2019 Plan, if any award granted under the 2019 Plan or any award outstanding under any Prior Plan after the Effective Date terminates, expires, or lapses for any reason, or is paid in cash, any stock subject to or surrendered for such award will again be available for the grant of an award under the 2019 Plan. The exercise of a stock-settled SAR, or broker-assisted "cashless" exercise of an option (or a portion thereof) will reduce the number of shares of stock available for issuance pursuant to the 2019 Plan by the entire number of shares of stock subject to that SAR or option (or applicable portion thereof), even though a smaller number of shares of stock will be issued upon such an exercise. Also, shares of stock tendered to pay the exercise price of an option or tendered or withheld to satisfy a tax withholding obligation arising in connection with an award will not become available for use under the 2019 Plan.
Eligibility
All employees, officers, non-employee directors of, and consultants to, the Company or an affiliate, as determined by the Compensation Committee, are eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan. As of December 28, 2018, this included 1,158 employees, 5 officers, and 7 non-employee directors. 
Non-Employee Director Compensation Limit
The 2019 Plan provides that the grant date fair value of all awards made under the 2019 Plan and all other cash compensation paid by the Company to any non-employee director in any 12-month period year shall not exceed $750,000. This limit only applies to compensation paid for services performed as a non-employee director and not in other capacities.
Awards Available Under the 2019 Plan
The following types of awards may be granted pursuant to the 2019 Plan: incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, SARs, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance share units, performance cash, stock grants and stock units.
Stock Options. The Compensation Committee may grant incentive stock options and nonqualified stock options under the 2019 Plan. Incentive stock options will be granted only to participants who are employees. The exercise price of all options granted under the 2019 Plan will be at least 100% of the fair market value of Company stock on the date granted and no option may be exercised more than ten years from the date of grant. The Compensation Committee will determine how the exercise price of an option may be paid and the form of payment, including, without limitation, cash, shares of stock held for longer than six months (through actual tender or by attestation), any net-issuance arrangement or other property acceptable to the Compensation Committee (including broker-assisted "cashless exercise" arrangements), and how shares of stock will be delivered or deemed delivered to participants. A participant will have no rights as a shareholder with respect to options until the record date of the stock purchase. No dividend equivalents may be awarded in connection with any option granted under the 2019 Plan. 
Stock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee also may grant SARs under the 2019 Plan. SARs give the participant the right to receive the appreciation in value of one share of common stock of the Company. Appreciation is calculated as the excess of (i) the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of exercise over (ii) the base value fixed by the Compensation Committee on the grant date, which may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the grant date. Payment for SARs shall be made in cash, stock, or a combination thereof. SARs are exercisable at the time and subject to the restrictions and conditions as the Compensation Committee approves, provided that no SAR may be exercised more than ten (10) years following the grant date. No dividend equivalents may be awarded in connection with any SAR granted under the 2019 Plan. 
Restricted Stock. The Compensation Committee may grant restricted stock under the 2019 Plan. A restricted stock award gives the participant the right to receive a specified number of shares of common stock at a purchase price determined by the Compensation Committee (including and typically zero). Restrictions limit the participant's ability to transfer the stock and subject the stock to a substantial risk of forfeiture until specific conditions or goals are met. 
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  37
Table of Contents
The restrictions will lapse in accordance with a schedule or other conditions as determined by the Compensation Committee, which typically involve the achievement of specified performance targets and/or continued employment of the participant until a specified date. As a general rule, if a participant terminates employment when the restricted stock is subject to restrictions, the participant forfeits the unvested restricted stock.
Restricted Stock Units. The Compensation Committee also may grant restricted stock unit awards under the 2019 Plan. A restricted stock unit award gives the participant the right to receive common stock, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of common stock (determined as of a specified date), in the future, subject to restrictions and a risk of forfeiture. The restrictions typically involve the achievement of specified performance targets and/or the continued employment of the participant until a specified date. Participants holding restricted stock units have no rights as a shareholder with respect to the shares of stock subject to their restricted stock unit award prior to the issuance of such shares pursuant to the award.  The XSUs granted under the XSPP are a type of restricted stock unit award.
Stock Grant Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant stock grant awards under the 2019 Plan upon such terms and conditions, and at any time, and from time to time, as the Committee shall determine. A stock grant award gives the participant the right to receive (or purchase at such price as determined by the Compensation Committee) shares of stock, free of any vesting restrictions. The purchase price, if any, for a stock grant award shall be payable in cash or in any other form of consideration acceptable to the Compensation Committee. A stock grant award may be granted or sold in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of any cash compensation owed to a participant.
Stock Unit Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant stock unit awards under the 2019 Plan upon such terms and conditions, and at any time, and from time to time, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. A stock unit award gives the participant the right to receive shares of stock, or a cash payment equal to the fair market value of a designated number of shares, in the future, free of any vesting restrictions. A stock unit award may be granted or sold in respect of past services or other valid consideration, or in lieu of any cash compensation owed to a participant.
Performance Shares. The Compensation Committee also may grant performance share awards under the 2019 Plan. A performance share award gives the participant the right to receive common stock of the Company if the participant achieves the performance goals specified by the Compensation Committee during a performance period specified by the Compensation Committee. Each performance share will have a value determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
Performance Share Units. The Compensation Committee also may grant performance share unit awards under the 2019 Plan. A performance share unit award gives the participant the right to receive common stock of the Company, a cash payment or a combination of stock and cash, if the participant achieves the performance goals specified by the Compensation Committee during a performance period specified by the Compensation Committee. Each performance share unit will have a value determined by the Compensation Committee at the time of grant.
Performance Cash. The Compensation Committee may grant performance cash awards under the 2019 Plan upon such terms and conditions, and at any time, and from time to time, as the Compensation Committee shall determine. A performance cash award gives the participant the right to receive an amount of cash depending on the satisfaction of one or more performance goals for a particular performance period. The achievement of the performance goals for a particular performance period will determine the ultimate value of the performance cash award.
Restrictions
The Compensation Committee may impose such restrictions on any awards under the 2019 Plan as it may deem advisable, including restrictions under applicable federal securities law, under the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the Company's common stock is then listed and under any blue sky or state securities law applicable to the awards.
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  38
Table of Contents
Minimum Vesting Requirement
The 2019 Plan imposes a minimum vesting requirement on awards such that no portion of any award shall vest prior to the 12-month anniversary of the grant date. This minimum vesting requirement does not apply to up to 5% of the total number of shares reserved for grant under the 2019 Plan.
Change in Control 
Unless otherwise provided in the applicable award agreement, the applicable change in control transaction documents or any employment agreement between the Company and a participant, in the event of a participant's termination of employment without cause (as defined in the 2019 Plan) within 12 months following a change in control, all time-based restricted stock unit awards that are outstanding and unvested shall become fully vested and all restrictions on such outstanding awards shall lapse as of the date of termination.  
Non-transferability
Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, no award granted under the 2019 Plan may be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated, otherwise than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution or, if applicable, until the termination of any restricted or performance period as determined by the Compensation Committee.
Adjustment Provisions
If there is a change in the outstanding shares of stock because of a stock dividend or split, recapitalization, liquidation, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change, the aggregate number of shares of stock available under the 2019 Plan and subject to each outstanding award, and its stated exercise price or the basis upon which the award is measured, shall be adjusted by the Compensation Committee. Moreover, in the event of such transaction or event, the Compensation Committee in its discretion may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding awards under the 2019 Plan such alternative consideration (including cash) as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all awards so replaced. Any adjustment to an incentive stock option shall be made consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. Further, any adjustments made shall be made consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.
Clawback
Every award granted under the 2019 Plan is subject to potential forfeiture or recovery to the fullest extent called for by law, any applicable listing standard, or any current or future clawback policy that may be adopted by the Company from time to time, including, without limitation, any clawback policy adopted to comply with the final rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the final listing standards to be adopted by the NASDAQ Stock Market pursuant to Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Under the 2019 Plan, participants agree to be bound by the Company's stock ownership guidelines, which were adopted by the Board in December 2018. The stock ownership guidelines apply our named executive officers and Board members in and require that non-employee directors hold at least 8,000 shares of Company stock and that named executive officers own at least 50,000 shares of the Company's stock. For purposes of these guidelines, stock ownership includes shares for which the executive or director has direct or indirect ownership or control, including Axon common stock plus vested and unvested Axon stock options and restricted stock units, including unvested performance-based restricted stock units. Executives and directors are expected to meet their ownership guidelines once they have received enough grants to add up to the required minimum.

Amendment, Modification and Termination of 2019 Plan
Subject to the Board's right to terminate, amend or modify the 2019 Plan at any time, the 2019 Plan will remain in effect until all awards issued under the 2019 Plan expire, terminate, are exercised or are paid in full in accordance with the 2019 Plan provisions and any award agreement. However, no award may be granted under the 2019 Plan after the tenth anniversary of the date the 2019 Plan is approved by the Company's shareholders.
The Board has discretion to terminate, amend or modify the 2019 Plan. Any such action of the Board is subject to the approval of the shareholders to the extent required by the 2019 Plan, law, regulation or the rules of any exchange on which Company stock is listed. To the extent permitted, the Board may delegate to the Compensation Committee the authority to approve non-substantive amendments to the 2019 Plan. Except as otherwise provided in the 2019 Plan, neither the Board nor the Compensation Committee may do any of the following without shareholder approval: reduce the purchase price, exercise price, or base value of any outstanding award, including any option or SAR; increase the number of shares available under the 2019 Plan; grant options or SARs with an exercise price or base value that is below fair market value of a share of Company stock on the grant date; reprice previously granted option SARs; cancel any option or SAR in exchange for cash or any other award or in exchange for any option or SAR with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price for the original option or SAR; extend the exercise period or term of any option or SAR beyond 10 years from the grant date; expand the types of Awards available for grant under the 2019 Plan; or expand the class of individuals eligible to participate in the 2019 Plan.
Tax Withholding
The Company shall have the power to withhold, or require a participant to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to satisfy federal, state, and local withholding tax requirements on any award under the 2019 Plan. To the extent that alternative methods of withholding are available under applicable laws, the Company will have the power to choose among such methods.
Federal Income Tax Information
The following is a brief summary of certain of the federal income tax consequences of certain transactions under the 2019 Plan based on federal income tax laws in effect on December 18, 2018. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not describe state or local tax consequences.
As a general rule, a participant will not recognize taxable income with respect to any award at the time of grant except in the case of a participant who receives a restricted stock grant and makes the timely election permitted by Section 83(b) of the Tax Code.
Upon exercise of a nonqualified stock option, the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock, or upon the payment of SARs, restricted stock units, stock grants, stock units, performance shares, performance share units or performance cash, the participant will recognize ordinary taxable income in an amount equal to the difference between the amount paid for the award, if any, and the fair market value of the stock or amount received on the date of exercise, lapse of restriction or payment. Subject to the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Company will be entitled to a concurrent income tax deduction equal to the ordinary income recognized by the participant. A participant who is granted an incentive stock option will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise. However, the excess of the stock's fair market value over the option price could be subject to the alternative minimum tax in the year of exercise (assuming the stock received is not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture or is transferable). If stock acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option is held for a minimum of two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, the gain or loss (in an amount equal to the difference between the sales price and the exercise price) upon disposition of the stock will be treated as a long-term capital gain or loss, and the Company will not be entitled to any income tax deduction. If the holding period requirements are not met, the incentive stock option will not meet the requirements of the Code and the tax consequences described for nonqualified stock options will apply.
Axon Enterprise, Inc. | 2019 Special Proxy Statement |  40
Table of Contents
If certain awards are subject to and fail to comply with Section 409A of the Code, a participant must include in ordinary income all deferred compensation conferred by the award, pay interest from the date of the deferral and pay an additional 20% tax. The award agreement for any award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code may include provisions necessary for compliance as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company intends (but cannot and does not guarantee) that awards granted under the 2019 Plan will comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or an exception thereto and intends to administer and interpret the 2019 Plan in such a manner.
Special Rules Applicable to Officers
In limited circumstances where the sale of stock that is received as the result of a grant of an award could subject an officer to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, the tax consequences to the officer may differ from the tax consequences described above. In these circumstances, unless a special election has been made, the principal difference usually will be to postpone valuation and taxation of the stock received so long as the sale of the stock received could subject the officer or director to suit under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, but not longer than six months.
Tax Consequences to the Company or Its Affiliates
To the extent that a grantee recognizes ordinary income in the circumstances described above, the Company or the subsidiary for which the employee performs services will, subject to the deduction limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code, be entitled to a corresponding deduction provided that, among other things, the income meets the test of reasonableness, is an ordinary and necessary business expense, is not an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to possible future market prices, market capitalization levels for Axon common stock and Axon's results of operations, wherever they occur in this proxy statement, are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of the management of Axon and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various important factors, including those set forth in this proxy statement.
Words such as "estimate," "project," "plan," "intend," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "would," "should," "could" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are found at various places throughout this proxy statement. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements include those set forth in Axon's filings with the SEC, including its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.
Axon undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In the event that Axon does update any forward-looking statement, no inference should be made that Axon will make additional updates with respect to that statement, related matters or any other forward-looking statements.
FUTURE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS
Axon will hold an annual meeting of shareholders in 2019 regardless of the outcome of the Special Meeting, or whether or not it has been held.  
To be eligible for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders, a proposal intended to be presented by a shareholder for action at that meeting must, in addition to complying with the shareholder eligibility and other requirements of the SEC's rules governing such proposals, have been received not later than December 14, 2018 by the Corporate Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices, 17800 North 85th Street, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255.
Shareholders may bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders that is not submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials (including the nomination of any person to be elected as a director) only if the shareholder proceeds in compliance with the Company's bylaws. For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting of shareholders by a shareholder that is not submitted for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials (including the nomination of any person to be elected as a director), notice of the proposed business must be given to the Corporate Secretary of the Company in writing no later than 60 days before the annual meeting of shareholders or (if later) ten days after the first public notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders.
The notice to the Company's Corporate Secretary must set forth as to each matter that the shareholder proposes to bring before the meeting: (a) the nature of the proposed business with reasonable particularity, including the exact text of any proposal to be presented for adoption, and the reasons for conducting that business at the annual meeting; (b) the shareholder's name and address as they appear on the records of the Company, business address and telephone number, residence address and telephone number, and the number of shares of common stock of the Company directly or beneficially owned by the shareholder; (c) any interest of the shareholder in the proposed business; (d) the name or names of each person nominated by the shareholder to be elected or re-elected as a director, if any; and (e) with respect to any such director nominee, the nominee's name, business address and telephone number, residence address and telephone number, the number of shares of common stock of the Company, if any, directly or beneficially owned by the nominee, all information relating to the nominee that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for elections of directors, or is otherwise required, under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act or successor regulation, and

Table of Contents a letter signed by the nominee stating the nominee's acceptance of the nomination, the nominee's intention to serve as a director if elected and consenting to being named as a nominee for director in any proxy statement relating to such election.
The presiding officer at any annual meeting shall determine whether any matter was properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the above provisions. If the presiding officer should determine that any matter has not been properly brought before the meeting, he or she will so declare at the meeting and any such matter will not be considered or acted upon.
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
Some brokers and other nominee record holders may be participating in the practice of "householding" proxy statements. This means that only one copy of the proxy statement may have been sent to multiple shareholders in a shareholder's household. The Company will promptly deliver a separate copy of the document to any shareholder who contacts the Company's investor relations department at 17800 North 85th Street, Scottsdale, Arizona 85255, phone number (480) 515-6330, requesting such copies. If a shareholder is receiving multiple copies of the proxy statement at the shareholder's household and would like to receive a single copy of the proxy statement for a shareholder's household in the future, shareholders should contact their broker, other nominee record holder, or the Company's investor relations department to request mailing of a single copy of the proxy statement.
OTHER MATTERS
Axon knows of no other matters to be submitted at the Special Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the Special Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy card to vote the shares they represent as the Board may recommend. Discretionary authority with respect to such other matters is granted by the execution of the proxy, whether through telephonic or Internet voting or, alternatively, by using a paper copy of the proxy card that has been requested.

SECTION 5
SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT
5.1NUMBER OF SHARES.  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 5.4, the aggregate number of shares of Stock reserved and available for grant pursuant to the Plan shall be 6,000,000 shares of Stock, plus the number of shares of Stock that are authorized but unissued under the 2018 Plan and all Prior Plans as of the Effective Date. The shares of Stock delivered pursuant to any Award may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized but unissued Stock, treasury Stock not reserved for any other purposes, or Stock purchased on the open market.
5.2SHARE COUNTING.  The following rules shall apply solely for purposes of determining the number of shares of Stock available for grant under the Plan at any given time: 
a.The number of shares of Stock available for grant under this Plan shall be reduced by one share of Stock for each share subject to Awards granted under the Plan.
b.In the event any Award granted under the Plan, or any award outstanding under any Prior Plan after the Effective Date, is terminated, expired, forfeited, or canceled for any reason, the number of shares of Stock subject to such Award, to the extent of any such termination, expiration, forfeiture, or cancellation, will again be available for grant under the Plan.
c.If shares of Stock are not delivered in connection with an Award because the Award is settled in cash rather than in Stock, no shares of Stock shall be counted against the limit set forth in Section 5.1. If an Award may be settled in cash or Stock, the rules set forth in Section 5.2(a) shall apply until the Award is settled, at which time, if the Award is settled in cash, the underlying shares of Stock will be added back to the shares available for grant pursuant to Section 5.1.
d.The exercise of a stock-settled SAR or broker-assisted "cashless" exercise of an Option (or a portion thereof) will reduce the number of shares of Stock available for grant under Section 5.1 by the entire number of shares of Stock subject to that SAR or Option (or applicable portion thereof), even though a smaller number of shares of Stock will be issued upon such an exercise.
e.Shares of Stock tendered to pay the exercise price of an Option or tendered, withheld or otherwise relinquished by a Participant to satisfy a tax withholding obligation arising in connection with an Award will not again become Stock available for grant under the Plan. Moreover, shares of Stock purchased on the open market with cash proceeds generated by the exercise of an Option or SAR will not increase or replenish the number of shares available for grant under Section 5.1.
f.If the provisions of this Section 5.2 are inconsistent with the requirements of any regulations issued pursuant to Section 422 of the Code, the provisions of such regulations shall control over the provisions of this Section 5.2, but only as this Section 5.2 relates to Incentive Stock Options.
5.3     AWARD LIMITS.  Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan, and subject to adjustment as provided in a.The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be issued as Incentive Stock Options under the Plan shall be the same numeric limit set forth in Section 5.1.
b.The sum of the total cash compensation earned and paid and the aggregate grant date fair value (calculated as of the Date of Grant in accordance with applicable accounting rules) of shares of Stock subject to Awards granted to any one Participant who is a Non-Employee Director during any one 12-month period shall not exceed $750,000. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Non-Employee Director serves the Company in more than one capacity during any 12-month period, the total compensation limit described in this Section 5.3(b) shall only apply to the compensation paid for services performed as a Non-Employee Director. To the extent any Non-Employee Director

Table of Contents compensation is deferred, it shall be counted toward this total compensation limit for the year in which the compensation was first earned or granted.
c.The maximum number of shares of Stock that may be granted with respect to Awards that do not satisfy the minimum vesting requirement set forth in Section 12.9 shall be five percent (5%) of the numeric limit set forth in Section 5.1.
5.4    ADJUSTMENT IN CAPITALIZATION.  In the event of any change in the outstanding shares of Stock by reason of a Stock dividend or split, recapitalization, liquidation, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange of shares, or other similar corporate change or event in respect of the Stock, the Committee shall make a proportionate adjustment in: (a) the number and class of shares of Stock made available for grant pursuant to Section 5.1; (b) the number of shares of Stock set forth in Section 5.3 and any other similar numeric or share-based limit expressed in the Plan; (c) the number and class of and/or price of shares of Stock subject to then outstanding Awards; (d) the performance targets or other goals applicable to any outstanding Awards; or (e) any other terms of an Award that are affected by the event. Moreover, in the event of any such transaction, the Committee, in its discretion, may provide in substitution for any or all outstanding Awards such alternative consideration (including cash) as it, in good faith, may determine to be equitable under the circumstances and may require in connection therewith the surrender of all Awards so replaced. Any action taken pursuant to this Section 5.4 shall be taken in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and, in the case of Incentive Stock Options, in accordance with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code.
5.5    REPLACEMENT AWARDS.  In the event of any corporate transaction in which the Company or an Affiliate acquires a corporate entity which, at the time of such transaction, maintains an equity compensation plan pursuant to which awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, or any other form of equity based compensation are then outstanding (the "Acquired Plan"), the Committee may make Awards to assume, substitute or convert such outstanding awards in such manner as may be determined to be appropriate and equitable by the Committee; provided, however, that the number of shares of Stock subject to any Award shall always be a whole number by rounding any fractional share to the nearest whole share. To the extent permitted by Section 409A of the Code, Options or SARs issued pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not be subject to the requirement that the exercise price of such Award not be less than the Fair Market Value of Stock on the date the Award is granted. Shares used in connection with an Award granted in substitution for an award outstanding under an Acquired Plan under this Section 5.5 shall not be counted against the number of shares of Stock available for grant under Section 5.1. Any shares of Stock authorized and available for issuance under the Acquired Plan may, subject to adjustment as described in Section 5.4, be available for use in making Awards under this Plan with respect to persons eligible under such Acquired Plan, by virtue of the Company's assumption of such Acquired Plan, consistent with NASDAQ Rules (or rules of any other exchange upon which the Stock is then traded), including, but not limited to, NASDAQ Rule 5635(c), including IM-5635-1, as such Rules may be amended or replaced from time to time.
5.6    FRACTIONAL SHARES.  No fractional shares of Stock shall be issued pursuant to the Plan. Unless the Committee specifies otherwise in the Award Agreement, or pursuant to any policy adopted by the Committee, cash will be given in lieu of fractional shares. In the event of adjustment as provided in Section 5.4 or the issuance of replacement awards as provided in Section 5.5, the total number of shares of Stock subject to any affected Award shall always be a whole number by rounding any fractional share to the nearest whole share.

16.3    FUNDING.  The Company shall not be required to segregate any of its assets to ensure the payment of any Award under the Plan.

The interests of each Participant and former Participant hereunder are unsecured and shall be subject to the general creditors of the Company.
16.4    EXPENSES.  The expenses of administering the Plan shall be borne by the Company.  
16.5    NO STOCKHOLDERS RIGHTS.  No Award gives the Participant any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company unless and until shares of Stock are in fact issued to such person in connection with such Award.
16.6    TITLES AND HEADINGS.  The titles and headings of the Sections in the Plan are for convenience of reference only and, in the event of any conflict, the text of the Plan, rather than such titles or headings, shall control.
16.7    SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.

The granting of Awards and the issuance of shares and/or cash under the Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. The Company shall be under no obligation to register pursuant to the Securities Act, any of the shares of Stock paid pursuant to the Plan. If the shares of Stock paid pursuant to the Plan may in certain circumstances be exempt from registration pursuant to the Securities Act, the Company may restrict the transfer of such shares in such manner as it deems advisable to ensure the availability of any such exemption. The Committee shall impose such restrictions on any Award as it may deem advisable, including without limitation, restrictions under applicable federal securities law, under the requirements of the NASDAQ (or any other exchange upon which the Stock is then traded), and under any other blue sky or state securities law applicable to such Award.

If an Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Company intends (but cannot and does not guarantee) that the Award Agreement and this Plan comply with and meet all of the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or an exception thereto and the Award Agreement shall include such provisions, in addition to the provisions of this Plan, as may be necessary to assure compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an exception thereto.  
b.Delay for Specified Employees. If, at the time of a Participant's Separation from Service, the Company has any Stock which is publicly traded on an established securities market or otherwise, and if the Participant is considered to be a Specified Employee, to the extent any payment for any Award is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and is payable upon the Participant's Separation from Service, such payment shall not commence prior to the first business day following the date which is six (6) months after the Participant's Separation from Service (or the date of the Participant's death if earlier than the end of the six (6) month period). Any amounts that would have been distributed during such six month period will be distributed on the day following the expiration of the six (6) month period.
c.Prohibition on Acceleration or Deferral. Under no circumstances may the time or schedule of any payment for any Award that is subject to the requirements of Section 409A of the Code be accelerated or subject to further deferral except as otherwise permitted or required pursuant to regulations and other guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A of the Code. If the Company fails to make any payment pursuant to the payment provisions applicable to an Award that is subject to Section 409A of the Code, either intentionally or unintentionally, within the time period specified in such provisions, but the payment is made within the same calendar year, such payment will be treated as made within the specified time period. In addition, in the event of a dispute with respect to any payment, such payment may be delayed in accordance with the regulations and other guidance issued pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

Schedule A - Vesting
Except as otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement and subject to the Grantee's continued employment through the Goal Attainment Date (as defined below), the XSUs shall vest in twelve (12) substantially equal installments (each a "Tranche") if, and only if, the Company achieves the Market Capitalization Goals and Operational Goals set forth in the Charts 1 and 2 below.
More specifically, each Tranche shall vest upon the Compensation Committee's determination that: (i) the Market Capitalization Goal set forth next to the applicable Tranche in Chart 1 below has been attained; and (ii)  the required number of Operational Goals specified in Chart 2 below have been attained, other than an Operational Goal (or Goals) that counted towards the vesting of a prior Tranche (the date that the Compensation Committee makes such determination, the "Vesting Date").1 The Compensation Committee will, in good faith, periodically evaluate whether a particular Tranche has met the Performance-Based Vesting Requirements for such Tranche based on the attainment of the Market Capitalization and Operational Goal(s) and when the Compensation Committee makes a determination that a particular Tranche has met the Performance-Based Vesting Requirements, it shall determine the date on which each of the Goals was attained (the "Goal Attainment Date"); provided, however, that if the Compensation Committee determines that the Goals have been attained on different dates, the Goal Attainment Date for that particular Tranche will occur on the later of the two dates. The Compensation Committee must make the determination that the Performance-Based Vesting Requirements have been attained within thirty (30) days following the Goal Attainment Date; provided, however, that in the event that the Compensation Committee's determination would occur during a blackout period, the Compensation Committee shall have thirty (30) days from the end of the blackout period to make the determination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Vesting Date shall occur prior to the first anniversary of the Date of Grant and if a Tranche would have vested prior to such date, the Vesting Date will be deemed to occur no earlier than the first anniversary of the Date of Grant, provided that the Grantee is employed on the Goal Attainment Date for the applicable Tranche.
Except as otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement, to vest in a particular Tranche, the Grantee must be employed by the Company on the Goal Attainment Date.
1 More than one Tranche may vest upon the attainment of the Goals if the requisite Market Capitalization Goal and Operational Goals for each Tranche have been attained. For example, assume that none of the Tranches has vested and Market Capitalization is $3,800,000,000 and, at that time, 2 of the 16 Operational Goals have been attained. If the Grantee is employed on the Goal Attainment Date, the shares subject to Tranches 1 and 2 will vest.

(p) "Six-Month Market Capitalization" means: (i) the sum of the Daily Market Capitalization of the Company for each trading day during the six (6) calendar month period immediately prior to any selected date for evaluating whether a particular Market Capitalization Goal has been attained, divided by (ii) the number of trading days during such period.

(t)"Target Revenue" means the cumulative revenue of the relevant target company (or, to the extent applicable, any predecessor to relevant target entity) for the four (4) consecutive fiscal quarters completed immediately prior to the closing date of the relevant transaction, provided that if the relevant target entity does not have four (4) fiscal quarters of operating history, the calculation will be annualized based on available quarterly financial data, as determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee.

(b)Change in Control. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in Schedule A to the contrary, if the Grantee is employed on the date of the closing of a transaction or series of transactions that results in a Change in Control, the Operational Goals and Six-Month and Thirty-Day Market Capitalization Goals will be disregarded for purposes of determining whether any unvested Tranches will vest in connection with such Change in Control. Instead, whether any unvested Tranches vest will depend on the Company's attainment of the Market Capitalization Goal set forth next to the applicable Tranche in Chart 1 above, except Market Capitalization will be calculated as the product of: (i) the lesser of the total number of shares of Stock outstanding immediately prior to the closing of a transaction or series of transactions that results in a Change in Control or the XSU Maximum; and (ii) the greater of (1) the most recent closing price of the Stock immediately prior to the closing of the Change in Control, or (2) the per share Stock price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by the Company's stockholders in connection with the Change in Control (with such amount determined in good faith by the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion). [ONLY FOR EXECUTIVES WITH DOUBLE-TRIGGER ACCELERATION IN AN EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT - Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan or in the Executive Employment Agreement between the Grantee and the Company (the "Employment Agreement"), in the event that the Grantee's employment is terminated for any reason or the employee resigns for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement), in either case within ninety (90) days preceding or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control, (A) in addition to any Tranches that vest as a result of the preceding provisions of this Section 3(b), one additional Tranche of XSUs shall vest and become nonforfeitable as of the date of termination or resignation for Good

Reason6, and (B) all Holding Period Requirements shall automatically be deemed waived upon the date of such termination.]  
(c)[OPTION 1 - FOR NON-OTE ELECTION EMPLOYEES Termination of Employment. If the Grantee's employment is terminated for any reason, any Acquired Shares issued upon vesting of the XSUs shall remain subject to the Holding Period Requirements, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any outstanding XSUs that have not vested as of the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall remain outstanding until the next date that the Compensation Committee makes a determination as to whether the Performance-Based Vesting Requirements have been met (the "Compensation Committee Determination Date") and any XSUs for which the Goal Attainment Date occurs prior to the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall be deemed vested as of the Compensation Committee Determination Date. Any XSUs that are outstanding and unvested as of the next Compensation Committee Determination Date following the date of termination of employment shall be canceled and forfeited without any consideration as of such date. If one or more Tranches have vested or vest pursuant to this paragraph, the Grantee will retain the Acquired Shares issued upon vesting of such Tranches and such Acquired Shares will remain subject to the Holding Period Requirements, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.]
[OPTION 2 - FOR OTE ELECTION EMPLOYEES Termination of Employment Without Cause. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything in Schedule A of the Grant Notice to the contrary, any outstanding XSUs that have not vested as of the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall remain outstanding until the next date that the Compensation Committee makes a determination as to whether the Performance-Based Vesting Requirements have been met (the "Compensation Committee Determination Date") and any XSUs for which the Goal Attainment Date occurs prior to the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall be deemed vested as of the Compensation Committee Determination Date. Any XSUs that are outstanding and unvested as of the next Compensation Committee Determination Date following the date of termination of employment shall be canceled and forfeited without any consideration as of such date. If one or more Tranches have vested or vest pursuant to this paragraph, the Grantee will retain the Acquired Shares issued upon vesting of such Tranches and such Acquired Shares will remain subject to the Holding Period Requirements, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause prior to the Goal Attainment Date for any Tranche (i.e., no Tranches have vested as of the Goal Attainment Date), the Company will issue the Grantee a number of shares of Stock equal to (i) (A) the Elected On-Target Earnings, multiplied by (B) the number of years that the Grantee has been employed by the Company beginning on January 1, 2019, up to a maximum of three (3) years7, divided by (ii) the closing price for the Stock as reported on the NASDAQ Stock Market on the Grant Date, subject to the Grantee's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in form and substance satisfactory to the Company.]
6For example, if the Grantee's employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason within 90 days preceding or 12 months following Change in Control and no Tranches have vested as of such date, the shares subject to Tranche 1 will become immediately vested and nonforfeitable in connection with such termination of employment. As a separate example, if the Grantee's employment is terminated without Cause or for Good Reason within 90 days preceding or 12 months following Change in Control and it is determined that Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 will vest after giving effect to the first two sentences of Section 3(b), the shares subject to Tranche 3 will also become vested and nonforfeitable in connection with the such termination of employment irrespective of whether the Market Capitalization Goal set forth next to Tranche 3 in Chart 1 has been attained.
7For example, if the Grantee's Elected On-Target Earnings is $10,000 and the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company without Cause on June 30, 2021, the Grantee would receive shares of Stock with a value of $25,000 ($10,000 Elected On-Target Earnings multiplied by 2.5 years of employment from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021) divided by the original Grant Date closing price of the stock and, if the Grantee's employment is terminated without Cause on February 15, 2025, the Grantee would receive stock with a value of $30,000 ($10,000 Elected On-Target Earnings multiplied by the maximum of 3 years of employment credit) divided by the original Grant Date closing price of the stock.

(d)[ONLY FOR OTE ELECTION EMPLOYEES Termination of Employment for Cause or Resignation. If the Grantee's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or the Grantee terminates his or her employment for any reason (1) if any XSUs have vested and the Acquired Shares issued upon vesting remain subject to the Holding Period Requirements, a number of Acquired Shares equal to one Tranche (less the number of shares sold or withheld to satisfy withholding taxes due in connection with settlement of the Acquired Shares) shall be forfeited without any consideration and (2) any other Acquired Shares shall remain subject to the Holding Period Requirements, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided with respect to one Tranche as set forth above in this Section 3(d), any outstanding XSUs that have not vested as of the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall remain outstanding until the next Compensation Committee Determination Date and any XSUs for which the Goal Attainment Date occurs prior to the date of termination of the Grantee's employment shall be deemed vested as of the Compensation Committee Determination Date. Any XSUs that are outstanding and unvested as of the next Compensation Committee Determination Date following the date of termination of employment shall be canceled and forfeited without any consideration as of such date.]
(e)Death or Disability. In the event that the Grantee's employment terminates due to the Grantee's death or Disability, [ONLY FOR OTE ELECTION EMPLOYEES Section 3(d) above shall not apply and] the Holding Period Requirements for any Acquired Shares shall be deemed automatically waived as of the date of termination of the Grantee's employment. In the event of death, the Company shall consider as vested any additional Tranches that achieve the Goal Attainment Date within 24 months after the Grantee's death and waive any applicable Holding Period Requirements. 
(f)Leave of Absence. Unless otherwise determined by the Compensation Committee, the XSUs shall continue to vest during any period of time in which the Grantee is on an approved leave of absence.
4.[OPTION 1 - FOR NON-OTE EMPLOYEES/<10% OTE EMPLOYEES Nontransferability of XSUs; Holding Period Requirements. The XSUs granted by this Agreement shall not be transferable by the Grantee or any other person claiming through the Grantee, either voluntarily or involuntarily, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Except as required to satisfy withholding taxes due in connection with settlement of the Acquired Shares in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan or as otherwise set forth in this Award Agreement, the Grantee shall not sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise alienate or hypothecate any Acquired Shares at any time prior to the date that is 2.5 years after the Goal Attainment Date for such Acquired Shares (the "Holding Period Requirements"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, may, in their sole discretion, waive the Holding Period Requirements, or deem a number of XSUs up to one Tranche to be vested, upon the termination of the Grantee's employment with the Company, unless Grantee is a subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, in which case the Compensation Committee must ratify the decision (but for the avoidance of doubt, no Grantee is permitted to waive the Holding Period Requirements or accelerate the vesting of his or her own Award). In order to carry out the provisions of this Section 4 more effectively, the Company shall hold any Acquired Shares subject to the Holding Period Requirements in escrow together with separate stock powers executed by the Grantee in blank for transfer. The Company shall not dispose of such Acquired Shares except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. [THIS SENTENCE ONLY FOR <10% OTE EMPLOYEES In the event of any forfeiture of the Acquired Shares to the Company pursuant to Section 3(d), the Company is hereby authorized by the Grantee, as the Grantee's attorney-in-fact, to date and complete the stock powers necessary for the transfer of the Acquired Shares being forfeited and to transfer such Acquired Shares in accordance with the terms hereof.] At such time as any Acquired Shares are no longer subject to the Holding Period Requirements, the Company shall release the shares from escrow. Any dividends paid by the Company during the period during which the Holding Period Requirements apply shall accrue and shall not be paid to the Grantee until and only to the extent the Acquired Shares are no longer subject to the Holding Period Requirements.]

(a)[OPTION 2 - FOR >10% OTE EMPLOYEES Nontransferability of XSUs; Holding Period Requirements. The XSUs granted by this Agreement shall not be transferable by the Grantee or any other person claiming through the Grantee, either voluntarily or involuntarily, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution. Except as required to satisfy withholding taxes due in connection with settlement of the Acquired Shares in accordance with Section 14 of the Plan or as otherwise set forth in this Award Agreement, upon settlement, the Grantee shall not sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise alienate or hypothecate any Acquired Shares at any time prior to the date that is 2.5 years after the Goal Attainment Date for such Acquired Shares; furthermore, the Grantee shall not sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise alienate or hypothecate a number of Acquired Shares equal to one Tranche prior to the Expiration Date (the "Holding Period Requirements")8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer, may, in their sole discretion waive the Holding Period Requirements, or deem a number of XSUs up to one Tranche to be vested, upon the termination of the Grantee's employment with the Company, unless Grantee is a subject to the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, in which case the Compensation Committee must ratify the decision (but for the avoidance of doubt, no Grantee is permitted to waive the Holding Period Requirements or accelerate the vesting of his or her own Award). Any dividends paid by the Company during the period during which the Holding Period Requirements apply shall accrue and shall not be paid to the Grantee until and only to the extent the Acquired Shares are no longer subject to the Holding Period Requirements.
(b)In order to carry out the provisions of this Section 4 more effectively, the Company shall hold any Acquired Shares subject to the Holding Period Requirements in escrow together with separate stock powers executed by the Grantee in blank for transfer. The Company shall not dispose of shares held in escrow pursuant to this Section 4(b) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. In the event of any forfeiture of the Acquired Shares pursuant to Section 3(d), the Company is hereby authorized by the Grantee, as the Grantee's attorney-in-fact, to date and complete the stock powers necessary for the transfer of the Acquired Shares being forfeited and to transfer such Acquired Shares in accordance with the terms hereof. At such time as any Acquired Shares are no longer subject to the Holding Period Requirements are no longer subject to the forfeiture, as applicable, the Company shall release such shares from escrow.]
5.Continued Employment. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, continued employment through the applicable Goal Attainment Date is a condition to the vesting of the XSUs. Nothing contained in this Agreement or the Plan constitutes a continued employment commitment by the Company or interferes with the right of the Company to increase or decrease the compensation of the Grantee from the rate in existence at any time.
6.Dividend and Voting Rights. The Grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company, no dividend rights and no voting rights with respect to the XSUs or any Acquired Shares until such shares of Stock are actually issued to and held of record by the Grantee. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights of a holder for which the record date is prior to the date of issuance of the stock certificate (or book entry credit or other indicia of ownership).
7.Timing and Manner of Settlement of XSUs. 
(a)Settlement of XSUs. As soon as practicable following each Vesting Date (but in no event later than two and one-half months after the end of the year in which the Vesting Date occurs), the Company shall issue to the Grantee the number of shares of Stock equal to the aggregate number of XSUs that have vested pursuant to this Agreement on such date and, subject to Section 4 above, the Grantee shall thereafter have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to such shares. The Grantee may satisfy a tax withholding obligation by: (i) directing the Company to withhold shares of Stock to which the Grantee is entitled pursuant to this Award in an amount necessary to satisfy the Company's applicable federal, state, local or foreign income and employment tax withholding obligations with respect to this Award; or (ii) a broker-assisted "cashless" transaction. The Committee may also permit the Grantee to satisfy his or her tax withholding obligation in any manner permitted under Section 14 of the Plan.
(b)No DCP Elections. The Grantee will not have any right to make any election regarding the time or form of any payment due pursuant to this Agreement. In addition, the Grantee does not have any right to elect to receive cash consideration in lieu of the XSUs awarded to the Grantee pursuant to this Agreement as consideration for the Grantee's services to the Company.
8The second part of the Holding Period Requirements, which ensure that a number of Acquired Shares equal to one Tranche are held through to the Expiration Date, shall apply to the most recently vested Tranche (e.g., once more than one Tranche has vested, subsequent Tranches shall replace previously vested Tranches for such Holding Period Requirements).

Table of Contents
(c)Payment Treated As Made Upon A Designated Event. If the Company fails to make any payment under this Agreement, either intentionally or unintentionally, within the time period specified in this Section 7, but the payment is made within the same calendar year, such payment will be treated as made within the time period specified in Section 7 pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(d). In addition, if a payment is not made due to a dispute with respect to such payment, the payment may be delayed in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(g).
8.Adjustments Upon Specified Events. Upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the Company's Stock contemplated by Section 5.3 of the Plan, the Committee shall make adjustments if appropriate in the number of XSUs subject to this Award and the number and kind of securities that may be issued in respect of this Award.
9.Notices. Any notice to be given under the terms of this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to the Company at Legal@axon.com or its principal office to the attention of the Secretary, and to the Grantee at the Grantee's last address reflected on the Company's records, or at such other address as either party may hereafter designate in writing to the other. Any such notice shall be deemed to be given only when received, but if the Grantee is no longer employed by the Company, such notice shall be deemed to have been duly given by the Company when enclosed in a properly sealed envelope addressed as aforesaid, registered or certified, and deposited (postage and registry or certification fee prepaid) in a post office or branch post office regularly maintained by the United States Government.
10.Plan. The Award and all rights of the Grantee under this Agreement are subject to all of the terms and conditions of the Plan, which are incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and of the Plan, the terms and conditions of the Plan shall govern. The Grantee agrees to be bound by the terms of the Plan, and this Agreement. The Grantee acknowledges having read and understood the Plan and this Agreement. Unless otherwise expressly provided in other sections of this Agreement, provisions of the Plan and this Agreement that confer discretionary authority on the Board or the Committee do not (and shall not be deemed to) create any rights in the Grantee unless such rights are expressly set forth herein or are otherwise in the sole discretion of the Board or the Committee so conferred by appropriate action of the Board or the Committee under the Plan after the date hereof. This XSU Award is an unfunded performance-based stock incentive plan and is not intended to be either an employee pension or welfare benefit plan subject to ERISA.
11.Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Grant Notice and the Plan together constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, written or oral, of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. The Plan and this Agreement may be amended pursuant to the provisions of the Plan.
12.Limitation on Grantee's Rights. Participation in the Plan confers no rights or interests other than as herein provided. This Agreement creates only a contractual obligation on the part of the Company as to amounts payable and shall not be construed as creating a trust. Neither the Plan nor any underlying program, in and of itself, has any assets. The Grantee shall have only the rights of a general unsecured creditor of the Company with respect to amounts credited and benefits payable in cash, if any, with respect to the XSUs, and rights no greater than the right to receive the Common Stock as a general unsecured creditor with respect to XSUs, as and when payable hereunder.
13.Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 
14.Section Headings. The section headings of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to alter or affect any provision hereof.
15.Section 409A This Award Agreement has been drafted with the intent that payments (and the right to payments) under it are exempt from the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. This Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent. To the extent that any payment or benefit under this Agreement qualifies as "non-qualified deferred compensation" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and is payable upon the Grantee's termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Grantee's "Separation from Service. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if at the time of the Grantee's Separation from Service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code, the Company determines that the Grantee is a Specified Employee, then to the extent any payment or benefit that the Grantee becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Grantee's Separation from Service would be considered deferred compensation otherwise subject to the 20% additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of
