                 Compensation Highlights
    2018 Financial Performance and Executive 
                 Compensation Highlights
     2018 CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS       
     During 2018, we demonstrated the continued strength of our franchise while operating in an ongoing challenging fiscal and economic environment. Results for our business in                  Puerto Rico were outstanding, as the economy continued to recover from the impact of Hurricanes Irma and Maria (the "Hurricanes") in 2017. We achieved year-over-year growth in our net interest income and maintained stable credit indicators                  and strong capital levels.       
     Our Puerto Rico business experienced growth in deposits, an increase in our customer base and strong net interest margins. Popular (the "Corporation") completed the                  acquisition of Wells Fargo's auto finance business in Puerto Rico ("Reliable"), positioning the Corporation as the leader in the Island's auto financing segment. Furthermore, we negotiated the early termination of our loss share agreements                  with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"). In the United States, our total loan portfolio grew by 7%, driven primarily by commercial loans, and net margins increased. In addition, Popular's capital levels remained strong.                  A common stock repurchase program of $125 million was completed, $450 million of senior debt with a 7% coupon was redeemed, $300 million in senior debt was issued at 6.125% and $53 million of Trust Preferred Securities were redeemed by the                  Corporation.       
     During 2018, we also made progress in each of the strategic pillars established last year:      
• Sustainable and profitable growth: We maintained strong margins, expanded our auto finance business in Puerto Rico and niche businesses in the United States and grew our customer base.      
• Simplicity: We advanced projects to streamline our organization to reduce costs, improve quality                    and agility, enable a superior customer and employee experience and provide a platform for future growth.       
• Customer focus: We executed targeted initiatives to measure and improve our customers'                    experience, including the migration of transactions to digital channels.       
• Fit for the Future: We continue to bolster a solid foundation of talent and risk management frameworks to support our future growth. We created the Corporate Security Group, focused on fraud prevention and cybersecurity efforts. We also implemented various initiatives                    focused on our employees' well-being and development, including a voluntary retirement program in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands                                                and base salary increases in all our markets.      
     True to Popular's core value of social commitment, valuable financial and in-kind assistance was provided through Fundación Banco Popular, Popular Foundation and corporate                  donations and social programs. Our total social investment during 2018 was $6.1 million, impacting communities in Puerto Rico, the mainland United States and the Virgin Islands.      
     2018 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS       
     Our 2018 GAAP net income increased from $107.7 million in 2017 to $618.2 million. These results were driven by strong top line revenue growth in our Puerto Rico franchise                  and reflect the positive contribution of the acquisition of Reliable.      
     Our net income reported under GAAP for 2018 was impacted by the early termination of our loss share agreements with the FDIC, entered into in connection with the acquisition                  of certain assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of Westernbank Puerto Rico through an FDIC-assisted transaction in 2010, as well as the impact of the 2018 Puerto Rico Tax Reform on the valuation of Popular's deferred tax asset.                  These factors contributed a net amount of $130.9 million to net income. To provide meaningful information about the underlying performance of our ongoing operations, the $130.9 million is deducted from net income to express our results on                  an adjusted net income basis, which is a non-GAAP measure; on this basis, our adjusted net income was $487.3 million. This compares favorably to our $276.0 million adjusted net income attained in 2017. In addition, for purposes of certain                  incentive awards, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors decided to make further net income adjustments related to Hurricane insurance claims, the impact of the voluntary retirement program and early extinguishment of debt to                  more accurately reflect our core performance so that participants are neither rewarded nor penalized for items that are non-recurring, unusual or not indicative of ongoing operations. On this basis,

     our after-tax adjusted net income for certain incentives was $500.0 million. Refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation in Appendix A of this                  Proxy Statement.      
     Popular, Inc. ("BPOP") shares closed 2018 at $47.22, 33% higher than year-end 2017. This performance compared very positively against our U.S. peers and the KBW Nasdaq                  Regional Banking Index ("KRX"), which declined by 18% and 19%, respectively. In fact, Popular was the best performing bank in the KRX, outperforming the Index throughout 2018 due, in part, to the Island's steady economic recovery after the                  2017 Hurricanes, strong earnings and stable credit quality metrics.

     PAY MIX IN THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM   
     Our executive compensation program focuses on the achievement of annual and long-term goals that generate sustained company performance and strong returns to our                  shareholders.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     BASE SALARY   
     In March 2018, each NEO, except for the Executive Chairman, received a 2% merit increase adjustment to his base salary upon consideration of salary market benchmarking and                  individual performance. Effective June 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a further increase to Mr. Alvarez's base salary to position his total compensation closer to market median while recognizing solid performance after his first                  year as CEO.      
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     SHORT-TERM ANNUAL CASH INCENTIVE   
     The short-term annual cash incentive is awarded based on the achievement of corporate results, individual goals and leadership competencies. In 2018, it had a target of 85%                  of base pay for Mr. Carrión, 100% for Mr. Alvarez and 80% of base pay for the other NEOs. Actual payouts can range from zero to 1.5 times the target award. After considering all incentive components, the Compensation Committee granted                  annual cash incentive awards at 113.6% of base pay for Mr. Carrión, 150% for Mr. Alvarez, 110.4% for Mr. Vázquez, 110.7% for Mr. Ferrer and 102% for Mr. Soriano.

[BEGIN TABLE]
     LONG-TERM EQUITY INCENTIVE   
     The annual equity grant rewards performance and aligns the interests of our NEOs with those of our shareholders. One half of the target award consists of performance shares,                  with actual earned shares determined at the end of a 3-year performance period based on total shareholder return and earnings per share metrics. The other half of this award consists of restricted stock granted based on corporate and                  individual performance, with a vesting period. At the time of grant, in February 2018, the target incentive opportunity was 85% of base pay for Mr. Carrión, 185% of base pay for Mr. Alvarez and 80% of base pay for the other NEOs. The actual                  long-term incentive awards range from zero to 1.5 times the target award. The 2018 long-term incentive awards were granted considering our performance in 2017, recognizing that although the 2017 net income goal had not been achieved, the                  senior management team had demonstrated strong leadership during Puerto Rico's unprecedented challenging macroeconomic conditions (due in large part to the impact of the Hurricanes), including maintaining a strong franchise and market                  position in Puerto Rico, stable credit quality and strong capital position. Upon consideration of the corporate and individual performance factors, the Compensation Committee granted equity awards in 2018 to NEOs at the previously mentioned                  target levels. Our executive compensation programs are discussed in more detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "2018 Executive Compensation Tables and Compensation Information" sections of this Proxy Statement.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 Director                   Independence   Popular's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that at least two-thirds of the Board shall consist of independent directors. At present, all of our non-employee directors                  (nine of eleven directors) are independent in accordance with the standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market ("NASDAQ"). Messrs. Carrión and Alvarez are our only employee directors and are not considered independent.   
 Majority Voting in Director Elections   Directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at the annual meeting. An incumbent director not elected by the affirmative vote of a                  majority of the shares represented at the annual meeting must tender his or her resignation to the Board, which may accept or reject the director's resignation.   
 Independent Lead Director   The Board has a Lead Director elected annually by a majority of the independent members of the Board.   
 Board Oversight of Risk Management    Popular's Board has a significant role in risk oversight. You can read about the role of the Board in risk oversight under "Board Oversight of Risk Management."   
 Succession Planning   The Compensation Committee annually reviews a management succession plan, developed by the CEO, to ensure an orderly succession of the CEO and executive officers in both                  ordinary course and emergency situations.   
 Director Retirement   Popular's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that directors may serve on the Board until the end of their term following their 72nd birthday, and may not be initially elected or re-elected after reaching age 72.   
 Stock Ownership   Within three years of their election, directors must hold Popular stock with a value equal to five times the annual Board retainer. Within five years of designation, the                  Executive Chairman and the President and CEO must hold Popular stock with a value equal to six times base pay and other executive officers must hold three times their base pay.   
 Restrictions on Pledging, Hedging and Speculative Transactions   Popular's directors and executive officers are prohibited from pledging Popular's common stock as collateral for loans. In addition, directors and executive officers are not                  allowed to engage in speculative transactions, such as hedging and monetization transactions, using Popular's securities.   
 Annual Board and Committee Self-Assessments    The Board and each committee conduct annual self-evaluations to determine whether they are functioning effectively.  
 Executive Sessions of Non-Management Directors    Popular's independent directors hold executive sessions without Popular's management.   
 Limits on Board Service   To ensure that Directors have sufficient time to devote to their responsibilities on Popular's Board, Popular's Corporate Governance Guidelines contain a policy about other                  directorships. Directors who also serve as CEOs of public companies should not serve on more than one public company board in addition to Popular's Board, and other directors should not serve on more than four public company boards in                  addition to Popular's Board. In addition, members of the Audit Committee may not serve on more than three public company audit committees, including Popular's Audit Committee, without prior Board approval.

Mr. Cestero's brother operates a property appraisal business. The borrowers will be required to make monthly payments of $500 until the maturity date of the promissory note, when their financial capacity will be         reevaluated and a new payment plan is expected to be entered into. Related           parties of Mr. Ballester have outstanding loans made prior to the borrowers on such loans having become Related Parties of Mr. Ballester and which were acquired by BPPR in 2010 as part of the Westernbank FDIC assisted transaction. Such loans         consist of the following: (i) four commercial loans made to entities that were wholly-owned by one brother-in-law of Mr. Ballester and (ii) one commercial loan made to an entity that was owned by same brother-in-law together with Mr. Ballester's         father-in-law and another brother-in-law. The loans were secured by real estate and personally guaranteed by the owners of each borrower. The loans were originated by Westerbank between 2001 and 2005 and had an aggregate outstanding principal         balance of approximately $33.5 million when they were acquired by BPPR. Between 2011 and 2014, the loans were restructured to consist of (i) five notes with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $19.8 million with a 6% annual interest rate         ("Notes A") and (ii) five notes with an aggregate outstanding balance of $13.5 million with a 1% annual interest rate, to be paid upon maturity ("Notes B"). The restructured notes had a maturity of September 30, 2016 and, thereafter, various         interim renewals were approved, with the last two renewals occurring in May and November of 2018. The May 2018 renewals included a six-month payment plan reduction from monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $36,000 to monthly         principal payments of approximately $5,000 plus accrued interest in one of the Notes A, commencing on January 2018. The November 2018 renewals included a change in the interest rate from 6% to 4.5% for four of the Notes A and from 4.25% to 4.5% in         the remaining Note A, commencing on May 2018, and an increase in the monthly principal payments of the Note A that had been modified in May from $5,000 to $10,000, effective December 2018. The renewed loans mature on June 30, 2019. The aggregate         outstanding balance on the loans as of December 31, 2018 was approximately $31.7 million and, during 2018, approximately $400,000 and $925,000 were paid in principal and interest, respectively. The largest outstanding balance of the loans during         2018 was approximately $32.1 million.Mr.         Carrión is President of and owns, together with his siblings, an entity which owns 35% of a corporation that owns a commercial building.

Finance         Holding Company, Puerto Rico-based subsidiaries of Wells Fargo & Company engaged in the auto finance business in Puerto Rico. Prior to the acquisition, Reliable Financial Services had entered into a lease agreement with respect to approximately         61,442 square feet of space (comprising approximately 34.54% of the rentable square feet) in the commercial building securing the aforementioned commercial loan to Related Parties of Mr. Carrión. The lease, which expires in accordance with its         terms in April 2019 and is not expected to be extended, is documented pursuant to a lease agreement between Reliable Financial Services and the corporation which is the borrower in the loan and of which Mr. Carrión's Related Parties own 56.5% in         the aggregate. As part of the acquisition, Popular Auto, as assignee of BPPR under the acquisition agreement, entered into an agreement with Reliable Financial Services to sublease the space necessary for Popular Auto, doing business as Reliable         Auto, to continue the acquired operations until the expiration of the lease, when the property will be fully vacated by Popular Auto. Since February 2018, the lease agreement has been amended three times, most recently in January 2019 to reduce the         square footage and rent payments due under the lease (and as a result, the sublease) as a result of the gradual transfer out of the building of Popular Auto operations. Rents paid pursuant to the sublease will be a source of repayment of, and serve         as collateral to, the commercial loan. During 2018, Popular Auto paid to Reliable Financial Services approximately $778,500 under the sublease.

 Puerto Rico                   ("P.R.")                   Business• We acquired Reliable – approximately $2 billion in auto and commercial loans, positioning the Corporation as the leader in the Puerto Rico auto financing segment.  
• As of 2018 year-end, we served 1.75 million customers, reflecting a 4.7% increase from 2017; our 2018 client base includes 30,000 new clients acquired as part of the Reliable                  transaction.  
• Total deposits rose by $4 billion (14%) from 2017.  
• Net interest margins remained strong at 4.27%.  
• We achieved a successful early termination of our loss share agreements with the FDIC in connection with the 2010 acquisition of Westernbank's assets and liabilities.  
• We continued the expansion of the U.S. consumer business managed from P.R., consisting of white label credit cards and our Eloan on-line lending platform.  
• We remain focused on providing innovative solutions to our customers through our digital transformation. Digital deposits captured 47% of total deposit transactions in                  December 2018, up 17% from December 2017, and Mi Banco (internet) active customers reached 839,422 in 2018, up 12% from 2017.  
 United States ("U.S.") Business• We completed the rebranding efforts (from Popular Community Bank to Popular) to align with Popular's strategic growth, expanded capabilities and launched several business                  platforms designed to attract diverse consumer and business segments. Furthermore, a significant portion of the retail branch network has been transformed to better reflect the evolving needs and expectations of our customers.  
• Our total loan portfolio grew by $409 million (7%).  
• Specialized business segments with nationwide scope (Popular Association Banking, healthcare and not-for-profit) have continued their healthy growth, and the private banking                  and residential mortgage programs are showing encouraging results.

The Corporation continues to closely monitor its portfolios and related credit metrics given Puerto Rico's ongoing economic and fiscal challenges.  
 Capital                   Strategy• Our capital levels remained robust, with year-end Common Equity Tier 1 capital equal to 16.9%.

This was crucial in attaining our corporate achievements during 2018, despite the                  impact of the Hurricanes and the challenging economic and fiscal environment in Puerto Rico.   
• We created the Corporate Security Group, focused on fraud prevention and cybersecurity.  
• We continue to streamline our operations through the development of robotic automation technology and the simplification of procurement and vendor management processes.  
• We made significant progress in the development of a corporate-wide customer service framework to enhance customer experience, as well as in each of the four strategic                  pillars that were established in 2017.

Our                  total social investment during 2018 was $6.1 million, impacting communities in Puerto Rico, United States and Virgin Islands.

 ✔   Use a combination of performance metrics to deter excessive risk-taking by eliminating focus on any single performance goal. Also, the Committee may adjust incentive payouts                  if results are not aligned with Popular's risk appetite and related tolerances.  
 ✔   Balance short-term (cash) and long-term (equity) compensation to discourage short-term risk taking at the expense of long-term results.  
 ✔   Use equity incentives to promote total return to shareholders, company performance and executive retention.  
 ✔   Require significant stock ownership from our executive officers. Our Executive Chairman and CEO have a requirement of six times their base salary, and the other NEOs must own                  three times their base salary. As of February 2019, all NEOs had either met the requirement or were on track to comply within the designated timeframe.  
 ✔   Hold a portion of equity vesting until retirement, thereby reinforcing long-term risk management and alignment with shareholder interests.   
 ✔   Apply clawback features to all executive officer variable pay in the event of a financial results restatement, a performance metric found to be materially inaccurate, or an                  executive's misconduct.  
 ✔   Employ "double-trigger" vesting of equity awards in the event of a change of control (i.e., vesting is only triggered upon a qualifying termination of employment following a                  change of control).  
 ✔   Conduct annual incentives and sales practices risk reviews in conjunction with Popular's Chief Risk Officer.  
 ✔   Engage an independent compensation consultant who advises and reports directly to the Committee.

Attract           and Retain Highly Qualified ExecutivesPopular's                       executive compensation program seeks to attract, motivate and retain the talent needed to successfully deliver future earnings stability and growth. Our mix of salary and performance-based short- and long-term incentives provides a competitive         offering to attract the best executive talent and promote engagement and long-term career retention. In consultation with management and its independent compensation consultant, the Committee balances competitiveness and retention features while         considering individual performance, experience and qualifications, as well as market practices and Popular's financial performance. Ensure           Effective Controls and Sound Risk Management Our         incentive design seeks to dissuade our executives from taking excessive or unnecessary risks and promoting improper sales practices and ensures sound risk management and effective controls. Popular uses a balanced approach to incentive design         through short-term (cash) and long-term (equity) components, a series of performance measures (financial, strategic, leadership, shareholder value), and the use of threshold performance requirements and payout caps, focusing on long-term         performance periods and rewards (including a portion of equity awards that vests at retirement). The Corporation's Incentive Recoupment Guideline, which applies to cash and equity-based incentives, covers financial statement restatement, materially         inaccurate performance criteria and misconduct. Also, the Compensation Committee may adjust individual awards based on consideration of compliance with policies, guidelines, laws and regulations; results and follow-up of audits and examinations;         and operation within Popular's risk appetite.

We do not provide employment agreements, change in control arrangements, tax gross-ups, supplemental retirement benefits or club memberships         to our executives. During 2018, perquisites such as home security, the use of company-owned automobiles and personal tickets to events sponsored by Popular were offered on a limited basis to NEOs. Popular owns an apartment in New York City, which         was used by our Executive Chairman during 2018 for business and non-business matters. Because availability of the corporate-owned apartment for personal use conveys a personal benefit to our Executive Chairman, we disclose the full rental value of         said apartment as Other Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.

The         Committee has reviewed and concluded that Meridian's consultation services comply with the standards adopted by the SEC and by NASDAQ with regard to compensation advisor independence and conflicts of interest. The Committee will continue to monitor         this compliance on an ongoing basis.COMPENSATION           INFORMATION AND PEER GROUP The         Committee periodically assesses the competitiveness of its executive pay practices through external studies conducted by Meridian as well as supplemental internal research based on proxies and compensation surveys (including resources provided by         Equilar, Willis Towers Watson, and similar service providers). The Committee also considers executive compensation information from financial institutions in its headquarters market of Puerto Rico. The         Committee utilizes the information from internal and external analyses to assess the appropriateness of compensation levels (relative to market and performance) and considers the information when setting program guidelines, including base salary         ranges, incentive targets and equity compensation. An individual's relative compensation with respect to the peer group may vary according to his or her role, Popular's financial performance, individual qualifications, experience and performance as         assessed by the Committee. Our         compensation peer group used for 2018 pay and performance comparisons, as well as reviews of compensation structure and design, was approved by the Committee in June 2017 and comprised the banks listed in the table below. Popular's total assets         were positioned near the median of the group.

In         their place, the following banks were added to the peer group: KeyCorp, Regions Financial Corporation and M&T Bank Corporation. This new peer group will be used for any benchmarking going forward.
the         Committee's first regularly scheduled meeting taking place in the month of February, and equity awards to other employees are granted on the first business day that the NASDAQ is open following the second complete day of trading following the         release of the Corporation's earning results for the first quarter of the calendar year. Equity grants to certain newly hired employees or promoted individuals, including executive officers, are made on the last business day prior to the 15th day         of each month or the last business day of each month, whichever day first follows the date on which the newly-hired individual commences providing active services to the Corporation or the promoted individual commences providing active services to         the Corporation at the promoted level.TAX           DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION As         part of its role, the Committee considers the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Committee is cognizant of and will continue to consider the impact of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act         of 2017, which expanded the number of individuals covered by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and eliminated the exception for performance-based compensation (generally effective beginning for the 2018 tax year) on the Corporation's         compensation programs and design. In addition, for NEOs who are residents of Puerto Rico, compensation is deductible for income tax purposes if it is reasonable. It is the Committee's intention that the compensation paid to Popular's NEOs be         deductible, but the Committee reserves the ability to grant or pay compensation that is not deductible. For the fiscal year 2018, all NEOs were residents of Puerto Rico.
The         Committee conducts an annual review of incentive and sales practices risk in conjunction with the CRO. During the December 2018 Committee meeting, the CRO outlined the results of his evaluation, which covered absolute levels and year-over-year         changes in number of participants and incentive award payouts, trends in customer claims and complaints, and an in-depth

thresholds         and caps to limit payouts; mix of financial and non-financial components; link to company performance; and competitive pay practices. Furthermore, an executive's incentive payout may be adjusted by the Committee at its discretion if results are not         aligned with Popular's risk appetite. The Committee will continue to monitor our compensation programs to ensure that they do not promote improper sales practices or inappropriate risk-taking, and that they comply with current and emerging         regulations and industry leading practices.

The terms of the Omnibus Plan, as amended as of April 30, 2013,         provide for "double-trigger" vesting in the event of a Change of Control, which means that awards subject to time-based vesting will vest if the holder's employment is terminated without Cause, or if the holder terminates employment for Good Reason         (each as defined in the Omnibus Plan) within two years after a Change of Control.

     ELECTION OF DIRECTORS      
     Popular's Restated Certificate of Incorporation establishes that the Board of Directors shall be composed of such number of directors as shall be established from time to                  time by the Board, but not less than 9 nor more than 25, and that the Board shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible, with each class having at least three members and with the term of office of one class                  expiring each year. When the number of directors is changed, any newly created directorship will be assigned among classes by a majority of the directors then in office in a manner that would make all classes as equal in number as possible.                  In the event of inequality within classes, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the class assigned to the new director will be the class having the last date for expiration of its term.                    
     Our Board named Myrna M. Soto and Robert Carrady as members of the Board, effective July 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019, respectively. In accordance with our Restated                  Certificate of Incorporation, any director named by the Board will hold office only until the next annual meeting of shareholders, at which such director should be duly elected and qualified. The Board is therefore nominating Ms. Soto and                  Mr. Carrady as "Class 2" members, consistent with the requirements in our Restated Certificate of Incorporation. As a result, at the meeting, four directors assigned to "Class 2" will be elected to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of                  shareholders or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. The remaining seven directors of Popular will continue to serve as directors, as follows: the three directors assigned to "Class 3," until the 2020 annual                  meeting of shareholders of Popular, and the four directors assigned to "Class 1," until the 2021 annual meeting of shareholders, or in each case until their successors are duly elected and qualified.      
     The persons named as proxies have advised Popular that, unless otherwise instructed, they intend to vote at the meeting the shares covered by the proxies "FOR" the election                  of the four nominees, and that if any one or more of such nominees should become unavailable for election they intend to vote such shares "FOR" the election of such substitute nominees as the Board may propose. Popular has no knowledge that                  any nominee will become unavailable for election.              
     Popular's Restated Certificate of Incorporation requires that each director receive a majority of the votes cast by shareholders in person or by proxy and entitled to vote                  (the number of shares voted "FOR" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "AGAINST" that nominee). All nominees are currently serving on the Board. If an incumbent director is not elected by a majority of the shares                  represented at the annual meeting, Puerto Rico corporation law provides that the director continues to serve on the Board as a "holdover director." Under Popular's Restated By-Laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, an incumbent director                  who is not elected by a majority of the votes cast must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In that situation, Popular's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee would make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept                  or reject the resignation, or whether to take other action. The Board would act on the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision.      
     The "Class 2" nominees for election as director at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders are: Joaquín E., Bacardí, III, Robert Carrady, John W. Diercksen and Myrna M. Soto.                  Refer to the "Nominees for Election as Directors and Other Directors" section of this Proxy Statement for information on the director's experience and qualifications.

     ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION                    
     The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and SEC regulations require a separate, nonbinding "say on pay" shareholder vote to approve the compensation of                  executives. The compensation paid to our NEOs and Popular's overall executive compensation policies and procedures are described in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the tabular disclosure (together with the                  accompanying narrative disclosure) in this Proxy Statement      
     This proposal gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to endorse or not endorse the compensation paid to Popular's NEOs through the following resolution.      
     "RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Popular approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis                    Section and the tabular disclosure regarding named executive officer compensation (together with the accompanying narrative disclosure) in this Proxy Statement."      
     Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board and may not be construed as overruling any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation Committee                  will consider the outcome of the vote when evaluating the effectiveness of our compensation policies and procedures and in connection with its future executive compensation determinations.      
     The approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and                  entitled to vote on that matter. At our annual shareholders' meeting held in May 2018, the vast majority of Popular's voting shareholders (94.74% of shares voted) expressed support for our executive compensation policies and procedures.

     RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC                   ACCOUNTING FIRM    
     The Audit Committee intends to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of Popular for 2019. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as the                  independent registered public accounting firm of BPPR since 1971 and of Popular since 1991.      
     The following table summarizes the fees billed to Popular by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:      
         December 31, 2018   December 31, 2017      
     Audit Fees   $7,098,840      $6,909,029      
     Audit-Related Fees(a)   1,455,250     1,001,013      
     Tax Fees(b)   43,029     42,625      
     All Other Fees(c)   4,500     3,600    
         $8,601,619     $7,956,267    
     (a)   Includes fees for assurance services such as audits of pension plans, compliance-related audits, accounting consultations and          Statement on Standards for                  Attestation Engagements No. 18 reports.    
  (b)   Includes fees associated with tax return preparation and tax consulting services. (c)   Includes software licensing fees.   
  (b)   Includes fees associated with tax return preparation and tax consulting services. (c)   Includes software licensing fees.   
     The Audit Committee has established controls and procedures that require the pre-approval of all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Audit                  Committee may delegate to one or more of its members the authority to pre-approve any audit or permissible non-audit services. Under the pre-approval controls and procedures, audit services for Popular are negotiated annually. In the event                  that any additional audit services are required by Popular, a proposed engagement letter is obtained from the auditors and evaluated by the Audit Committee or the member(s) of the Audit Committee with authority to pre-approve auditor                  services. Any decisions to pre-approve such audit and non-audit services and fees are to be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. The Audit Committee has considered that the provision of the services covered by                  this paragraph is compatible with maintaining the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm of Popular. During 2018, fees for all services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP were approved by the Audit Committee.                                         Neither Popular's Restated Certificate of Incorporation nor its Restated By-Laws require that the shareholders ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Popular's independent registered public accounting firm. If the                  shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, but may nonetheless appoint such firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its                  discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that such change would be in the best interest of Popular and its shareholders.                                         Representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP will attend the meeting and will be available to respond to any appropriate questions that may arise. They will also have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire.                                         The ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Popular's auditors requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of shares represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on that matter.

conformity         with GAAP, and annually auditing the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The         members of the Audit Committee are not engaged professionally in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employees of Popular. Popular's management is responsible for its accounting, financial management and internal controls.
