PROXY STATEMENT 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board" or "Board of Directors") of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (the "Company") of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"), to be held at our executive offices located at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, on Thursday, May 2, 2019, at 9:30 a.m. (Central Time), for the purposes set forth in the accompanying notice, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy are first being mailed or made available to stockholders on or about March 21, 2019. 
INFORMATION CONCERNING SOLICITATION AND VOTING 
Record Date 
The close of business on March 11, 2019 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of such date, we had 180,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share ("Common Stock"), of which 88,446,348 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, and 10,000,000authorized shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, of which no shares were outstanding. Common Stock is our only outstanding class of voting stock. Each share of Common Stock will have one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
Quorum Requirements 
A majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, is required to constitute a quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at the Annual Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the time of the Annual Meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting until a quorum shall be present or represented by proxy. The Annual Meeting may be adjourned from time to time, whether or not a quorum is present, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes present and entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting. 
Voting Procedures 
Whether you hold shares directly as the stockholder of record or through a broker, trustee or other nominee, as the beneficial owner, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. If you hold shares in street name, you must vote by giving instructions to your broker or nominee. You should follow the voting instructions on any form that you receive from your broker or nominee. The availability of telephone and Internet voting for shares held in street name will depend on your broker's or nominee's voting process. Please refer to the instructions in the materials provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card provided to you for information on the available voting methods. 
If a proxy is properly given prior to or at the Annual Meeting and not properly revoked, it will be voted in accordance with the instructions, if any, given by the stockholder. Subject to the requirements described below, if no instructions are given, each proxy will be voted: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election as directors of the nominees described in this Proxy Statement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the  compensation of our executive officers named in the section below entitled "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Summary Compensation Table" (the "Named Executive Officers");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For a frequency of every year for future non-binding advisory votes on  the compensation of our Named Executive Officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public  accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In accordance with the recommendation of the Board on any other proposal that may properly come before the Annual  Meeting or any adjournment thereof.  
[END TABLE]
The persons named as proxies were selected by our Board of Directors. 
Without your instructions, your broker or nominee is permitted to use its own discretion and vote your shares on certain routine matters (such as Proposal 4), but is not permitted to use its discretion and vote your shares on non-routine matters (such as Proposals 1, 2 and 3). We urge you to give voting instructions to your broker or nominee on all proposals. Shares that are not permitted to be voted by your broker or nominee are called "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes are not considered votes for or against a proposal and, therefore, will have no direct impact on any proposal. If you abstain from voting on Proposal 1, your abstention will have no effect on the outcome of the election. If you abstain from voting on Proposals 2, 3 or 4, your abstention will have the same legal effect as a vote against these proposals. 
Stockholders who give proxies have the right to revoke them at any time before they are voted by delivering a written request to Christopher L. Howard, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, prior to the Annual Meeting or by submitting another proxy at a later date. The giving of the proxy will not affect the right of a stockholder to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person. 
Miscellaneous 
We will bear the cost of printing, mailing and other expenses in connection with this solicitation of proxies and will also reimburse brokers and other persons holding shares of Common Stock in their names or in the names of nominees for their expenses in forwarding the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of such shares. Certain of our directors, officers and employees may, without any additional compensation, solicit proxies in person or by telephone. 
Our management is not aware of any matters other than those described in this Proxy Statement that may be presented for action at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that the proxies will be voted with respect thereto in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting such proxies subject to the direction of our Board of Directors.  PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Introduction 
Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended ("Certificate of Incorporation"), provides that our Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes. All classes of directors have three-year terms. The terms of our Class II directors expire at the Annual Meeting. 
Our Board of Directors has nominated the individuals named below under the caption "Class II Nominees" for election as directors to serve until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 and their successors have been elected and take office or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. Each nominee has consented to be a candidate and to serve if elected. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the nominees named. In connection with the expiration of the current term of the Class II directors, we plan to reduce the size of the Board from nine to eight members effective at the Annual Meeting. 
Qualification of Directors 
As described below, our Board of Directors is composed of individuals from differing backgrounds and experiences. We believe that each of our directors possesses unique qualifications, skills and attributes that complement the performance of the full Board. The experience that each has obtained from his or her professional background, as set forth below, has qualified him or her to serve on our Board of Directors.  
Class II Nominees 
The following table shows the names, ages and principal occupations of each of the nominees designated by our Board of Directors to become directors and the year in which each nominee was first appointed or elected to the Board of Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Age     Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
 Name    Age     Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Age     Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
 Name    Age     Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote FOR each of the Class II nominees. 
Continuing Directors 
Each of the persons named below will continue to serve as a director until the annual meeting of stockholders in the year indicated and a successor is elected and takes office or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. Stockholders are not voting on the election of the Class I directors or Class III directors. The following table shows the names, ages, principal occupations and other directorships of each continuing director and the year in which each was first appointed or elected to our Board or that of our predecessor, Acadia Healthcare Company, LLC: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Age       Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
 Name    Age       Principal Occupation/Other Directorships     Director Since 
 Class III Term Expiring in 2020

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 2: NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") enables our stockholders to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described below in the sections entitled "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" and "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION." Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, override any decision made by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee or create or imply any additional fiduciary duty of the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee will, however, review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
Our executive compensation program is vital to our ability to attract, motivate and retain a highly experienced team of executives. We believe that the program is structured in a manner that supports our company and our business objectives. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for the compensation of our Named Executive Officers disclosed in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our Named Executive Officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this Proxy Statement. Accordingly, we ask our stockholders to vote FOR the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the Company's stockholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the sections entitled "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" and "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION." 
Although the results of this advisory vote are not binding on the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote FOR the resolution to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.  PROPOSAL 3: NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY 
OF THE VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to include, at least once every six years, a non-binding advisory vote regarding the frequency of the non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation. In casting their advisory vote, stockholders may choose among four options: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A vote every year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A vote every two years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A vote every three years; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To abstain from voting.  
[END TABLE]
The last time the Company's stockholders cast a frequency vote was at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders. The stockholders voted in favor of a frequency of every year. Based on these results and the reasons described below, the Board of Directors has determined that a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate alternative for us at this time. The Board of Directors believes that an advisory vote every year will be the most effective timeframe for us to respond to stockholders' feedback and provide us with sufficient time to engage with stockholders to understand and respond to the vote results. Setting a one-year period will enhance stockholder communication by providing a clear, simple means for us to obtain information on investor sentiment about our executive compensation philosophy. 
Although this advisory vote is non-binding, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and will respect the expressed desire of the Company's stockholders by implementing the option, if any, that receives an affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter. If no option receives a majority, the Board will select the annual option to be in effect until the next vote on the frequency of the vote on executive compensation. 
The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote for a frequency of every year for future non-binding stockholder advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers.  PROPOSAL 4: RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. Although ratification is not required by our Amended and Restated Bylaws, as amended ("Bylaws"), or otherwise, our Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. 
Fees 
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP for the audit of our annual financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and fees incurred for other services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP for such years: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(1)    $ 4,238,924      $ 4,247,839   
 Audit-Related Fees      —          —     
 Tax Fees(2)      870,843        2,749,039   
 All Other Fees      —          —     
 Total Fees    $ 5,109,767      $ 6,996,878   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Primarily for the audit of our annual financial statements and the review of our quarterly financial  statements, and services provided in connection with acquisition due diligence.  
(2)  Primarily for tax compliance services and other tax planning and tax advice services.  
[END TABLE]
Pre-approval of Auditor Services 
The charter of the Audit Committee provides that the Audit Committee must pre-approve all auditing and non-auditing services to be provided by our auditor. In addition, the Audit Committee shall have the sole authority to approve any compensation to our auditor for any approved audit or non-audit services. For 2018, all services provided by Ernst & Young LLP were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. All non-audit services were reviewed by the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee concluded that the provision of such services by Ernst & Young LLP was compatible with the maintenance of that firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. 
Required Vote 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter is needed to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Under Delaware law, an abstention will have the same legal effect as a vote against the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the ratification of the independent registered public accounting firm. If the appointment is not ratified, the matter will be referred to the Audit Committee for further review. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend that the stockholders vote FOR ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Independence of the Board of Directors 
Our Board annually reviews the independence of all of our directors and affirmatively makes a determination as to the independence of each director based on whether such director satisfies the definition of "independent director" as set forth in the applicable rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Our Board has determined that all of our directors are independent directors other than Ms. Osteen and Mr. Jacobs. 
Code of Conduct and Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Conduct which is applicable to all of our officers, employees and directors, including our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, the principal accounting officer or controller and all persons performing similar functions (together, the "Senior Financial Officers").

• Carrying out such other responsibilities delegated by the Board relating to the director nominations process and  procedures.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee is currently composed of Ms. Gregg, Messrs. Bissell and Grieco and Dr. Petrie, with Mr. Bissell serving as Chairman. During 2018, the Nominating Committee held two meetings. The Nominating Committee has a written charter available on our website, www.acadiahealthcare.com under the webpage "Investors – Corporate Governance." 
Meetings of our Board of Directors and Committees 
During 2018, our Board of Directors held a total of sixteen meetings and took action by written consent one time. Each directorattended 75% or more of the meetings of our Board and the committees of our Board of Directors on which such director served. 
Nomination of Directors 
Nominations By the Nominating Committee 
Directors may be nominated by our Nominating Committee, Board, executive officers or by our stockholders in accordance with our Bylaws, Certificate of Incorporation, applicable laws and any guidelines developed by Nominating Committee or the Board. The Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board and its committees, and recommending candidates for the Board's selection as director nominees for election at the annual or other properly convened meeting of the stockholders in accordance with our Bylaws and applicable laws and regulations. The Nominating Committee meets to discuss and evaluate the qualities and skills of each candidate, both on an individual basis and taking into account the overall composition and needs of the Board. The Nominating Committee considers each identified candidate's qualifications, which include the nominee's experience, business acumen, education, integrity, character, commitment, diligence, conflicts of interest and ability to exercise sound business judgment. While we have not established diversity standards for nominees, as a matter of practice, we generally seek nominees with a broad diversity of experience, professions, skills and backgrounds. We do not currently pay a fee to any third party to identify or assist in identifying or evaluating potential nominees.  Nominations By Our Stockholders 
Our Bylaws govern stockholder nominations of directors. To make a director nomination at the 2020 annual meeting, a stockholder of record entitled to vote at the annual meeting must deliver a written notice (containing certain information specified in our Bylaws as discussed below) to Christopher L. Howard, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, at Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067 between the close of business on January 3, 2020 and the close of business on February 2, 2020. If the date of the 2020 annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after May 2, 2020, the stockholder's notice must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company. To make a director nomination to be voted on at a special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, a stockholder of record entitled to vote in such election must deliver written notice to our secretary at the address above no earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such special meeting and no later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day on which we first publicly announce the date of the special meeting and the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting. 
For a stockholder nomination to be deemed proper, the notice must contain certain information specified in our Bylaws, including information as to the director nominee(s) proposed by the stockholder, the name and address of the stockholder, the class and number of shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by the stockholder, a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and any other persons (including each proposed nominee(s) if applicable) in connection with the proposed nominations, and a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to bring such business or nominate the person(s) named in the notice. 
Majority Voting for Uncontested Director Elections; Director Resignation Policy 
In May 2017, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws became effective that adopted a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections. In contested elections, directors will continue to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast. The Board also adopted a Director Resignation Policy requiring a nominee for director to submit a written offer of resignation to the Board in the event such nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election of directors. The Director Resignation Policy addresses the continuation in office of a "holdover" director, so that an incumbent director who does not receive the requisite affirmative majority of the votes cast for his or her re-election must tender his or her resignation to the Board. In the event a nominee submits a written officer of resignation to the Board, the Nominating and Governance Committee will promptly consider the director's offer of resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept the resignation or reject it. The Board will act on such recommendation within 90 days following receipt of the recommendation. 
Communicating with the Board 
All stockholder communications with our Board of Directors should be directed to Christopher L. Howard, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, at Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, and should prominently indicate on the outside of the envelope that it is intended for our Board of Directors or for an individual director. Each communication intended for our Board of Directors and received by Mr. Howard will not be opened, but will be promptly forwarded unopened to the Chairman of the Audit Committee following its clearance through normal security procedures. 
Attendance by Members of the Board of Directors at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
We encourage each member of our Board of Directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders. For the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, each director attended in person or participated by phone. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board of Directors does not have a formal policy on whether the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors should be separate. While historically these roles have been combined, the Company currently has separate individuals serve in those positions. Reeve B. Waud serves as the Chairman of the   Board and Debra K. Osteen serves as our Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Osteen is also a member of the Board. The Board of Directors has carefully considered its leadership structure and believes at this time that the Company and its stockholders are best served by having the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer filled by different individuals. This allows the Chief Executive Officer to, among other things, focus on the Company's day-to-day business, while allowing the Chairman to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing advice and oversight of management. In addition, our independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside our Company and industry, while the Chief Executive Officer brings Company-specific experience and expertise. The Board of Directors recognizes that depending on future circumstances, other leadership models may become more appropriate. Accordingly, the Board of Directors will continue to periodically review its leadership structure. 
Risk Oversight 
Our Board is responsible for overseeing our risk management process. The Board fulfills its responsibility by delegating many of these functions to its committees. Under its charter, the Audit Committee is responsible for meeting periodically with management to review our major financial risks and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such risks. The Audit Committee also oversees our financial reporting and internal controls and compliance programs. 
The Board receives reports on risk management from our senior officers and from the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Also, our Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary provides a summary of our outstanding litigation and any governmental investigations to our Board at each Board meeting. Additionally, our Board regularly engages in discussions of the most significant risks that we are facing and how these risks are being managed. Our Board of Directors believes that the work undertaken by the Audit Committee, together with the oversight provided by the full Board of Directors, enables the Board to oversee our risk management function effectively. 
Non-Management Executive Sessions 
We had seven independent directors in 2018. During 2018, there were seven executive sessions of the independent directors. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Since May 19, 2016, the Compensation Committee has consisted of Ms. Gregg, Messrs. Gordon and Miquelon and Dr. Petrie, none of whom has at any time been one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers serves, or in the past year served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has or had one or more of its executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee. 
Policy on Reporting of Concerns Regarding Accounting Matters 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy on the reporting of concerns regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters. We have established a compliance hotline called ValuesLine (800-500-0333), which is administered by a third party, as a hotline for the receipt, retention and treatment of complaints from employees or others regarding accounting, internal accounting controls and auditing matters. Information received through the hotline is conveyed directly to our Chief Compliance Officer. Complaints relating to accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters will then be directed to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Any complaint may be made anonymously if the claimant so desires, and all claimants will be provided confidentiality in the handling of the complaint.  Procedure for Approval of Transactions with Related Persons 
We have established policies and other procedures regarding approval of transactions between the Company and any employee, officer, director, and certain of their family members and other related persons, including those required to be reported under Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). These policies and procedures are generally not in writing, but are evidenced by principles set forth in our Code of Conduct or adhered to by our Board. As set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, the Audit Committee reviews and approves all related person transactions after reviewing such transaction for potential conflicts of interests and improprieties. Accordingly, all such related person transactions are submitted to the Audit Committee for ongoing review and oversight. Generally speaking, we enter into related person transactions only on terms that we believe are at least as favorable to the Company as those that we could obtain from an unrelated third party. See the section below entitled "CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS" for additional information.  MANAGEMENT

Executive Summary 
Acadia is the leading publicly traded pure-play provider of behavioral healthcare services, with operations in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our business strategy is to acquire and develop behavioral healthcare facilities and improve our operating results within our facilities and our other behavioral healthcare operations. We strive to improve the operating results of our facilities by providing quality patient care, expanding referral networks and marketing initiatives while meeting the increased demand for behavioral healthcare services through expansion of our current locations as well as developing new services within existing locations. The Company grew rapidly between becoming a publicly-traded company in late 2011 and 2016, completing several significant acquisitions during that period. Since acquiring Priory Group No. 1 Limited in early 2016, acquisition activity has slowed considerably compared to prior years, while organic growth through bed additions and development has continued. The Company experienced various business challenges beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2018, including challenges with its United Kingdom operations relating to, among other things, a lower census than expected and higher labor expense resulting from staffing shortages 
Acadia has a history of motivating leaders through the use of performance-based pay with challenging annual and long-term incentives and a record of good alignment with stockholders' interests as a result of incentive designs and executive equity ownership. As described in greater detail below, our executive compensation program seeks to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  attract and retain superior executives by providing the opportunity to earn competitive compensation packages,   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  align the pay of our executive officers with Company performance, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  recognize and reward senior management's individual and collective efforts relating to the financial  performance of the Company and creation of stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Despite various challenges and external headwinds, the Company produced solid operating results in 2018 as described below. Nonetheless, the Company's performance fell short of target goals set for management in early 2018 and, accordingly, executives did not realize the full potential of the Company's annual and long-term incentive compensation opportunities for 2018. Further, the realizable value (as defined below) of outstanding equity awards held by our executives decreased consistent with the decline in our stock price. We believe that the compensation of our executive officers was well aligned with our financial and operating performance, and the returns experienced by our stockholders, and reflected the challenging year. We remain committed to providing quality patient care at our facilities and supporting our long-term strategic objectives. We believe that the Company is well positioned to address the challenges facing it and to grow through future acquisitions and same-facility growth, both of which will contribute to additional stockholder value creation in the future. 
Following the say-on-pay vote at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and extensive review and discussions with our independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), about our executive compensation program and that of our peer companies, we initiated several changes to our executive compensation program aimed at further aligning our executive compensation program with long-term stockholder interests. Those changes are reflected in the executive compensation programs implemented in 2018 as described below.  
On December 16, 2018, the Company announced a leadership transition whereby Debra K. Osteen became the Company's Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, and Reeve B. Waud became the Chairman of the Board, separating the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Joey A. Jacobs was removed from his positions as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. In connection with this transition, Ms. Osteen received a compensation package as described below in "Chief Executive Officer Transition - Ms. Osteen's Compensation Arrangements" and Mr. Jacobs received the compensation described below in "Chief Executive Officer Transition - Mr. Jacobs' Payments Upon Termination."

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EPS (as defined below) for purposes of our compensation plans was $2.39 for 2018 compared with $2.41 for  2017, on a 0.4% increase in weighted average basic shares outstanding. For purposes of our 2018 equity and non-equity incentive awards, our target level Adjusted EPS was $2.45.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) for purposes of our compensation plans was approximately $597.2 million  for 2018 compared with approximately $602.1 million for 2017. For purposes of our 2018 equity and non-equity incentive awards, our target level Adjusted EBITDA was $640.5 million.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures can be found beginning on page 59 of this Proxy Statement.   Pay for Performance 
Compensation paid to executive officers for 2018 reflects the alignment of pay with the Company's performance, as more fully described in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Below Target Payment of 2018 Non-Equity Incentive Compensation.  The Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and revenue measures set forth in our non-equity incentive compensation plan for 2018 were achieved at 93.2%, 97.6% and 98.4% of target, respectively, resulting in the  payment of below-target cash bonuses to our Named Executive Officers as described below in the section entitled "Components of Executive Compensation – Annual Non-Equity Incentive Compensation."   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Below Target Vesting of 2018 Equity Awards. Based on actual 2018 Adjusted EPS performance in relation to  targets, the first tranche of the performance vesting restricted stock units granted in 2018 were earned below target levels. As further described in the section below entitled "Components of Executive Compensation – Equity-Based  Compensation," approximately 83.8% of the first tranche of both the 2018 restricted stock unit annual award and 2018 restricted stock unit transition award was earned, subject to the three-year TSR modifier, and performance vesting restricted  stock units issued in 2017 and 2016 did not vest and were forfeited.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reduction in Realizable Value of Outstanding Equity Awards. Given the trading price of our common stock,  the realizable value of prior-year equity awards was significantly below the granted opportunity as of the end of 2018. For example, realizable value as of December 31, 2018 of equity awards granted to our Chief Executive Officer  (Mr. Jacobs for purposes of this analysis) during the past three fiscal years represents approximately 34% of the originally granted target opportunity. See the section below entitled "– Assessment of Realizable Pay and  Performance."

Stockholder Approval of Executive Compensation on an Advisory Basis 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2018, we held an advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as disclosed in our Proxy Statement dated March 23, 2018 related to the annual meeting. Stockholders of the Company expressed strong support for the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, with approximately 97% of the votes cast supporting the Company's executive compensation. Given the strong support of the stockholders and the significant changes implemented in the 2018, the Compensation Committee's approach to compensation programs for 2019 has remained relatively consistent with 2018. 
Executive Compensation Highlights 
Following the say-on-pay vote at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and extensive review and discussions with our independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC ("Pay Governance"), about our executive compensation program and that of our peer companies, our executive compensation program included the following features for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Salary Increase for our Chief Executive Officer — Modest 2% raises to the base salary of each of  our applicable Named Executive Officers for 2018, except for Mr. Jacobs whose base salary did not increase for 2018;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Re-affirm our Approach of Allocating the Majority of Equity Value to  Performance-Based Awards — 75% of overall long-term incentive value for each Named Executive Officer is delivered as performance vesting restricted stock units and 25% as time-vesting restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Introduction of Relative TSR to Performance-Based Equity Incentive Awards — Adopted an additional  performance metric under performance vesting restricted stock unit awards, in the form of a modifier based on our three-year TSR relative to the companies listed in the S&P Composite 1500 Index within the GICS Healthcare Providers and Services  Industry Group, plus Brookdale Senior Living Inc. and Civitas Solutions, Inc. (collectively, the "TSR Peer Group");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three-Year Performance Period for Restricted Stock Units — The performance-based restricted stock  units will vest only after the three-year performance period and only if the Company meets or exceeds established Adjusted EPS goals, with shares earned based on Adjusted EPS performance to be adjusted up or down based on our three-year TSR relative  to the TSR Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Introduction of Revenue as Component of Annual Non-Equity Incentive  Awards — Revenue added as a financial measure for determining annual cash incentive awards, strengthening our focus on continued strong growth and reducing the weight of Adjusted EPS in the calculation. The Compensation Committee reviewed  the relationship between performance in each of our three primary incentive plan metrics (revenue, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted EBITDA) and long-term stockholder value creation and found each to be strongly correlated to long-term stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reductions in our Chief Executive Officer's 2018 Long-Term Incentive Opportunity — In addition  to the performance award design changes described above, we reduced Mr. Jacobs' 2018 target long-term incentive award value by $500,000, or 7%, when compared to his 2017 target award.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee approved the following annual compensation package for Ms. Osteen for 2019, separate from her initial stock grant in February 2019 and any retention bonus to be paid in 2019: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (i)  base salary of $900,000,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (ii)  non-equity incentive award with threshold, target and maximum award  levels at 50%, 100% and 200%, respectively,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iii)  equity incentive awards consisting of a grant of performance vesting restricted stock units and shares of time  vesting restricted stock, with a target value of at least $3.2 million, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (iv)  insurance, health and welfare benefits generally applicable to our Named Executive Officers.   
[END TABLE]
See "Components of Executive Compensation – Annual Non-Equity Incentive Compensation" and "Components of Executive Compensation – Equity-Based Compensation" for more information about awards of non-equity and equity compensation. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Summary Compensation Table" for more information about the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. 
Assessment of Realizable Pay and Performance 
The Compensation Committee believes that the best way to drive stockholder value creation is to design compensation programs that motivate management and reward success by aligning executive rewards with stockholders and limiting realizable compensation when stockholder value declines and/or goals are not achieved. Acadia's performance-based executive compensation program historically has resulted in strong alignment between realizable pay and company performance. 
In assessing pay and performance, the Company's independent compensation consultant, Pay Governance, analyzed the realizable pay of our former Chief Executive Officer in relation to originally granted opportunity and to the Company's performance as defined by TSR. Unlike the results reported in the Summary Compensation Table in "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION," realizable pay looks at the pay an executive earned or could have earned for a period based on the actual financial performance against the Company's incentive goals and the share price performance that drove those results. The Compensation Committee believes that realizable pay is a better gauge for assessing pay and performance alignment than the data found in the Summary Compensation Table. 
For purposes of this review, realizable pay includes the actual rewards Mr. Jacobs earned from 2016 to 2018 including base salaries received, actual non-equity compensation earned, current value (as opposed to grant date or accounting value used in the Summary Compensation Table) of time-based restricted stock awards granted during the period, and current value of shares earned or estimated to be earned from performance vesting restricted stock unit awards granted in the three-year period, but excluding any amounts payable to him related to his termination as an employee of the Company in December 2018. Outstanding equity awards are valued using the Company's stock price as of December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year.  Pay Governance compared, and our Compensation Committee reviewed, Mr. Jacobs' realizable compensation to granted pay opportunity at target and to company performance, including performance relative to our compensation peers and found alignment between realizable pay and TSR performance. As shown in the graphs below, the Company's pay program has produced realizable pay levels that are directionally and reasonably aligned with the Company's performance. From 2016 through 2018, we granted Mr. Jacobs approximately $28.3 million in total direct compensation ("TDC") opportunity, yet his realizable pay for such compensation as of the end of 2018 was only approximately $13.5 million (48% of the granted opportunity). The significant driver was long-term incentive awards, with $7.0 million realizable by Mr. Jacobs compared to $20.7 million of granted opportunity. This compares to the Company's three-year TSR of (26)% from 2016 to 2018. Peer median TSR over the same three-year period was 7%. 
For purpose of the graph, TDC is comprised of (1) actual base salary, (2) annual non-equity incentive awards (target for granted opportunity; actual for realizable pay), and (3) long-term equity incentive awards (at grant date fair value for granted opportunity; at current values based on year-end stock price for realizable pay). To facilitate this comparison, we have calculated these amounts without regard to vesting requirements. 
Compensation Process and Philosophy 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for discharging our Board of Directors' responsibilities relating to the oversight, administration and approval of our compensation plans, policies and programs for our executive officers and directors. The primary responsibilities and duties of the Compensation Committee are described above in the section entitled "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE – Committees of the Board of Directors – Compensation Committee." 
Our executive compensation program seeks to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Link the interests of management with those of our stockholders by encouraging stock ownership and aligning  performance equity awards with stockholder returns;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain superior executives by providing them with the opportunity to earn total compensation packages  that are competitive within the healthcare industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recognize and reward senior management's individual and collective efforts relating to the financial  performance of the Company and creation of stockholder value through salary, annual cash incentives and long-term stock-based incentives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Manage compensation based on the individual's level of skill, knowledge, effort and responsibility.   
[END TABLE]
 The Compensation Committee believes that the compensation of our executive officers should provide a competitive level of total compensation necessary to attract and retain talented and experienced executives, and motivate them to contribute to our success. The Compensation Committee has a pay-for-performance philosophy that works to align the interests of management with the interests of stockholders through the use of incentive compensation and an approach that puts a majority of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers at risk if the Company does not perform. 
Our Compensation Committee reviews and approves, in advance, employment and similar arrangements or payments to be made to any executive officer. Historically, Mr. Jacobs provided the Compensation Committee with input regarding the performance of and compensation recommendations for other executive officers based on his direct knowledge of their contributions during the year. Our Chief Executive Officer does not play any role with respect to the deliberations and determinations about his or her own compensation. Our Chief Executive Officer considers internal pay equity issues, individual contribution and performance, competitive pressures and our financial performance in making his or her recommendations to the Compensation Committee. 
Our Compensation Committee believes that our executive compensation program should be internally consistent and equitable in order to achieve our compensation goals. The Compensation Committee relies on its collective judgment together with the information provided to it by management, the analyses and goals described above and the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee also considers the qualifications, length of service, experience, consistency of performance, position, responsibilities, individual performance and available competitive alternatives of our executives, their existing compensation and our financial resources, performance and prospects in determining appropriate levels of compensation for our executives.

 Role of Compensation Consultant 
Following the say-on-pay vote at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders in May 2017, our Compensation Committee interviewed various compensation consultants and retained Pay Governance to evaluate the Company's executive compensation program and advise it regarding potential changes for 2018. Pay Governance supported the Compensation Committee in its review of pay programs and practices in light of the 2017 say-on-pay vote and within the context of continuing and improving the alignment of executive pay with stockholders. The Compensation Committee used this information to make compensation decisions for 2018 and to implement the changes described herein. The Compensation Committee has retained Pay Governance to advise it with respect to 2019. 
Our Compensation Committee has considered the relationships that Pay Governance has had with the Company, the members of the Compensation Committee and our executive officers, and has taken into account the factors required by NASDAQ to be considered when assessing a consultant's independence. After considering such relationships and factors, the Compensation Committee determined that the work of Pay Governance in 2017 and 2018 did not raise any conflicts of interest. Outside of their direct engagement by the Compensation Committee as independent compensation consultants to the Compensation Committee with respect to executive compensation matters, Pay Governance has not provided other services to the Company in 2017 or 2018. 
Peer Group Comparison 
In late 2017, for purposes of reviewing 2017 compensation and setting 2018 compensation for our executive officers and in determining to make the changes for 2018 described herein, Pay Governance assisted the Compensation Committee in establishing a peer group of publicly-traded healthcare companies generally similarly sized and with similar service offerings to us (the "2018 Peer Group"). The 2018 Peer Group consisted of the following companies: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Amedisys, Inc.       LifePoint Health,  Inc.(1) 
   Brookdale Senior Living Inc.       Magellan Health, Inc. 
   Civitas Solutions, Inc.       MEDNAX, Inc. 
   The Ensign Group, Inc.       Molina Healthcare, Inc. 
   Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc.(1)       Quest Diagnostics Incorporated 
   Encompass Health Corporation (formerly HealthSouth Corp.)       Select Medical Holdings Corporation 
   Kindred Healthcare,  Inc.(1)       Universal Health Services, Inc. 
   Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Ceased to be a publicly traded company during 2018.   
[END TABLE]
The 2018 Peer Group was established using similar criteria for selection of the prior year's peer group selected by our Compensation Committee, specifically: industry, market capitalization, revenue and revenue growth, and adjusting for mergers and acquisition activity among peers. For purposes of comparison, our projected revenue at the time the 2018 Peer Group was selected placed us below the 25th percentile of the 2018 Peer Group, allowing for continued growth. Our market capitalization was approximately $2.8 billion as of October 25, 2017, which placed us between the 50th and 75th percentiles of the 2018 Peer Group. 
In late 2018, for purposes of reviewing 2018 compensation and setting 2019 compensation for our executive officers, Pay Governance assisted the Compensation Committee in establishing a peer group for 2019 (the "2019 Peer Group"). The 2019 Peer Group consisted of all of the companies in the 2018 Peer Group with the exception of Kindred Healthcare, Inc.  Chief Executive Officer Transition 
Ms. Osteen's Compensation Arrangements 
Ms. Osteen's annual base salary is $900,000 and her target annual non-equity incentive compensation for each calendar year during her employment period with the Company is 100% of her base salary. For 2019, Ms. Osteen is entitled to a long-term incentive award with a target value equal to not less than $3.2 million. Thereafter, Ms. Osteen will be eligible to receive annual grants of equity or other long-term incentive awards in amounts as determined by the Compensation Committee. To offset the value of compensation forfeited or forgone and compensate for other economic consequences of revoking her separation agreement with her former employer and joining the Company, Ms. Osteen received (1) a one-time equity grant of restricted stock units with a grant date fair value of $6.65 million that will vest ratably on the first two anniversaries of the effective date of her employment (which shares of restricted stock will be reduced by a number of shares (valued at the effective date of her employment) equal to any amounts received by Ms. Osteen in respect of stock options issued by her former employer and held by her on December 12, 2018), (2) a one-time cash sign-on bonus in the amount of $350,000 and (3) an additional $2.5 million cash payment on the first anniversary of the effective date of her employment (subject to Ms. Osteen's employment at such time). See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control under the Employment Agreements" for more information about the terms of Ms. Osteen's Employment Agreement. 
Mr. Jacobs' Payments Upon Termination 
In December 2018, Mr. Jacobs was removed from his positions as the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company. In connection with his termination and pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company, Mr. Jacobs received cash payments of approximately $8.1 million, representing an aggregate amount equal to the sum of (A) three times his base salary, (B) three times his target non-equity incentive compensation for 2018, (C) unpaid base salary through the termination date, (D) unreimbursed expenses through the termination date and (E) payment in respect of unused paid time off and sick pay accrued as of the termination date. Mr. Jacobs also received his pro-rata annual non-equity incentive compensation for 2018 in March 2019 and is entitled to receive an amount equal to the cost of COBRA premiums for continued health and dental insurance for 36 months after termination as well as a pay-out of amounts under the Company's Nonqualified Deferred Compensation plan. In addition, all of Mr. Jacobs' unvested restricted stock became vested upon termination and Mr. Jacobs will be entitled to receive additional shares of common stock in the future pursuant to his performance vesting restricted stock units based upon the Company's performance. Mr. Jacobs did not receive any payments or benefits in addition to those described above that were paid pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company. See "Executive Compensation" for additional details. 
Separation of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Roles 
In conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer transition, we separated the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. Ms.  Osteen serves as our Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors while Reeve B. Waud became the Chairman of the Board. 
Components of Executive Compensation 
The components of our compensation program for executive officers include base salary, performance-based cash and equity incentive compensation, and time-based equity awards.  The following table summarizes the elements of our compensation program for our Named Executive Officers and provides information about each element:

[END TABLE]
As illustrated in the charts below and consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy, 80% of our former Chief Executive Officer's total direct compensation and, on average, 68% of the other Named Executive Officers' (other than Ms. Osteen) total direct compensation for 2018 was performance-based pay, with a significant emphasis on long-term performance and stockholder value creation. For the purposes of these charts, total direct compensation includes base salary, actual non-equity incentive compensation and the grant date fair value of our annual equity grants made in 2018. The stock awards portion of these charts were determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation value and assume that target performance goals for performance vesting restricted stock units issued in 2018 are attained during the initial year of the performance period in accordance with ASC 718 rather than during all three years of the performance period given the change in structure of the 2018 awards compared to the performance vesting restricted stock units issued in prior years. See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Summary Compensation Table" for more information about the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers. 
Base Salary 
Our Compensation Committee generally meets on an annual basis to review each Named Executive Officer's base salary and to consider adjustments to each Named Executive Officer's base salary for the following year. The base salaries under the employment agreements for our Named Executive Officers are subject to an annual increase in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee.  In setting base salaries for 2018 and 2019, the Compensation Committee reviewed the composition of the relevant peer group and discussed peer group information with the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultants. For 2018, for Named Executive Officers other than himself and Ms. Osteen, Mr. Jacobs provided the Compensation Committee with an evaluation of the individual performance and roles and responsibilities of each executive officer. Given our financial performance for 2018 and other considerations deemed relevant by the Compensation Committee, the committee determined to provide modest 2.0% raises to the base salary of each of our Named Executive Officers for 2019 except for Ms. Osteen and Messrs. Turner and Jacobs. 
The base salaries for the Named Executive Officers effective as of January 1, 2018 and 2019 are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Base Salary As of January 1, 2018      Base Salary As of January 1, 2019      Percentage Increase

[END TABLE]
See "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Summary Compensation Table" for more information about the base salaries paid to our Named Executive Officers. 
Annual Non-Equity Incentive Compensation 
Annual non-equity incentive awards paid to our Named Executive Officers are a reward for the realization of established performance objectives. Our Compensation Committee annually adopts a cash bonus plan pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Incentive Plan") for each Named Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee generally meets in February or March to review whether and the extent to which performance objectives have been achieved for the prior year. All non-equity incentive awards are subject to the review and approval of the Compensation Committee, which has the discretion to adjust any and all such awards. 
2018 Awards 
For 2018, based on input from Pay Governance and a review of the relative correlation between internal financial metrics and stockholder value creation, the Compensation Committee determined that revenue should be added as a component of our non-equity incentive compensation program for executive officers and that the impact of Adjusted EPS should be reduced but maintained given its strong relationship to driving stockholder value. Therefore, annual non-equity incentive compensation payable to our Named Executive Officers for 2018 was based 100% on the Company-wide measures Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and revenue, with Adjusted EBITDA determining 50% of the total incentive award, Adjusted EPS determining 30% of the total incentive award and revenue determining 20% of the total incentive award. The Compensation Committee used these measures for determining annual cash incentive awards because they are important measures of our performance and the performance of our management, they drive our success and growth and they are key criteria by which management plans and analyzes our business. 
For purposes of determining 2018 non-equity incentive compensation, we define Adjusted EBITDA as the sum of the following: (a) net income from continuing operations, (b) interest expense, (c) income tax expense, (d) depreciation and amortization expense, (e) equity-based compensation expense, (f) transaction-related expenses, (g) loss on extinguishment of debt, (h) impairment and other non-cash charges, (i) legal settlement costs, (j) severance and restructuring costs and (k) gain or loss on foreign currency derivatives. Adjusted EPS is defined as (a) adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to the Company divided by (b) diluted weighted-average shares   outstanding. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to the Company is defined as the sum of (a) net income attributable to the Company; (b) income or loss from discontinued operations; and (c) provision for income taxes; plus the sum of (d) transaction-related expenses (e.g. acquisition-related diligence and advisory costs, contract termination costs, etc.); (e) gain or loss on extinguishment of debt; (f) impairment and other non-cash gains and charges (e.g. gain or loss on disposal of property); (g) legal settlement costs; (h) severance and restructuring costs; and (i) gain or loss on foreign currency derivatives; minus (j) adjusted income tax provision, as disclosed in or derived from the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, press releases or other financial records, as appropriate. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS are calculated net of non-equity incentive payments and excluding the impact of gains or losses as a result of foreign currency conversions or fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For purposes of determining whether 2018 performance objectives were met, our Adjusted EBITDA and revenue goals are adjusted to include 90% of earnings generated by acquisitions completed during 2018, while Adjusted EPS is adjusted to include 50% of earnings generated by acquisitions completed during 2018, in order to incentivize management to pursue accretive acquisitions that will benefit the Company without inequitably adjusting performance objectives.The Compensation Committee did not make any further adjustments in determining Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EPS and revenue for 2018 compensation plan purposes. 
The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum cash incentive award for 2018 (as a percentage of base salary) for each of the Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Osteen).

(1)  As described below, Named Executive Officers may receive an aggregate of less than the threshold percentage of  their base salary listed above if performance exceeds the threshold level of one or more, but not all, of the applicable performance measures.  
[END TABLE]
These target and maximum percentages are no less than the target and maximum percentages that each executive is eligible to earn (as a percentage of base salary) pursuant to the employment agreements entered into with each applicable executive in April 2014. 
For purposes of our 2018 non-equity incentive awards, our target level Adjusted EBITDA was $640.5 million, our target level Adjusted EPS was $2.45 and our target level revenue was $3,060.0 million. Threshold and maximum performance levels for each of these measures was 92.5% and 107.5% of target, respectively. The measures are not weighted equally. For example, if our actual Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $640.5 million, Mr. Jacobs would receive 65% of his base salary with respect to the EBITDA portion (50%) of his target bonus (130% of base salary). If our Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.45, Mr. Jacobs would receive 39% of his base salary with respect to the Adjusted EPS portion (30%) of his target bonus (130% of base salary). If our revenue for 2018 was $3,060.0 million, Mr. Jacobs would receive 26% of his base salary with respect to the revenue portion (20%) of his target bonus (130% of base salary). Straight-line interpolation is used to determine awards for performance between goal levels. 
On March 7, 2019, the Compensation Committee met to determine whether and the extent to which the performance goals for the 2018 annual non-equity incentive awards had been achieved. Actual Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of our 2018 non-equity incentive awards was approximately $597.2 million, actual Adjusted EPS was $2.39 and actual revenue was $3.012 million. The Compensation Committee determined that actual Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was 93.2% of target Adjusted EBITDA, actual Adjusted EPS for 2018 was 97.6% of target Adjusted EPS, and actual revenue was 98.4% of target revenue. The payout as a percentage of target was 70.5%. As a result of these performance measures, the Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Osteen) received the following cash incentive payments with respect to 2018:  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    EBITDA Component      EPS Component      Revenue Component      Total Cash Incentive Payment   
 Ronald M. Fincher    $ 160,949      $ 147,292      $ 105,073      $ 413,314   
 Brent Turner      148,568        135,961        96,991        381,520

[END TABLE]
The amount set forth in the table above as payable to Mr. Jacobs is a pro rata amount based on the date of his termination. In addition to the cash incentive payment set forth in the table, pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement with the Company, Mr. Jacobs was paid an amount equal to three times his target annual non-equity incentive plan compensation for 2018 following his termination in December 2018. See "Executive Compensation" for additional information about amounts paid to Mr. Jacobs. 
2019 Awards 
In March 2019, the Compensation Committee approved non-equity incentive awards for each of our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Jacobs) for 2019 with potential cash incentive payments to be based 100% on the following company-wide measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Equity-Based Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee believes that time vesting restricted stock and performance vesting restricted stock units are a key component to the compensation of our executive officers, and providing a mix of different types of equity awards is consistent with market practice for executive officers in our peer group. The Compensation Committee believes that restricted stock and restricted stock units provide a substantial incentive to our Named Executive Officers by allowing them to directly participate in any increase in our long-term value. These incentives are intended to reward, motivate and retain the services of our Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee believes that a mix of equity awards aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our stockholders and is consistent with our pay-for-performance philosophy. Equity-based awards are typically granted under the Incentive Plan in February or March of each year. 
2018 Annual Awards 
As discussed earlier, the Compensation Committee implemented significant changes to our compensation program for 2018. The Compensation Committee continued to maintain Adjusted EPS as the core long-term metric for purposes of performance vesting equity awards and continues to believe that a substantial portion of equity awards should be performance based (with 75% of awards being performance vesting restricted stock units and 25% of awards being time vesting restricted stock). However, it made the following changes for 2018 awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee reduced Mr. Jacobs' 2018 target long-term incentive award by $500,000, or  7%, when compared to his 2017 target award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial performance will be measured annually, with Adjusted EPS goals for each of the three years in the  performance period set at the beginning of each year of the three-year term of the award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A TSR modifier that measures the Company's TSR performance relative to a group of industry comparators over  the full three-year performance period was added.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares earned annually based on Adjusted EPS results are accumulated and released at the end of the three-year  term of the award, subject to adjustment based on the new relative TSR modifier. The Compensation Committee believes that release of shares at the end of the three-year term in combination with the application of a three-year relative TSR modifier  increases the long-term orientation of the compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The number of shares accumulated during the term are increased or decreased by up to 25% at the end of the  three-year term based on our three-year TSR relative to that of the TSR Peer Group. If our absolute TSR is negative, the TSR modifier is capped at 100% and cannot increase the share payout.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Adjusted EPS performance range has been expanded to a range of 92.5% to 107.5%. This more expansive range  recognizes potential business volatility over a three-year term and is consistent with the approach taken by our peers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Given the longer three-year payout, an executive whose employment is terminated during the three-year performance  period due to death, disability, retirement, or without cause or for good reason will vest at the end of the three-year performance period, subject to the Company's achievement of the performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
Effective March 2, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved grants of the following number of performance vesting restricted stock units (subject to the achievement of certain performance goals and continued employment) and shares of time vesting restricted stock under the Incentive Plan to our Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Osteen): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Performance Restricted Stock Units      Restricted Stock   
 Ronald M. Fincher      30,741        10,247   
 Brent Turner      28,377        9,459   
 Christopher L. Howard      24,443        8,148   
 David M. Duckworth      21,183        7,061   
 Joey A. Jacobs      128,241        42,747   
[END TABLE]
The allocation among performance vesting restricted stock units (75% of the total equity award) and restricted stock (25% of the total equity award) is not based on a formula approach but reflects the Compensation Committee's view that most equity-based incentives should be performance-based and at risk. The Named Executive Officers must be employed by the Company at the time the restricted stock units and/or restricted stock vest in order to receive the shares of Common Stock underlying each award, except in the case of certain terminations of employment as discussed under the heading "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control under the Employment Agreements."  The 2018 annual awards of performance vesting restricted stock units reflect the changes described above and include the following TSR modifier: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Relative TSR Achieved (compared to TSR Peer Group)% of Target Awarded(1)(2)   
 Relative TSR Achieved (compared to TSR Peer Group)% of Target Awarded(1)(2)   
 75th percentile or greater      125%  
 55th percentile      100%  
 30th percentile or less      75%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Interpolated for performance between percentiles.  
(2)  TSR modifier capped at 100% if the Company's TSR is negative, regardless of applicable Adjusted EPS  amount.  
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Units. The restricted stock units granted effective March 2, 2018 are earned in three equal annual installments based upon the achievement of specified performance levels of Adjusted EPS for 2018, 2019 and 2020, and adjusted before vesting at the end of the full three-year period in accordance with the three-year TSR modifier. The Compensation Committee established, on the grant date, the performance objectives for 2018 for purposes of the vesting of restricted stock units. The performance objectives for 2019 and 2020 are determined by the Compensation Committee subsequent to December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The Compensation Committee believes that Adjusted EPS provides the best incentive to senior management and is the appropriate financial measure for determining vesting of restricted stock unit awards because it is an important measure of our performance and the performance of our management, it drives our success and growth and it is a key criterion by which management plans and analyzes our business. 
The number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon vesting of the restricted stock units ranges from 0% to 200% of the total number of units set forth above in accordance with a formula based on our Adjusted EPS, and adjusted in accordance with the TSR modifier. None of the performance vesting restricted stock units will vest for performance below 92.5% of the specified Adjusted EPS. Unearned performance awards in each performance period are forfeited. 
For 2018, the threshold award (as a percentage of the number of restricted stock units eligible for vesting based on 2018 performance) for each applicable Named Executive Officer was 50%, the target award was 100% and the maximum award was 200%. Subject to remaining vesting and the three-year TSR modifier, the actual number of shares of Common Stock earned each year is based on performance relative to the specified Adjusted EPS for the corresponding year. 
For purposes of our 2018 awards of performance vesting restricted stock units, our target level Adjusted EPS was $2.45. The table below sets forth the number of shares of Common Stock that each Named Executive Officer was eligible to earn for 2018 (as a percentage of the number of restricted stock units eligible for vesting based on 2018 performance), subject to continued employment throughout the performance period, based upon the Company's actual Adjusted EPS for 2018. For example, if our actual Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.45, each Named Executive Officer would earn the number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the number of restricted stock units that may be earned based on 2018 performance, or one-third of the 2018 target grant. The remaining two-thirds remain subject to 2019 and 2020 performance standards. All shares earned are subject to adjustment at the end of the three-year term based on the TSR modifier. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Adjusted EPS of $2.27 - $2.45    Adjusted EPS of $2.45 - $2.63    Adjusted EPS of $2.63 or Greater 
 Adjusted EPS of $2.27 - $2.45    Adjusted EPS of $2.45 - $2.63    Adjusted EPS of $2.63 or Greater 
[END TABLE]
On March 7, 2019, the Compensation Committee met to determine whether and the extent to which the performance goals for the 2018 restricted stock unit awards had been achieved. The Compensation Committee determined that actual Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.39, resulting in approximately 83.8% of the first tranche of the 2018 restricted stock unit annual award being earned as reflected in the table below, subject to remaining vesting and the three-year TSR modifier:

2018 Transition Awards 
As a result of the 2018 change in the vesting schedule of performance vesting restricted stock units from annual vesting to three-year vesting, there was a gap in vesting of equity awards of our Named Executive Officers prior to the completion of the initial three-year term of the 2018 awards. In order to mitigate that gap and to facilitate the transition to the new approach, the Compensation Committee made an additional one-time special transition award of performance vesting restricted stock units to our Named Executive Officers, other than Ms. Osteen and Mr. Jacobs,effective March 2, 2018. The Compensation Committee believes that the transition awards serve as a retention tool and provide motivation to the executive officers during this transition period. 
The Compensation Committee approved transition grants of the following number of performance vesting restricted stock units (subject to the achievement of certain performance goals and continued employment) under the Incentive Plan to our Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Osteen and Mr. Jacobs): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Performance Restricted Stock Units   
 Ronald M. Fincher      15,371   
 Brent Turner      14,188   
 Christopher L. Howard      12,222   
 David M. Duckworth      10,592   
[END TABLE]
The transition awards have the same general design as the 2018 annual awards but with a shorter term and performance measurement period. The one-time special awards are equal to 50% of the grant date value of the 2018 annual performance vesting restricted stock unit awards. The methodology for establishing the vesting criteria and other terms for the 2018 transition awards of performance vesting restricted stock units is consistent with that for the 2018 annual awards with the financial measure Adjusted EPS used for evaluating performance. However, the transition awards will be earned over a two-year period instead of three years and the TSR modifier for the transition awards will be based on the two-year TSR for the Company and the TSR Peer Group. See the section above entitled "– 2018 Annual Awards" for more information about the general terms of the transition awards. 
On March 7, 2019, the Compensation Committee met to determine whether and the extent to which the 2018 performance goals for the transition awards had been achieved. The Compensation Committee determined that actual Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.39, resulting in approximately 83.8% of the first tranche of the transition awards being earned as reflected in the table below, subject to remaining vesting and the two-year TSR modifier:  
[BEGIN TABLE]

Vesting of 2017 and 2016 Restricted Stock Unit Awards 
On March 29, 2017 and February 5, 2016, the Compensation Committee approved grants of the following number of performance vesting restricted stock units under the Incentive Plan to our Named Executive Officers (other than Ms. Osteen): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    2017 Performance Restricted Stock Units      2016 Performance Restricted Stock Units   
 Ronald M. Fincher      26,170        18,367   
 Brent Turner      24,157        16,954   
 Christopher L. Howard      20,808        14,891   
 David M. Duckworth      18,033        11,648   
 Joey A. Jacobs      119,957        83,392   
[END TABLE]
The restricted stock units granted in 2017 and 2016 are earned in three equal annual installments based upon the achievement of specified performance levels of Adjusted EPS. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon vesting of the restricted stock units ranges from 0% to 200% of the total number of units set forth above in accordance with a formula based on our Adjusted EPS. None of the performance vesting restricted stock units will vest for performance below 95% of the specified Adjusted EPS. 
One-third of each of the target amounts for the 2017 and 2016 awards are subject to 2018 Adjusted EPS performance. For 2018 performance under the 2017 and 2016 restricted stock unit awards, the threshold award (as a percentage of the number of restricted stock units eligible for vesting based on 2018 performance) for each Named Executive Officer was 50%, the target award was 100% and the maximum award was 200%. The actual number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting of the restricted stock units each year is based on the Company's actual Adjusted EPS relative to the specified Adjusted EPS for the corresponding year. 
For purposes of our 2017 and 2016 awards of performance vesting restricted stock units, our target level Adjusted EPS was $2.78 for 2017 and $2.98 for 2016, respectively. The tables below set forth the number of shares of Common Stock that each Named Executive Officer was eligible to earn for 2018 performance under the 2017 and 2016 restricted stock unit awards (as a percentage of the number of restricted stock units eligible for vesting based on 2018 performance), subject to continued employment throughout the performance period, based upon the Company's actual Adjusted EPS for 2018. For example, for the 2017 restricted stock unit awards, if our Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.78, each Named Executive Officer would earn the number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the number of restricted stock units that may vest based on 2018 performance, or one-third of the 2017 target grant. The remaining one-third remains subject to 2019 performance standards. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 For the 2016 restricted stock unit awards, if our Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.98, each Named Executive Officer would earn the number of shares of Common Stock equal to 100% of the number of restricted stock units that may vest based on 2018 performance, or one-third of the 2016 target grant.

[END TABLE]
On March 7, 2019, the Compensation Committee met to determine whether and the extent to which the 2018 performance goals for the 2017 and 2016 restricted stock unit awards had been achieved. The Compensation Committee determined that actual Adjusted EPS for 2018 was $2.39. As a result, the restricted stock units issued in 2017 and 2016 did not vest. 
2019 Annual Awards 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee expects to approve grants of performance vesting restricted stock units (subject to the achievement of certain performance goals and continued employment) and shares of time vesting restricted stock under the Incentive Plan to our Named Executive Officers (other than Mr. Jacobs), substantially consistent with past annual equity awards, including the allocation among performance vesting restricted stock units (75% of the total equity award) and restricted stock (25% of the total equity award). 
The 2019 annual awards of performance vesting restricted stock units are expected to include the following TSR modifier: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Relative TSR Achieved (compared to TSR Peer Group)% of Target Awarded(1)(2)   
 Relative TSR Achieved (compared to TSR Peer Group)% of Target Awarded(1)(2)   
 75th percentile or greater      125%

 30th percentile or less      75%  
[END TABLE]
(1) Interpolated for performance between percentiles. 
(2) TSR modifier capped at 100% if the Company's TSR is negative, regardless of applicable Adjusted EPS amount. 
Restricted Stock Units. The methodology for establishing the vesting criteria and other terms for the 2019 awards of performance vesting restricted stock units are expected to be consistent with that for the 2018 annual awards with the financial measure Adjusted EPS used for evaluating performance. 
Restricted Stock. The time vesting restricted stock granted in 2019 are expected to vest 25% per year on the four successive anniversaries of the date of grant. 
See the section above entitled "Components of Executive Compensation – Equity-Based Compensation – 2018 Annual Awards" for more information about restricted stock units, restricted stock and how 2019 awards are expected to vest based on future performance. 
Perquisites and other Benefits 
We provide our Named Executive Officers with modest perquisites (less than $10,000 on an annual basis) that our Compensation Committee believes are reasonable and consistent with our overall executive compensation program. Our Compensation Committee believes that such perquisites help us to retain our executive personnel and allows them to operate more effectively.  Our Named Executive Officers are eligible for health and welfare benefits available to eligible Company employees during active employment under the same terms and conditions. These benefits include medical, dental, vision, short-term and long-term disability and group-term life insurance coverage. The Named Executive Officers also participate in a separate insurance plan that provides long term care benefits to the executives and their spouses. Our general policies applicable to all employees govern paid vacation and other time off for our Named Executive Officers. 
Compensation Clawback Policy 
If the Company is required to restate its financial statements as a result of misconduct, Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer to reimburse the Company for: (i) any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 12 months following the public issuance of the financial statements; and (ii) any profits realized from the sale of Company securities during those 12 months. On February 26, 2015, the Compensation Committee adopted and approved a compensation clawback policy applicable to performance-based equity awards issued to executive officers during and after 2015. Under the clawback policy, if a Named Executive Officer is determined by the Board to have engaged in fraud or misconduct contributing to restatement of the Company's financial statements, the Board shall take appropriate action to address such events, including requiring (i) reimbursement of any equity securities that vested during the preceding three year period, including any proceeds from the sale of such securities, and (ii) cancellation of all unvested equity securities during such three-year period. 
Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act directs the SEC to promulgate additional rules requiring companies listed on stock exchanges to adopt policies regarding the recovery of executive compensation from executive officers for accounting restatements resulting from material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. In accordance with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC issued proposed rules in 2015 regarding the adoption of clawback policies. Upon the SEC's adoption and publication of final rules implementing these requirements, the Compensation Committee will review and, if necessary, revise the Company's clawback policy to conform with such rules. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
On February 28, 2013, our Board adopted and approved the Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, effective February 1, 2013 (the "Deferred Compensation Plan"). The Deferred Compensation Plan is designed to provide tax-deferred compensation for our eligible employees, including executive officers. Deferred compensation plans are common in our industry, and help in the recruitment and retention of top executive talent. 
Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, participants may defer up to 50% of their annual base compensation and up to 100% of any performance-based compensation. Participants are fully vested in their deferral accounts as to amounts they elect to defer. No employer matching contributions are made to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants will be able to select from several fund choices and their deferred compensation account will increase or decrease in value in accordance with the performance of the funds selected. Participants may receive a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Plan upon a qualifying distribution event such as separation from service, disability, death, change in control or an unforeseeable emergency. Following a participant's separation from the Company for any reason, the participant's vested interest in the account is paid to the participant (or the participant's beneficiary in the event of the participant's death) either in a lump sum or up to ten annual installments, as elected by the participant. The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan administered and maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation benefits to participants. 
Risk Assessment 
In addition to overseeing the Company's executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the risk profile of the Company's compensation policies and practices for all employees. The Compensation Committee has concluded that the Company's compensation program does not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking and determined that such program is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact on the Company. See "CORPORATE GOVERNANCE – Risk Oversight" for more information about the Board's role in our risk management process.  Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) 
Code Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain "covered employees" of a publicly held corporation. For taxable years ending December 31, 2017 and earlier, "covered employees" generally referred to the company's Chief Executive Officer and its next three most highly compensated executive officers (excluding the Chief Financial Officer) in the year that the compensation is paid. This limitation does not apply to compensation that is considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under the rules of Section 162(m). The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation" was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million is not deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017 (the scope of which is uncertain under the legislation). In addition, beginning with taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, "covered employees" generally was expanded to include the Company's chief financial officer; also, each individual who is a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016 will remain a covered employee for all future years. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines, Insider Trading Policy, Hedging and Pledging 
In March 2012, the Board of Directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for non-management directors. The guidelines require that each non-management director hold an investment position in our Common Stock equal in value to five times the annual cash retainer (exclusive of any Board committee retainers) paid to non-management directors. The guidelines provide for a five-year transition period during which directors can attain the required ownership. As of December 31, 2018, all of our non-management directors not in a transition period satisfied the applicable stock ownership guidelines. 
In December 2014, the Board of Directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for certain designated officers. The guidelines require that the Named Executive Officers hold an investment position in our Common Stock equal to the following multiples of annual base salary: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Position    Fair Market Value of Stock Holdings as a Multiple of Base Salary   
 Chief Executive Officer      5x   
 Other Named Executive Officers      3x   
[END TABLE]
The guidelines provide for a five-year transition period during which executive officers can attain the required ownership. If an executive officer becomes subject to a greater ownership threshold due to an increase in the amount of his or her annual base salary, the executive officer must satisfy the greater ownership threshold within the later of the original five-year transition period or two years from the effective date of the increase in annual base salary. As of December 31, 2018, all of our Named Executive Officers not in a transition period satisfied the applicable stock ownership guidelines. 
Pursuant to the stock ownership guidelines applicable to non-management directors and executive officers, ownership of the following shares of Common Stock ("Qualified Shares") are counted toward the satisfaction of the applicable ownership requirements: (i) shares owned directly by the non-management director or the executive officer; (ii) shares owned indirectly (e.g. by a spouse or in trust); (iii) restricted shares, including restricted shares that have been granted but that have not vested; (iv) shares issuable upon the settlement of vested restricted stock units; and (v) shares obtained through stock option exercises. For the avoidance of doubt, shares that underlie unexercised options, whether or not vested, will not be deemed to be Qualified Shares. 
We maintain an insider trading policy that governs transactions in our securities by directors, officers and other employees. Among other provisions, the policy prohibits "short-selling" of any equity security of the Company and any hedging transactions. Directors and officers are also prohibited from holding our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging our securities as collateral for a loan.  Termination and Change-in-Control Arrangements 
Under the terms of the compensation plans and employment agreements with the Named Executive Officers, the Named Executive Officers are entitled to payments and benefits upon the occurrence of specified events including termination of employment. The specific terms of these arrangements are discussed under the heading "EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION – Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control under the Employment Agreements." The Compensation Committee believes that these arrangements are appropriate and necessary to attract and retain talented senior executives. The Compensation Committee believes that the potential payments and benefits provide security and encourage retention in the event of an actual or potential change in control, such as a sale or "hostile" takeover. The absence of such arrangements could impact our ability to hire talented executives and an executive's willingness to work through a merger or sale transaction which could be beneficial to our stockholders.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by SEC Regulation S-K, Item 402(b) with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

(1)  Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units granted to each  Named Executive Officer (other than Ms. Osteen) pursuant to the Incentive Plan, determined using a Monte-Carlo simulation value and computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718,  "Stock Compensation," or ASC 718. The awards are described in more detail in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards section below. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K for assumptions relevant to the valuation of stock awards. With respect to annual grants of restricted stock units, the units vest over three years and the amounts assume that the performance goals are attained  during the initial year of the performance period in accordance with ASC 718. With respect to the transition award of restricted stock units granted in 2018, the units vest over two years and assume that the performance goals are attained during the  initial year of the performance period in accordance with ASC 718. The stock awards amounts for 2017 and 2016 assume that target performance goals for performance vesting restricted stock units are attained in all three years of the performance  period given the different structure of the performance vesting restricted stock units issued in years prior to 2018 as described in "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS."

Assuming that the maximum performance goals are attained during the initial year of the performance period in accordance with ASC 718 for the restricted stock units granted in 2018, and during all three years for the restricted stock units granted in 2017 and 2016, the aggregate grant date fair value of the annual grants of restricted stock unit awards would have been:

Under the plan, participants may defer up to 50% of their annual base compensation and up to 100% of any performance-based compensation. Participants are fully vested in their deferral accounts as to amounts they elect to defer. No employer matching contributions are made to the Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants will be able to select from several fund choices and their deferred compensation account will increase or decrease in value in accordance with the performance of the funds selected. Participants may receive a distribution from the Deferred Compensation Plan upon a qualifying distribution event such as separation from service, disability, death, change in control or an unforeseeable emergency or on a specified date selected by a participant. Following a participant's separation from the Company for any reason, the participant's vested interest in the account is paid to the participant (or the participant's beneficiary in the event of the participant's death) either in a lump sum or up to ten annual installments, as elected by the participant. The Deferred Compensation Plan is intended to be an unfunded plan administered and maintained by the Company primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation benefits to participants. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control under the Employment Agreements 
In December 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with Ms. Osteen (the "Osteen Agreement"). In April 2014, we entered into amended and restated employment agreements with each of Messrs. Jacobs, Fincher, Turner and Howard, and an employment agreement with Mr. Duckworth (collectively with the Osteen Agreement, the "Employment Agreements"). A summary of the Employment Agreements is provided below. 
Compensation and Benefits 
The base salaries under the Employment Agreements are subject to an annual increase in the sole discretion of our Board. In addition to base salary, under the Employment Agreements the executives are entitled to participate, in their sole discretion, in all of our employee benefit programs for which senior executive employees are generally eligible. Each executive is also reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with services performed under each executive's Employment Agreement. 
Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation 
During the term of each Employment Agreement and for 12 months thereafter (in the case of Ms. Osteen and Mr. Duckworth), 24 months thereafter (in the case of Messrs. Fincher, Turner and Howard) or 36 months thereafter (in the case of Mr. Jacobs), each such executive is prohibited from (i) directly or indirectly managing, controlling, consulting, rendering services for or participating, engaging or owning an interest in any business which derives 25% of its gross revenue from the business of providing behavioral healthcare and/or related services and (ii) directly or indirectly managing, controlling, rendering services for or participating or consulting with any unit,   division, segment or subsidiary of any other business that engages in or otherwise competes with (or was organized for the purpose of engaging in or competing with) the business of providing behavioral healthcare and/or related services (subject to certain exceptions), in each case within any geographical area in which we engage in such businesses. During the term of each Employment Agreement and for 12 months thereafter (in the case of Ms. Osteen and Mr. Duckworth), 24 months thereafter (in the case of Messrs. Fincher, Turner and Howard) or 36 months thereafter (in the case of Mr. Jacobs), each such executive is prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting or hiring any employee or independent contractor of ours or directly or indirectly soliciting any customer, supplier, licensee, licensor or other business relation of ours. In addition, the executives are subject to customary confidentiality and non-disparagement obligations both during and following their employment with the Company. 
Severance 
Under each Employment Agreement (other than the Osteen Agreement), if the executive is terminated without "Cause" or resigns with "Good Reason," such executive is generally entitled to receive (subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions):

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any other material breach by Ms. Osteen of her Employment Agreement or any other agreement between  Ms. Osteen and us.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment Agreements) means if the applicable executive resigns his or her employment with the Company as a result of one or more of the following actions (in each case taken without the executive's written consent): (i) a reduction in such executive's base salary (other than (for the executives other than Ms. Osteen) as part of an across-the-board reduction that (A) results in a 10% or less reduction of such executive's base salary as in effect on the date of any such reduction or (B) is approved by our Chief Executive Officer); (ii) a material diminution of such executive's job duties or responsibilities inconsistent with the executive's position; (iii) any other material breach by us of such Employment Agreement; or (iv) a relocation of our principal executive offices and corporate headquarters outside of a 30-mile radius of Nashville, Tennessee following relocation thereto in accordance with such Employment Agreement; provided that, none of the events described in clauses (i) through (iv) shall constitute Good Reason unless such executive shall have notified us in writing describing the event which constitutes Good Reason within 90 days after the occurrence of such event and then only if we shall have failed to cure such event within 30 days after our receipt of such written notice and such executive elects to terminate his or her employment as a result at the end of such 30 day period. 
If an executive that is party to an Employment Agreement dies or becomes disabled, such executive is entitled to the applicable Termination Payments (other than the amount equal to a multiple of the target annual cash bonus amount and the amount equal to a multiple of such executive's base salary as in effect on the termination date) and, in the case of Ms. Osteen, the Osteen Termination Payments. In the event that an executive becomes disabled not due to death, such executive is entitled to receive continued installment payments of such executive's base salary as in effect on the termination date for a specified period of time. 
If we terminate an executive under an Employment Agreement for Cause or if any such executive resigns without Good Reason, such executive is only entitled to receive his or her unpaid base salary through the termination date and any bonus amount to which such executive is entitled by reference to the calendar year that ended on or prior to the termination date, and in the case of Ms. Osteen, all other payments, benefits or fringe benefits pursuant to any applicable compensation arrangement as of the termination date. Upon any termination of employment under an Employment Agreement, whether voluntary or otherwise, such executive has the option to elect to continue health insurance coverage until the earlier of (A) such time as the executive is eligible to participate in another health plan or (B) the executive becomes eligible for Medicare. 
The tables below show the amounts that each Named Executive Officer (other than Mr. Jacobs) would have received assuming that the Named Executive Officer's employment was terminated or he or she died or became disabled effective December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and except as noted below, none of the Named Executive Officers were entitled to any compensation or benefits for resignation or retirement. Furthermore, the Employment Agreements do not distinguish a termination following a change in control from a termination in another context. Therefore, a termination following a change in control will entitle a Named Executive Officer to severance benefits only if the Named Executive Officer's employment is otherwise terminated without Cause by the Company or by the Named Executive Officer for Good Reason. Mr. Jacobs was terminated as Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board effective December 16, 2018 and a description of amounts paid or payable to him upon termination can be found at "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Chief Executive Officer Transition – Mr. Jacobs' Payments Upon Termination."

As of December 31, 2018, all unvested restricted stock units of each Named Executive Officer would remain subject to  pre-established performance goals and would vest in future years based on future performance.

2018 and 2019 Performance Vesting Equity Awards 
As described in "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Components of Executive Compensation – Equity-Based Compensation," shares earned annually under performance vesting restricted stock unit awards made in 2018 and 2019 are accumulated and released at the end of the three-year term of the award (or two-year term in the case of the 2018 transition awards), subject to adjustment based on the new relative TSR modifier. Given the longer payout for such awards, awards of an executive whose employment is terminated during the performance period due to death, disability, retirement, or without cause or for good reason will vest at the end of the performance period, subject to the Company's achievement of the performance goals.  Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Ms. Osteen, our Chief Executive Officer: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of the Company (other than our Chief Executive  Officer) was $27,199; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was $1,250,000.  
[END TABLE]
Since Ms. Osteen did not serve as our principal executive officer for the entire year, her 2018 annual total compensation is presented above on an annualized basis. To determine such amount, we added (i) the total base salary she would have earned had she served as our Chief Executive Officer for all of 2018 ($900,000) and (ii) the one-time cash sign-on bonus ($350,000). 
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Ms. Osteen, our Chief Executive Officer, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 46 to 1. Given Ms. Osteen was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer in December 2018, and as such, did not receive an annual long-term equity grant or annual non-equity incentive award in 2018 or participate in our health insurance and other benefit plans, we anticipate the ratio of her compensation to that of our median employee will increase in the future. 
For purposes of the foregoing pay ratio disclosure, we were required to identify the median employee of all employees of the Company, without regard to their location, compensation arrangements or employment status (full-time versus part-time) and then determine the annual total compensation that "median employee" earned during 2018. To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee in 2018, we took the following steps: 
We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our employee population consisted of approximately 42,100 individuals working at the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, with approximately 20,800 of these individuals located in the United States and Puerto Rico and approximately 21,300 located in the United Kingdom (as reported in Item 1, Business, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018). This population consisted of our full-time, part-time and temporary employees. The inclusion of part-time and temporary employees substantially reduces the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees. 
We prepared a list of employees at December 31, 2018 from our payroll records and evaluated total compensation. Total compensation includes salary, stock awards and non-equity incentive plan compensation. Compensation for full-time and part-time employees who commenced employment after January 1, 2018 was annualized. Compensation for temporary employees was not annualized. We used the exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 of 1.33 British pounds to U.S. dollars to calculate total compensation for our employees located in the United Kingdom. 
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by us may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies, including those within our peer group and industry.  DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The table below sets forth the 2018 compensation earned by or paid to our non-management directors. Ms. Osteen and Mr. Jacobs do not receive any additional compensation for their services as directors. Mr. Jacobs' term as a member of the Board will expire at the Annual Meeting.

The value of the restricted shares shall be based on the closing trading price of our Common Stock on the trading day immediately preceding the Annual Meeting Date. All restricted shares issued to non-management directors shall vest over three years with such shares to vest 331⁄3% per year on the three successive anniversary dates of the grant of restricted stock beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. 
Each of our directors is a party to an Indemnification Agreement with the Company pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify and advance expenses to such director in connection with his or her service as our director, officer or agent to the fullest extent permitted by law and as set forth in each such agreement and, to the extent applicable, to maintain insurance coverage for each such director under our policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
Our management has primary responsibility for preparing our financial statements and implementing internal controls over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
The role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee are set forth in a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors. The charter is available on our website, www.acadiahealthcare.com, under the webpage "Investors – Corporate Governance." The Audit Committee reviews and reassesses the adequacy of the charter annually or more often as necessary and recommends any proposed changes to the Board. The Audit Committee acted in accordance with its charter in 2018. In fulfilling its responsibilities for fiscal year 2018, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pre-approved all auditing and  non-auditing services of Ernst & Young LLP;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed with management our unaudited quarterly financial statements during 2018 and our audited  financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of critical accounting policies used in such financial statements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed with the internal auditor the quality and appropriateness of our internal controls and  reporting procedures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards  No. 1301, as amended, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T, both with and without management present; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP as required by the applicable  requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding Ernst & Young LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP their independence from us and  management.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements and discussions with management and Ernst & Young LLP as described above, and in reliance thereon, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Registration Rights Agreement 
Effective December 31, 2015, concurrently with the execution of the sale and purchase deed related to our acquisition of Priory Group No. 1 Limited, we entered into a third amended and restated registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), with certain members of our current and former management (the "Management Investors"), WCP, investment funds affiliated with Bain Capital Partners, LLC (collectively, "Bain Capital") and investment funds affiliated with Advent International Corporation ("Advent"). The Registration Rights Agreement grants certain stockholders "demand" registration rights for registered offerings and "piggyback" registration rights with respect to our securities. Such rights expired for Bain Capital and Advent in connection with their prior sales of Acadia stock. All expenses incident to registrations are required to be borne by us. 
Stockholders Agreement 
Concurrently with the execution of the merger agreement related to our acquisition of CRC Health Group, Inc. ("CRC"), we entered into an amended and restated stockholders agreement (the "Stockholders Agreement") with the Management Investors, WCP and Bain Capital. The Stockholders Agreement became effective on February 11, 2015 in connection with the closing of our acquisition of CRC. 
The Stockholders Agreement granted WCP certain rights to designate a nominee for election to our board of directors which WCP exercised to designate Mr. Waud for election at the annual meeting of stockholders held in 2016 and certain consent rights over the transfer of shares by Management Investors that have expired. 
The Stockholders Agreement provides that no Management Investor will take any of the following actions from the date the Company gives notice to the Management Investors that a preliminary or final prospectus has been circulated for a public offering and during the 60 days following the date of the final prospectus for such public offering: (i) offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the Company's or its subsidiaries' equity securities or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities; (ii) enter into any transaction which would have the same effect as described in clause (i); (iii) enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or part, any of the economic consequences or ownership of any of the securities described in clause (i); or (iv) publicly disclose the intention to enter into any transaction described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). The foregoing restrictions do not apply to transactions made in the subject public offering and those to which the underwriters managing such public offering agree in writing. As used in this "– Stockholders Agreement" section, "public offering" refers to any offering by the Company of the Company's or its subsidiaries' capital stock or other equity securities to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or any comparable statement under any similar federal statute then in force.  GENERAL INFORMATION 
Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, proper stockholder proposals intended to be presented at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received by us at our principal executive offices at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067 no later than November 22, 2019 for the proposals to be included in the Proxy Statement and form of proxy card for that meeting. 
If a stockholder desires to bring a matter before our annual meeting of stockholders and the matter is submitted outside the process of Rule 14a-8, including with respect to nominations for election as directors, the stockholder must follow the procedures set forth in our Bylaws. Our Bylaws provide generally that stockholder proposals and director nominations to be considered at an annual meeting of stockholders may be made by a stockholder only if (1) the stockholder is a stockholder of record and is entitled to vote at the meeting, and (2) the stockholder gives timely written notice of the matter to our corporate secretary. To be timely, a stockholder's notice must be received at our principal executive offices no later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that our annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after the date of first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders, notice by the stockholder must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made by the Company. Under our Bylaws, notice with respect to the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received at our principal executive offices between the close of business on January 3, 2020 and the close of business on February 2, 2020, unless the 2020 annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 70 days after May 2, 2020. The notice must set forth the information required by the provisions of our Bylaws dealing with stockholder proposals and nominations of directors. 
Annual Report on Form 10-K 
As indicated in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, a copy of this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders has been posted on the website www.proxyvote.com. Upon the written request of any stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, we will furnish, without charge, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC. Requests should be directed to Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, Attention: Christopher L. Howard, Esq., Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, (615) 851-6000. Our Annual Report to Stockholders and Annual Report on Form 10-K are not proxy soliciting materials. 
Delivery of Documents to Stockholders Sharing an Address 
Householding is a program adopted by the SEC that permits companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for annual reports, proxy statements and the Notices of Internet Availability of proxy materials sent to multiple stockholders of record who have the same address by delivering a single annual report, proxy statement or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to that address. Householding is designed to reduce a company's printing costs and postage fees. Brokers with account holders who are stockholders of the Company may be householding the Company's proxy materials. If your household participates in the householding program, you will receive one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you are a beneficial holder, you can request information about householding from your broker, bank or other nominee.If at any time you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate proxy statement, annual report or Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, please notify your broker if your shares are held in a brokerage account or us if you are a stockholder of record. You can notify us by sending a written request to our General Counsel and Secretary at 6100 Tower Circle, Suite 1000, Franklin, Tennessee 37067, or by calling (615) 861-6000. In addition, we will promptly deliver, upon written or oral request to the address or telephone number above, a separate copy of the annual report, proxy statement and Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to a stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of the documents was delivered.  If you receive more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, this means that you have multiple accounts holding Common Stock with brokers and/or the Company's transfer agent. Please vote all of your shares by following the instructions included on each Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Additionally, to avoid receiving multiple sets of proxy materials in the future, the Company recommends that you contact Broadridge Financial Services, Inc. at www.proxyvote.com or (800) 579-1639 to consolidate as many accounts as possible under the same name and address. If you are a beneficial holder, please call your broker for instructions. 
Electronic Access to Proxy Statement and Annual Report to Stockholders 
We have elected to provide this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders over the Internet through a "notice and access" model. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials provides instructions on how you may access this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders on the Internet at www.proxyvote.com or request a printed copy at no charge. In addition, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials provides instructions on how you may request to receive, at no charge, all future proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email. Your election to receive proxy materials by mail or email will remain in effect until you revoke it. Choosing to receive future proxy materials by email will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to stockholders and will reduce the impact of our annual meetings on the environment.
