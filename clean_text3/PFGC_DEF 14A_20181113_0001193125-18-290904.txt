PROXY STATEMENT

General Information 
Why am I being provided with these materials? 
The Board of Directors (the "Board" or "Board of Directors") of Performance Food Group Company has delivered these proxy materials to you in connection with its solicitation of proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on November 13, 2018 (the "Annual Meeting"), and at any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. Except where the context requires otherwise, references to "the Company," "we," "us" and "our" refer to Performance Food Group Company. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 (our "Annual Report"). 
What am I voting on? 
There are four proposals scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal No. 1: Election of the four Class III director nominees listed in this Proxy Statement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    1 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The holders of record of a majority of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting must be present in person or represented by proxy to constitute a quorum for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" are counted as present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
What is a "broker non-vote"? 
A broker non-vote occurs when shares held through a broker are not voted with respect to a proposal because (1) the broker has not received voting instructions from the stockholder who beneficially owns the shares and (2) the broker lacks the authority to vote the shares at its discretion. Under current New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") interpretations that govern broker non-votes, Proposal Nos. 1, 3 and 4 are considered non-routine matters, and a broker will lack the authority to vote uninstructed shares at their discretion on such proposals. Proposal No. 2 (Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) is considered a routine matter, and a broker will be permitted to exercise its discretion to vote uninstructed shares on this proposal. 
How many votes are required to approve each proposal? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Proposal No. 1 (Election of Directors):     Under our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws"), directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast, which means that the number of  votes "FOR" a nominee must exceed the number of votes "AGAINST" that nominee. Any director who receives a greater number of votes "AGAINST" his or her election than votes "FOR" such election is required to  tender his or her resignation to our Board in accordance with our Board policy. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the offer and recommend to the Board whether to accept the offer. The full Board will consider all  factors it deems relevant to our best interests, make a determination and publicly disclose its decision and rationale within 90 days after confirmation of the election results.   Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as  votes cast for purposes of Proposal No. 1; therefore, they will have no effect on this proposal.

   Proposal No. 2 (Ratification of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm)       The selection of the independent registered public accounting firm will be  ratified if the votes cast "FOR" exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" this proposal.   Abstentions will not be counted as votes cast for purposes of Proposal No. 2; therefore, they will have no effect on this proposal.   Stockholder ratification of the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent  registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws or otherwise. However, the Board is submitting the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance and because  we value our stockholders' views on the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. If our stockholders fail to ratify the selection, it will be considered as notice to the Board and the Audit Committee to consider the  selection of a different firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be  in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders.

   Proposal No. 3 (Non-Binding Vote to Approve  Executive Compensation)       The advisory, non-binding vote  regarding the compensation of our named executive officers will be approved if the votes cast "FOR" exceed the votes cast "AGAINST" this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not  be counted as votes cast for purposes of Proposal No. 3; therefore, they will have no effect on this proposal.

The Board of Directors and Certain Governance Matters 
Our Board of Directors manages or directs our business and affairs, as provided by Delaware law, and conducts its business through meetings of the Board of Directors and four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Technology Committee. 
We have structured our corporate governance in a manner we believe closely aligns our interests with those of our stockholders. Notable features of our corporate governance include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have fully independent Audit, Compensation, Nominating and Corporate Governance and Technology Committees, and our  independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions without the presence of our corporate officers or non-independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Three of the four members of our Audit Committee qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by  the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have implemented a range of other corporate governance best practices, including the following:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In August 2018, the Board amended and restated the Bylaws to adopt a majority voting standard for the election of directors  in uncontested elections. Additionally, the Board adopted a policy that any director who receives a greater number of votes "AGAINST" his or her election than votes "FOR" his or her election is required to offer his or her  resignation from the Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Also in August 2018, the Board amended and restated the Bylaws to adopt proxy access. Commencing at the Company's 2019  annual meeting of stockholders, our Bylaws now permit a stockholder (or group of stockholders (up to 20)) who has owned a significant amount of our common stock (at least 3% of our outstanding shares) for a significant amount of time (at least three  years) to submit director nominees (the greater of two or up to 20% of the Board) for inclusion in our proxy statement if the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our Bylaws.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Corporate Governance Guidelines place limits on the number of public company directorships held by our directors to  prevent "overboarding."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership requirements for directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board separates the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Policies prohibiting hedging our shares.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors evaluates the Company's corporate governance policies and practices on an ongoing basis with a view toward maintaining appropriate corporate governance practices in the context of the Company's current business environment. Additionally, the Board seeks to align our governance practices closely with the interests of our stockholders. This commitment is demonstrated through the Board's recent changes to the Bylaws discussed above, along with the Board's submission of Proposal No. 4 (concerning the declassification of the Board) for stockholder vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Our Board of Directors and management value the perspectives of our stockholders and encourage stockholders to communicate with the Board of Directors as described below under "—Communications with the Board." 
Director Independence and Independence Determinations 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines and NYSE rules, a director is not independent unless our Board of Directors affirmatively determines that he or she does not have a direct or indirect material relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines define independence in accordance with the independence definition in the current NYSE corporate governance rules for listed companies. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require our Board of Directors to review the independence of all directors at least annually. 
In the event a director has a relationship with the Company that is relevant to his or her independence and is not addressed by the objective tests set forth in the NYSE independence definition, our Board of Directors will determine, considering all relevant facts and circumstances, whether such relationship is material. 
12    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement 
Our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Fernandez, Spratt, Winkleblack, Zillmer, Overly and Steenland and Mses. Adler and Grant is independent under the guidelines for director independence set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and under all applicable NYSE guidelines, including with respect to committee membership. Our Board also has determined that each of Messrs. Spratt and Winkleblack and Mses. Adler and Grant is "independent" for purposes of Section 10A(m)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and that each of Messrs. Fernandez, Overly, Steenland and Zillmer is "independent" for purposes of Section 10C(a)(3) of the Exchange Act. Mr. Holm serves on our Board of Directors but, as our President and Chief Executive Officer, he cannot be deemed independent. In making the director independence determinations, the Board considered the fact that Mr. Overly was formerly affiliated with Blackstone, which received payments from the Company during fiscal 2017, and the fact that Ms. Adler was formerly employed by Barclays Capital, which received underwriting discounts in our initial public offering and secondary offerings and is a lender under our credit facility. Payments received by Blackstone and Barclays, respectively, pursuant to the foregoing transactions did not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of Blackstone's or Barclays Capital's, as applicable, consolidated gross revenues in any of the last three fiscal years.. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee weighs the characteristics, experience, independence and skills of potential candidates for election to the Board and recommends nominees for director to the Board for election. In considering candidates for the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also assesses the size, composition and combined expertise of the Board. As the application of these factors involves the exercise of judgment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not have a standard set of fixed qualifications that is applicable to all director candidates, although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does at a minimum assess each candidate's strength of character, judgment, industry knowledge or experience, independence of thought and his or her ability to work collegially with the other members of the Board. In addition, although the Board considers diversity in the broadest meaning of the word, the Board does not have a formal diversity policy. In identifying prospective director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek referrals from other members of the Board, management, stockholders and other sources, including third party recommendations. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may, but need not, retain a search firm in order to assist it in identifying candidates to serve as directors of the Company. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee utilizes the same criteria for evaluating candidates regardless of the source of the referral. When considering director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks individuals with backgrounds and qualities that, when combined with those of our incumbent directors, provide a blend of skills and experience to further enhance the Board's effectiveness. 
In connection with its annual recommendation of a slate of nominees, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may assess the contributions of those directors recommended for re-election in the context of the Board evaluation process and other perceived needs of the Board. 
In addition to the process described above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee had previously nominated a number of individuals designated by Blackstone and Wellspring as required under the provisions of the stockholders' agreement described under "Transactions With Related Persons—Stockholders' Agreement." Mr. Dawson was originally recommended in 2002 by Wellspring as a director nominee pursuant to the stockholders' agreement, and Mr. Overly was recommended in 2013 by Blackstone as a director nominee pursuant to the stockholders' agreement. Blackstone and Wellspring no longer have the right to designate any director nominees. Upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board nominated Mr. Dawson for reelection as a Class III Director at the Annual Meeting, and Mr. Overly remains a Class II Director. 
When considering whether the nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, taken as a whole, to enable the Board to satisfy its oversight responsibilities effectively in light of our business and structure, the Board focused primarily on each nominee's current performance as a director and on the information discussed in each board member's biographical information set forth above. We believe that our directors provide an appropriate mix of experience and skills relevant to the size and nature of our business. In particular, the members of our Board of Directors considered the following important characteristics, among others: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Dawson—his significant financial, investment, and operational experience from his involvement in  Wellspring's investments in numerous portfolio companies, as well as his thirteen years of experience as a director of the Company and its predecessor.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Winkleblack—his substantial executive experience across a broad range of industries. In addition, his nearly  twelve years of experience as the Chief Financial Officer of a large, publicly-traded consumer goods company enables him to bring important perspectives to our Board of Directors on performance management, business analytics, compliance, risk  management, public reporting, and investor relations.  
[END TABLE]

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. Any recommendation submitted to the Secretary of the Company should be in writing and should include any supporting material the stockholder considers appropriate in support of that recommendation, but must include information that would be required under the rules of the SEC to be included in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such candidate and a written consent of the candidate to serve as one of our directors if elected. Stockholders wishing to propose a candidate for consideration may do so by submitting the above information to the attention of the Secretary, Performance Food Group Company, 12500 West Creek Parkway, Richmond, Virginia 23238. All recommendations for nomination received by the Secretary that satisfy our Bylaw requirements relating to director nominations will be presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for its consideration. Stockholders also must satisfy the notification, timeliness, consent and information requirements set forth in our Bylaws. These requirements are also described under "Stockholder Proposals for the 2019 Annual Meeting." 
Board Structure 
Our Board of Directors is led by Mr. Steenland, our Chairman. The Chief Executive Officer position is separate from the Chairman position. We believe that the separation of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions is appropriate corporate governance for us at this time. Accordingly, Mr. Steenland serves as Chairman, while Mr. Holm serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President. 
Executive Sessions 
Executive sessions, which are meetings of the non-management members of the Board, are regularly scheduled throughout the year. In addition, at least once a year, the independent directors will meet in a private session that excludes management and any non-independent directors. Our Chairman, Mr. Steenland, presides at the executive sessions.

The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for auditing our financial statements and expressing an opinion as to their conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company with management and with the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the applicable auditing standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm their independence.

Leadership Changes 
Effective March 1, 2018, the Board of Directors appointed James D. Hope to serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Hope replaced Thomas G. Ondrof, who notified us on December 14, 2017 of his intent to retire from his position as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Mr. Ondrof's retirement was effective March 1, 2018. Following his retirement from the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, Mr. Ondrof was appointed to serve as Strategic Growth Leader of the Company. 
Effective September 21, 2018, Mr. Flitman resigned as our Executive Vice President and President and Chief Executive Officer of Performance Foodservice. Mr. Flitman accepted a position as Chief Executive Officer of BMC Stock Holdings, Inc., a leading construction and building supply provider. 
Executive Compensation Program Objectives and Overview 
Our current executive compensation program is intended to achieve two fundamental objectives: (1) attract, motivate, and retain high caliber talent; and (2) align executive compensation with achievement of our overall business goals, adherence to our core values, and stockholder interests. In structuring our current executive compensation program, we are guided by the following basic philosophies: 
Competitive Compensation. Our executive compensation program should provide a fair and competitive compensation opportunity that enables us to attract and retain high caliber executive talent. Executives should be appropriately rewarded for their contributions to our successful performance. 
Pay for Performance. A significant portion of each executive's compensation should be "at risk" and tied to overall Company, business unit, and individual performance. 
Alignment with Stockholder Interests. Executive compensation should be structured to include elements that link executives' financial rewards to stockholder return. 
As described in more detail below, the material elements of our executive compensation program for NEOs include base salary, cash bonus opportunities, a long-term equity incentive opportunity, and broad-based employee benefits. The NEOs may also receive severance payments and other benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment or a change in control of the Company. We believe that each element of our executive 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    25 
 compensation program helps us to achieve one or more of our compensation objectives, as illustrated by the table below.

[END TABLE]
Say on Pay and Say on Frequency Votes. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the outcome of the stockholder advisory vote on fiscal 2017 executive compensation when making decisions relating to the compensation of our NEOs and our executive compensation program and policies. Our stockholders voted at our 2017 annual meeting, in a non-binding, advisory vote, on the fiscal 2017 compensation paid to our NEOs. Approximately 97% of the votes were cast in favor of the Company's fiscal 2017 NEO compensation decisions. Based on this level of support, the Compensation Committee decided that the say on pay vote result did not necessitate any substantive changes to our compensation program. 
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, stockholders can vote on the frequency of say on pay voting once every six years. We expect this vote to next occur at our 2022 annual meeting. Until that time, we expect to hold an advisory, non-binding say on pay vote on an annual basis. 
Compensation Determination Process 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for establishing, maintaining, and administering our compensation and benefit policies and determines the compensation for our CEO and NEOs. The NEOs do not have any role in determining or recommending the form or amount of compensation paid to our NEOs. Our President and Chief Executive Officer is not a member of the Compensation Committee and does not participate in deliberations regarding his compensation. 
In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Frederic W. Cook & Co., Inc. ("FW Cook"), an independent compensation consulting firm, to advise on executive and non-employee director compensation. FW Cook evaluated the competitiveness of our executive and director compensation programs using peer group compensation data of the following peer group companies: Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc., Aramark, The Chefs' Warehouse, Inc., Compass Group PLC, Dean Foods Company, W.W. Grainger, Inc., MRC Global Inc., Pilgrim's Pride Corporation, Snyder's-Lance, Inc., SpartanNash Company, SUPERVALU Inc., Sysco Corporation, United Natural Foods, Inc., US Foods Holding Corp. and WESCO International, Inc. This peer group is composed of companies of appropriate size and similar stature in our industry. FW Cook compared total target direct compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and Chief Information Officer against executives holding the same title and position amongst the peer group companies. Our executive officers without an exact functional position match were compared against peer group executives based upon relative pay rank. 
26    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement 
Based on this evaluation, FW Cook recommended, and the Compensation Committee determined, to set total target direct compensation (comprised of base salary, cash bonus opportunity at target and long-term equity incentive opportunity at target) at levels that approximate the median of the peer group. As a result, the Compensation Committee determined not to change target bonus levels for any of our executive officers and not to increase the base salaries for Messrs. Holm, Hope, Ondrof, and Flitman. FW Cook recommended and the Compensation Committee approved a base salary increase for Mr. Hagerty to $450,000 and a base salary increase for Ms. O'Connell to $425,000 for fiscal 2018 as described below under "—Executive Compensation Program Elements—Base Salaries." FW Cook recommended, and the Compensation Committee approved, target long-term equity incentive award guidelines based on a percentage of base salary for each of the NEOs as described under "—Executive Compensation Program Elements—Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards." 
FW Cook reports directly to the Chair of the Compensation Committee and performs no other work for the Company. FW Cook generally attends all meetings where the Compensation Committee evaluates the overall effectiveness of the executive compensation programs or where the Compensation Committee analyzes or approves executive compensation. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance and independence of FW Cook on an annual basis, at which time it makes a determination as to the renewal of FW Cook's annual engagement. Each year, the Compensation Committee considers all appropriate information relating to the independence of FW Cook and its professionals involved in the work performed for, and advice provided to, the Compensation Committee. In fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee determined that: (i) the relationships and work of FW Cook and its professionals did not present any conflict of interest; and (ii) FW Cook and its professionals are independent for the purpose of providing advice to the Compensation Committee with respect to matters relating to the compensation of the executives and non-employee directors of the Company. 
Employment Agreements 
We do not typically enter into formal employment agreements with our executive officers. However, we have an employment agreement with Mr. Holm. In addition, we typically enter into offer letters with our executive officers. In connection with the commencement of their employment in 2015, 1994, 2014 and 2011, respectively, we entered into offer letters with Messrs. Flitman, Hagerty and Hope and Ms. O'Connell, setting forth their initial compensation and benefits. We entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Ondrof in connection with his retirement from the position of Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company in 2017. A full description of the material terms of Mr. Holm's employment agreement, Mr. Ondrof's letter agreement and Mr. Flitman's offer letter are presented below in "—Narrative to Summary Compensation Table and Fiscal 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards." 
Executive Compensation Program Elements 
Base Salaries 
Base salaries are an important element of compensation because they provide the NEOs with a base level of income, which ensures a level of financial security. Generally our NEOs are eligible for an adjustment to their base salaries each year at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. Adjustments may occur earlier or later depending on performance and market competitiveness. During fiscal 2018, as a result of the evaluation described under "—Compensation Determination Process" above, the Compensation Committee determined (1) not to increase the base salaries for Messrs. Flitman and Holm, which were as follows: Mr. Flitman ($700,000) and Mr. Holm ($1,000,000), (2) to increase the base salary for Mr. Hagerty to $450,000 and (3) to increase the base salary for Ms. O'Connell to $425,000. In connection with Mr. Hope's appointment as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Hope's annual base salary was increased from $500,000 to $600,000 effective March 1, 2018. In addition, as a result of his resignation as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and appointment as our Strategic Growth Leader, Mr. Ondrof's annual base salary changed from $625,000 to $160,000 effective March 1, 2018. 
Cash Bonus Opportunities 
Annual Cash Bonus Opportunity. We maintain an annual incentive plan (the "AIP"). All of our NEOs are eligible to participate in the AIP. The primary purpose of the AIP is to focus management on key measures that drive financial performance and provide competitive bonus opportunities tied to the achievement of our financial and strategic growth objectives. 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    27 
Fiscal 2018 AIP 
A target annual bonus, expressed as a percentage of base salary, is established within certain NEOs' employment agreements, offer letters or letter agreements and may be adjusted from time to time by the Compensation Committee in connection with an NEO's promotion, performance or based upon competitive conditions. For our NEOs at the corporate level, including Messrs. Holm, Hope and Ondrof and Ms. O'Connell, the AIP award, which is a cash bonus, is tied to our overall financial results as measured by our Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, further adjusted to include a capital charge for acquisitions completed during the fiscal year. For our NEOs at the segment level, including Messrs. Flitman and Hagerty, the AIP award is tied to our overall financial results as measured by our Adjusted EBITDA, to Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable segment (excluding certain adjustments), and to the safety performance of the applicable segment, as measured by accidents per million miles and recordable case rate. We believe that tying part or all of the NEOs' bonuses to Company-wide performance goals encourages collaboration across the executive leadership team, while tying part of the bonus of our NEOs at the segment level to Adjusted EBITDA and safety performance for their respective segments also rewards these NEOs for achievements with respect to their respective business units. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance because we believe that it provides a reliable indicator of our strategic growth and the strength of our cash flow and overall financial results. We use accidents per million miles and recordable case rate as measures of safety for each segment because we believe these metrics are reliable indicators of safety performance. 
Actual amounts paid to our NEOs at the corporate level under the fiscal 2018 AIP were calculated by multiplying each such NEO's target annual bonus for 2018 (which is 100% of base salary in effect at fiscal year-end) by a payout percentage based on our actual achievement relative to our overall Adjusted EBITDA performance objective. Pursuant to their respective transitions into new roles with the Company effective March 1, 2018, actual amounts paid to Messrs. Hope and Ondrof under the fiscal 2018 AIP were prorated to reflect their respective annual base salaries prior to March 1, 2018 and their respective revised annual base salaries on and following March 1, 2018. 
The payout percentage was determined by calculating our actual achievement against the overall Adjusted EBITDA performance target based on the pre-established scale set forth in the following table: 
PERFORMANCE FOOD GROUP—ALL SEGMENTS 
[BEGIN TABLE]%  Attainment of Performance Target         Payout Percentage%  Attainment of Performance Target         Payout Percentage%  Attainment of Performance Target         Payout Percentage

   Less than 95.0%         0.0%   
   Less than 95.0%         0.0%

   100%         100.0%   
   102.3% or  above         133.0%   
   102.3% or  above         133.0%   
   102.3% or  above         133.0%   
[END TABLE]
Based on the pre-established scale set forth above, no cash incentive award would have been paid to our NEOs at the corporate level unless our actual performance for fiscal 2018 was at or above 95.0% of our overall Adjusted EBITDA target. If our actual performance was 95.0% of target, they would have been entitled to 25% of their respective target bonus amounts. If our actual performance was 102.3% or more of target, they would have been entitled to 133.0% of their respective target bonus amounts. For performance percentages between these levels, the resulting payout percentage would be adjusted on a linear basis. For example, if our actual performance was between 95.0% and 100% of target Adjusted EBITDA, a $1 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 3.4% increase in the payout percentage. If actual performance was between 100% and 102.3% of target Adjusted EBITDA, a $1 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 3.3% increase in the payout percentage. In addition, an incentive payment may be adjusted downward for documented performance-related reasons. The overall Adjusted EBITDA performance target for fiscal 2018 was $438.8 million. 
28    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement 
For fiscal 2018, the actual overall Adjusted EBITDA resulted in a payout percentage of 42% of the target bonus amounts of our NEOs at the corporate level under the fiscal 2018 AIP. The following table illustrates the calculation of the annual cash bonus payable to each of Messrs. Holm, Hope and Ondrof and Ms. O'Connell under the fiscal 2018 AIP in light of these performance results.

Actual amounts paid to Messrs. Flitman and Hagerty under the fiscal 2018 AIP were calculated by multiplying the target annual bonus for 2018 (which was 100% of base salary in effect at fiscal year-end) by a weighted achievement factor determined by the sum of (1) the applicable segment Adjusted EBITDA achievement factor (70% multiplied by the Performance Foodservice or Vistar segment Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage, as applicable), (2) the overall Adjusted EBITDA achievement factor (20% multiplied by the overall Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage) and (3) the applicable safety performance achievement factor (10% multiplied by the Performance Foodservice or Vistar safety measure payout percentage, as applicable). 
The overall Adjusted EBITDA achievement factor was determined by calculating our actual achievement against the overall Adjusted EBITDA performance target based on the pre-established scale set forth in the table above. The Adjusted EBITDA achievement factor for the Performance Foodservice segment, was determined by the Performance Foodservice segment's achievement against the Performance Foodservice Adjusted EBITDA performance target based on the pre-established scale set forth in the following table:

The safety performance achievement factor for each of the Performance Foodservice segment and the Vistar segment is based 50% on the accidents per million mile target ("AMM") (defined as improvement of 10% or more over the prior year) and 50% on the recordable case rate target ("RCR") (defined as improvement of 10% or more over the prior year). Each of the two safety performance metrics (AMM and RCR) is independent of the other. 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    29 
 Messrs. Flitman and Hagerty would either receive the full payout with respect to the applicable safety metric if target performance was achieved, or no payment with respect to the applicable safety metric if target performance was not achieved. 
Based on the pre-established scales set forth above, no cash incentive award would have been paid to our NEOs at the segment level unless, (1) in the case of Mr. Flitman, our actual performance for fiscal 2018 was at or above 95.0% of our overall Adjusted EBITDA target, actual performance by our Performance Foodservice segment was at or above 94.6% of the target Adjusted EBITDA for our Performance Foodservice segment, the AMM target at the Performance Foodservice segment was met or the RCR target at the Performance Foodservice segment was met and (2) in the case of Mr. Hagerty, our actual performance for fiscal 2018 was at or above 95.0% of our overall Adjusted EBITDA target, actual performance by our Vistar segment was at or above 92.0% of the target Adjusted EBITDA for our Vistar segment, the AMM target at the Vistar segment was met or the RCR target at the Vistar segment was met. For performance percentages between the levels set forth above, the resulting payout percentage would be adjusted on a linear basis. Under the payout scale for our Performance Foodservice segment, an increase of $265,256 of the segment's target Adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 1% increase in the payout percentage. Under the payout scale for our Vistar segment, an increase of $142,835 of the segment's target Adjusted EBITDA would have resulted in a 1% increase in the payout percentage. An incentive payment may be adjusted downward for documented performance-related reasons. For fiscal 2018, the Adjusted EBITDA performance target for our Performance Foodservice was $369.7 million, and the Adjusted EBITDA performance target for our Vistar segment was $133.9 million. 
In addition, Mr. Flitman's payout percentage with respect to the Performance Foodservice segment Adjusted EBITDA performance would have been increased as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• one percentage point increase for each percentage point increase above a minimum threshold percentage growth rate of our  sales to independent customers by volume and our sales of Performance Brands by volume; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• two percentage points increase for each percentage point increase when sales to independent customers by volume and sales  of Performance Brands by volume exceeded the minimum threshold percentage growth rates by more than 10%.  
[END TABLE]
We set the performance thresholds for growth rates of our sales to independent customers by volume and sales of Performance Brands by volume at what we believe are challenging levels. In the four most recent fiscal years, the only four fiscal years in which this potential payout threshold increase was made available, the Performance Foodservice segment has met the minimum threshold levels but has not exceeded them by 10%. Since Mr. Flitman's annual cash bonus could have been increased for each percentage point increase above the minimum threshold percentage growth rates of (1) our sales to independent customers by volume and (2) sales of Performance Brands by volume, his potential annual cash bonus is uncapped. 
For fiscal 2018, the actual Adjusted EBITDA achieved for our Performance Foodservice segment resulted in an achievement factor of 0%. The Performance Foodservice segment did not achieve the AMM target and did not achieve the RCR target, resulting in a Performance Foodservice safety performance payout percentage of 0% and a weighted achievement factor of 8.4% when combined with the overall Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage of 42% and the Performance Foodservice Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage of 0%. 
For fiscal 2018, the actual Adjusted EBITDA achieved for our Vistar segment resulted in an achievement factor of 95%. The Vistar segment achieved the AMM target and achieved the RCR target, resulting in a Vistar segment safety performance payout percentage of 100% and a weighted achievement factor of 84.9% when combined with the overall Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage of 42% and the Vistar Adjusted EBITDA payout percentage of 95%. 
The following table illustrates the calculation of the annual cash incentive awards payable to Messrs. Flitman and Hagerty under the fiscal 2018 AIP in light of these performance results.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, in February 2015, Mr. Flitman received a restricted cash award of $1,500,000 in consideration for amounts he would have otherwise been entitled to receive from his former employer. This restricted cash award vested in three equal installments on the first three anniversaries of his commencement of employment, and is payable on January 19, 2019, the fourth anniversary of Mr. Flitman's commencement of employment. Additional information regarding this restricted cash award is described under "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" below. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
We believe that the NEOs' long-term compensation should be directly linked to the value we deliver to our stockholders. Equity awards to the NEOs are designed to provide long-term incentive opportunities over a period of several years. 
Since our initial public offering in October 2015 (the "IPO"), we have made annual grants under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan that provide a mix of performance shares, time-based stock options and time-based restricted stock. This long-term equity incentive program is informed by the peer group and broader public company practice and is consistent with our compensation objective of providing a long-term equity incentive opportunity that aligns compensation with the creation of stockholder value and achievement of business goals. In addition, based on a review of peer group data, the Compensation Committee has approved target long-term equity incentive award guidelines based on a percentage of base salary for each of the NEOs as follows: Mr. Holm, 370% of base salary; Messrs. Hope, Ondrof and Flitman, 160% of base salary; and Mr. Hagerty and Ms. O'Connell, 130% of base salary. Actual long-term equity incentive-awards may differ from the target percentages based upon discretionary performance factors as determined by the Compensation Committee. 
2018 Long-Term Equity Incentive Grants 
On September 21, 2017, in connection with our annual compensation review, the Compensation Committee approved annual long-term equity incentive grants to our NEOs. We granted awards of performance shares, time-based stock options and shares of time-based restricted stock to each of Messrs. Holm, Hope, Ondrof, Flitman and Hagerty, and Ms. O'Connell under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
The following table sets forth the total grant value of these long-term equity incentive grants for each of Messrs. Holm, Hope, Ondrof, Flitman, and Hagerty and Ms. O'Connell, which were translated into a number of performance shares, stock options, and shares of restricted stock by taking such dollar amount and dividing it by the per share "fair value" that will be used for reporting the compensation expense associated with the grant under applicable accounting guidance, which "fair value" was based in part on the per share closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant.

Benefits and Perquisites 
We provide to all our employees, including our NEOs, broad-based benefits that are intended to attract and retain employees while providing them with retirement and health and welfare security. Broad-based employee benefits include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a 401(k) savings plan (the "401(k) plan");  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• medical, dental, vision, life, and accident insurance, disability coverage, dependent care and healthcare flexible spending  accounts; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• employee assistance program benefits.  
[END TABLE]
We maintain the 401(k) plan, a qualified contributory retirement plan, that is intended to qualify as a profit sharing plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Eligible employees, including our NEOs, may contribute up to 50% of their eligible compensation, subject to statutory limits imposed by the Code. We are also permitted to make profit sharing contributions and matching contributions, and currently provide for matching contributions equal to 100% of employee contributions up to 3.5% of eligible compensation. Our contributions to the plan are made subject to certain minimum requirements specified in the plan. All matching contributions by us become vested on the four-year anniversary of the participant's hire date. As of January 1, 2009, the 401(k) plan merged with the Self-Directed Tax Advantaged Retirement (STAR) Plan of PFGC, Inc. Employees employed on or before December 31, 2008 are also eligible for an annual contribution based on the employee's salary and years of service (a "STAR Contribution"). Mr. Holm and Mr. Hagerty are the only NEOs eligible to receive the additional STAR Contributions. 
In addition, at no cost to the employee, we provide an amount of basic life and accident insurance coverage valued at one times annual salary up to a maximum of $1 million combined benefit. 
We also provide our NEOs with limited perquisites and personal benefits that are not generally available to all employees, such as an annual auto allowance, eligibility to participate in our executive health programs, reimbursement of relocation expenses and temporary housing allowances. We provide these limited perquisites and personal benefits in order to further our goal of attracting and retaining our executive officers. The benefits and perquisites not generally available to all employees provided to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 are reflected in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table and the accompanying footnote in accordance with SEC rules. 
Severance and Other Benefits 
We believe that severance protections can play a valuable role in attracting and retaining high caliber talent. In the competitive market for executive talent, we believe severance payments and other termination benefits are an effective way to offer executives financial security to offset the risk of foregoing an opportunity with another company. Consistent with our objective of using severance payments and benefits to attract and retain executives, our Senior Management Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") provides our executives with severance benefits that we believe will permit us to attract and/or continue to employ high caliber talent. 
Each of our NEOs, other than Mr. Holm, Mr. Flitman and Mr. Ondrof, is eligible for the Severance Plan benefits under the terms of the Severance Plan, as modified by the severance letter agreements we have entered into with Messrs. Hope and Hagerty and Ms. O'Connell (the "Severance Letter Agreements"). Mr. Holm is eligible for 
32    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement severance benefits under the terms of his employment agreement. Mr. Ondrof is no longer eligible to participate in the Severance Plan under the terms of his letter agreement. Likewise, as a result of Mr. Flitman's resignation effective September 21, 2018, Mr. Flitman is not eligible to participate in the Severance Plan. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for descriptions of these arrangements. 
Hedging and Pledging Policies 
The Company's Insider Trading Policy requires directors and executive officers to consult the Company's General Counsel prior to engaging in transactions involving the Company's securities. The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits directors and executive officers from hedging or monetization transactions, including, but not limited to, through the use of financial instruments such as exchange funds, variable forward contracts, equity swaps, puts, calls, and other derivative instruments, or through the establishment of a short position in the Company's securities. The Company's Insider Trading Policy limits the pledging of Company securities to those limited situations approved by the Company's General Counsel. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Executive Officers 
To align the interests of our management with those of our stockholders, the Board of Directors concluded that certain of our executive officers (the "Covered Executives") should have a significant financial stake in the Company's stock. To further that goal, we have implemented stock ownership guidelines (the "Guidelines"). The Covered Executives are required to hold a specific level of equity ownership as outlined below: 
Executives. The Guidelines will apply to the Covered Executives in the following Tiers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Tier One    Chief Executive Officer 
 Tier Two    Chief Financial Officer 
 Tier Three    All other Senior Executives (direct reports of the Chief Executive Officer) 
[END TABLE]
Covered Executives' Stock Ownership Multiples. The stock ownership levels under the Guidelines, expressed as a multiple of the Covered Executive's base annual salary rate as of January 1st of the year, are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Tier One    6 times base annual salary rate 
 Tier Two    3 times base annual salary rate 
 Tier Three    1 times base annual salary rate 
[END TABLE]
Retention Requirement. There is no required time period within which a Covered Executive must attain the applicable stock ownership level under the Guidelines. However, until the applicable ownership level is achieved, the following retention requirements will apply. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Tier One    100% of shares 
 Tier Two    50% of shares 
 Tier Three    50% of shares 
[END TABLE]
The shares counted toward these ownership requirements include shares of common stock owned directly by the Covered Executive and outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
These ownership requirements are set at levels that the Company believes are reasonable given the Covered Executive's respective salaries and responsibility levels. In addition, FW Cook has reviewed our Guidelines and confirmed that they are consistent with the corresponding practices of our peer group. 
As of September 24, 2018, each of the Named Executive Officers has met the applicable ownership level. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code 
Section 162(m) of the Code generally prohibits public companies from taking a tax deduction for compensation paid in excess of $1,000,000 to certain executive officers. Prior to its amendment as implemented by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "Tax Act"), Section 162(m) of the Code provided an exception from the compensation deduction limitations for compensation that was considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under the applicable regulations. The regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code provide that a company that becomes 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    33 
 public in connection with an initial public offering is exempt from applying the compensation deduction limitations for a specified period of time following its initial public offering (the "IPO Transition Period"). The Tax Act's amendment of Section 162(m) of the Code, among other things, eliminated the exception to the compensation deduction limitations for "qualified performance-based compensation," other than in limited circumstances. The IPO Transition Period was not impacted by the Tax Act's amendments to Section 162(m) of the Code. This IPO Transition Period may extend until the first annual stockholders meeting that occurs after the end of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which our IPO occurred, unless the transition period is terminated earlier under the Section 162(m) of the Code post-offering transition rules. 
While the 2007 Management Option Plan and the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan currently include certain provisions that had been intended to allow the Compensation Committee, following the expiration of the IPO Transition Period, to grant awards that could be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code, the Tax Act's amendments to Section 162(m) of the Code have made these provisions inapplicable for such purposes. Accordingly, following the expiration of the IPO Transition Period, any performance equity awards granted to employees covered by Section 162(m) of the Code, as amended, will be subject to the compensation deduction limitations set forth in Section 162(m) of the Code. 
Although the Compensation Committee considers tax deductibility in making compensation program decisions, the Compensation Committee's primary consideration is whether the compensation program aligns the interests of our executives with those of the Company and our stockholders.

      With respect to the performance shares in the Fiscal 2018 Grants, 50% vest according to ROIC (as defined below) and 50%  vest according to Relative TSR (as defined below). The grant date fair value of the shares that vest according to ROIC was computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718 based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions as of the grant  date. Assuming the highest level of performance is achieved, the aggregate grant date fair value of the ROIC awards would be: Mr. Holm—$963,490; Mr. Hope $208,310; Mr. Ondrof—$260,410; Mr. Flitman—$291,643;  Mr. Hagerty—$152,323; and Ms. O'Connell—$143,856.

38    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement provided that he was to serve as Chief Executive Officer of Performance Foodservice on an at-will basis. Mr. Flitman's offer letter provided for: (1) an initial base salary of $700,000; (2) eligibility to receive an annual cash bonus starting in fiscal 2017, with a target amount equal to 100% of his base salary, and a maximum equal to 133% of his base salary, the receipt of which was based on the achievement of performance targets; (3) a sign-on bonus of $600,000, which Mr. Flitman would have had to repay in full if his employment was terminated by the Company for cause, voluntarily by Mr. Flitman other than for good reason or due to disability, prior to the first anniversary of his start date; (4) a "Buyout Award" consisting of the restricted cash award described above under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Cash Bonus Opportunities—Sign-on Bonuses" and the Buyout RSUs described below; and (5) the Equity Award described below.

In connection with his commencement of employment, and pursuant to the terms of his offer letter, Mr. Flitman was entitled to receive two equity awards, one buyout award in an amount of 89,483 restricted stock units ("RSUs") (plus any dividend equivalent units to which Mr. Flitman was entitled in connection with these RSUs) in consideration for amounts he would have otherwise been entitled to receive from his former employer (the "Buyout RSUs") and another grant in an amount of 178,967 RSUs (plus any dividend equivalent units to which Mr. Flitman was entitled in connection with these RSUs) as part his fiscal 2015 compensation package (the "Equity Award"). Each of these awards was granted in July 2015 under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. 
The Buyout RSUs vested in three substantially equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of his start date and will be settled on January 19, 2019, which is the fourth anniversary of his start date. 
The Equity Award vested and was settled on May 18, 2017, when the following conditions were met: (1) 50% of the Equity Award vested and settled when Blackstone and its affiliated investment funds received cash proceeds in respect of its direct or indirect equity investment in us that represented at least (a) 2.0 times its aggregate investment in the Company's equity securities and (b) a 12% annual internal rate of return; and (2) 50% of the Equity Award vested and settled when Blackstone and its affiliated investment funds received cash proceeds in respect of its direct or indirect equity investment in us that represented at least (x) 2.5 times its aggregate investment in the Company's equity securities and (y) a 12% annual internal rate of return.

Description of Fiscal 2018 Equity-Based Awards 
Awards Granted Under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan 
Options. Stock options granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest ratably over four years generally from the date of grant. One fourth of the stock options granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest or vested, as applicable, on each of September 21, 2018, September 21, 2019, September 21, 2020 and September 21, 2021. 
Time-Vesting Restricted Stock. Shares of time-vesting restricted stock granted under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest ratably over four years generally from the date of grant. One fourth of the shares of time-vesting restricted stock granted to our NEOs in fiscal 2018 under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan vest or vested, as applicable, on each of September 21, 2018, September 21, 2019, September 21, 2020 and September 21, 2021. 
Performance Shares. The performance period for the performance shares granted in fiscal 2018 began on July 2, 2017 and ends on June 27, 2020. The performance shares granted in fiscal 2018 under the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan will vest on the date the Compensation Committee certifies the achievement of the applicable performance 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    39 
 targets, subject to the recipient's continued service with the Company through the end of the performance periods, based on the extent to which the applicable performance goals, which are based on return on invested capital (as defined below, "ROIC") and relative total shareholder return (as defined below, "Relative TSR"), are attained. The Compensation Committee determined that the number of shares that vest under these grants will be based on performance weighted 50% on ROIC and 50% on Relative TSR, in each case over the performance periods. The Compensation Committee believes that the performance goals described below for the performance shares are reasonably attainable, yet provide an appropriate incentive to maximize our performance and shareholder value. The Compensation Committee believes that achievement of maximum performance against the goals would require exceptional corporate performance over the performance period. 
ROIC. 50% of the performance shares will vest at the end of the performance period based upon the achievement of ROIC (calculated as provided in the Restricted Stock Agreement applicable to performance-based vesting awards) targets by the Company during the performance period. Accordingly, the total number of shares of restricted stock that will vest based on the achievement of ROIC performance levels is equal to the product of (i) 50% multiplied by (ii) the recipient's target number of performance shares multiplied by (iii) the ROIC payout percentage, which can range from 0% to 150%. 
Relative TSR. 50% of the performance shares will vest based upon the achievement of Relative TSR targets by the Company over the performance period. The Company's total shareholder return is calculated as (i) (A) the average closing price of a share of common stock of the Company over the 10 trading day period ending on (and including) the last date of the performance period (assuming dividends are reinvested) minus (B) the price of a share of our common stock at the beginning of the performance period ($27.40) (the "Beginning Share Price") divided by (ii) the Beginning Share Price. Relative TSR is expressed as a relative percentile ranking of the Company among the total shareholder return of companies in the S&P MidCap 400 Index over the performance period. The total number of shares of restricted stock that will vest based on the achievement of Relative TSR performance levels is equal to the product of (i) 50% multiplied by (ii) the recipient's target number of performance shares multiplied by (iii) the Relative TSR payout percentage, which can range from 0% to 150%. 
Treatment of Awards in Connection with a Change in Control or Qualifying Termination. Immediately prior to a "change in control," any outstanding and unvested stock options and time-based restricted stock will become fully vested to the extent the acquiring or successor entity does not assume, continue or substitute for the stock options and time-based restricted stock. If the recipient's employment is terminated by us without cause or the recipient resigns with good reason within 18 months following a "change in control," any outstanding and unvested stock options and time-based restricted stock will become fully vested (to the extent the acquiring or successor entity assumes, continues or substitutes for the stock options and time-based restricted stock). On a "change in control," any outstanding and unvested performance shares will be converted to time-based restricted stock that will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant ("Converted Awards"). Such conversion will be based on the target award opportunity if the "change in control" occurs prior to the 18-month anniversary of the start of the performance period or after the 18-month anniversary of the start of the performance period if the actual performance is not measurable on the date of the "change in control"; otherwise, the conversion will be based on the actual performance at the time of the "change in control." Vesting of the Converted Awards will be accelerated if the acquiring or successor entity does not assume, continue or substitute for the Converted Awards or if the recipient's employment is terminated by us without cause or the recipient resigns with good reason within 18 months following a "change in control" (to the extent the acquiring or successor entity assumes, continues or substitutes for the stock options and restricted stock). 
Any outstanding and unvested stock options and time-based restricted stock will become fully vested in the event of the recipient's termination of employment by the recipient due to death or disability. Any outstanding and unvested performance shares will pay out pro-rata based on actual performance at the end of the performance period in the event of the recipient's termination of employment by the recipient due to death or disability. Upon any other termination of employment, all unvested stock options, time-based restricted stock and performance shares will be forfeited.

In addition to the foregoing, if Mr. Hope or Ms. O'Connell were to be terminated because of his or her death or disability, he or she would be entitled to acceleration of the vesting of our contributions to his or her 401(k) plan account. Mr. Hagerty is fully vested in our contribution to his 401(k) plan account.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
For purposes of the Severance Plan, as modified by Messrs. Hope's and Hagerty's and Ms. O'Connell's Severance Letter Agreements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "good reason" means, provided that the Company has failed to cure such event within 30 days of receipt of written  notice from the executive of such event and that such event occurred within fewer than 90 days of the executive's resignation, (1) a diminution in the executive's base salary or annual bonus opportunity; (2) any material  diminution in the executive's authority, duties, or responsibilities; (3) failure of the Company or its subsidiaries to pay or cause to be paid the executive's base salary or annual bonus, when due; or (4) relocation of the  executive's principal place of employment more than 50 miles from the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area; provided that none of these events will constitute "good reason" until the Company fails to cure the event within 30 days  after receipt of written notice of the event which constitutes "good reason." In addition, "good reason" will cease to exist for an event on the 90th day following its occurrence.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the foregoing, we provide each of our NEOs with basic life and accident insurance coverage valued at one times annual salary to a maximum of $1 million combined benefit. Therefore, if the benefits were triggered on 
46    Performance Food Group  ½  2018 Proxy Statement 
 June 29, 2018 under our life insurance plans, the designated beneficiaries of our NEOs would have received the following amounts: Mr. Holm ($1,000,000), Mr. Hope ($600,000), Mr. Ondrof ($160,000), Mr. Hagerty ($450,000), and Ms. O'Connell ($425,000). 
CEO Pay Ratio Disclosure 
The annual total compensation of our CEO for fiscal year 2018, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement and including the value of his health and welfare benefits (calculated for him and his eligible dependents at $25,726), was $5,186,012. The annual total compensation, including health and welfare benefits, of our median employee for fiscal year 2018 was $71,366. As a result, we estimate the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of the median employee for fiscal year 2018 was 73 to 1. 
To identify the median employee, we used the following methodology: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We compiled a list of all employees as of June 30, 2018, which totaled 14,999 employees. This list of employees  excluded 84 employees that joined the Company pursuant to the acquisition of CCSI, Inc. during fiscal year 2018 and eight furloughed employees.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To find the annual total compensation of our median employee for fiscal year 2018 (other than our CEO), we calculated the  annual total compensation of each employee using the sum of his or her salary and wages from our payroll records, the value of his or her Company-provided health and welfare benefits, the value of his or her fiscal 2018 bonus under the AIP, and the  value of employer matching contributions to our 401(k) plan on behalf of the employee. In making this determination, we annualized the compensation of any full-time employees who were hired in fiscal year 2018 but did not work for us for the entire  fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total compensation for such median employee using the same  methodology used for the calculation of the annual total compensation for the NEOs as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Additionally, we included the value of the median employee's health and welfare  benefits (calculated for the employee and the employee's dependents at $5,026).

The shares counted toward these ownership requirements include shares of common stock owned directly by the Covered Director and outstanding restricted stock and restricted stock units. 
These ownership requirements are set at levels that the Company believes are reasonable given the Covered Director's respective annual cash retainers.

Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    49 
Proposal No. 4 — Approve Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to Declassify the Board of Directors 
As part of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's review of our corporate governance principles and periodic review of the size, structure, composition and functioning of our Board of Directors, and after reviewing the various arguments for and against a classified board structure, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommended that our Board of Directors approve an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the classification of our Board of Directors over a three-year period so that beginning at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders all directors would be elected for a one-year term. 
On August 8, 2018, our Board of Directors adopted a resolution, subject to stockholder approval, to amend and restate our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Declassification Amendment") pursuant to which the Company will phase out the classification of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors directed that the proposed Declassification Amendment be submitted for consideration by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. We are asking stockholders to approve the Declassification Amendment. 
Article VI of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation currently provides that the Company's directors are divided into three classes, with the term of one class expiring each year and the directors in each class serving three-year terms. If the Declassification Amendment is approved and becomes effective, the class of directors elected at this Annual Meeting will be elected to full three-year terms, and the classes of directors elected in 2017 and 2016 will continue to serve out the remaining portion of their three-year terms, but directors elected after this Annual Meeting will be elected to one-year terms. Therefore, beginning with the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, our Board of Directors will be declassified and our entire Board of Directors will be elected on an annual basis. 
The Declassification Amendment would not change the present number of directors or our Board of Directors' authority to change that number and to fill any vacancies or newly created directorships. Until the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, any director appointed to fill newly created Board of Director seats or vacancies would hold office for a term that coincides with the remaining term of the relevant class. However, directors elected at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders will be elected to one-year terms and directors elected at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will also be elected to one-year terms. Upon the annual election of the entire Board of Directors at the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, a director appointed to a vacancy or new directorship would serve for a term expiring at the next annual meeting of stockholders following his or her appointment. In addition, because our Board of Directors is classified, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation currently provides that directors may be removed only for cause, consistent with Delaware law. The Declassification Amendment provides that directors elected to serve a three-year term may only be removed for cause and that from and after the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders, when declassification is complete, all directors may be removed either with or without cause. A marked version of Article VI of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as approved by our Board of Directors on August 9, 2018, that reflects the Declassification Amendment is attached to this Proxy Statement as Appendix A. 
If the Declassification Amendment is approved, our Board of Directors intends to cause the Declassification Amendment to be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware following the Annual Meeting and adopt conforming amendments, if necessary, to the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines. If the Declassification Amendment is not approved, then our Board of Directors will remain classified.

Ownership of Securities 
Beneficial Ownership 
The following table sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of shares of our common stock as of September 14, 2018 by (1) each person known to us to beneficially own more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, (2) each of our directors and named executive officers and (3) all of our directors and executive officers as a group. The amounts and percentages of shares beneficially owned are reported on the basis of SEC regulations governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under SEC rules, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares voting power or investment power, which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days. Securities that can be so acquired are deemed to be outstanding for purposes of computing such person's ownership percentage, but not for purposes of computing any other person's percentage. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of securities as to which such person has no economic interest. 
Unless otherwise noted, the address for each beneficial owner listed below is c/o Performance Food Group Company, 12500 West Creek Parkway, Richmond, VA 23238.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a company's common stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE. Executive officers, directors, the chief accounting officer and beneficial owners with more than 10% of our common stock are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on our review of copies of such reports and written representations from our executive officers, directors, and 10% stockholders we believe that our executive officers, directors, and 10% stockholders complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements during fiscal 2018. 
Transactions with Related Persons 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our "related person transaction policy." Our related person transaction policy requires that (i) any "related person transaction" (defined as any transaction that is anticipated would be reportable by us under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K in which we were or are to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any related person had or will have a direct or indirect material interest) be approved or ratified by an approving body comprised of the disinterested members of our Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors (provided that a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or such committee, respectively, are disinterested) and (ii) any employment relationship or transaction involving an executive officer and any related compensation be approved by the Compensation Committee or recommended by the Compensation Committee to the Board of Directors for its approval. It is our policy that directors interested in a related person transaction will recuse themselves from any vote on a related person transaction in which they have an interest. 
Stockholders' Agreement 
In connection with the IPO, on October 6, 2015, we entered into a stockholders' agreement with affiliates of Wellspring. This agreement granted Wellspring the right to nominate to our Board of Directors a number of designees equal to: (i) at least 20% of the total number of directors comprising our Board of Directors at such time as long as Wellspring and its affiliates beneficially own at least 20% but less than 30% of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors; and (ii) at least 10% of the total number of directors comprising our Board of Directors at such time as long as Wellspring and its affiliates beneficially own at least 5% but less than 20% of the shares of our common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors. For purposes of calculating the number of directors that Wellspring was entitled to nominate pursuant to the formula outlined above, any fractional amounts were rounded up to the nearest whole number (e.g., one and one quarter directors shall equate to two directors) and the calculation was made on a pro forma basis after taking into account any increase in the size of our Board of Directors. 
In the event a vacancy on the Board of Directors was caused by the death, retirement, or resignation of Wellspring's director-designee, Wellspring, to the fullest extent permitted by law, had the right to have the vacancy filled by Wellspring's new director-designee. 
In December 2017, Wellspring sold all of its remaining shares of common stock of the Company; accordingly, Wellspring no longer has the right to nominate to our Board of Directors any nominees. 
Registration Rights Agreement 
In connection with the IPO, on October 6, 2015, we entered into a registration rights agreement that provided Wellspring an unlimited number of "demand" registrations and customary "piggyback" registration rights and customary "piggyback" registration rights to certain other stockholders. The registration rights agreement also provided that we will pay certain expenses relating to such registrations and indemnify the registration rights holders against certain liabilities that may arise under the Securities Act. The Company paid the following amounts in expenses in connection with offerings by Wellspring of approximately $184,000 in September 2017, $196,000 in November 2017 and $222,000 in December 2017 pursuant to the registration rights agreement. 
Performance Food Group   ½  2018 Proxy Statement    53 
In December 2017, Wellspring sold all of its remaining shares of common stock of the Company; accordingly, Wellspring no longer has the right to nominate to our Board of Directors any nominees. 
Advisory Fee Agreement 
We were a party to the Amended and Restated Advisory Fee Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") with Blackstone Management Partners V L.L.C. ("BMP") and Wellspring. Pursuant to this agreement, BMP, Wellspring or their affiliates provided certain strategic and structuring advice and assistance to us. In addition, under this agreement, BMP, Wellspring, or their affiliates provide certain monitoring, advisory, and consulting services to us for an aggregate annual management fee equal to the greater of $2.5 million or 1.5% of Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the ABL Facility). BMP, Wellspring, or their affiliates also received reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with the provision of services pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. For fiscal 2018, payments under the Advisory Agreement totaled $3.0 million to Wellspring. 
Under its terms, the Advisory Agreement terminated on October 6, 2017. 
Other Transactions 
FMR LLC ("Fidelity") filed a Schedule 13G/A stating that it holds approximately 8.0% of the Company's stock. An affiliate of Fidelity provides investment management and record keeping services to the Company's 401(k) Plan. The participants in the 401(k) Plan paid $663,080 for record keeping services and $391,421 for investment management services to Fidelity in fiscal 2018. The investment management agreement was entered into on an arm's-length basis.
