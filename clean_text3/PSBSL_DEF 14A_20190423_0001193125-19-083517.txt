Corporate Governance and Board Matters 
Corporate Governance Framework 
The Board has adopted the following corporate governance documents, which, along with our charter and bylaws, establish the framework for our corporate governance and outline the general practice of our Board with respect to board structure, function, and conduct, and board and committee organization: 
Our current Corporate Governance Guidelines, Business Conduct Standards, Code of Ethics, and Committee Charters are available online in the "Investor Relations" section of our website, psbusinessparks.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance, or in writing from the Company's Investor Services Department, 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviews the Corporate Governance Guidelines at least annually and makes recommendations for any changes to the Board. We will disclose any amendments or waivers to the Code of Ethics on our website or in accordance with the SEC and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) requirements. 
Commitment to Diversity 
The Board and its Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee are committed to ensuring that a diversity of experiences and viewpoints are represented on the Board as well as the Company's senior management. As a reflection of this commitment, 25% of our current Board is female, and our President and CEO is female and Hispanic. 
Board Leadership 
We have separate individuals serving as Chairman of the Board and as CEO. Ronald L. Havner, Jr., has served as Chairman of the Board since March 1998. He is also Chairman of Public Storage. Mr. Havner has been involved with the Company since its founding and has extensive knowledge of the Company, the markets in which it operates, and the real estate industry. Joseph D. Russell, Jr. is a member of our Board and was our CEO from August 2003 to June 2016. Mr. Russell was also our President until August 2015 and currently serves as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Trustee of Public Storage. Maria R. Hawthorne serves as our President and was appointed as CEO in July 2016. She is the only management director and brings in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities, and risks facing the Company and our industry. She is also deeply familiar with our day-to-day operations and management and has the leadership skills to continue to drive profitable growth of PS Business Parks. 
We do not have a policy against one individual holding the positions of Chairman and CEO. Rather, the Board evaluates the desirability of having a combined or separate Chairman and CEO from time to time and adopts a structure based on what it believes to be in the best interests of PS Business Parks and its shareholders. Currently, the Board believes that having separate Chairman and CEO roles serves the interests of the Company and its shareholders well. 
    PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 20 
Proposal 1 
Majority Vote Requirements for Directors 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that in an uncontested election of directors, each director nominee who does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast with respect to that director, must submit his or her resignation to the Board. For the purpose of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, a majority means the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed 50% of the votes cast with respect to the director. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will then make a recommendation to the Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or take other action. The Board will act on any such recommendation and publicly disclose its decision within 90 days from the date the election results were certified by the inspector of Elections. If a director's resignation is accepted by the Board, the Board may fill the resulting vacancy or decrease the size of the Board in accordance with the bylaws. 
Presiding Independent Director 
The Board has established a position of Presiding Independent Director to provide an independent director with a leadership role on the Board. The Presiding Independent Director presides at meetings of all independent directors or all non-management directors in executive sessions without the presence of management. These meetings are held on a regular basis in connection with each regularly scheduled board meeting and at the request of any independent or non-management director. In addition, the independent directors meet separately at least once annually. These sessions are designed to encourage open discussion of any matter of interest without the CEO or any other members of management present. The position of Presiding Independent Director generally rotates annually among the chairs of the standing committees of the Board. Peter Schultz, Chair of the Capital Committee, was the Presiding Independent Director for 2018. James Kropp is the Presiding Independent Director for 2019, effective February 20, 2019. 
Board Responsibilities and Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board is responsible for overseeing our Company's approach to major risks and our policies for assessing and managing these risks. In connection with its oversight function, the Board regularly receives presentations from management on areas of risk facing our business. The Board and management actively engage in discussions about these potential and perceived risks to the business. 
In addition, the Board is assisted in its oversight responsibilities by the four standing Board committees (as described below), which have assigned areas of oversight responsibility for various matters, as described in the Committee Charters and as provided in the NYSE rules. 
The Audit Committee of our Board (the Audit Committee) assists the Board in overseeing the integrity of our financial statements, the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the performance of our internal audit function. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee also regularly evaluates Company practice and policies with respect to risk assessment, risk management, and financial risk. 
The Compensation Committee oversees the compensation of our CEO and other executive officers and evaluates compensation incentives to ensure they will motivate senior management to grow long-term shareholder return without taking undue risk. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee focuses on risks associated with director and management succession planning, corporate governance, and overall Board effectiveness. 
The Capital Committee oversees the optimization of the Company's capital expenditures. The Committee's goal is to place the Company in the best position to maximize the long-term benefit of its capital expenditures, while at the same time ensuring those assets are well maintained and positioned to meet the needs of the Company's customer base. 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 21     
Proposal 1 
The Board committees also hear reports from members of management to enable each committee to identify, discuss, understand and manage risk. The chair of each of the Board's standing committees reports on interim individual committee discussions to the full Board at each Board meeting. All directors have access to management in the event a director wishes to follow up on items discussed outside the Board meeting. 
Board Orientation and Education 
Each new director participates in an orientation program and receives materials and briefings concerning our business, industry, management, and corporate governance policies and practices. Continuing education is provided for all directors through board materials and presentations, discussions with management, and the opportunity to attend external board education programs. 
Board Retirement Policy 
The Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that no person will be nominated for election to the Board for any term unless he or she is 73 years of age or younger on the first day of the term. The Board has discretion to make exceptions to the policy to provide for a transition period of service. 
Director Independence 
The Board evaluates the independence of each director annually based on information supplied by the directors and the Company, and on the recommendations of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of the directors be independent in accordance with the requirements of the NYSE. A director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines, in accordance with NYSE rules, that the director has a material relationship with PS Business Parks, based on all relevant facts and circumstances. Material relationships may include commercial, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, family, and other business, professional, and personal relationships. The Board also considers the director's relationships with Public Storage, our largest shareholder. 
Following its annual review of each director's independence, in February 2019, the Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board determined, that (i) each of Jennifer Holden Dunbar, James H. Kropp, Gary E. Pruitt, Robert S. Rollo, and Peter Schultz is independent pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, and (ii)  each Audit Committee member and each Compensation Committee member meets the additional independence requirements of the rules of the SEC. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board has four standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, and the Capital Committee. Each of the standing committees operates pursuant to a written charter, which can be viewed at our website at  psbusinessparks.com/investor-relations/corporate-governance. Any shareholder may obtain a print copy by writing to the Company's Secretary at PS Business Parks, Inc., 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, CA 91201-2349. 
Our four standing committees are described below. 
Audit Committee 
The primary functions of the Audit Committee, as set forth in its charter, are to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for oversight of:

The Compensation Committee has not delegated any of its responsibilities to individual members of the Committee or to a subcommittee of the Committee, although it has the discretion to do so. As required by its charter, the Compensation Committee and, in some instances, the Compensation Committee and all other independent members of the Board, made final compensation decisions for executive officers in 2018, including the NEOs set forth in the Summary Compensation Table on page 46 below. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain outside compensation consultants for advice, but historically and for 2018 has not done so, relying instead on surveys of publicly available information about senior executive compensation at similar companies. For a discussion of the Compensation Committee's use of survey information in 2018, as well as the role of Ms. Hawthorne, our President and CEO, in determining or recommending the amount of compensation paid to our NEOs in 2018, see the CD&A beginning on page 30. 
Each member of the Compensation Committee qualifies as independent pursuant to the rules of the SEC and NYSE.

Proposal 1 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation. No executive officer of PS Business Parks served on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has an executive officer who also served on our Compensation Committee or Board at any time during 2018, and no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under Item 404 of SEC Regulation S-K. 
Messrs. Havner and Russell and Ms. Hawthorne are present or former officers of the Company and are members of the Board. They do not serve on the Compensation Committee. 
Oversight of Compensation Risks. With respect to consideration of risks related to compensation, the Compensation Committee annually considers a report from our senior management team concerning potential risks related to compensation policies and practices applicable to all of the Company's employees. 
In early 2019, the Compensation Committee considered management's review of the target metrics for all of our employee incentive compensation plans and management's conclusion that the Company's incentive compensation plans, practices, and policies (1) properly incentivized employees to achieve short- and long-term Company goals, (2) did not create any significant motivation or opportunity for employees to take undue risks to achieve an incentive compensation award, and (3) are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Compensation Committee, following discussion, reached a similar conclusion. The Compensation Committee expects to further review compensation risks from time to time. 
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee 
The primary functions of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, as set forth in its charter, are to: 
Our Board has delegated to the Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee responsibility for recommending nominees for election to the Board. Other duties and responsibilities of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee include periodically reviewing the structure, size, composition, and operation of the Board and each Board committee; recommending assignments of directors to Board committees; conducting a preliminary review of director independence; overseeing director orientation; and annually reviewing and evaluating its charter and performance. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is further guided by the principles set forth in its charter. 
    PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 24 
Proposal 1 
Director Qualifications. We believe that members of the Board should have high professional and personal ethics and values. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business or other relevant experience. They should be committed to enhancing shareholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. Their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform all director duties responsibly. Each director must represent the interests of all shareholders. In general, the Board seeks to add directors who meet the independence requirements of the NYSE rules. In addition, director candidates must annually submit a completed director questionnaire concerning matters related to independence determination, the determination of whether a candidate qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, and must satisfactorily complete a background investigation by a third-party firm. 
Director Diversity. Although the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee does not have, and does not believe there is a need for, a formal policy concerning diversity, it seeks to ensure that a diversity of different experiences and viewpoints are represented on the Board. As a reflection of this commitment, 25% of our proposed Board composition is female, satisfying recently enacted California law requiring PS Business Parks to have at least one female on the Board by no later than December 31, 2019. 
Identifying and Evaluating Nominees for Directors. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee utilizes a variety of methods for identifying and evaluating nominees for director. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee regularly assesses the appropriate size of the Board and whether any vacancies on the Board are expected due to retirement or otherwise. In the event that vacancies are anticipated or otherwise arise, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers various potential candidates for director. 
Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, professional search firms, shareholders, or other persons. These candidates are evaluated at meetings of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and may be considered at any point during the year. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers properly submitted shareholder nominations of candidates for the Board in the same manner as other candidates. Following verification of the shareholder status of persons proposing candidates, recommendations will be aggregated and considered by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee prior to the issuance of the proxy statement for the annual meeting. If any materials are provided by a shareholder in connection with the recommendation of a director candidate, such materials are forwarded to the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee may also review materials provided by professional search firms or other parties in connection with a nominee who is not proposed by a shareholder. In evaluating such nominations, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee seeks to achieve a balance of knowledge, experience, and capability on the Board. 
We do not have any other policies or guidelines that limit the selection of director candidates by the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, and the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and the Board have and continue to exercise broad discretion to select director candidates who will best serve the Board and the Company in the current and anticipated business environment.

Capital Committee 
The Capital Committee focuses on assessing, monitoring, and optimizing the Company's capital expenditures, including development and redevelopment opportunities as well as the Company's annual recurring capital expenditures, which include maintenance capital, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. The goal is to place the Company in the best position to maximize the long-term benefits of its capital expenditures while ensuring its assets are well maintained and positioned in the marketplace to meet the needs of the Company's customer base. The Capital Committee operates pursuant to a formal charter adopted by the members of the committee in July 2016. 
Communications with the Board of Directors 
The Company provides a process by which shareholders and interested parties may communicate with the Board. Communication to the Board should be addressed to: Board of Directors, c/o Jeffrey D. Hedges, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Secretary, PS Business Parks, Inc., 701 Western Avenue, Glendale, California 91201-2349. Communications intended for a specified individual director or group of directors should be addressed to the director(s) c/o Secretary at the above address, and all such communications received will be forwarded to the designated director(s). 
Board and Committee Meetings and Attendance 
The Board meets at regularly scheduled intervals and may hold additional special meetings as necessary or desirable in furtherance of its oversight responsibilities. As described above, the non-management directors generally meet in executive session without the presence of management in connection with each regularly scheduled Board meeting. 
In 2018, the Board held four in-person meetings and two special telephonic meetings. Each director who served as a director at the time attended at least 83% of the Board meetings held and, if a member of a committee of the Board, at least 81% of the meetings held by both the Board and all committees of the Board on which the director served. We do not have a policy regarding directors' attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders, but directors are encouraged to attend. All of the Board's nine directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
The following table summarizes the membership of the Board's standing committees and the number of meetings held by each committee in 2018:

Equity Awards. Each new non-employee director who is determined by the Board to be independent, upon the date of his or her initial election by the Board or the shareholders to serve as a non-employee director, is automatically granted an option to purchase 10,000 shares of Common Stock, which vests in five equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant or the annual shareholders meeting date in that year, whichever is earlier, subject to continued service. Directors who previously served as Company executives are not eligible to receive this award. 
Annually, each non-employee director receives a non-qualified stock option to purchase 2,000 shares of Common Stock, which vests in five equal annual installments beginning one year from the date of grant based on continued service. The annual grants are made immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders at the closing price for the Common Stock on the NYSE on such date. 
Upon the retirement of a director from the Board because the director is not nominated for re-election due to the Board's Mandatory Retirement Policy, all outstanding options held by the director vest effective as of the date of his or her retirement and the director has one year to exercise all vested options. 
Retirement Stock Grants. Under our Retirement Plan for Non-Employee Directors, each non-employee director of the Company receives, upon retirement as a director of the Company, 1,000 shares of fully-vested Common Stock for each full year of service as a non-employee director of the Company, up to a maximum of 8,000 shares. The awards are intended to retain and reward long-term service on the Board and to provide equity compensation to Board members. Directors receive any dividends paid on unvested shares.    Directors who previously served as Company executives are not eligible to receive this grant until their participation in the Company's equity incentive plans have ended. 
At December 31, 2018, Messrs. Havner and Kropp and Ms. Dunbar and Ms. Lewis were each entitled to receive 8,000 fully-vested shares of Common Stock upon retirement; Messrs. Pruitt and Schultz were each entitled to 6,000 shares; and Mr. Rollo was entitled to receive 5,000 shares. 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 27     
Proposal 1 
As of December 31, 2018, the value of each award of 8,000 shares was $1,048,000; the value of 6,000 shares was $786,000; and the value of 5,000 shares was $655,000, each based on the closing price of $131.00 of our common stock as of December 31, 2018. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines. Pursuant to the Corporate Governance Guidelines, each non-management director is encouraged to have a significant stock ownership in the Company. All directors are expected, within three years of election, to own at least $100,000 of common stock of the Company, as determined using the per- share value on the date of acquisition. All of our directors meet this stock ownership requirement.

  Proposal 2 – Advisory vote to approve executive compensation 
Advisory Vote 
We provide shareholders an annual advisory vote to approve the compensation of our NEOs, also known as a "Say-on-Pay" proposal. 
More than 94% of the votes cast at our 2018 Annual Meeting were in favor of our executive compensation package. This approval, along with direct input received from shareholders regarding their votes, signaled strong shareholder support of the elements and amounts of compensation paid for both 2017 performance and the compensation opportunities established to reward long-term growth and performance. As a result, the Compensation Committee did not make any significant changes to the Company's executive compensation program for 2018.
We believe our strong performance in 2018 was driven, in part, by motivated NEOs incentivized by our strategic compensation program. Annual cash incentive bonus payments, which represent a significant portion of our regular annual compensation, were tied to achieving at least a (i) 5.0% increase in Adjusted FAD¹ and (ii) 2.0% increase in Same Park Net Operating Income (Same Park NOI).² 
¹Adjusted FAD is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to "2018 Annual Cash Incentive Thresholds and Targets" in the CD&A section of the proxy statement. 
² Refer to page 26 of our Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2019, for information regarding our calculation of Same Park NOI. 
We believe these compensation targets fueled impressive 2018 performance that rewarded shareholders with a 7.9% TSR—compared to the 2018 NAREIT Equity Index, which had a negative return of 4.1%. Our TSR also beat the NAREIT Equity Index and the S&P 500 index for the 5-year and 15-year periods ending December 31, 2018, averaging 11.4% in total annual return since 2003. 
The Board recommends that shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs disclosed in the following CD&A and compensation tables. 
Although the shareholder vote on our executive compensation program is advisory and nonbinding on the Company, the Compensation Committee, which is responsible for designing and administering the compensation program, values the opinions expressed by shareholders. The Compensation Committee will consider and weigh heavily the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR approval of our executive compensation as described in this proxy statement.

Proposal 2 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) 
The following section summarizes our philosophy and objectives regarding the compensation of our NEOs, including how we determine the elements and amounts of executive compensation. This section should be read in conjunction with both its tabular compensation disclosures for NEOs for the year ended December 31, 2018, and the Compensation Committee Report, which can be found on page 45 of this proxy statement. 
Executive Summary 
The Compensation Committee's goal for our executive compensation program is to hire, retain, and motivate our senior management to achieve solid financial results and create long-term shareholder value. Our NEOs are paid based on what the Compensation Committee considers appropriate in view of individual and corporate performance; market and peer compensation practices from surveys and other sources; and our objective of aligning our NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders to maximize shareholder value over the long term. We believe that our compensation programs have been effective in helping the Company move towards its financial and operational goals. 
In general: 
In fiscal year 2018, senior management successfully grew occupancy and average rental rates and continued to commit to a conservative balance sheet by minimizing the use of debt. Their efforts were directly responsible for the following results: 
Based on these achievements and considerations, the Compensation Committee made the following compensation decisions for 2018: 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 31     
Proposal 2 
In keeping with our conservative compensation philosophy and practices: 
We believe our compensation program for NEOs drove 2018 performance and will continue to drive improved Company performance. Accordingly, the Board recommends that shareholders approve the compensation of the Company's NEOs, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation rules, including the CD&A, the compensation tables, and the narrative disclosures that accompany the compensation tables in this proxy statement. 
Our Executive Officers 
The following are biographical summaries of the current executive officers of the Company who are not also serving as directors: 
Jeffrey D. Hedges, age 36, joined the Company as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary, and principal financial officer on September 17, 2018. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Hedges served as Senior Vice President, Accounting and Reporting from 2015 at Invitation Homes (NYSE:INVH) (formerly known as Starwood Waypoint Homes and prior to that Colony Starwood Homes), a publicly traded single-family residential real estate investment trust that owns and operates single-family rental homes in the United States. Mr. Hedges was a Senior Manager in the Transaction Advisory Services and Assurance (Audit) groups at Ernst & Young from 2006 to 2015. Mr. Hedges is a certified public accountant and holds a Bachelor of Science from the W.P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, and a 
 Master of Business Administration from the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. 
John W. Petersen, age 55, has been Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer since he joined the Company in December 2004. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Petersen was Senior Vice President, San Jose Region, for Equity Office Properties (EOP) from July 2001 to December 2004, responsible for 11.3 million square feet of multi-tenant office, industrial and R&D space in Silicon Valley. Prior to working for EOP, Mr. Petersen was Senior Vice President with Spieker Properties from 1995 to 2001, overseeing the growth of that company's portfolio in San Jose, through acquisition and development of nearly three million square feet. Mr. Petersen is a graduate of The Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and was recently the President of the National Association of Industrial and Office Parks, Silicon Valley Chapter. 
Trenton Groves, age 46, has served as the Company's Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer, Assistant Secretary, and principal accounting officer since September 2018. Mr. Groves joined the Company as Corporate Controller in 2004 and has served as Vice President, Finance, and Corporate Controller since 2007. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Groves was in public accounting, serving as a Manager in the Assurance (Audit) group at Ernst & Young from 2002 to 2004 and as Manager at Arthur Anderson from 1998 to 2002. Mr. Groves is a certified public accountant and holds a Bachelor of Science in accounting from California State University, Northridge. 
Executive Officer Diversity 
Although we do not have and do not believe there is a need for a formal policy concerning diversity of executive officers, the Board seeks to ensure that a diversity of different experiences, backgrounds, and viewpoints are represented in our management. Currently, our CEO is female and Hispanic, and the Board and management continue to be focused and committed to increasing diversity in ongoing succession planning discussions. 
    PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 32 
Proposal 2 
Compensation Objectives and Process 
Our compensation goals are to hire, retain, and motivate our senior management to create long-term shareholder value. We generally pay our NEOs compensation that we consider appropriate in view of individual and corporate performance, competitive levels, and our objective of aligning our NEOs' interests with those of our shareholders to maximize shareholder value over the long term. 
In general, our compensation program for NEOs has comprised: (1) a base salary; (2) short-term incentives generally in the form of annual cash bonuses; and (3) periodic equity awards subject to long-term vesting, which may be restricted stock units (RSUs) or stock options. 
Our incentive compensation for NEOs is designed to reward achievement of Company-wide performance goals by tying awards to objectives that the Compensation Committee believes are key drivers of long-term, sustainable performance. 
Because each component of our compensation program is designed to accomplish or reward different objectives, historically and in 2018, the Compensation Committee determined the award of each component separately. Historically and in 2018, the Compensation Committee did not retain or rely on information provided by any third-party compensation consultant in setting compensation levels and awards for our NEOs. 
The Compensation Committee generally considers corporate, business unit, and individual performance and other relevant factors, and will solicit the views of the CEO (with respect to compensation of the other NEOs) and the Chairman and the Board (with respect to compensation of the CEO). 
Focus on Pay for Performance 
The guiding principle of our executive compensation philosophy is to pay for performance and incentivize our executive officers to create long-term shareholder value. The Compensation Committee believes that NEO compensation should significantly vary based on the Company's achievement of financial and operational goals and on each executive's contributions to such achievement. This link between incentive payouts and achievement of goals has helped drive our strong and consistent performance year after year. 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 33     
Proposal 2 
Assessment of Individual Contributions to Overall Performance 
The Compensation Committee's evaluation of each NEO places strong emphasis on his or her contributions to the Company's overall performance rather than focusing only on his or her individual business or functional area. The Compensation Committee believes that the NEOs share responsibility to support the goals and performance of the Company as a whole. 
Long-Term Financial Performance 
The Company has delivered strong financial performance over a sustained period of time, increasing adjusted FAD and Same Park NOI in each of the last five years. The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation program, structured on the philosophy and objectives outlined above, is a key driver of the Company's strong performance over the long term. 
The Compensation Committee made all final compensation decisions for NEOs in 2018, which were ratified by the Board thereafter. For more information on the Compensation Committee and its responsibilities, see "Corporate Governance and Board Matters—Committees of the Board of Directors—Compensation Committee" on page 23. 
Sound Governance Practices 
In designing our executive compensation around the philosophy and objectives outlined above, the Compensation Committee believes that our program encourages the highest performance standards and aligns the interests of our NEOs with the long-term interests of our shareholders by: 
At the same time, the following features of our program discourage inappropriate risk taking:

Elements of Executive Compensation 
To achieve our compensation objectives of aligning pay with performance and long-term shareholder value, we believe that total executive compensation over the long-tern should be balanced among the following components:

Equity Grant Practices 
Equity grants to all of our executive officers, including the NEOs, must be approved by the Compensation Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, and: 
In 2016, the Compensation Committee approved a pool of 5,000 RSUs to be granted under authority of Ms. Hawthorne, the Company's President and CEO, to new employees or employees promoted by the Company who are not executive officers of the Company. These awards are typically granted on the first trading day of the month following the hire or promotion date, and vest in equal annual installments over five years. 
Equity grants to other non-executive officers may be made at other times during the year, but are not timed in coordination with the release of material non-public information. These awards typically vest in equal annual installments over five years.

Proposal 2 
Executive Officer Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board implemented stock ownership guidelines for NEOs effective April 28, 2015. Each NEO is expected to beneficially own Common Stock equal in market value to a specified multiple of his or her annual base salary. The guideline for the CEO is five times his or her base salary and for the other NEOs is three times his or her base salary. All of our NEOs who have been with the Company at least five years exceed his/her stock ownership requirement. 
Only shares of Common Stock (1) owned by the executive, (2) owned jointly by him/her and his/her spouse, (3) owned by his/her spouse, (4) held by him/her in the 401(k) Plan, and (5) held in custodial accounts or trust for him/her or for his/her spouse and/or children are counted for determining compliance with these guidelines. Unvested time-based RSUs and in-the-money value of vested options are NOT counted for determining compliance with these guidelines. 
2018 Executive Compensation 
2018 Company Performance 
Execution on Strategy. During 2018, management successfully executed on the Company's strategy of improving occupancy and rental rates. Optimized occupancy gives us the ability to adjust rents and transaction costs aggressively in response to changing conditions, thereby accelerating company financial performance and operating metrics. In addition, we continued to commit to a conservative balance sheet by minimizing the use of debt. Management's successful execution on these strategies enabled the Company to deliver solid results on several fronts during the year, including the following:

Proposal 2 
Total Shareholder Return. We believe our compensation program for executive officers helped drive our strong performance in 2018, rewarding the Company's shareholders with a 7.9% TSR during 2018, compared to the NAREIT Equity Index, which had a negative return of 4.1%. In addition, our TSR beat the NAREIT Equity Index and the S&P 500 indices for the 5-year and 15-year periods ending December 31, 2018, averaging 11.4% in TSR per year since 2003. The exhibit below shows our TSR expressed as cumulative return to shareholders since December 31, 2013, and illustrates that $100 invested in PS Business Parks on December 31, 2013 would have been valued at $203.66 as of December 31, 2018. 
*TSR assumes common share price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends

Core FFO and Shareholder Distributions. In 2018, we grew our Core FFO per common share by 5.5% over 2017 levels, which increased our capacity for investments in our business. Annual dividends per common share paid in 2018 also grew by more than 11.8%. The following chart shows the growth achieved by PS Business Parks in these two metrics over a five-year period.

Pay Ratio Disclosure 
This section presents the ratio of annual total compensation of our President and CEO, Maria R. Hawthorne (as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table at page 46 below), to the annual total compensation (Form W-2 wages) of our median employee (excluding Ms. Hawthorne). The ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 
We selected the median employee based on the Company's 155 employees (excluding Ms. Hawthorne) as of December 31, 2018. In identifying our median employee, we calculated the annual total compensation of each employee as of December 31, 2018, based on Form W-2 information. We did not apply any cost-of-living adjustments as part of the calculation. 
The 2018 annual total compensation for our CEO, as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table below, and as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K, was $3,773,551. The 2018 annual total compensation for our median employee, as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K, was $83,264. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 45 to 1.

Factors Considered by the Compensation Committee in its Compensation Decisions for 2018 
2018 Advisory Vote to Approve Executive Compensation. We believe our executive compensation program is appropriately structured to achieve our objective of driving growth in long-term shareholder value.  
Role of Management and Compensation Committee Meetings. In general, our CEO attends all meetings of the Compensation Committee at which (i) compensation of the other NEOs or other employees is discussed and/or (ii) Company-wide compensation matters, such as the consideration of new equity plans, are discussed. 
Our CEO does not vote on items before the Compensation Committee. As discussed in more detail below, the Compensation Committee solicits our CEO's views on the performance of the executive officers reporting to her, including each of the other NEOs. In general, the Compensation Committee sets the compensation for the other NEOs after consideration of our CEO's recommendations with respect to appropriate amounts to reward and incentivize each NEO.     
The Compensation Committee met four times during 2018. Ms. Hawthorne attended a portion of all of the meetings but did not participate in the deliberations of the Compensation Committee with respect to setting her own compensation. 
2018 Compensation Targets 
The Compensation Committee designed its incentive compensation programs for 2018 to focus management on growing our business. 
2018 Annual Cash Incentive Thresholds and Targets. In March 2018, the Compensation Committee met to determine the appropriate performance thresholds and target amounts for 2018 annual incentive bonuses in order to properly incentivize senior management with respect to 2018 performance. The thresholds represent the minimum performance levels that must be achieved in order for senior management to be qualified for awards of 2018 annual incentive bonuses at the target amounts. 
After consideration of the Company's strategic goals and input from Ms. Hawthorne and other Board members, including the Chairman of the Board, the Compensation Committee established the following as the performance thresholds for payment of senior executive bonuses: (i) at least 5.0% growth in 2018 Adjusted FAD from 2017 Adjusted FAD and (ii) at least 2.0% growth in 2018 Same Park NOI from 2017 Same Park NOI. These financial metrics were selected by the Compensation Committee because of their importance to both the PS Business Parks senior executive team and to investors. And consistent with our long history of setting annual incentive award targets at around one time base salary (although this does not preclude the Compensation Committee from approving higher or lower annual incentives awards), 2018 bonus target amounts were established at 100% of base salary for each executive officer. 
For purposes of determining performance metrics, Adjusted FAD is calculated after FAD is computed. FAD is computed by adjusting consolidated Funds From Operations (FFO) to (a) deduct capital improvements that maintain the real estate value, tenant improvements and lease commissions, (b) eliminate certain non-cash income or expenses such as straight-line rent and non-cash stock compensation expense and (c) eliminate the impact of EITF Topic D-42. FFO represents GAAP net income before real estate depreciation and amortization expense, gains or losses from sales of operating properties and impairment charges on operating properties and real estate equity investments. 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 41     
Proposal 2 
For purposes of calculating the FAD bonus target amounts, 2018 FAD was adjusted by a number of factors, including adjustments made to neutralize the impact of: (i) maintenance capital expenditures; (ii) income, capital, and expenses incurred in connection with asset dispositions in 2018; and (iii) cash paid for taxes in lieu of shares. 
In determining whether the bonus paid is to be at, above or below the target bonus amount, the Compensation Committee will solicit the views of the CEO (with respect to the other NEOs) and the Chairman and the Board (with respect to the CEO), taking into account the performance of each NEO, including achievement of individual performance goals and other factors deemed relevant by the Compensation Committee. 
2018 Compensation Decisions 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee considered, among other factors, that (i) Adjusted 2018 FAD was $193.2 million, a 10.0% increase over 2017 and (ii) 2018 Same Park NOI was $7.1 million, a 2.6% increase over 2017. As a result, the Compensation Committee made the following decisions with respect to 2018 compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       his onboarding package); $355,000 for Mr. Peterson (100% of target); and $145,334 for Mr. Groves (100% of target, prorated according to the terms of his promotion).   
[END TABLE]
In evaluating management's performance, the Compensation Committee placed significant weight on management's strategic decisions that correctly anticipated changing economic conditions, their successful execution on that strategy, and their unwavering financial discipline. Our management team, led by Ms. Hawthorne, successfully oversaw and navigated the Company through these challenges. And Ms. Hawthorne did so while serving in a dual capacity as interim Chief Financial Officer from September 1, 2017, through September 16, 2018. 
In evaluating the overall compensation of our NEOs, and in keeping with its compensation philosophy of emphasizing and rewarding long-term performance, the Compensation Committee avoided placing inordinate emphasis on strict year-over-year comparisons in any specific financial metric, such as rental income or net income, as they are in part skewed by one-time and non-recurring events and do not reflect management's long-term strategic focus. As such, the Compensation Committee believes that the Company's 2018 executive compensation is fully aligned with performance. 
In addition to the compensation awarded for 2018 service, the Compensation Committee approved the following special equity awards in 2018: a one-time award of 25,000 RSUs was awarded to Ms. Hawthorne in light of retention considerations and for serving a dual capacity role as Chief Financial Officer; 10,000 RSUs were awarded to Mr. Hedges in connection with his appointment as part of an onboarding package; and 2,000 RSUs were awarded to Mr. Groves in light of retention considerations and additional responsibilities he assumed prior to the hiring of Mr. Hedges.

Performance-Based Compensation 
We believe that a significant percentage of NEO compensation should be tied to the Company's performance and thus be "at risk." The following charts identify the percentage of regular 2018 compensation that is "at risk" as it is compensation tied to the achievement of performance goals.

2019 Compensation Outlook 
The Compensation Committee believes the Company is well-positioned as a result of management's focus and successful execution over the last several years. Given these expectations, the Compensation Committee met in February and March 2019 and made the following decisions for 2019 NEO compensation: 
Tax Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee considers the tax deductibility of compensation as one factor when considering executive compensation program alternatives. Due to its tax status as a REIT, the Company must generally distribute its taxable income to shareholders. To the extent that compensation is not deductible, taxable income will be higher and so, distributions to shareholders may be higher than they would be otherwise. 
The Compensation Committee has in the past approved and has reserved the right in the future to approve compensation that does not qualify for deductibility in circumstances it deems in the Company's best interests. 
Prior to January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) imposed a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the Company's current chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. Certain "performance-based" compensation exceeding $1,000,000 annually paid to the executives was excluded from Section 162(m)'s limitation and was deductible if certain requirements were met. The Company generally designed awards of stock options, certain restricted share units, and cash incentives to qualify as deductible "performance-based" compensation. 
Under tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 (the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"), the deductibility of executive compensation was limited further, effective January 1, 2018. Section 162(m) still imposes a $1,000,000 per person limit on the annual tax deduction for compensation paid to the Company's current chief executive officer and certain other executive officers. But, the exclusion for "performance-based" compensation was repealed, and the group of employees subject to the limitation was expanded to include the chief financial officer and certain former executive officers.     
Compensation awarded before November 3, 2017, which otherwise qualified as "performance based," may continue to be deductible in the future as the cash compensation is paid, the restricted share units vest, and the stock options are exercised, under certain interim relief provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. However, due to ambiguities and uncertainties about how the revised Section 162(m) should apply, it is uncertain whether previous awards that the Compensation Committee believed to be "performance based" compensation will be deductible going forward.

Payments Upon Termination. We do not have a formal severance or retirement program for payments on termination of employment through voluntary or involuntary termination, other than as specifically set forth in the 2012 Plan, the 2003 Stock Option and Incentive Plan (the 2003 Plan), the 401(k) Plan or as required by law. These include: 
Payments Upon Death or Disability. In the event of the death or permanent and total disability of an NEO while employed by the Company, the executive officer will receive 401(k) Plan contributions noted above and accrued unused vacation pay, in addition to the following: 
Payments Upon a Change of Control. The Company's 2003 Plan and 2012 Plan provide that upon the occurrence of a change of control of the Company: 
Under the 2012 Plan, the Compensation Committee may elect, in its sole discretion, to cancel any outstanding awards of options, RSUs, dividend equivalent rights and/or stock appreciation rights and pay or deliver to the holder an amount in cash or securities having a value (as determined by the Compensation Committee acting in good faith), in the case of restricted stock, RSUs and dividend equivalent rights, equal to the formula or fixed price per share paid to holders of shares of stock pursuant to such "change in control" and, in the case of options or stock appreciation rights, equal to the product of the number of shares of stock subject to such options or stock appreciation rights (the "Award Stock") multiplied by the amount, if any, by which (x) the formula or fixed price per share paid to holders of shares of stock pursuant to such transaction exceeds (y) the option price or stock appreciation right price applicable to such Award Stock. No performance-based awards under the 2012 Plan will vest, partially or fully, in connection with a "change in control" unless the performance conditions for such award has been satisfied. All other equity-based awards will be governed by the terms of their agreement.

A "change of control" (in the 2003 Plan) and a "change in control" (in the 2012 Plan) are defined to include: 
The foregoing provisions do not apply to the extent (1) provision is made in writing in connection with the "change of control" for continuation of the 2003 Plan or the 2012 Plan or substitution of new options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, RSUs, dividend equivalent rights, and other equity-based awards or (2) a majority of the Board determines that the "change of control" will not trigger application of the foregoing provisions.

Additional Information about our Directors and Executive Officers; 
Certain Relationships 
Policy Regarding Pledging of Shares 
Our insider trading policy discourages (but does not prohibit) the pledging of shares of Common Stock by insiders. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of any registered class of the Company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes of ownership of those securities with the SEC and the NYSE. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by SEC regulations to provide the Company with a copy of all Section 16(a) forms that they file. 
Based solely on a review of reports we filed on behalf of our directors and executive officers and written representations from these individuals that no other reports were required, we believe that all reports on behalf of our directors and executive officers were filed on a timely basis under Section 16(a). 
Related Party Transaction Approval Policies and Procedures 
With respect to transactions involving our directors, our Code of Ethics provides for review by the Board of related party transactions that might present a possible conflict of interest. The Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee reviews related party transactions involving Board members pursuant to the Code of Ethics. Directors are requested to submit information in advance to the Nominating/ Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers the matters submitted to it in light of the facts and circumstances presented and considering the best interests of the Company and makes a recommendation to the Board with respect to any action to be taken. The director with an actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest does not participate in the decision-making process related to the transaction. 
Our executive officers are subject to our Business Conduct Standards. Under the Business Conduct 
 Standards, executive officers are required to discuss and seek pre-approval of the CEO for any potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews, on an ongoing basis, related party transactions involving our executive officers and directors or Public Storage that may require Board pre-approval under applicable law or may be required to be disclosed in our financial statements. 
Relationship with Public Storage 
The properties in which the Company has an equity interest are generally owned by the operating partnership. As of March 1, 2019, the Company owned approximately 78.9% of the operating partnership's common partnership units. The remaining common partnership units were owned by Public Storage and affiliated partnerships. The 7,305,355 Units held by Public Storage and affiliated partnerships are redeemable (pursuant to the terms of the agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership) by the holder for cash or, at the Company's election, for shares of our Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. Upon conversion of the Units to Common Stock, Public Storage and its affiliated partnerships would own approximately 41.7% of the Common Stock (based upon the Common Stock outstanding at March 1, 2019, and assuming such conversion).

Proposal 2 
Management Agreement with Affiliates 
The operating partnership operates industrial, retail, and office facilities for Public Storage and partnerships and joint ventures of which Public Storage is a general partner or joint venturer (the Affiliated Entities) pursuant to a management agreement under which Public Storage and the Affiliated Entities pay to the operating partnership a fee of 5% of the gross revenues of the facilities operated for Public Storage and the Affiliated Entities. During 2018, Public Storage and the Affiliated Entities paid fees of approximately $407,000 to the operating partnership pursuant to that management agreement. In 2018, we allocated approximately $472,000 in operating expenses to Public Storage relating to the management agreement, including payroll and other overhead expenses. We had net amounts due from Public Storage of $43,000 at December 31, 2018. 
Public Storage also provides property management services for the self-storage component of two assets owned by the Company. These self-storage facilities, located in Palm Beach County, Florida, operate under the "Public Storage" name. Under the property management contracts, Public Storage is compensated based on a percentage of the gross revenues of the facilities managed. Under the supervision of the Company, Public Storage coordinates rental policies, rent collections, marketing activities, the purchase of equipment and supplies, maintenance activities, and the selection and engagement of vendors, suppliers, and independent contractors. In addition, Public Storage assists and advises the Company in establishing policies for the hire, discharge, and supervision of employees for the operation of these facilities, including on-site managers, assistant managers, and associate managers. Both the Company and Public Storage can cancel the property management contract upon 60 days' notice. Management fees paid for these facilities were approximately $96,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018, and, in 2018, Public Storage allocated approximately $65,000 in operating expenses to us related to the management of the facilities, including payroll and overhead expenses. 
Public Storage also owns and licenses the PS Business Parks name and logo to the Company under a royalty-free license that may be terminated upon six months' notice to the Company. 
Cost Sharing and Other Arrangements with Public Storage 
Pursuant to a cost sharing and administrative services arrangement, we share certain administrative services, corporate office space, and certain other third party arrangements with Public Storage which are allocated based upon time, effort, and other methodologies. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Public Storage reimbursed us $38,000 for costs paid on their behalf, and we reimbursed Public Storage $1.2 million in costs that Public Storage incurred on our behalf. 
Common Management/Board Members with Public Storage 
Ronald L. Havner, Jr., Chairman of the Board, is also Chairman of Public Storage. Joseph D. Russell, Jr., a director, is also the President and Chief Executive Officer and a trustee of Public Storage. Gary E. Pruitt, a director, is also a trustee of Public Storage.

Proposal 3 – Ratification of independent registered public accountants 
Executive Summary 
The Board recommends that shareholders ratify the Audit Committee's selection of EY as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Accountants) for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. EY has acted as the Independent Accountants since the Company's organization in 1997. 
Ratification is not required by the Company's bylaws, but the Board believes that shareholder ratification of the appointment is good corporate governance. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment of EY, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection, but may nevertheless determine to do so. Even if the appointment of EY is ratified by the shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 
Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
The following table shows the fees billed or expected to be billed to the Company by EY for audit and other services provided for fiscal 2017 and 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit fees    $  623,000      $  615,000   
 Audit-related fees      22,000        23,000

 All Other Fees      0        0   
 Total      689,000        689,000   
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees. Audit fees represent fees for professional services provided in connection with the audit of the Company's annual financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, review of the quarterly financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and services in connection with the Company's registration statements. 
Audit related fees. Audit-related fees represent professional fees provided in connection with the audit of the Company's 401(k)/Profit Sharing Plan (the 401(k) Plan). 
Tax fees. During 2018 and 2017, all of the tax services consisted of tax compliance and consulting services. 
Auditor Independence 
The Audit Committee has determined that the Independent Accountants' provision of the non-audit services described above is compatible with maintaining the Independent Accountants' independence. 
Policy to Approve Ernst & Young LLP Services 
The Audit Committee has adopted a pre-approval policy relating to services performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that all services provided by EY to us, including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services, must be pre-approved by the Audit Committee. 
Under this policy, the Audit Committee of the Company pre-approved all services performed by EY during 2018 and 2017, including those listed in the previous table. The Chairman of the Audit Committee has the authority to grant required approvals between meetings of the Audit Committee, provided that any exercise of this authority is presented at the next committee meeting.

Proposal 3 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee's responsibilities include appointing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, pre-approving audit and non-audit services provided by the firm, and assisting the Board in providing oversight to the Company's financial reporting process. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors and management to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. 
In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee meets with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditor, and management to review the Company's accounting, auditing internal controls, and financial reporting matters. Management is responsible for the Company's financial statements, including the estimates and judgments on which they are based, for maintaining effective internal controls over financial reporting, and for assessing the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB and for issuing a report thereon. It is not the Audit Committee's responsibility to plan or conduct audits or to determine that the Company's financial statements and disclosures are complete, accurate, and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and applicable laws, rules, and regulations. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes and necessarily relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management and of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
In connection with its oversight responsibilities related to the Company's financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Audit Committee met with management and EY, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and reviewed and discussed with them the audited consolidated financial statements. 
 Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communication with Audit Committees), as modified or supplemented. The discussion included, but was not limited to, the overall scope and plans for the annual audit, the results of their audit, their evaluation of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
In addition to providing the required written disclosures and communications, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the letter confirming their independence of the Company as required by the applicable rules of the PCAOB, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of non-audit services to the Company and its affiliates is compatible with the firm's independence. 
During 2018, management documented, tested, and evaluated the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the requirements set forth in Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and SEC regulations adopted thereunder. The Audit Committee met with representatives of management, the internal auditors, legal counsel, and the independent registered public accounting firm on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss the progress of the process. At the conclusion of this process, the Audit Committee received from management its assessment and report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee received from EY its assessment of and opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. These assessments and reports are as of December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the results of management's assessment and EY's audit.

Proposal 3 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also approved the appointment of EY as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and recommended that the Board submit this appointment to the Company's shareholders for ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

Purpose of the proxy solicitation 
We are providing these proxy materials on behalf of the Board of PS Business Parks, Inc. to ask for your vote and to solicit your proxies for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting to be held on April 23, 2019, or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
These materials are available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, will be delivered to you by mail, because you were a shareholder as of March 1, 2019, the record date (the Record Date) fixed by the Board, and are therefore entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting (the Notice) and to vote on matters presented at the Annual Meeting. 
This proxy statement contains important information regarding the Annual Meeting. Specifically, it identifies the proposals on which you are being asked to vote, provides information you may find useful in deciding how to vote, and describes voting procedures. This Notice and proxy statement are first being distributed and made available on or about March 22, 2019, to holders of our common stock on the record date. A copy of our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, which includes a copy of our Form 10-K, accompanies this proxy statement. 
Date, time and place of the annual meeting 
The Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 23, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, at the Biltmore Hotel Miami-Coral Gables, 1200 Anastasia Avenue, Coral Gables, Florida 33134. 
Who can vote 
Holders of PS Business Parks Common Stock at the close of business on the Record Date may vote the shares of Common Stock they hold on that date at the Annual Meeting. For all matters submitted for vote at the Annual Meeting, each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. 
Quorum for the annual meeting 
If a majority of the shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, we will have a quorum, permitting business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, we had 27,362,101 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote. 
How votes are counted 
For the election of directors, the eight candidates who receive the most votes cast at the meeting will be elected. Shares of common stock not voted (whether by abstention or otherwise) will not affect the vote. As discussed above, the Company has adopted a policy whereby directors who do not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her election must submit their resignation to be considered by the Board. 
The number of shares cast "for" each other proposal to be voted on at the Annual Meeting must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that proposal for approval of the proposal. We will not count shares that abstain from voting. 
Although the advisory vote to approve executive compensation in Proposal 2 is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider and take into account the vote results in making future determinations on executive compensation. 
PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 61     
How proxies will be voted 
If you hold shares through a broker or nominee and do not provide the broker or nominee with specific voting instructions, under the rules that govern brokers or nominees in such circumstances, your broker or nominee will have the discretion to vote such shares on routine matters, but not on non-routine matters. As a result: 
Broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum but will otherwise have no effect on the outcome of the vote on Proposals 1 and 2. 
If you are a registered shareholder and submit a properly executed proxy card containing no instructions, the shares represented by the proxy will be voted FOR (i) each of Proposals 1, 2 and 3, and (ii) in accordance with the judgment of the proxy holders as to any other matter that may properly be brought before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof. 
How to cast a vote 
You may vote by any of the following means: 
Properly completed and submitted proxy cards and voting instruction cards, and proxies properly completed and submitted over the Internet, if received in time for voting and not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions contained therein. 
How to vote as a participant in the 401(k) Plan 
If you hold your shares as a participant in the 401(k) Plan, your proxy will serve as a voting instruction for the trustee of the 401(k) Plan with respect to the amount of shares of Common Stock credited to your account as of the record date. If you provide voting instructions via your proxy card or voting instruction card with respect to your shares of Common Stock held in the 401(k) Plan, the trustee will vote those shares of Common Stock in the manner specified. The trustee will vote any shares of Common Stock for which it does not receive instructions in the same 
    PS Business Parks• 2019 Proxy Statement• 62 
proportion as the shares of Common Stock for which voting instructions have been received, unless the trustee is required by law to exercise its discretion in voting such shares. 
To allow sufficient time for the trustee to vote your shares of Common Stock, the trustee must receive your voting instructions by 7:00 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, on April 19, 2019.

(1)   Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or "EBITDA" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net income prior to the impact of depreciation and interest expense. Management believes that EBITDA is frequently used by analysts and investors as a measure of valuation  and to assess the Company's performance over time.  
(2)   Return on assets is a non-GAAP financial measure representing the ratio of net  operating income (rental income less cost of operations, which excludes depreciation) to pre-depreciation cost of real estate facilities. Management believes that this measure is useful in evaluating the  Company's earnings relative to the associated accumulated investment over time.
