Corporate Governance 
Item 1 – Election of Directors 
Evaluation Process for Director Candidates 
The Nominating/Governance Committee considers director candidates suggested by stockholders, management or other members of the Board and may hire consultants or search firms to help identify and evaluate potential director candidates. For information regarding how stockholders can submit a director candidate for consideration by the Nominating/Governance Committee, see page 36. 
The Nominating/Governance Committee evaluates director candidates by considering their judgment, qualifications, attributes, skills, integrity, diversity, international business or other experience relevant to our global activities, and other factors it deems appropriate. The Committee looks for candidates who are leaders in the organizations with which they are affiliated and have experience in positions with a high degree of responsibility. The Committee seeks candidates free from relationships or conflicts of interest that could interfere with the director's duties to Gallagher or our stockholders. The Committee also evaluates candidates' independence and takes into account other applicable requirements for directors under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listing standards. 
Board Diversity 
The Nominating/Governance Committee seeks Board members from diverse professional backgrounds who combine a broad spectrum of experience and expertise with a reputation for integrity. The Committee implements this policy through discussions among its members and assesses its effectiveness annually as part of the Committee's and the Board's self-evaluation process. The Committee has also used a search firm on occasion to help it identify highly qualified and diverse candidates. 
Board Nominees and Vote Required 
Upon the recommendation of the Nominating/Governance Committee, the Board has nominated our Chairman and CEO and each of the eight individuals listed below to hold office until the next annual meeting and the election and qualification of their successors or, if earlier, until their resignation, death or removal. Each of the nominees currently serves on the Board and has consented to serve for a new term if elected. However, if any nominee should become unable or unwilling to serve, the Board may nominate another person to stand for election or reduce the number of directors. 
Each director nominee who receives more "FOR" votes than "AGAINST" votes at the Annual Meeting will be elected. Any incumbent director nominees who receive a greater number of votes "AGAINST" election than votes "FOR" election are required to tender their offer of resignation for consideration by the Nominating/Governance Committee in accordance with our Governance Guidelines. 
In connection with the mandatory retirement age provision of our Governance Guidelines, the Board is not nominating Elbert O. Hand for re-election to the Board. We gratefully acknowledge Mr. Hand's distinguished service as a member of the Board of Directors since 2002. 
Independent Director Qualifications 
The table below summarizes the key qualifications and areas of experience that led our Board to conclude that each independent director nominee is qualified to serve on our Board, but is not intended to be an exhaustive list of their qualifications or contributions to the Board.

Board Leadership Structure 
Pat Gallagher currently serves as Chairman of the Board and CEO. With the exception of the Chairman, all Board members are independent and actively oversee the activities of the Chairman and other members of the senior management team. We believe that our Board leadership structure allows us to take advantage of Pat Gallagher's extensive experience and knowledge of our business, which enriches the Board's decision making. Pat Gallagher's role as Chairman and CEO also enhances communication and coordination between management and the Board on critical issues. 
David Johnson was originally elected by the Board in 2016 to serve as our independent Lead Director for a two-year term and re-elected in 2018 for a second two-year term. Under our Governance Guidelines, the Lead Director may serve up to two consecutive two-year terms. The duties and responsibilities of the independent Lead Director are set forth below.

The independent directors meet regularly in executive sessions. Executive sessions are held at the beginning and at the end of each regularly scheduled in-person Board meeting. Other executive sessions may be called by the Lead Director at his discretion or at the request of the Board. The committees of the Board also meet regularly in executive sessions. Executive sessions are chaired by our independent Lead Director. The Board believes that its leadership structure as described above provides an effective framework for addressing the risks facing our company. 
Director Independence 
The Board has conducted its annual review of the independence of each director nominee under NYSE standards and the independence standards set forth in Appendix A of our Governance Guidelines (available on our website located at www.ajg.com/ir, under the heading "Corporate Governance"). Based upon its review, the Board has concluded in its business judgment that, with the exception of Pat Gallagher, all of the director nominees (Sherry S. Barrat, William L. Bax, D. John Coldman, Frank E. English, Jr., David S. Johnson, Kay W. McCurdy, Ralph J. Nicoletti, and Normal L. Rosenthal) and Elbert O. Hand, who is not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting, are independent.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Overview. The Board is responsible for oversight and monitoring of our enterprise risk management program. In carrying out this responsibility, the Board has designated the Audit Committee with primary responsibility for overseeing enterprise risk management. The other committees of the Board also oversee the management of risks within their areas of responsibilities. The Board receives periodic reports from each committee and from management on our major risks and steps undertaken to monitor and mitigate such risks. 
Audit Committee. At each regularly scheduled meeting, the Audit Committee monitors management's risk management function. It does this by discussing, among other things, guidelines and policies regarding risk assessment and risk management, our major risk exposures, including marketplace, regulatory, cybersecurity and other risks, and steps taken by management to monitor and control such exposures. Our Global Chief Compliance Officer attends each Committee meeting and reports on significant risk and compliance issues. In addition, the Committee oversees an internal audit department, the head of which reports directly to the Committee (on matters other than day-to-day operations). The internal audit department is independent from management and the Committee defines its responsibilities. Among other things, the purpose of the department is to bring a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluating and improving the effectiveness of our risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit department evaluates the effectiveness of our risk management processes, performs consulting and advisory services for us related to risk management, and reports significant risk exposures to the Committee. The Committee periodically reports to the full Board a summary of its activities and any key findings that arise from its risk oversight and monitoring functions. 
Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee reviews our overall compensation policies and practices to determine whether our program provides incentives for executive officers and other employees to take excessive risks. Based upon an analysis conducted by management and discussions between management and the Committee, the Committee has determined that our compensation policies and practices do not present risks that are likely to have a material adverse effect on us or our business. In reaching this determination, our Committee and management noted the following: (i) no single business unit bears a disproportionate share of our overall risk profile; (ii) no single business unit is significantly more profitable than the other business units; (iii) our compensation practices are substantially consistent across all business units both in the amount and types of compensation awarded; (iv) substantially all of our revenue-producing employees are sales professionals whose compensation is tied to the amount of revenue received by the company; (v) our annual cash incentive program caps payouts at 200% of target awards; and (vi) our PSUs are capped at 200% of target awards and are based on average performance over a three-year measurement period. A significant portion of our senior executives' compensation is deferred and invested in Gallagher stock through our DEPP and our senior executives own significant amounts of Gallagher stock. In addition, stock options vest on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date and restricted stock units vest on the fifth anniversary of the grant date. Based on the above, we believe that our compensation practices help ensure that no single year's results and no single corporate action has a disproportionate effect on executive officers' annual compensation, and encourage steady and consistent long-term performance by our executive officers. 
Nominating/Governance Committee. The Nominating/Governance Committee reviews risks related to our corporate governance structure and processes, including those related to succession planning for the Board and key leadership roles on the Board and its committees. The Committee also reviews related person transactions to evaluate whether our directors and executive officers have conflicts of interest that could interfere with their ability to carry out their duties to the company. 
Other Board Matters 
Attendance. The Board expects each director to attend and participate in all Board and applicable committee meetings and annual meetings of stockholders. Each director is expected to prepare for meetings in advance and to dedicate the time necessary to discharge properly his or her responsibilities at each meeting and to ensure other commitments do not materially interfere with his or her service on the Board. During 2018, the Board met seven times. All of the nominees attended 75% or more of the aggregate meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served during 2018. With the exception of Mr. Coldman, all of our Board members attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
Stockholder Communications with the Board. A stockholder or other party interested in communicating with the Board, any of its committees, the Chairman, the Lead Director, the non-management directors as a group or any director individually may do so by writing to their attention at our principal executive offices, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., c/o Corporate Secretary, 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050. 
Corporate Governance Materials. We are committed to sound and effective corporate governance. To that end, the Board has adopted Governance Guidelines that set forth principles to assist it in determining director independence and other important corporate governance matters. The Board has also adopted Global Standards of Business Conduct (the Global Standards) that apply to all directors, executive officers and employees. The Global Standards, along with our Governance Guidelines and the charters of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating/Governance Committees, are available at www.ajg.com/ir, under the heading "Corporate Governance." We will provide a copy of the Global Standards or Governance Guidelines without charge to any person who requests a copy by writing to our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements of Item 5.05 of Form 8-K regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the Global Standards by posting such information on our website.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Director Compensation 
The Board sets the amount and form of director compensation based upon recommendations made by the Nominating/Governance Committee. Pat Gallagher receives no additional compensation for his service as a director. A substantial portion of each non-employee director's total annual compensation consists of equity grants, in the form of restricted stock units. Under our stock ownership guidelines, directors with at least five years of service are expected to own an amount of our common stock with a value equal to five times the cash portion of the annual director retainer. In 2018, the annual cash retainer was $100,000. All of our directors meet these guidelines. 
On May 15, 2018, each non-employee director was granted 2,100 restricted stock units that vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant (or immediately upon a director's departure from the Board). Committee Chairs receive additional annual fees as follows: $25,000 for the Audit Committee, $20,000 for the Compensation Committee and $15,000 for the Nominating/Governance Committee. The Lead Director receives an additional annual fee of $30,000. Directors are reimbursed for travel and accommodation expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and committee meetings. 
Directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual cash retainer or restricted stock units under our Deferral Plan for Nonemployee Directors. Deferred cash retainers and restricted stock units are converted to notional stock units, which are credited with dividend equivalents when dividends are paid on our common stock. Deferred restricted stock units are distributed in the form of common stock, and deferred cash retainers and accrued dividend equivalents are distributed in cash, at a date specified by each director or upon such director's departure from the Board.

Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions 
How We Review and Approve Related Person Transactions 
We review all relationships and transactions exceeding $120,000 in which the company participates and in which any related person (our directors and executive officers or their immediate family members and any persons owning 5% or more of our common stock) had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The company's legal staff is primarily responsible for reviewing such relationships and transactions based on the facts and circumstances, and for developing and implementing processes and controls for obtaining and evaluating information about related person transactions. As required by SEC rules, we disclose in this Proxy Statement all such transactions that are determined to be directly or indirectly material to a related person. In addition, the Nominating/Governance Committee reviews and approves, ratifies or disapproves any such related person transaction. In the course of reviewing and determining whether or not to approve or ratify a disclosable related person transaction, the Committee considers the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nature of the related person's interest in the transaction  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Material transaction terms, including the amount involved  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than could have been reached with an unrelated third party   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For employment arrangements, whether compensation is commensurate with that of other employees with equivalent  qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Importance and potential benefits of the transaction to the related person and to the company  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction would impair a director or executive officer's judgment to act in the company's best  interest

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
All audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services for fiscal years 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved by the Audit Committee. It is the policy of the Audit Committee to pre-approve the engagement of Ernst & Young LLP before we engage such firm to render audit or other permitted non-audit services. The Audit Committee has adopted procedures for pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee annually pre-approves a list of specific services and categories of services, subject to a specified cost level. Part of this approval process includes making a determination as to whether permitted non-audit services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence. The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Chairman of the Audit Committee for the types of services that Ernst & Young LLP has historically been retained to perform related to integrated audit and other recurring services, subject to reporting any such approvals at the next Audit Committee meeting. 
A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if the representative so desires.

Overview of Our Executive Compensation Program 
The Compensation Committee believes that our compensation program for named executive officers is balanced and reasonable and helps us retain and motivate highly talented business leaders through a range of economic cycles. We reward performance by emphasizing a balance of short- and long-term compensation vehicles. Annual cash incentives are awarded based on achievement of financial performance measures and the Committee's assessment of individual performance. Further details on the principles and objectives of our compensation program are set forth below.

Stockholder Views 
When making determinations regarding corporate governance and executive compensation, our Board of Directors pays close attention to the views of our stockholders, including the 97.4% approval rate received for our "say on pay" proposal in 2018. In light of this strong level of support, the Compensation Committee did not make any changes to our executive compensation program as a result of the 2018 "say on pay" proposal. 
In addition, members of our management team engaged with our largest stockholders to discuss corporate governance and executive compensation matters during the year. In 2017 the Committee implemented a three-year performance period for performance share units (PSUs) based on a new performance measure, average growth in adjusted EBITDAC per share. Based in part on stockholder feedback, the Committee continues to believe that PSUs structured this way, which constitute 75% of our CEO's and the largest portion of our other named executive officers' annual equity award value, appropriately align the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders over the long term.

In 2018, the Compensation Committee determined a target long-term incentive award value (as a percentage of base salary) for each named executive officer. The Committee based this target value upon a number of factors including retention considerations, internal pay equity, our historical practices and external market data (see discussion of pay comparison groups on page 22). For our CEO and named executive officers who lead an operating division (Tom Gallagher and Scott Hudson), the target award value was allocated between PSUs and stock options. For Doug Howell and Walt Bay, who lead our financial and legal operations, respectively, the Committee allocated the target award value among PSUs, stock options and restricted stock units. PSUs make up the largest portion of each named executive officer's award due to the Committee's commitment to drive business performance and align executive interests with stockholder interests. Set forth below is the target award value and allocation between award types for each named executive officer.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Compensation Decision-Making Process 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining compensation opportunities for our named executive officers, establishing the annual total value to be transferred through our equity plans, setting thresholds, targets and maximum awards for incentive compensation, establishing performance measures and approving final award amounts. To determine compensation opportunities for our named executive officers, the Committee takes into account the compensation objectives noted earlier under Components of Compensation for Named Executive Officers, compensation data for our comparison groups, trends in the financial service and insurance brokerage sectors and the strategic value of a given role, among other factors. 
Tally Sheets 
The Compensation Committee also considers the data compiled in a tally sheet prepared by management for each named executive officer. Tally sheets provide: 
This information provides a comprehensive context in which the Committee can determine the appropriate type and amount of compensation for each named executive officer. 
Role of the CEO 
At the beginning of each year, Pat Gallagher proposes performance objectives for the company and himself. The Compensation Committee and the Board review these objectives with Mr. Gallagher and make modifications as necessary. Following this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee and the Board finalize and approve the objectives for Mr. Gallagher and the company. The objectives include both quantitative financial measurements and qualitative strategic and operational considerations that focus on factors Mr. Gallagher and the Board believe create long-term stockholder value. Mr. Gallagher reviews and discusses preliminary considerations regarding his own compensation with the Compensation Committee but does not participate in the Committee's final determination of his compensation. Mr. Gallagher also reviews the performance of each other named executive officer and presents a summary of these performance reviews to the Committee, along with preliminary recommendations regarding salary adjustments, if any, and annual award amounts. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC (Pearl Meyer) as its independent executive compensation consultant. In connection with its engagement, Pearl Meyer reviewed 2018 proxy season results and implications for our pay practices; assisted in the review and confirmation of our peer group for executive compensation and performance review purposes; provided updates on emerging executive compensation trends, including proxy advisory firm and regulatory developments; and reviewed and assessed all elements of our pay programs for executive officers, including the competitiveness of pay levels and incentive program design. The Committee assessed Pearl Meyer's independence pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules and concluded that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Pearl Meyer from serving as an independent consultant to the Committee. 
Tax Considerations 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the deductibility for Federal income tax purposes of compensation payable in a taxable year to our named executive officers to the extent that such compensation exceeds $1 million. In 2018, all of our named executive officers received compensation in excess of $1 million and, therefore, that portion of the compensation expense was non-deductible.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Comparative Market Assessment 
The Compensation Committee reviews compensation data from two different comparison groups as a market reference for its named executive officer compensation decisions. 
Proxy Comparison Group 
The Compensation Committee uses the Proxy Comparison Group as a reference point for our compensation plan structure, pay mix, general equity granting practices and individual pay levels. 
This group is focused on our direct competitors for executive talent. Its members are selected from insurance brokers and carriers and from professional and financial services companies that may compete with us for executive talent or in specific lines of business. 
The companies listed below under "Insurance Brokers" are of particular interest for the Compensation Committee. Although Aon, Marsh & McLennan and Willis Towers Watson are larger than we are on several size dimensions, the Committee believes it is important to understand their compensation programs given that they compete with us the most directly. Additionally, we are similarly-sized to the median-sized company in the broader peer group. 
The companies set forth below were used for the 2018 analysis. There were no changes to this group from the prior year.

Survey Comparison Group 
The Compensation Committee also uses a Survey Comparison Group as a reference point for individual pay levels for certain executive positions. 
This group consists of insurance and general industry companies similar to us in total assets, revenue or number of employees. In 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed pay data from two published surveys, Executive Compensation Survey conducted by Mercer and Top Management Industry Compensation Survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson. 
Results of the Comparative Market Assessment 
For 2018, the Compensation Committee examined the total direct compensation opportunity (base salary, annual cash incentives and long-term incentives) for each named executive officer, as well as each individual element of compensation. Data from the Proxy Comparison Group and Survey Comparison Group were used as a market reference for compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee does not target total compensation to a specific percentile of comparison group compensation. 
The comparative market assessment showed that total direct compensation for our named executive officer group was generally competitive with the Proxy Comparison Group. However, the assessment showed that Pat Gallagher's total direct compensation was below the median for similarly situated CEOs in the Proxy Comparison Group.

*Deferred Equity Participation Plan (DEPP) 
Deferred cash awards under the DEPP are nonqualified deferred compensation awards under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. Each named executive officer has made an irrevocable election to have such awards deemed invested in a fund representing shares of our common stock. Awards under the DEPP do not vest until participants reach age 62 (or the one-year anniversary of the date of grant for participants over the age of 61, which applies to Pat Gallagher). Accordingly, amounts in the plan are subject to forfeiture in the event of a voluntary termination of employment prior to age 62 (or the minimum one-year vesting period). Awards deemed invested in our common stock provide an incentive for our named executive officers to manage our company for earnings growth and total shareholder return. In addition, the deferred realization of these awards encourages retention of our named executive officers until a normal retirement age, and for one-year increments after such age.

The Supplemental Plan allows certain highly compensated employees (those with compensation greater than an amount set annually by the IRS) to defer up to 80% of their base salary and annual cash incentive payment. We match any deferrals of salary and annual cash incentive payments on a dollar-for-dollar basis up to the lesser of (i) the amount deferred or (ii) 5% of the employee's regular earnings minus the maximum contribution that we could have matched under the 401(k) Plan. All such cash deferrals and match amounts may be deemed invested, at the employee's election, in a number of investment options that include various mutual funds, an annuity product and a fund representing our common stock. Such employees may also defer restricted stock units and PSUs, but these deferrals are not subject to company matching. Amounts held in the Supplemental Plan accounts are payable as of the employee's termination of employment, or at such other time as the employee elects in advance of the deferral, subject to certain exceptions set forth in IRS regulations. 
***401(k) Match 
Under our 401(k) Savings and Thrift Plan (401(k) Plan), a tax qualified retirement savings plan, participating employees, including our named executive officers, may contribute up to 75% of their earnings on a before-tax or after-tax basis into their 401(k) Plan accounts, subject to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under the 401(k) Plan, we match an amount equal to one dollar for every dollar an employee contributes on the first 5% of his or her regular earnings. The 401(k) Plan has other standard terms and conditions.

We maintain the Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Employees' Pension Plan (the Pension Plan) which is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code and which historically covered substantially all domestic employees. In 2005, we amended the Pension Plan to freeze the accrual of future benefits for all domestic employees effective July 1, 2005. Benefits under the Pension Plan are based upon the employee's

highest average annual earnings for a five calendar-year period with us and are payable after retirement in the form of an annuity or a lump sum. The maximum amount of annual earnings that may be considered in calculating benefits under the Pension Plan is $210,000 (the maximum amount of annual earnings allowable by law in 2005, the last year that benefits accrued under the Pension Plan). 
Benefits under the Pension Plan are calculated as an annuity equal to 1% of the participant's highest annual average earnings multiplied by years of service, and commencing upon the participant's retirement on or after age 65. The maximum benefit under the pension plan upon retirement would be $53,318 per year, payable at age 65 in accordance with IRS regulations. Participants also may elect to commence their pensions anytime on or after attaining age 55 if they retire prior to age 65, with an actuarial reduction to reflect the earlier commencement date, ranging from 54% at age 55 to no reduction at age 65. All of our named executive officers with accumulated benefits under the plan are eligible to take this early retirement option. For additional information on the valuation assumptions with respect to pensions, refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
2018 Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control 
Change-in-Control Agreements 
We provide our named executive officers with change-in-control agreements, which we believe are an important part of their overall compensation. In addition to helping secure their continued dedication to stockholder interests prior to or following a change in control, the Compensation Committee also believes these agreements are important for recruitment and retention, as all or nearly all of our competitors for talent have similar agreements in place for their senior employees. In general, compensation levels under these agreements are separate and unrelated to named executive officers' overall compensation decisions for a given year. 
Double Trigger 
Each named executive officer's change-in-control agreement provides for payments if there is a "Termination" of the individual within 24 months after a "Change in Control" (commonly referred to in combination as a "double trigger"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Change in Control occurs (i) if a person or group is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or  indirectly, of our securities representing 50% or more of the voting power to elect directors, (ii) if there is a change in the composition of the Board such that within a period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of  such two-year period constitute the Board and any new directors elected or nominated by at least two-thirds of the directors who were either directors at the beginning  of the two-year period or were so elected or nominated, cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board, or (iii) our stockholders approve the sale of all or substantially all of our  assets or any merger, consolidation, issuance of securities or purchase of assets, the result of which would be the occurrence of any event described in (i) or (ii) above. A substantially similar change-in-control definition is used under our equity plans, the DEPP and the Supplemental Plan, except that our equity plans and the DEPP do not include subsection (iii) above.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Termination means either (i) a termination of employment by us for any reason other than death, physical or  mental incapacity or "cause" (defined as gross misconduct or willful and material breach of the change-in-control agreement) or (ii) resignation upon the  occurrence of (1) a material change in the nature or scope of the individual's authorities, powers, functions or duties, (2) a reduction in total compensation, (3) any relocation of the individual's principal place of  employment more than 35 miles from his or her location prior to the Change in Control, (4) a breach of the change-in-control agreement by us or (5) a good  faith determination by the individual that as a result of the Change in Control, his or her position is materially affected.  
[END TABLE]
Payments upon Double Trigger 
Under the change-in-control agreements, each named executive officer subject to Termination within 24 months after a Change in Control is entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Severance – two-times salary, bonus  and annual cash incentive. A lump sum severance payment equal to salary, bonus and annual cash incentive compensation payments for a 24-month period on the basis of a salary rate not less than his annual  salary prior to the termination, or if greater, the salary at the time of the Change in Control and the bonus and annual cash incentive payment prior to termination or, if greater, the bonus and annual cash incentive payment prior to the Change in  Control. The severance payment would be made in a lump sum not more than seven days after the date of termination.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No new excise tax gross-up payments. Our change-in-control agreements entered into prior to 2008 provide that the named executive officer would be eligible to receive an excise tax "gross-up" payment  as defined in Sections 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, relating to so-called "excess parachute payments." However, our change-in-control agreements entered into after 2008 do not contain excise tax gross-ups, and it is our policy not to enter into new change-in-control agreements that contain excise tax gross-ups, or amend existing  change-in-control agreements without removing these provisions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Participation in benefit plans. The  change-in-control agreements also provide for continued participation in welfare benefit plans, including medical, dental, life and disability insurance, on the same  basis and at the same cost as prior to the Termination, for the shorter of a two-year period or until the individual becomes covered by a different plan with coverage or benefits equal to or greater than the  plan provided by us. The agreements also provide for the payment of any unpaid salary and a lump sum cash payment for accumulated but unused vacation.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
Other Termination and Change-in-Control Payments 
The table below shows potential incremental payments, benefits and equity award accelerations upon termination of our named executive officers. The amounts are determined under existing agreements and plans for various termination scenarios. The amounts assume that the trigger events for all such payments occurred on December 31, 2018 and use the closing price of our common stock on that date of $63.28. The amounts in the table below do not include the amount of pension or deferred compensation our named executive officers would receive under each termination scenario because these amounts are reflected in the 2018 Pension Benefits and 2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation tables presented above. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options. All of our named executive officers have outstanding stock options, which they are eligible to  exercise upon termination of employment. If they are terminated for cause they are eligible to exercise all options that are vested at the time of termination, subject to the restrictive covenant and clawback provisions in their award agreements.  Upon a voluntary resignation or termination without cause, (1) they may exercise or retain through their original expiration date all nonqualified stock options granted before 2013 that have vested as of the date of termination (i.e., stock  options granted in 2012, which expire in 2019), and (2) because our named executive officers have all reached the age of 55, nonqualified stock options that were granted in 2013 or later are no longer subject to forfeiture if their departure  from the company is at least two years after the date of grant. If a named executive officer is terminated due to death or disability, all stock options vest and remain outstanding through their original expiration date. If there is a change in  control, all stock options granted prior to the approval of our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan vest immediately and may be exercised through their original expiration date. For stock options granted after the approval of our 2017 Long-Term Incentive  Plan, accelerated vesting at a change in control requires Board approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock units. Doug Howell, Scott Hudson and Walt Bay have outstanding restricted stock units. Upon a  termination for cause, all unvested restricted stock units would lapse. Because they have reached the age of 55, upon a voluntary resignation or termination without cause, their restricted stock units are not subject to forfeiture if their departure  from the company is at least two years after the date of grant, although vesting and distribution will still occur in accordance with the original schedule. If they terminate because of death or disability the awards immediately vest. If there is a  change in control, all restricted stock units granted prior to the approval of our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan vest immediately. For restricted stock units granted after the approval of our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, accelerated vesting at a  change in control requires Board approval.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs. All of our named executive officers have outstanding PSUs. Upon a termination for cause, all unvested PSUs  would lapse. Because our named executive officers have all reached the age of 55, upon a voluntary resignation or termination without cause, the earned portion of PSUs are not subject to forfeiture if their departure from the company is at least two  years after the date of grant, although vesting and distribution will still occur in accordance with the original schedule. If there is a change in control, all earned PSUs granted prior to the approval of our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan vest  immediately and the performance conditions for unearned PSUs are deemed satisfied at target levels or, if greater, on a pro rata basis based on actual achievement as of the date of the change in control. For PSUs granted after the approval of  our 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, Board approval is required at a change in control both for accelerated vesting and for the deemed satisfaction of performance conditions described in the prior sentence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• DEPP. All of our named executive officers participate in the DEPP. Amounts in this plan vest on the earliest to  occur of (1) the date the participant turns 62 (or the one-year anniversary of the date of grant for participants over 61), (2) death, (3) termination of employment because of disability,  (4) termination in a manner that grants the person severance pay under our Severance Plan (filed as an exhibit to our Exchange Act filings) and (5) a change in control. Accordingly, vesting would accelerate under all of the termination  scenarios other than a voluntary resignation or a termination for cause.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination for Cause. Where applicable, termination "for cause" under our plans generally means a  termination of employment based upon the good faith determination of the company that one or more of the following events has occurred: (i) the participant has committed a dishonest or fraudulent act to the material detriment of the company;  (ii) the participant has been convicted (or pleaded guilty or nolo contendere) for a crime involving moral turpitude or for any felony; (iii) material and persistent insubordination on the part of the participant; (iv) the loss  by the participant, for any reason, of any license or professional registration without the company's written consent; (v) the diversion by the participant of any business or business opportunity of the company for the benefit of any party  other than the company; (vi) material violation of the company's Global Standards of Business Conduct by the participant; or (vii) the participant has engaged in illegal conduct, embezzlement or fraud with respect to the assets,  business or affairs of the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Liberal Change-in-Control  Definitions in Equity Plans or DEPP. None of our equity plans or the DEPP has a "liberal" change-in-control definition (i.e., they do not provide for  buyout thresholds lower than 50%, and a change in control is deemed to occur upon completion, rather than stockholder approval, of a transaction).

Item 3 – Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement. This proposal, commonly known as "say-on-pay", gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our named executive officers. Our stockholders are given the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on say-on-pay proposals annually. Our stockholders will have the next opportunity to vote on such a proposal at the 2020 Annual Meeting. 
We believe that our compensation program for named executive officers is structured in the best manner possible to support our company and business objectives, as well as to support our culture and traditions developed since our founding in 1927. We believe our program strikes the appropriate balance between using responsible, measured pay practices and effectively motivating our executives to dedicate themselves fully to value creation for our stockholders. 
We encourage you to read our Compensation Discussion and Analysis on pages 15 to 22 of this Proxy Statement and our Executive Compensation tables on pages 24 to 33. 
Resolution and Recommendation 
The Board strongly endorses the company's compensation program for named executive officers and recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation of the named executive officers of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the executive compensation tables and the related narrative in this Proxy Statement, is hereby APPROVED. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the ratio of the annual total compensation of Pat Gallagher, our CEO, to the annual total compensation of the median compensated of all our other employees who were employed as of December 31, 2018. For 2018, Pat Gallagher's total compensation was $8,062,954 and the annual total compensation of our median compensated employee was $64,495. The ratio between these two amounts was 125 to 1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) and the methodology described below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
As of December 31, 2018, our total employee population consisted of approximately 31,052 employees. As permitted by the rule, we excluded approximately 799 non-U.S. employees, or less than 3% of our total U.S. and non-U.S. employee population, from the following non-U.S. jurisdictions: Colombia (137), Guernsey (108), Chile (82), Peru (75), Jersey (71), Jamaica (53), Barbados (48), Sweden (41), Singapore (32), Bermuda (32), Gibraltar (27), Isle of Man (21), Cayman Islands (19), Norway (17), Malta (11), Saint Lucia (11), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (5), Dominica (3), Grenada (2), Antigua and Barbuda (2), and Saint Kitts and Nevis (2). We also excluded approximately 1,284 employees of the businesses we acquired during 2018, which are identified in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. After giving effect to these two adjustments, our employee population consisted of approximately 28,969 individuals. 
We used 2018 gross taxable income as set forth in our payroll data to determine our "median employee," which we annualized for all permanent employees who did not work for the entire year. Once identified, we calculated the annual total compensation of our "median employee" for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the 2018 Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.

Questions & Answers About the Annual Meeting 
What is the quorum requirement for holding the Annual Meeting? 
The holders of a majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at a meeting of the stockholders, present in person or deemed to be present or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for purposes of any Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum at this Annual Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the Annual Meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person, deemed to be present or represented by proxy, shall have the power to adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present, deemed to be present or represented. 
What are broker non-votes? 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held in the name of a broker, trustee or other nominee and do not provide that broker, trustee or other nominee with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Generally, broker non-votes occur on a matter when a broker is not permitted to vote on that matter without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given. Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers, trustees or other nominees may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. Only the ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor is considered a routine matter. The other proposals are not considered routine matters, and without your instructions, your broker cannot vote your shares. 
Will any matters other than those identified in this Proxy Statement be decided at the Annual Meeting? 
As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we are not aware of any matters to be raised at the Annual Meeting other than those described in this Proxy Statement. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting for consideration, the people named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote your proxy on those matters in their discretion. If any of our nominees are not available as a candidate for director, the proxy holders will vote your proxy for any other candidate the Board may nominate or the Board may choose to decrease the size of the Board. 
Who can vote, and how do I vote? 
Only holders of our common stock at the close of business on the record date of March 20, 2019 are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. We have no other outstanding securities entitled to vote, and there are no cumulative voting rights for the election of directors. At the close of business on the record date, we had 185,224,733 shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. Each holder of our common stock on that date will be entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting. 
"Record holders" may vote (1) by completing and returning a proxy card, (2) on the Internet, or (3) using a toll-free telephone number. Please see the proxy card for specific instructions on how to vote using one of these methods. The telephone and Internet voting facilities for record holders will close at 11:59 p.m. 
 Eastern Daylight Time on May 13, 2019. "Beneficial owners" will receive instructions from their broker or other intermediary describing the procedures and options for voting. 
What is the voting standard and the treatment of abstentions and broker non-votes for each item on the proxy card? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Voting Item   Voting Standard   Treatment  of Abstentions & Broker Non-Votes 
 Election of directors (Item 1)     Majority of votes cast    Not counted as votes cast and therefore no effect 
 Election of directors (Item 1)     Majority of votes cast    Not counted as votes cast and therefore no effect

 Say-on-pay  (Item 3)     Majority of stock having voting power and present    Abstentions treated as votes against. Broker non-votes have no effect 
[END TABLE]
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the "record holder" of those shares. If, on the other hand, your shares are held in a brokerage account or by a bank or other intermediary, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name, and a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Internet Availability Notice) was forwarded to you automatically from your broker or other intermediary. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct your broker or other intermediary to vote your shares in accordance with your wishes. You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. Because a beneficial owner is not the record holder, you may not vote your shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a "legal proxy" from your broker or other intermediary. Your broker or other intermediary has provided you with an explanation of how to instruct it regarding the voting of your shares. If you do not provide your broker or other intermediary with voting instructions, your broker or other intermediary will not be allowed to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting for any matter other than ratification of the appointment of our independent auditor. 
If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. If you are a record holder and sign the proxy card without giving specific instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board (FOR all of our nominees to the Board, FOR ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm, and FOR the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers). 
What is "householding"? 
Householding is a procedure approved by the SEC whereby multiple stockholders of record who share the same last name and address will receive only one Internet Availability Notice or one

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
set of proxy materials. Each stockholder of record will continue to receive a separate proxy card. We have undertaken householding to reduce printing costs and postage fees. A stockholder must affirmatively consent to householding. Record holders who wish to begin or discontinue householding may contact Broadridge Investor Communication Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) by calling 1-800-542-1061, or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717. Broadridge will undertake the necessary steps to continue or discontinue householding upon such request of a record holder. Beneficial owners who wish to begin or discontinue householding should contact their broker or other intermediary. You can also request prompt delivery of a copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report by contacting our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050 (telephone number: 630-773-3800). 
What should I do if I receive more than one Internet Availability Notice or proxy card? 
If you own some shares of common stock directly as a record holder and other shares indirectly as a beneficial owner, or if you own shares of common stock through more than one broker or other intermediary, you may receive multiple Internet Availability Notices or, if you request proxy materials to be delivered to you by mail, you may receive multiple proxy cards. It is necessary for you to vote, sign and return all of the proxy cards or follow the instructions for any alternative voting procedure on each of the Internet Availability Notices you receive in order to vote all of the shares you own. If you request proxy materials to be delivered to you by mail, each proxy card you receive will come with its own prepaid return envelope. If you vote by mail, please make sure you return each proxy card in the return envelope that accompanied the proxy card. 
May I change my vote after I return my proxy? 
Yes. If you are a record holder, even after you have submitted your proxy, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by delivering a written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050. You may also revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time by timely mailing a proxy card that is properly signed and dated with a later date than your previous vote, by casting a later dated proxy via the Internet or telephone, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, you must contact the holder of record to revoke a previously authorized proxy. Beneficial owners must have a "legal proxy" from their broker to vote in person at the Annual Meeting. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy. 
Who will pay the costs of soliciting these proxies? 
We will pay the costs of soliciting proxies to be voted at the Annual Meeting. After the Internet Availability Notices are initially distributed, we and our agents may also solicit proxies by mail, electronic mail, telephone or in person. We will also reimburse brokers and other intermediaries for their expenses in sending Internet Availability Notices to beneficial owners. In addition, we have hired Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Ave., Stamford, CT 06902, to assist us in soliciting proxies, for which we will pay a fee of $10,000 plus their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
What is the deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal to be included in the 2020 Proxy Statement? 
The deadline for submitting a stockholder proposal to be included in our Proxy Statement and proxy card for the 2020 Annual Meeting is close of business on or before November 23, 2019. Such proposals must comply with the requirements of Rule 
14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), regarding stockholder proposals to be included in company-sponsored proxy materials. Proposals should be addressed to our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050. 
How do I submit a proposal regarding a director nomination or other item of business to be presented directly at the 2020 Annual Meeting? 
Under our by-laws, notice of any matter that is not submitted for inclusion in our Proxy Statement and proxy card for the 2020 Annual Meeting under Rule 14a-8, but that a stockholder instead wishes to present directly at the Annual Meeting, including director nominations and other items of business, must be delivered to our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050, not later than the close of business on February 14, 2020 and not earlier than the close of business on January 15, 2020. If the date of the Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after May 14, 2020, notice of any such matter must be delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to the 2020 Annual Meeting or the 10th day following the date the 2020 Annual Meeting date is publicly announced. For these purposes, "close of business" means 5:00 p.m. CDT. We will not entertain any nominations or other items of business at the 2020 Annual Meeting that do not meet the requirements in our by-laws. If we do not receive notice of a matter by February 14, 2020 (or the applicable deadline if the 2020 Annual Meeting is more than 30 days before or after May 14, 2020), SEC rules permit the people named as proxy holders on the proxy card to vote proxies in their discretion when and if the matter is raised at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Any stockholder proposal relating to a director nomination should set forth all information relating to such person required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for contested director elections under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, including, among other things, the particular experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of the nominee that, in light of our business and structure, led to the stockholder's conclusion that the nominee should serve on the Board. The proposal should also include the director nominee's written consent to be named in our Proxy Statement as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected. Stockholders are also advised to review our by-laws, which contain additional disclosure and other requirements regarding the information to be included in the advance notices of stockholder proposals and director nominations. 
How do I recommend a proposed director nominee to the Board for consideration? 
Any stockholder who wishes to propose director nominees for consideration by the Board's Nominating/Governance Committee, but does not wish to present such proposal at an annual meeting, may do so at any time by directing a description of each nominee's name and qualifications for Board membership to the Chair of the Nominating/Governance Committee, c/o our Corporate Secretary at 2850 Golf Road, Rolling Meadows, Illinois 60008-4050. The recommendation should contain all of the information regarding the nominee described in the question and answer above and in our by-laws relating to director nominations brought before an annual meeting. The Nominating/Governance Committee evaluates nominee proposals submitted by stockholders in the same manner in which it evaluates other nominees. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
An automated system administered by Broadridge will tabulate the votes. Voting results will be reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K that we will file with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

Exhibit A: Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures 
For 2018, the executive compensation performance measures used by the Compensation Committee were adjusted EBITDAC, adjusted EBITDAC per share, and adjusted revenue, in each case for our combined brokerage and risk management segments. The Committee believes that these measures align with the key components of our long-term strategy and drive our long-term stock price performance. Please see page 18 in the body of this Proxy Statement for detailed information regarding these measures. In the context of 2018 compensation decisions, the Committee also considered our adjusted EBITDAC margin and organic revenue performance. For these measures, definitions and GAAP reconciliations are set forth below. 
The measures discussed below are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, the GAAP information provided in this Proxy Statement. We believe that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to Gallagher's results of operations and financial condition. Our industry peers may provide similar supplemental non-GAAP information related to adjusted EBITDAC margin and organic revenues, although they may not use the same or comparable terminology and may not make identical adjustments. The non-GAAP information we provide should be used in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the GAAP information provided in this Proxy Statement. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts in order to conform them to the current year presentation. 
Adjusted EBITDAC Margin – adjusted EBITDAC margin is presented to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of items that have a high degree of variability. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EBITDAC – We define this measure as net earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation,  amortization and the change in estimated acquisition earnout payables.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDAC – We define this measure as EBITDAC adjusted to exclude net gains realized from  sales of books of business, acquisition integration costs for large acquisitions, workforce related charges, lease termination related charges, acquisition-related adjustments and the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation, as  applicable. The amounts excluded with respect to foreign currency translation are calculated by applying current year foreign exchange rates to the same periods in the prior year. Please note that "adjusted EBITDAC" as defined on  page 18 in the context of annual cash incentives and performance share units is the same as this definition, except that it does not exclude acquisition integration costs and other acquisition-related adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDAC margin – We define this measure as adjusted EBITDAC divided by total adjusted  revenues (see table on the next page).  
[END TABLE]
Organic Revenues – For the brokerage segment, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the first twelve months of such revenues generated from acquisitions and such revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. These revenues are excluded from organic revenues in order to help interested persons analyze the revenue growth associated with the operations that were a part of Gallagher in both the current and prior year. In addition, organic change in base commission and fee revenues, supplemental revenues and contingent revenues exclude the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation. For the risk management segment, organic change in fee revenues excludes the first twelve months of fee revenues generated from acquisitions and the fee revenues related to operations disposed of in each year presented. In addition, change in organic growth excludes the period-over-period impact of foreign currency translation to improve the comparability of our results between periods by eliminating the impact of the items that have a high degree of variability or are due to the limited-time nature of these revenue sources. 
These revenue items are excluded from organic revenues in order to determine a comparable, but non-GAAP, measurement of revenue growth that is associated with the revenue sources that are expected to continue in the current year and beyond. We have historically viewed organic revenue growth as an important indicator when assessing and evaluating the performance of our brokerage and risk management segments. We also believe that using this non-GAAP measure allows readers of our financial statements to measure, analyze and compare the growth from our brokerage and risk management segments in a meaningful and consistent manner.
