Information on how to vote in person at the Annual Meeting is discussed below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What happens if the meeting is postponed or adjourned?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Your proxy may be voted at the postponed or adjourned meeting. You will still be able to change your proxy  until it is voted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If your shares are registered directly in your name, you may vote:  
[END TABLE]
(1) Over the Internet: Go to the website of our tabulator, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge"), at www.proxyvote.com. Use the vote control number printed on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to access your account and vote your shares. You must specify how you want your shares voted or your internet vote cannot be completed, and you will receive an error message. Your shares will be voted according to your instructions. You must submit your internet proxy before 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on May 6, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting, for your proxy to be valid and your vote to count. 
(2) By Telephone: Call 1-800-690-6903, toll free from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, and follow the recorded instructions. You must specify how you want your shares voted and confirm your vote at the end of the call or your telephone vote cannot be completed. Your shares will be voted according to your instructions. You must submit your telephonic proxy before 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on May 6, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting, for your proxy to be valid and your vote to count. 
(3) By Mail: If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials, complete and sign your enclosed proxy card and mail it in the enclosed postage prepaid envelope to Broadridge. Your shares will be voted according to your instructions. Broadridge must receive the proxy card not later than May 6, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting, for your proxy to be valid and your vote to count. 
If you do not specify how you want your shares voted, they will be voted as recommended by our Board of Directors.  (4) In Person at the Annual Meeting: If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may deliver your completed proxy card in person or you may vote by completing a ballot, which we will provide to you at the Annual Meeting. 
If your shares are held in "street name," meaning they are held for your account by a broker or other nominee, you may vote: 
(1) Over the Internet or by Telephone: You will receive instructions from your broker or other nominee if they permit internet or telephonic voting. You should follow those instructions. 
(2) By Mail: You will receive instructions from your broker or other nominee explaining how you can vote your shares by mail. You should follow those instructions. 
(3) In Person at the Annual Meeting: You may contact your broker or other nominee who holds your shares to obtain a broker's proxy and bring it with you to the Annual Meeting. A broker's proxy is not the form of proxy enclosed with this Proxy Statement. You will not be able to vote shares you hold in street name in person at the Annual Meeting unless you have a proxy from your broker or other nominee issued in your name giving you the right to vote your shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If your shares are registered directly in your name, you may revoke your proxy and change your vote  before or at the Annual Meeting. To do so, you must do one of the following:  
[END TABLE]
(1) Vote over the internet or by telephone as instructed above. Only your latest internet or telephone vote is counted. You may not change your vote over the internet or by telephone after 11:59 p.m., eastern time, on May 6, 2019. 
(2) Sign a new proxy and submit it by mail as instructed above. Only your latest dated proxy that was received by Broadridge by May 6, 2019 will be counted. 
(3) Attend the Annual Meeting, request that your proxy be revoked and vote in person as instructed above. Attending the Annual Meeting will not revoke your internet vote, telephone vote or proxy, as the case may be, unless you specifically request it.  
If your shares are held in street name, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker or other nominee. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you obtain a broker's proxy as described in the answer above. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Will my shares be voted if I do not return my proxy?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  If your shares are registered directly in your name, your shares will not be voted if you do not vote  over the internet, by telephone, by returning your proxy or by ballot at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If your shares are held in street name, your broker or other nominee may, under certain circumstances, vote your shares if you do not timely return your proxy. Brokers and other nominees can vote their customers' unvoted shares on discretionary matters but cannot vote such shares on non-discretionary matters. If you do not timely return a proxy to your broker or other nominee to vote your shares, your broker or other nominee may, on discretionary matters, either vote your shares or leave your shares unvoted. 
The election of directors (Proposal 1) and the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (Proposal 3) are non-discretionary matters. The ratification of the appointment of our independent auditors (Proposal 2) is a discretionary matter. 
We encourage you to provide voting instructions to your broker or other nominee. This ensures that your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting according to your instructions.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Shares representing a majority of the votes applicable to all of our shares of common stock issued and  outstanding and entitled to vote must be present to hold the Annual Meeting and conduct business. This is called a quorum. For purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, we count as present any shares that are voted over the internet, by  telephone or by completion and submission of a proxy or that are represented in person at the Annual Meeting. Further, for purposes of establishing a quorum, we will count as present shares that a stockholder holds even if the stockholder votes to  withhold or abstain or votes on only one of the proposals. In addition, we will count as present shares held in street name by brokers or other nominees that indicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote those shares on Proposals  1 and 3. If a quorum is not present, we expect to adjourn the Annual Meeting until we obtain a quorum.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What vote is required to approve each proposal and how are votes counted?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Proposal 1 – Election of Three Class II Directors  
[END TABLE]
The three nominees for Class II director receiving the highest number of votes FOR election will be elected as directors. This is called a plurality. Proposal 1 is a non-discretionary matter. Therefore, if your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, your broker or other nominee cannot vote your shares on Proposal 1. Shares held in street name by brokers or nominees who indicate on their proxies that they do not have authority to vote the shares on Proposal 1 will not be counted as votes FOR or WITHHELD from any nominee and will be treated as "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 1. With respect to Proposal 1, you may: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR all nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• vote FOR any nominee(s) and WITHHOLD your vote from the other nominee(s); or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• WITHHOLD your vote from all nominees.  
[END TABLE]
Votes that are withheld will not be included in the vote tally for the election of directors and will not affect the results of the vote. 
Proposal 2 – Ratification of Appointment of Independent Auditors 
To approve Proposal 2, stockholders holding a majority of the votes cast on the matter must vote FOR the proposal. Proposal 2 is a discretionary matter. Therefore, if your shares are held in street name and you do not instruct your broker or other nominee how to vote your shares, your broker or other nominee may vote your shares on Proposal 2. If you vote to ABSTAIN on Proposal 2, your shares will not be voted FOR or AGAINST the proposal and will also not be counted as votes cast or shares voting on the proposal. Voting to ABSTAIN will have no effect on the voting on Proposal 2. 
Although stockholder approval of our Audit Committee's appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 is not required, we believe that it is advisable to give stockholders an opportunity to ratify this appointment. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote will not overrule any decision by us or our Board of Directors (or any committee thereof). However, if this proposal is not approved at the Annual Meeting, our Audit Committee may reconsider its appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
Proposal 3 – Non-Binding Advisory Vote on the Frequency of Future Advisory Votes on the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
Votes on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers are non-binding, and, as described in more detail in Proposal 3, our Board of Directors may decide that it is in   the best interest of our stockholders and the Company to hold future executive compensation advisory votes more or less frequently. However, our Board of Directors will review and consider the outcome of this vote when making determinations as to when we will submit the advisory vote on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers to stockholders for approval. The frequency option receiving the greatest number of votes cast (every year, once every two years, or once every three years) will be the frequency option that stockholders approve. Proposal 3 is a non-discretionary matter. Therefore, voting to ABSTAIN and broker non-votes do not constitute a vote for any of the three frequency options. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote your shares:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the nominees for election as director listed in Proposal 1;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered  public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" the approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of holding  future advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  How many votes do I have?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  On each matter to be voted upon, you have one vote for each share of Class A common stock and ten  votes for each share of Class B common stock you owned as of March 13, 2019. The Class A common stock and Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all proposals described in this Proxy Statement.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Are there other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  We do not know of any matters that may come before the Annual Meeting other than the election of three  Class II directors, the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm and the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes to approve the  compensation of our Named Executive Officers. If any other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy will vote, and otherwise act, in accordance with their judgment on the matter.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Is my vote confidential?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  Proxy instructions, ballots, and voting tabulations that identify individual stockholders are handled in  a manner that protects your voting privacy. Your vote will not be disclosed either within CarGurus or to third parties, except as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, or  to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  Where can I find the voting results?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  We will report the voting results in a Current Report on Form  8-K within four business days following the adjournment of the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q.  What are the costs of soliciting these proxies?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A.  We will bear all expenses of this solicitation, including the cost of preparing and mailing these proxy  materials. Directors, officers and employees of CarGurus may also solicit proxies in person or by other means of communication. Such directors, officers and employees will not be additionally compensated but may be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection with such solicitation. We may

Q.  Who may I contact if I have any additional questions?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board of Directors determined that each of Ms. Hickok and Messrs. Conine, Kaufer, Parafestas and Schwartz does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under the applicable Nasdaq listing requirements and rules. In making these determinations, our Board of Directors considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including each non-employee director's direct and beneficial ownership of our capital stock and the transactions involving them described in the section titled "Related Person Transactions." In particular, our Board of Directors considered the professional relationship between Mr. Parafestas and Mr. Steinert whereby Mr. Parafestas provides tax and investment services to Mr. Steinert and his family members in his and their individual capacities, as well as Mr. Parafestas' direct and beneficial ownership of our capital stock, but determined that such relationship and ownership do not affect Mr. Parafestas' independence with respect to his service on our Board of Directors, Compensation Committee or Audit Committee. 
Because Mr. Steinert controls a majority of our outstanding combined voting power, we are a "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Under these rules, a company is a controlled company if more than 50% of the combined voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company. A controlled company may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the compensation committee be composed entirely of directors meeting Nasdaq independence standards applicable to  compensation committee members with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the compensation committee be responsible for the hiring and overseeing of persons acting as compensation  consultants and be required to consider certain independence factors when engaging such persons; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• director nominees either be selected, or recommended for selection by the board of directors, either by  "independent directors," as defined under Nasdaq rules, constituting a majority of the independent directors of the board of directors in a vote in which only independent directors participate, or by a nominating committee comprised solely  of independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
We have availed, and intend to continue to avail, ourselves of certain of these exemptions and, for so long as we qualify as a controlled company, we will maintain the option to utilize from time to time some or all of these exemptions. For example, our Compensation Committee does not consist entirely of independent directors, we do not have a nominating committee, and our director nominees are not selected (or recommended for selection by our Board of Directors) in a vote in which only independent directors participate. 
Our Class B common stock has ten votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Primarily by virtue of his holdings in shares of our Class B common stock, Mr. Steinert is able to exercise voting   rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes. The conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares. In particular, if Mr. Steinert retains a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock. 
Director Nomination Process 
As a controlled company, we do not use solely independent directors or a committee comprised solely of independent directors to evaluate director candidates and select or recommend director nominees for selection by the Board of Directors. The process followed by our Board of Directors to identify and evaluate director candidates may include requests to members of the Board of Directors and others for recommendations, meetings from time to time to evaluate biographical information and background material relating to potential candidates, and interviews of selected candidates by members of the Board of Directors. 
Criteria and Diversity 
In considering whether to recommend any particular candidate for inclusion in the slate of recommended director nominees for the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors applies certain criteria as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include the candidate's business experience and skills, independence, character, wisdom, judgment, integrity, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, understanding of our business environment, the ability to commit sufficient time and attention to board activities, and the absence of potential conflicts with our interests. The Board of Directors does not assign specific weights to particular criteria and no particular criterion is a prerequisite for any prospective nominee. 
Our Board of Directors recognizes its responsibility to ensure that nominees for our Board of Directors possess appropriate qualifications and reflect a reasonable diversity of personal and professional experience, skills, backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that the backgrounds and qualifications of our directors, considered as a group, should provide a composite mix of experience, knowledge and abilities that will allow our Board of Directors to promote our strategic objectives and to fulfill its responsibilities to our stockholders. 
While our Board of Directors does not have a formal policy with respect to diversity, our Board of Directors is committed to a policy of inclusiveness and will take reasonable steps to ensure that women and minority candidates are considered for the pool of candidates from which our director nominees are chosen and will endeavor to include candidates from non-traditional venues. Consistent with this philosophy, during 2018 Ms. Hickok joined our Board of Directors, including in a leadership role as Chair of our Audit Committee. 
The director biographies on pages 9–12 indicate each director's experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led the Board of Directors to conclude that each director should continue to serve as a member of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors believes that each director has had substantial achievement in his or her professional and personal pursuits and possesses the background, talents and experience that our Board of Directors desires and that will contribute to the best interests of our company and to long-term stockholder value. 
Board of Directors Meetings and Attendance 
Our Board of Directors met five times during 2018 and acted by written consent on five occasions. During 2018, each of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of the meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees on which they served. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that our directors are invited and encouraged to attend our annual meeting of stockholders. Five of the six members of our Board of Directors serving at the time of our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended such meeting.  Board of Directors Leadership Structure 
Mr. Steinert is our Chairman. Mr. Steinert has authority, among other things, to call and preside over meetings of our Board of Directors and set meeting agendas. As a result of Mr. Steinert's extensive history with and knowledge of CarGurus, he is able to provide valuable insight and help ensure that the Board of Directors and management act with a common purpose. If Mr. Steinert is ever not present at a meeting of the Board of Directors, an independent director is appointed to chair such meetings. 
We have a Chair for each committee of our Board of Directors. The Chair of each committee is expected to report annually to our Board of Directors on the activities of his or her committee. Our Board of Directors delegates substantial responsibilities to the committees, which report their activities and actions back to the full Board of Directors. We believe our board and committee leadership structure provides an appropriate allocation of roles and responsibilities for our company at this time because it strikes an effective balance of the participation of management and independent leadership in the proceedings of our Board of Directors. 
Executive Sessions 
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our non-management directors are required to meet in executive session at least semi-annually to discuss, among other matters, the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. The director who presides at these meetings is a non-management director selected by a majority of the non-management directors. In general, these executive sessions are held on the same date as regularly scheduled meetings of the Board of Directors. 
Board of Directors Committees 
Our Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee, each of which operates pursuant to a Charter adopted by our Board of Directors. The composition and functioning of our committees comply with all applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules and regulations of Nasdaq and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including those related to our status as a "controlled company." 
The composition of the committees of our Board of Directors during the 2018 fiscal year is as follows. Members serve on these committees until their resignation, removal or as otherwise determined by our Board of Directors.

Our Compensation Committee operates under a written Charter that satisfies the applicable Nasdaq standards and which is available on our website at https://investors.cargurus.com at "Governance." The Compensation Committee met four times during 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of our Compensation Committee has ever been an executive officer or employee of ours. None of our executive officers currently serves, or has served during the last completed fiscal year, on the compensation committee or board of directors of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 
Board of Directors Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors oversees the management of risks inherent in the operation of our business and the implementation of our business strategies. Our Board of Directors performs this oversight role by using several different levels of review. In connection with its review of the operations and corporate functions of our company, our Board of Directors addresses the principal risks associated with those operations and corporate functions. In addition, our Board of Directors reviews the risks associated with our business strategies periodically throughout the year as part of its consideration of undertaking any such business strategies. 
The Audit Committee has the responsibility to consider and discuss our major financial risk exposures and the steps our management has taken to monitor and control these exposures, including guidelines and policies to govern the process by which risk assessment and management are undertaken. Our Audit Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to oversight of the performance of our internal audit function.  The Compensation Committee assesses and monitors the extent to which our incentive compensation policies and programs for employees may encourage excessive risk-taking and the relationship between risk management policies and practices and compensation, and evaluates compensation policies and practices that could mitigate any such risk. 
Communicating with the Directors 
Our Board of Directors gives appropriate attention to written communications that are submitted by stockholders and other interested parties and will respond if and as appropriate. The General Counsel is primarily responsible for monitoring communications to our Board of Directors from stockholders and other interested parties and for providing copies or summaries of such communications to the directors as she considers appropriate. 
Communications are forwarded to all directors if they relate to important substantive matters and include suggestions or comments that our General Counsel considers to be important for the directors to know. In general, communications relating to corporate governance and corporate strategy are more likely to be forwarded than communications relating to ordinary business affairs, personal grievances and duplicative communications. 
Stockholders and other interested parties who wish to send communications on any topic to the Board of Directors should address such communications to: The Board of Directors, c/o Secretary, CarGurus, Inc., 2 Canal Park, 4th Floor, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02141 USA. 
Additionally, we have established a confidential process for reporting, investigating and resolving employee and third-party concerns related to accounting, auditing and similar matters under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Stockholders and other interested parties may confidentially provide information to our Audit Committee or to one or more of our individual directors by using the confidential and anonymous financial concern hotline that is operated by an independent, third-party service. Within the United States and Canada, the ethics hotline can be reached by telephone, toll-free, at (877) 325-9953 or worldwide via the internet at https://www.whistleblowerservices.com/CARG/.

The report of the Audit Committee is not considered to be "soliciting material," is not deemed "filed" with the SEC, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company under the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
The Audit Committee has reviewed (i) the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, (ii) management's report on its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2018, and (iii) the report from Ernst & Young, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31 2018. The Audit Committee has met with representatives of Ernst & Young, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations; their evaluations of the Company's internal control, including internal control over financial reporting; and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
The Company's management is responsible for the Company's financial reporting process, including its system of internal controls, and for the preparation of its consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The independent registered public accounting firm audits the annual consolidated financial statements prepared by management in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"), expresses an opinion as to such financial statements and issues a report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee is responsible for providing independent, objective oversight of the Company's accounting functions and internal controls. 
The Audit Committee also received from, and discussed with, Ernst & Young the written disclosures and other communications that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is required to provide to the Audit Committee, including the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, as amended (Communication with Audit Committees), as adopted by the PCAOB, in Rule 3200T. 
Ernst & Young also provided the Audit Committee with the written disclosures and the letter required by Rule 3526 of the PCAOB requiring independent registered public accounting firms annually to disclose in writing all relationships that in their professional opinion may reasonably be thought to bear on independence, to confirm their perceived independence and to engage in a discussion of independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed this disclosure and has discussed with Ernst & Young their independence from the Company. 
Based on these discussions and the Company's review of the representations and information provided by management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

We refer to these executive officers collectively in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying compensation tables as our "Named Executive Officers."

Using proprietary technology, search algorithms, and innovative data analytics, we believe we are building the world's most trusted and transparent automotive marketplace and creating a differentiated automotive search experience for consumers.

2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
Consistent with our performance and compensation objectives, the Compensation Committee took the following actions relating to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base Salary – Increased base salaries in amounts ranging from 2.7% to 4.0%, while the  base salary of our CEO was maintained at its 2017 level of $325,000. In February 2019, at Mr. Steinert's request to demonstrate his confidence in the Company and further align his interests with those of our stockholders, our Compensation  Committee reduced Mr. Steinert's base salary to $50,000, effective January 1, 2019, and Mr. Steinert waived his eligibility to receive a cash bonus for his 2019 performance. As a result, a significant majority of  Mr. Steinert's target total direct compensation for 2019 will be equity-based in the form of restricted stock unit ("RSU") awards with time-based vesting requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash Incentive Awards – Made annual cash incentive award payments, which, in the  aggregate, represented approximately 150% of the target annual cash incentive award opportunities for our Named Executive Officers for the full year based on achievement against pre-established performance  objectives, including an annual cash incentive award payment in the amount of $485,225 to our CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Unit Awards – Granted time-based RSU awards that vest over four years.   
[END TABLE]
 2018 Executive Compensation Policies and Practices 
We endeavor to maintain sound governance standards consistent with our executive compensation policies and practices. The Compensation Committee evaluates our executive compensation program on a regular basis to ensure consistency with our short-term and long-term goals given the dynamic nature of our business and the market in which we compete for executive talent. The following policies and practices were in effect during 2018: 
What We Do: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Executive Compensation Review. The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves our  compensation strategy, including, as applicable, a review of our compensation peer group used for comparative purposes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Risk Oversight. The Compensation Committee reviews the extent to which our incentive  compensation policies and programs may encourage excessive risk-taking. At least annually, the Compensation Committee also reviews the relationship between our risk management policies and practices and compensation, and evaluates alternative  compensation policies and practices that could mitigate any such risk.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Utilize Independent Compensation Advisor. Pursuant to its Charter, the Compensation Committee has  sole authority to engage outside compensation consultants or other advisors to assist the committee in carrying out its duties. With respect to 2018 executive compensation, while the Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant,  it considered the competitive market analysis prepared in 2017 by Compensia, Inc. ("Compensia"), a compensation consulting firm. Except as described below under "Compensation-Setting Process –  Role of Compensation Consultant," Compensia performed no other consulting or other services for us in 2018. Based on its review, the Compensation Committee has determined that Compensia is independent and does not  have other relationships with us that would impair its independence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation At Risk. Our executive compensation program is designed so that a significant portion  of the cash incentive compensation of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, is "at risk" based on corporate performance and all of their RSU awards are "at risk" based on continued employment  through applicable vesting dates.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity-Based Compensation. A significant portion of the total compensation we pay to our executive  officers, including our Named Executive Officers, is in the form of equity-based compensation, which we believe aligns the interests of our executive officers and stockholders.  
[END TABLE]

• "Double Trigger" Change of Control Provisions in Executive Equity Awards. Our current  form of RSU award agreement with our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, provides for acceleration of unvested RSUs under such award solely in the event of a qualifying termination of employment within 12 months following a  Change of Control (as defined in the Company's Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2017 Plan")). With the exception of (i) certain RSUs granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the  "2015 Plan"), the vesting of which accelerates upon a Transaction (as defined in the 2015 Plan), and (ii) the initial RSU award granted to Ms. Patton in connection with her commencement of employment (see "Executive  Employment Arrangements" below), 50% of the unvested portion of which accelerates if a Change of Control (as defined in the 2017 Plan) occurs during her employment and before August 21, 2021, our executive officers are not  contractually entitled to other severance payments in the event of a change of control of the company. See "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" below for the definitions of "Change of  Control" under the 2017 Plan and "Termination" under the 2015 Plan.

Stockholder Advisory Vote on Frequency of Future Stockholder Advisory Votes on Named Executive Officer Compensation 
At the Annual Meeting, we will be conducting a non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future non-binding stockholder advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers (commonly known as a "Say-on-Pay" vote). Stockholders will have the option of voting on whether future Say-on-Pay votes should be held every one, two, or three years, or abstaining from such vote. In determining the frequency of future Say-on-Pay votes, our Board of Directors will take into consideration the preference of our stockholders as reflected by the results of this "frequency" vote. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
We believe in providing a competitive total compensation package to our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, through a combination of base salary, annual cash incentive award opportunities, equity awards and broad-based health and welfare benefit plans. Our executive compensation program is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, motivate and retain executive officers of outstanding ability and potential;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward the achievement of key performance measures; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure that executive compensation is meaningfully related to the creation of stockholder value.   
[END TABLE]
 We believe that our executive compensation program should generally include short-term and long-term elements, including cash and equity compensation, and should reward consistent performance that meets or exceeds expectations. We evaluate the compensation provided to our executive officers to ensure it remains competitive relative to compensation paid by companies of similar size and geographical location operating in our industry, taking into account our relative performance, our financial and strategic objectives, and the performance of the individual executive. 
Executive Compensation Design 
The compensation arrangements for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, consist of base salary, annual cash incentive award opportunities, long-term incentive compensation opportunities in the form of equity awards and certain employee health and welfare benefits. The key component of our executive compensation program continues to be equity compensation. Historically, we have emphasized the use of equity to provide incentives for our executive officers to focus on the growth of our overall enterprise value and, correspondingly, to create sustainable value for our stockholders. At this time, our principal equity incentive vehicle is time-based RSU awards that may be settled in shares of our Class A common stock as they are earned. 
We believe that RSU awards that may be settled in shares of our Class A common stock offer our executive officers a valuable long-term incentive that aligns their interests with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Going forward, as we deem appropriate, we may introduce other forms of stock-based compensation awards into our executive compensation program to offer our executive officers additional types of equity incentives that further this objective. 
We also offer cash compensation in the form of base salaries and annual cash incentive award opportunities. Typically, we have structured our cash bonus opportunities to focus on the achievement of specific short-term financial and strategic objectives that will further our longer-term growth objectives. 
We have not adopted any formal policies or guidelines for allocating compensation between current and long-term compensation, between cash and non-cash compensation or among different forms of non-cash compensation. Instead, the Compensation Committee reviews each element of executive compensation separately and also takes into consideration the value of each executive officer's target total direct compensation opportunity (the sum of base salary, annual cash incentive award opportunity and equity awards) as a whole, and its relative size in comparison to our other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also considers amounts realizable from prior compensation awarded to each executive officer, including equity that is nearly- or fully-vested, when setting each individual's target total direct compensation opportunity for the fiscal year. 
The Compensation Committee reviews our executive compensation program at least annually. As part of this review process, the Compensation Committee considers whether our overall compensation philosophy is aligned with the interests of stockholders while considering the compensation levels needed to ensure that our executive compensation program remains reasonable and competitive. In addition, the Compensation Committee considers our ability to achieve our retention objectives and the potential cost of replacing executive officers. 
Compensation-Setting Process 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving the compensation of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, subject to any approval of our Board of Directors that the Compensation Committee determines to be desirable or is required by applicable law or the Nasdaq listing standards. Specifically, the Compensation Committee oversees our compensation and benefit plans and policies, administers our equity compensation plans and reviews and approves (or makes recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding) the compensation of our executive officers.  Role of our Chief Executive Officer 
Each year, our CEO evaluates the performance of our executive officers and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to base salary adjustments, target annual cash incentive award opportunities, actual award payments, and equity awards for each executive officer, including our Named Executive Officers (other than himself). While the Compensation Committee takes these recommendations into consideration in its deliberations, it exercises its own independent judgment in approving the executive compensation of our executive officers. 
Role of Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee has the authority under its Charter to engage the services of a compensation consultant to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. 
In 2017, in connection with our IPO and prior to the formation of our Compensation Committee, we retained Compensia to provide director and executive compensation advisory services. Specifically, we engaged Compensia to evaluate our executive compensation as compared to similar newly public companies and to assist in the development of our post-IPO compensation program for the non-employee members of our Board of Directors. At such time, Compensia recommended a compensation peer group for the purpose of conducting a market analysis of the total compensation of certain executive officers and provided recommendations for the Compensation Committee's consideration with respect to the base salary, cash bonus targets and equity compensation of certain executive officers. 
With respect to 2018 executive compensation, the Compensation Committee did not engage a compensation consultant but considered the 2017 competitive market analysis of Compensia, as described above, in the course of its deliberations. The Compensation Committee also considered market information available through the proxy statements of peer companies as reference points in making certain executive compensation decisions for 2018 consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy. 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee has formally retained Compensia to assist it in developing and overseeing the Company's executive compensation program. Pursuant to this engagement, Compensia is expected to perform, or has performed, the following projects for the Compensation Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assist in reviewing and updating our compensation peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide compensation data and analysis for similarly-situated executive officers at our compensation peer group  companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If requested, advise regarding non-employee director compensation,  including compensation data and analysis for our peer group companies; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Generally keep the Compensation Committee informed on emerging trends and best practices in the area of executive  compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Compensia maintains a policy that is specifically designed to prevent any conflicts of interest. In addition, the Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Compensia taking into account, among other things, the factors set forth in Exchange Act Rule 10C-1 and the Nasdaq listing standards, and concluded that no conflict of interest exists with respect to the work that Compensia performs for the Compensation Committee. 
Competitive Positioning 
In 2017, Compensia, at the direction of the Company and prior to the formation of the Compensation Committee, recommended the following compensation peer group consisting of 17 publicly traded companies. This recommended list consisted of technology companies that Compensia and the Company determined operate   within our industry and compete with us for talent, that are located in the same general geographical area and that have similar revenues, market capitalization and projected revenue growth. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Alarm.com Holdings    LogMeIn    RingCentral 
 Benefitfocus    New Relic    SecureWorks 
 Cornerstone OnDemand    Okta    The Trade Desk 
 Five9    Paycom Software    TrueCar 
 Gigamon    Paylocity Holding    Twilio 
 HubSpot    Qualys     
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considered compensation data drawn from publicly-available proxy statements for this compensation peer group as reference points for its 2018 executive compensation decisions. While the Compensation Committee takes into account peer company compensation practices, the Compensation Committee uses this information as one of many factors in its deliberations on compensation matters and does not set compensation levels to meet specific percentiles. 
The Compensation Committee reviews the compensation data drawn from a compensation peer group, in combination with industry-specific compensation survey data, to develop a subjective representation of the "competitive market" with respect to current executive compensation levels and related policies and practices. The Compensation Committee then evaluates how our pay practices and the compensation levels of our executive officers compare to the competitive market. As part of this evaluation, the Compensation Committee also reviews the performance measures and performance goals generally used within the competitive market to reward performance. 
Elements of Executive Compensation 
The compensation program for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, consists of three principal components: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash incentive awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation in the form of time-based RSU awards that are settled in shares of our  Class A common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salary 
Base salary represents the fixed portion of the compensation of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, and is an important element of compensation intended to attract and retain highly-talented individuals. Generally, we use base salary to provide each executive officer with a specified level of cash compensation during the year with the expectation that he or she will perform his or her responsibilities to the best of his or her ability and in our best interests. 
Generally, the Compensation Committee reviews the base salaries of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, at the beginning of each year and makes adjustments as it determines to be necessary or appropriate. Typically, the Compensation Committee sets the base salaries of our executive officers at levels which it believes are competitive with current market practices (with reference to our compensation peer group) and after taking into consideration each individual executive officer's role and the scope of his or her responsibilities, qualifications, experience, past performance and expected future contributions, prior base salary with the Company and the base salary levels of our other executive officers. The Compensation Committee does not apply specific formulas to determine base salary adjustments.  In February 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed the base salary of each of our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers. Based on its comparison of our Named Executive Officers' base salaries to those of executives holding comparable positions at the companies in our compensation peer group, as well as its assessment of our 2017 performance and the other factors described above, the Compensation Committee determined that it was appropriate to adjust the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers for 2018 as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer     2017 Base Salary       2018 Base Salary(1)       Percentage Increase   
 Mr. Steinert    $ 325,000      $ 325,000        –     
 Mr. Trevisan    $ 350,000      $ 360,000        2.8%  
 Mr. Zales    $ 370,000      $ 380,000        2.7%  
 Ms. Patton    $ 250,000      $ 260,000        4.0%  
 Mr. Chrzan(2)    $ 295,000      $ 305,000        3.4%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  These base salaries were effective as of January 1, 2018.  
  (2)  Effective February 13, 2019, Mr. Chrzan resigned as our Chief Technology Officer.   
[END TABLE]
The actual base salaries paid to our Named Executive Officers in 2018 are set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Cash Incentive Awards 
In 2018, we provided our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, with the opportunity to earn cash incentive awards to encourage the achievement of our corporate performance objectives and to reward those individuals who significantly impact our corporate results based on the objectives set forth in our annual operating plan. The Compensation Committee determines and approves cash incentive award decisions for our executive officers. 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the CarGurus, Inc. Annual Incentive Plan (the "2018 Annual Incentive Plan") effective as of January 1, 2018, providing an opportunity for certain of our salaried employees, including our Named Executive Officers, to earn cash incentive awards, as described below. Pursuant to the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, each participant was eligible to receive a cash incentive award for the fiscal year based on our achievement of one or more pre-established business and financial performance goals and the participant's individual performance goals, if applicable, during the fiscal year. The amount actually paid to a participant could be more or less than his or her target award, depending on the extent to which applicable performance goals were satisfied. Participants, including our Named Executive Officers, will not receive a payout for any performance measure that fails to achieve threshold level criteria. 
Target Cash Incentive Award Opportunities 
Under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, each participant's actual annual cash incentive award was to be calculated, in part, by reference to a target annual cash incentive award opportunity based on either a percentage of his or her annual base salary for the fiscal year or a specified dollar amount, in each case as determined, in the case of our executive officers, by the Compensation Committee. In February 2018, based on its comparison of our Named Executive Officers' target cash incentive award opportunities to those executives holding comparable positions at the companies in our compensation peer group, as well as its assessment of our 2017 performance and the other factors described in "Elements of Executive Compensation – Base Salary" above, the Compensation   Committee determined to set the target annual cash incentive award opportunities of our Named Executive Officers for 2018 as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer     Target Cash Incentive Award Opportunity       Target Cash Incentive Award Opportunity (as a percentage  of base salary)      Percentage Increase from 2017 Target Cash Incentive  Award Opportunity   
 Mr. Steinert    $ 325,000        100%      30%  
 Mr. Trevisan    $ 160,000        44%      –     
 Mr. Zales    $ 230,000        61%      –     
 Ms. Patton    $ 130,000        50%      100%  
 Mr. Chrzan(1)    $ 120,000        39%      –     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Effective February 13, 2019, Mr. Chrzan resigned as our Chief Technology Officer.   
[END TABLE]
The amount actually paid to a participant could be more or less than his or her target annual cash incentive award, depending on the extent to which applicable performance goals were satisfied. 
Corporate Strategic and Organizational Goals 
For purposes of the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approved various strategic and organizational initiatives in several different categories as the business performance goals upon which award payments would be based. The strategic initiatives involved monthly recurring revenue ("MRR") improvement, new dealer products, audience and connection growth, international expansion, and peer to peer activities, while the organizational initiatives involved activities related to employee engagement and enhancing our engineering scale. Each of these initiative categories involved one or more quantitative and qualitative metrics as established by our management that had to be successfully completed for the initiative to be considered achieved. For 2018, the threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for the number of strategic and organizational initiatives achieved and the corresponding payout levels under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan were established as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measure     Performance Level    Payout Percentage 
 Strategic and Organizational Initiatives    Threshold (25%)(1)   50% 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  There is no payout for performance that does not meet the threshold level criteria.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Financial Performance Goals 
In addition, the Compensation Committee selected annual revenue and adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), a non-GAAP financial measure, as the financial performance goals for the fiscal year. For 2018, the threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for annual revenue and adjusted EBIT, as set forth in our annual operating plan, and the corresponding payout levels for achievement of such metrics under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan were established as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measure     Performance Level    Payout Percentage 
 Annual Revenue    Threshold (95%)(1)   50% 
 Adjusted EBIT    Threshold (90%)(1)   50% 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  There is no payout for performance that does not meet the threshold level criteria.  
[END TABLE]
 We calculate adjusted EBIT as GAAP net income, adjusted to exclude: stock-based compensation expense, other (income) expense, net, the (benefit from) provision for income taxes, and other one-time, non-recurring items, as may be applicable. 
The Compensation Committee believed that, for purposes of the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, these corporate financial metrics were the most appropriate performance measures to use in determining cash incentive awards because, in its view, they continued to be the best indicators of our successful execution of our annual operating plan. Thus, the threshold performance levels for these corporate performance goals were the minimum performance levels that had to be achieved before participants could earn any annual cash incentive awards. If the threshold performance goal for a particular measure was not achieved, then no award payments would be made under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan with respect to such measure. 
The above-referenced performance objectives should not be interpreted as a prediction of how we will perform in future periods. As described above, the purpose of these objectives was to establish a method for determining the payment of annual cash incentive compensation. You are cautioned not to rely on these performance goals as a prediction of our future performance. 
Individual Performance Goals 
For purposes of the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee authorized our CEO to establish one or more individual performance goals for each executive officer, including each other Named Executive Officer, as part of his or her incentive award calculation. As part of our annual performance evaluation process, our CEO, after consultation with each executive officer, established his or her performance goals for the fiscal year. These performance goals were not intended to be formulaic, but rather to serve as the framework upon which our CEO could evaluate the executive officer's overall performance. Such performance goals were established with reference to each individual executive officer's position or function within the Company and included operational metrics that could reflect corporate or departmental goals or could include specific operational goals with respect to his or her area of responsibility. These performance goals also included the demonstration of leadership and effective decision-making, effective communication, promotion of our strategic and organizational initiatives and values, and commitment to excellence and work ethic and could include more specific objectives for the executive officer, such as the successful completion of major projects and organization capability building. 
The Compensation Committee applied similar factors in determining the individual performance goals for our CEO. 
Following the end of the 2018 fiscal year, our executive officers other than the CEO were subject to reviews by our CEO, as well as a "360" review during the course of the year, to evaluate his or her performance for the year and his or her accomplishments against the pre-established individual performance goals.  
Weighting of Performance Goals 
At the time the Compensation Committee established the corporate performance goals for the fiscal year, it also determined the weighting for our executive officers with respect to the business and financial performance goals and the individual performance goals. For purposes of the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan, the weighting of the performance goals for our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Goal     Weighting 
 Strategic and Organizational Initiatives    33.00% 
 Annual Revenue    24.75% 
 Adjusted EBIT    8.25% 
 Individual Performance Goals    34.00% 
[END TABLE]
 2018 Annual Incentive Award Results 
In August 2018, based on our progress in achieving our revenue goal for the year, the Compensation Committee approved a discretionary payment to our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee approved these payments in connection with the determination by our CEO to make discretionary mid-year payments of a portion of target annual incentive awards for 2018 under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan to eligible salaried employees who were participants in the plan meeting certain eligibility requirements. 
Consistent with the treatment of all other eligible salaried employees by our CEO, the Compensation Committee determined to pay 2018 annual incentive awards to our executive officers in two installments rather than in one lump sum, whereby (i) 80% of each executive officer's target annual cash incentive award opportunity for the period from January 1, 2018 to June 30, 2018 would be made in an initial lump sum payment on or around August 31, 2018 (the "First Half 2018 Payment"), and (ii) the remainder of each executive officer's full-year annual cash incentive award would be paid in a second lump sum payment following the end of 2018 based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of our actual performance as measured against the achievement of the pre-established corporate and individual performance goals. 
In August 2018, the Compensation Committee therefore approved the following First Half 2018 Payments for our Named Executive Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    Target Annual Cash Incentive Award for First Half of  2018      Actual Cash Incentive Award Payment for First   Half of 2018 (80% of Target Award for Period)

 Mr. Trevisan   $ 80,000     $ 64,000   
 Mr. Zales   $ 115,000     $ 92,000   
 Ms. Patton   $ 65,000     $ 52,000

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  Effective February 13, 2019, Mr. Chrzan resigned as our Chief Technology Officer.   
[END TABLE]
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined the total amounts to be paid to our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan based on our actual performance for the year with respect to each corporate performance goal and each executive officer's performance against his or her individual performance goals. For 2018, the actual results against the targets set for the corporate components under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measure        Achievement Percentage                    Payout Percentage             
 Strategic and Organizational Initiatives     73%      114%  
 Annual Revenue     109%      190%  
 Adjusted EBIT     112%      150%  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee evaluated the individual performance of each executive officer based on the performance review conducted for each executive officer and factored this evaluation into the determination of his or her final cash incentive award payment.  As a result, the target annual cash incentive award opportunities and the actual cash incentive award payments made to our Named Executive Officers for 2018 were as follows.

The cash bonus payments made to our Named Executive Officers for 2018 are set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
Currently, we use RSU awards with time-based vesting requirements to retain, motivate and reward our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, for long-term increases in the value of our Class A common stock and, thereby, to align their interests with those of our stockholders. Because RSU awards have value to the recipient even in the absence of stock price appreciation, we are able to incentivize and retain our executive officers using fewer shares of our Class A common stock than would be necessary if we issued options to purchase shares of our Class A common stock or other awards to provide equity to our executive officers. In addition, because the value of these RSU awards increases with any increase in the value of the underlying shares of Class A common stock, the awards also provide incentives to our executive officers that are aligned with the interests of our stockholders. 
Typically, the size and form of the equity awards granted to our executive officers are determined in the discretion of the Compensation Committee at a level that it believes is competitive with current market practices (with reference to our compensation peer group) and after taking into consideration each individual executive officer's role and the scope of his or her responsibilities, qualifications, experience, past performance and expected future contributions, his or her current equity holdings and the potential equity awards to be granted to our other executive officers. 
In February 2018, after reviewing the equity awards granted to executives holding comparable positions at the companies in our compensation peer group, as well as its assessment of our 2017 performance and the other factors described above, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of RSU awards to our Named Executive Officers as follows:

Except as described below with respect to one of Mr. Chrzan's two RSU awards presented in the table above, 6.25% of the shares of our Class A common stock subject to the RSU awards vest on the date that is three months following the vesting commencement date and 6.25% of the shares subject to the awards vest on the last day of each three-month period thereafter until the fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date, contingent upon the respective executive officer remaining continuously employed by us through each applicable vesting date. Upon vesting, the RSU awards will be settled by issuing the number of shares of our Class A common stock that have vested on such date. The second of Mr. Chrzan's RSU awards for 40,000 shares of our Class A common stock was subject to vesting such that 100% of such RSUs subject to the award would have vested on the fourth anniversary of the vesting commencement date, contingent upon his employment with us on such vesting date. This RSU award had not vested as of Mr. Chrzan's departure date and therefore was forfeited. 
In addition, all of the RSU awards presented in the table above provide for acceleration of vesting in the event the executive officer's employment is terminated by us without cause or by the executive officer for good reason within 12 months following a qualifying change of control of the Company. 
The equity awards granted to our Named Executive Officers in 2018 are set forth in the "Summary Compensation Table" and the "Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" below. 
Welfare and Health Benefits 
We have established a broad-based tax-qualified savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Code for our eligible U.S. employees, including our executive officers, who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. Currently, we match contributions made to the plan by our employees as follows: 50% of an employee's calendar-year contributions, up to a maximum of the lesser of (i) 6% of the employee's base salary, bonus, and commissions paid during the period or (ii) $5,000. Mandatory matching contributions may be subject to vesting based on an employee's start date and length of service. Employees can designate the investment of their Section 401(k) accounts into a broad range of mutual funds. We do not allow investment in our common stock through the Section 401(k) plan. We intend for the plan to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code so that contributions by employees to the plan, and income earned on plan contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the plan. 
In addition, our executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, are eligible to receive the same employee benefits that are generally available to all our full-time employees, subject to the satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements. These benefits include health and dependent care, flexible spending accounts, medical, dental and vision benefits, business travel insurance, an employee assistance program, basic life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, short-term and long-term disability insurance, an employee sabbatical program, daily catered lunches, and health club, commuter and parking benefits. 
In structuring our employee benefit programs, we seek to provide an aggregate level of benefits that are comparable to those provided by similar companies, compliant with applicable laws and practices and affordable to our employees. We adjust these programs as needed based upon regular monitoring of applicable laws and practices, the competitive market and our employees' needs. 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
Currently, we do not view perquisites or other personal benefits as a significant component of our executive compensation program. Accordingly, we do not provide significant perquisites or other personal benefits to our   executive officers, including our Named Executive Officers, except as generally made available to our employees, or in situations where we believe it is appropriate to assist an individual in the performance of his or her duties, to make our executive officers more efficient and effective and for recruitment and retention purposes. During 2018, none of our Named Executive Officers received perquisites or other personal benefits that were, in the aggregate, $10,000 or more for each individual. 
In the future, we may provide perquisites or other personal benefits in limited circumstances, such as those described in the preceding paragraph. All future practices with respect to perquisites or other personal benefits for our executive officers will be approved and subject to periodic review by the Compensation Committee. 
Employment Arrangements 
We have entered into employment offer letters with each of our executive officers. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of our employment arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, see "Executive Employment Arrangements" below. 
Post-Employment Compensation Arrangements 
The employment offer letters with certain of our executive officers provide for certain protections in the event of their termination of employment under specified circumstances. We believe that these protections were necessary to induce these individuals to forego other opportunities or leave their then-current employment for the uncertainty of a demanding position in a new and unfamiliar organization. We also believe that these arrangements continue to serve our executive retention objectives by helping these executive officers maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibility to maximize stockholder value. 
For a summary of the material terms and conditions of the post-employment arrangements with our Named Executive Officers, see "Executive Employment Arrangements" below. For an estimate of the value of payments and benefits that our Named Executive Officers would have been eligible to receive if a hypothetical change of control or other trigger event had occurred on December 31, 2018, see "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" below.  
Other Compensation Policies 
Hedging and Pledging Policy 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our directors, executive officers, and certain other persons as may be designated from engaging in short sales of our securities, buying or selling puts or calls or other derivative securities on our securities or entering into hedging or monetization transactions or similar arrangements with respect to our securities without requisite prior approval. In addition, our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our directors, executive officers, and certain other persons as may be designated from holding our securities in a margin account or pledging our securities as collateral for a loan without requisite prior approval. 
Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 Sales Plans Policy 
Certain of our directors and our executive officers have adopted written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1 plans, pursuant to which they contracted with a broker to sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis. Pursuant to these Rule 10b5-1 plans, a broker executes trades subject to parameters established by the director or executive officer upon entering into the plan, without further direction from the director or executive officer. Our directors and executive officers may only enter into such a plan at a time when we are not in a "blackout period" under our Insider Trading Policy and when the director or executive officer entering into the plan is not otherwise aware of material, nonpublic information. We also require a sixty-day cooling-off period before trades may commence under a new plan. Once the plan is in place, the director or executive officer may amend or terminate the plan   only in limited circumstances. We have implemented an internal policy that prohibits each executive officer from selling any shares of our common stock in the open market outside of a Rule 10b5-1 plan, regardless of whether he or she is in possession of material, nonpublic information. 
Tax and Accounting Considerations 
Deductibility of Executive Compensation 
In determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the possible income tax consequences to the Company and to our executive officers. To maintain maximum flexibility in designing our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee, while considering tax deductibility as one factor in determining compensation, does not limit compensation to those levels or types of compensation that are intended to be deductible. 
Generally, Section 162(m) of the Code disallows a federal income tax deduction for public corporations of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid for any fiscal year to their chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and up to three other executive officers whose compensation is required to be disclosed to our stockholders under the Exchange Act because they are our most highly-compensated executive officers. As a result of a transition rule applicable to newly-public companies, the Section 162(m) deduction limit generally does not apply to compensation paid pursuant to an arrangement that was in existence prior to our initial public offering and disclosed in its public filings, such as RSU awards and stock options granted to our Named Executive Officers. As final guidance and regulations relating to Section 162(m), as amended in connection with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, have not been issued, no assurance can be given that the transition rule for newly-public companies will continue to be available. We will continue to closely monitor developments with respect to Section 162(m) of the Code. 
To maintain flexibility to compensate our executive officers in a manner designed to promote our short-term and long-term corporate goals and objectives, the Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy that all compensation must be deductible. From time to time, the Compensation Committee may approve compensation for our Named Executive Officers that does not comply with an exemption from the deduction limit when it believes that such compensation is consistent with the goals of our executive compensation program and in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. Therefore, the Compensation Committee may approve base salaries and other compensation awards for our executive officers that may not be fully deductible because of the deduction limit of Section 162(m). 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
We follow the FASB ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires us to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and non-employee members of our Board of Directors, including options to purchase shares of our common stock and other stock awards, based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the executive compensation tables required by the federal securities laws, even though the recipient of the awards may never realize any value from their awards. FASB ASC Topic 718 also requires us to recognize the compensation cost of our stock-based compensation awards in our income statements over the period that an employee or director is required to render service in exchange for a stock option or other award.

Executive Employment Arrangements 
We have entered into employment offer letters with each of our Named Executive Officers. These agreements provide for "at-will" employment and generally include the Named Executive Officer's initial base salary, an indication of eligibility for an annual performance-based bonus opportunity, an equity awards recommendation, and certain severance and change of control payments and benefits. These employment arrangements are described below. 
Langley Steinert 
The employment offer letter with Mr. Steinert, effective March 17, 2006, memorializes the terms of Mr. Steinert's position as our Chief Executive Officer. The terms provide that Mr. Steinert is entitled to a base salary, which may be adjusted on an annual basis, and participation in our benefit programs. In connection with his commencement of employment, Mr. Steinert entered into a non-disclosure, development and non-competition agreement, which provides that at all times during his employment and thereafter, Mr. Steinert will maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information obtained by him as a result of his employment and assign all inventions to us. In addition, during the term of Mr. Steinert's employment, and for the one-year period (subject to certain extensions in the event of a breach) after Mr. Steinert's termination of employment, Mr. Steinert cannot (i) compete against our company, (ii) interfere or do business with any customers or affiliates of our company, or (iii) solicit in any way the existing or future employees of our company or any others who provide services to our company.  Jason Trevisan 
The employment offer letter with Mr. Trevisan, dated August 10, 2015, provides for an initial annual base salary, which may be adjusted on an annual basis, consistent with salary review procedures for other company employees. In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Trevisan received a $50,000 sign-on bonus, which would have been subject to repayment if Mr. Trevisan's employment terminated within 12 months following his employment start date. Mr. Trevisan is also eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus. 
In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Trevisan was awarded 553,986 RSUs (the "Initial RSU Award") under the 2015 Plan, which can be settled for 184,662 shares of Class A common stock and 369,324 shares of Class B common stock, subject to service-based vesting and liquidity event-based vesting; both the service-based vesting and liquidity event-based vesting conditions must be satisfied prior to the seventh anniversary of the date of grant in order for the Initial RSU Award to fully vest. The liquidity-event based vesting condition was satisfied upon our IPO. With respect to the service-based vesting condition, 25% of the units vested on August 31, 2016, and an additional 6.25% vested (or will vest, as applicable) every three months thereafter until August 31, 2019, subject to Mr. Trevisan's continued employment on the applicable vesting dates. Such vesting may be accelerated in connection with a Transaction (as defined in the 2015 Plan). See "Potential Payments upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" above for the definition of "Termination" under the 2015 Plan. 
Mr. Trevisan is entitled to participate in all employee benefit programs made available to other company employees, including but not limited to health insurance, paid time off, and reimbursement for business expenses in accordance with our expense reimbursement policy. 
If we terminate his employment for cause, we will pay Mr. Trevisan his accrued compensation and benefits through the date of termination and he will forfeit the unvested portion of the Initial RSU Award. If Mr. Trevisan terminates his employment for any reason, we will pay him his accrued compensation and benefits through the date of termination. 
If we terminate Mr. Trevisan's employment without cause, or Mr. Trevisan terminates his employment for good reason, he will receive accrued compensation through the date of termination and, provided he executes and does not revoke a release of claims, he will be entitled to (i) a severance payment of $100,000, which will be paid in a lump sum within 60 days following his termination of employment and (ii) vesting as of his termination date of any portion of the Initial RSU Award that would have vested under the service-based vesting condition over the 12-month period following his termination, had he remained employed during that period. 
Pursuant to the terms of the employment offer letter, (1) "cause" is generally defined as a finding by our Board of Directors that Mr. Trevisan has: (i) materially breached the offer letter, which breach has not been remedied within 30 days following written notice to him; (ii) engaged in disloyalty to our company, including, without limitation, fraud, embezzlement, theft, commission of a felony, or proven dishonesty; (iii) disclosed trade secrets or confidential information of our company to persons not entitled to receive such information; (iv) breached the nondisclosure, developments, and non-competition agreement that he entered into in connection with the commencement of his employment; or (v) engaged in such other behavior detrimental to the interests of our company as our Board of Directors reasonably determines; and (2) "good reason" is generally defined as the occurrence of any of the following events, without Mr. Trevisan's consent: (i) a material diminution in his title, responsibilities, authority, or duties; (ii) a material diminution of his base salary or target annual discretionary bonus, except for across-the-board reductions based on our company's financial performance similarly affecting all or substantially all senior management employees; (iii) a material change in the principal geographic location at which he provides services to our company (with the exception of travel related to his duties); or (iv) our company's material breach of the offer letter; provided that Mr. Trevisan notifies us within 30 days of the occurrence of the condition constituting good reason, he cooperates with us to cure the condition for a period of not less than 30 days following the notice, and, if we fail to cure the condition following our cure period, he terminates his employment within 30 days following the end of the cure period.  The employment offer letter requires that Mr. Trevisan comply with our nondisclosure, developments, and non-competition agreement, which provides that at all times during Mr. Trevisan's employment and thereafter, he will maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information obtained by him as a result of his employment and assign all inventions to us. In addition, during the term of Mr. Trevisan's employment, and for the one-year period (subject to certain extensions in the event of a breach) after Mr. Trevisan's termination of employment, Mr. Trevisan cannot (i) compete against our company, (ii) interfere or do business with any customers or affiliates of our company, or (iii) solicit in any way the existing or future employees of our company or any others who provide services to our company. 
Samuel Zales 
The employment offer letter with Mr. Zales, dated October 24, 2014, provides for an initial annual base salary, which may be adjusted on an annual basis, consistent with salary review procedures for other company employees. Upon execution of the employment offer letter, Mr. Zales received a $50,000 sign-on bonus, which would have been subject to repayment upon a voluntary termination within 12 months following Mr. Zales's employment start date. Mr. Zales is also eligible to receive a discretionary annual bonus. 
In connection with the commencement of his employment, Mr. Zales was awarded an option to purchase 265,066 shares of Class A common stock and 530,132 shares of Class B common stock (the "Initial Option"), pursuant to the terms of the Company's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2006 Plan"). The shares of common stock underlying the Initial Option vested over four years as follows: 25% vested on November 3, 2015, and an additional 6.25% vested at the end of each three-month period thereafter until November 3, 2018, provided that Mr. Zales remained employed on the applicable vesting dates and complied with the terms of the 2006 Plan, or upon a change of control, if earlier. All such shares underlying the Initial Option are vested. 
Mr. Zales is entitled to participate in all employee benefit programs made available to other company employees, including, but not limited to, health insurance, paid time off, and reimbursement for business expenses in accordance with our expense reimbursement policy. 
If we terminate Mr. Zales' employment without cause, he will receive accrued compensation through the date of termination and, provided he executes and does not revoke a release of claims, he is entitled to a severance payment of $100,000, which will be paid in a lump sum on Mr. Zales's last day of employment with us. If Mr. Zales is terminated for any reason, Mr. Zales will have 90 days to exercise the Initial Option. 
The employment offer letter requires that Mr. Zales comply with our nondisclosure, developments, and non-competition agreement, which provides that at all times during Mr. Zales' employment and thereafter, Mr. Zales will maintain the confidentiality of all confidential information obtained by him as a result of his employment and assign all inventions to us.

Director Compensation 
During 2018, we compensated our non-employee directors for their service as directors. Accordingly, Mr. Steinert, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, did not receive any additional compensation for his service as a director. 
Our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the compensation of our non-employee directors and, as applicable, makes recommendations to the Board of Directors for its consideration of changes to our  non-employee director compensation program. Our Compensation Committee compares the compensation of our Board of Directors to compensation paid to non-employee directors of similarly sized public companies. Our Compensation Committee also considers the responsibilities we ask from the members of our Board of Directors along with the amount of time required to perform those responsibilities. 
Cash Compensation 
We have established a cash and equity compensation program for our non-employee directors in consideration of their service on our Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors. 
The cash compensation approved by the Board of Directors is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Annual Base Compensation for Non-Employee  Directors    $ 35,000   
 Additional Compensation for Audit Committee Chair    $ 20,000   
 Additional Compensation for Compensation Committee Chair    $ 12,000   
 Additional Compensation for Audit Committee Member (not Chair)    $ 9,000   
 Additional Compensation for Compensation Committee Member (not Chair)    $ 5,000   
[END TABLE]
This cash compensation for non-employee directors is expected to remain the same for 2019. 
The payments described above are payable in full on or promptly after the date of the annual meeting of stockholders. When a director joins the Board of Directors or a committee or accepts another position on the Board of Directors, such director will receive pro-rata cash compensation based on his or her expected service during the fiscal year. 
Each member of our Board of Directors is also entitled to reimbursement for reasonable travel and other expenses incurred in connection with attending board meetings and meetings for any committee on which he or she serves. 
Equity Compensation 
Pursuant to our non-employee director compensation program, each non-employee director who is in service as of the date of an annual meeting of stockholders and whose service on the Board of Directors has continued from the prior fiscal year is eligible to receive as of the date of such annual meeting, subject to Board of Directors approval, an annual grant of RSUs pursuant to the 2017 Plan, with the number of RSUs subject to the grant to be determined based on $150,000 divided by the closing price of the Class A common stock on Nasdaq on the date of such grant, prorated as necessary in respect of the director's expected service for such fiscal year, subject to a service-based vesting requirement, vesting in full on the first anniversary of such grant. Accordingly, for 2018, on May 24, 2018, our Board of Directors granted to each of Messrs. Kaufer, Parafestas and Smith an RSU award of 4,793 shares of our Class A common stock. 
In addition, each non-employee director that first becomes a member of our Board of Directors shall receive, subject to approval by the Board of Directors, an initial grant of RSUs pursuant to the 2017 Plan, with the number of RSUs subject to the grant to be determined based on $150,000, divided by the closing price of the Class A common stock on Nasdaq on the date of such grant, subject to a service-based vesting requirement, vesting in full on the first anniversary of such grant. Accordingly, in 2018, Ms. Hickok and Messrs. Conine and Schwartz received initial director grants of 3,357, 4,492 and 4,219 RSUs, respectively.  The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation of non-employee directors who served on our Board of Directors in 2018:

Stephen Kaufer  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
The following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2018, in which we were a party and the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our executive officers, directors, or holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, or an affiliate or immediate family member thereof, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. We believe the terms obtained or consideration that we paid or received, as applicable, in connection with the transactions described below were comparable to terms available or amounts that would be paid or received, as applicable, in arm's-length transactions with unrelated third parties. 
Related Person Transactions 
Third Amended and Restated Investors' Rights Agreement 
We are party to a third amended and restated investors' rights agreement, dated August 23, 2016, which provides, among other things, that certain holders of our capital stock, including Allen & Company LLC, Argonaut 22 LLC, entities affiliated with T. Rowe Price, Langley Steinert, Stephen Kaufer, David Parker, Simon Rothman, and Ian Smith, have the right to demand that we file a registration statement or request that their shares of our capital stock be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing. 
Policies and Procedures for Related Person Transactions 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy for the review of any transaction, arrangement or relationship in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and one of our executive officers, directors, director nominees or 5% stockholders (or their immediate family members), each of whom we refer to as a "related person," has a direct or indirect material interest. 
If a related person proposes to enter into such a transaction, arrangement or relationship, which we refer to as a "related person transaction," the related person must report the proposed related person transaction to our General Counsel. The policy calls for the proposed related person transaction to be reviewed and, if deemed appropriate, approved by the Audit Committee. Whenever practicable, the reporting, review and approval will occur prior to entry into the transaction. 
If advance review and approval is not practicable, the Chair of the Audit Committee will review and, if deemed appropriate, approve proposed related person transactions that arise between committee meetings, notifying the Audit Committee at its next meeting. If we become aware that a related person transaction has not been approved under the policy, the Audit Committee will review, and, in its discretion, may ratify the related person transaction. Our Audit Committee may approve or ratify the transaction if it determines that, under all of the circumstances, the transaction is in or is not inconsistent with our best interests. The Audit Committee may impose any conditions on the related person transaction that it deems appropriate. The policy also provides that any related person transactions that are ongoing in nature will be reviewed annually. 
A related person transaction reviewed under the policy will be considered approved or ratified if it is authorized by the Audit Committee after full disclosure of the related person's interest in the transaction. As appropriate for the circumstances, the Audit Committee will review and consider: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the related person's interest in the related person transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the approximate dollar value of the amount involved in the related person transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would impair the independence of an otherwise independent director or nominee for  director;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction is undertaken in the ordinary course of our business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the transaction are no less favorable to us than terms that could have been reached with an  unrelated third party;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the purpose, timing, and the potential benefits to us, of the transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any other information regarding the related person transaction or the related person in the context of the  proposed transaction that would be material to investors in light of the circumstances of the particular transaction.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the transactions that are excluded by the instructions to the SEC's related person transaction disclosure rule, our Board of Directors has determined that the following transaction, among others, does not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of related persons and, therefore, is not a related person transaction for purposes of our policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• interests arising solely from the related person's position as an employee (other than an executive officer)  or director of another entity that is a participant in the transaction, when (a) the related person and all other related persons own in the aggregate less than a 10% equity interest in such entity and (b) the amount involved in the  transaction equals less than the greater of $1.0 million or 2% of the annual total annual revenue of the other entity that is a party to the transaction.  
[END TABLE]
 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table sets forth certain information as of March 1, 2019, with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of our Named Executive Officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each of our directors and director nominees;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• all of our directors, director nominees and executive officers as a group; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each person or group of affiliated persons we know to beneficially own 5% or more of the outstanding shares of  our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC and the information is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Unless otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, the persons and entities named in the table have sole voting and sole investment power with respect to all shares that they beneficially own, subject to community property laws where applicable. In computing the number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock subject to options or RSUs held by that person that are currently exercisable, exercisable within 60 days after March 1, 2019 or vested and will settle within 60 days after March 1, 2019. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. 
We have based our calculation of the percentage ownership of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock on 90,117,806 shares of our Class A common stock outstanding and 20,702,084 shares of our Class B common stock outstanding, in each case, as of March 1, 2019. 
This table is based upon information supplied by officers, directors and stockholders known by us to be beneficial owners of more than 5% of our common stock as well as Schedules 13G or 13D filed with the SEC. 
Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed on the table below is c/o CarGurus, Inc., 2 Canal Park, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02141.

 PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Board of Directors may establish the authorized number of directors from time to time by resolution. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified Board of Directors. This means our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class having as nearly as possible an equal number of directors. The term of service of each class of directors is staggered so that the term of one class expires at each annual meeting of the stockholders. 
Our Board of Directors currently consists of seven members, divided into three classes as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Class I is comprised of Lori Hickok and Greg Schwartz, each with a term ending at the 2021 annual meeting of  stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Class II is comprised of Steven Conine, Stephen Kaufer and Anastasios Parafestas, each with a term ending at  the Annual Meeting; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Class III is comprised of Ian Smith and Langley Steinert, each with a term ending at the 2020 annual meeting  of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors are elected for a full term of three years to succeed those directors whose terms are expiring. Messrs. Conine, Kaufer and Parafestas are current directors whose terms expire at the Annual Meeting. Our Board of Directors has nominated each of Messrs. Conine, Kaufer and Parafestas for election as Class II directors with terms ending in 2022. 
A plurality of the combined voting power of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote is required to elect each nominee as a director. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE CLASS II 
NOMINEES NAMED ABOVE.  PROPOSAL 2 
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC 
ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Ernst & Young, an independent registered public accounting firm, to perform the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019 and to perform an audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. This appointment is being presented to the stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. 
Ernst & Young has audited our financial statements since the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Ernst & Young has no direct or indirect material financial interest in our company or our subsidiaries. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be given the opportunity to make a statement on the firm's behalf if they so desire. The representatives also will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Proxies solicited by management will be voted for ratification unless stockholders specify otherwise. Ratification by the stockholders is not required. Although we are not required to submit the appointment of Ernst & Young to a vote of the stockholders, our Board of Directors believes it is appropriate as a matter of policy to request that the stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent registered public accounting firm. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding. The outcome of this advisory vote will not overrule any decision by us or our Board of Directors (or any committee thereof). However, if the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will investigate the reasons and consider whether to retain Ernst & Young or appoint another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Board of Directors and the Audit Committee in their discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. 
Principal Accountant Fees and Services 
The following table sets forth all fees paid or accrued by us for professional audit services and other services rendered by Ernst & Young during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Audit Fees(1)    $ 1,468,415      $ 1,857,608   
 Audit-Related Fees      —          —     
 Tax Fees(2)      249,500        152,000   
 All Other Fees      —          —     
 Total:    $ 1,717,915      $ 2,009,608   
  (1)  Audit Fees consist of fees for professional services provided in connection with the annual audit of our  consolidated financial statements, and in the year ended December 31 2018, our internal control over financial reporting, the review of our quarterly financial statements, consultations on accounting matters directly related to the audit,  consents and assistance with and review of documents filed with the SEC, including services that are normally provided in connection with registration statements, including the registration statement for our IPO.

  (2)  Tax Fees consist of fees for professional services in connection with tax compliance, tax planning, and tax  advice, including foreign tax return preparation and requests for rulings or technical advice from tax authorities.  
[END TABLE]
 Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
Consistent with requirements of the SEC and the PCAOB regarding auditor independence, our Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of our independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, our Audit Committee as a whole, or through its Chair, pre-approves all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. The committee may delegate to one or more members of the committee the authority to pre-approve any such services, provided such pre-approval is reported to the committee at a subsequent meeting. The Audit Committee has delegated to the Chair of the Audit Committee the authority to pre-approve audit services (other than the annual audit engagement), audit-related services, tax services and other permissible non-audit services, provided that the Chair reports any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG AS OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL 3 
NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF 
FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act provides that stockholders must be given the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding advisory basis, for their preference as to how frequently we should seek future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. We are required to solicit stockholder votes on the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers at least once every six years, although we may seek stockholder input more frequently.
By voting with respect to this Proposal 3, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer that we conduct future non-binding advisory votes to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers every one, two or three years. Stockholders also may, if they wish, abstain from casting a vote on this Proposal 3. Our Board of Directors has determined that an annual non-binding advisory vote to approve the compensation of our Named Executive Officers will allow our stockholders to provide timely and direct input on our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices as disclosed in the proxy statement each year. Our Board of Directors believes that an annual vote is therefore consistent with the Company's efforts to engage in an ongoing dialogue with our stockholders on executive compensation and corporate governance matters. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote on the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of CarGurus, Inc. approve the submission by the Company of a non-binding advisory say-on-pay resolution pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Every year  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Every two years; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Every three years.  
[END TABLE]
We recognize that our stockholders may have different views as to the best approach for the Company, and therefore we look forward to hearing from our stockholders as to their preferences on the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. This vote is advisory and not binding on the Company or our Board of Directors. Although non-binding, our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee value the opinions that stockholders express in their votes and will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding the frequency of future non-binding advisory votes on the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 
The proxy card provides stockholders with the opportunity to choose among four options (holding the vote every one, two or three years, or abstaining) and, therefore, stockholders will not be voting to approve or disapprove the recommendation of our Board of Directors. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE OPTION OF "EVERY YEAR" AS THE PREFERRED FREQUENCY FOR FUTURE NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTES TO APPROVE THE COMPENSATION OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  OTHER MATTERS 
Stockholder Proposals for 2020 Annual Meeting 
Requirements for stockholder proposals to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials – Stockholders may present proper proposals for inclusion in our proxy statement and for consideration at our next annual meeting of stockholders by submitting their proposals in writing to our Secretary in a timely manner. In order to be included in the proxy statement for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholder proposals must be received by our Secretary no later than November 28, 2019 and must otherwise comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. 
Requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations to be brought before an annual meeting – In addition, our amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders who wish to present certain matters before an annual meeting of stockholders or nominate any person or persons for election to our Board of Directors. In general, to be properly brought before an annual meeting, nominations for the election of directors or other such business must be: (1) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of our Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), (2) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our Board of Directors (or any committee thereof) or (3) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by a stockholder who is a stockholder of record or beneficial owner of shares of our capital stock at the time such notice of meeting is delivered, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complies with the other notice procedures set forth in our bylaws. Written notice must be delivered to our Secretary no later than the deadlines for notice discussed below and must contain specified information concerning the nominees and the stockholder proposing such nominations and specified information regarding any other proposals as set forth in Section 2.12 of our amended and restated bylaws. A copy of the full text of the bylaw provisions discussed above may be obtained free of charge by writing to our Secretary. 
To be timely, notice must be delivered to or mailed and received at our principal executive offices: (x) not later than the close of business on the ninetieth (90th) calendar day, or earlier than the close of business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) calendar day, in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting if such meeting is to be held on a day which is not more than thirty (30) calendar days in advance of the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting or not later than sixty (60) calendar days after the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting; and (y) with respect to any other annual meeting of stockholders, the close of business on the tenth (10th) calendar day following the date of public disclosure of the date of such meeting. As a result, the period for submitting proposals or nominations for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders is between January 8, 2020 and February 7, 2020. 
If a stockholder who has notified us of his or her intention to present a proposal at an annual meeting does not appear to present his or her proposal at such meeting, we need not present the proposal for vote at such meeting. 
In addition, stockholders are required to comply with any applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 
Householding of Proxy Materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers or other nominees, to satisfy delivery requirements for annual reports and proxy statements with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single annual report and/or proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
