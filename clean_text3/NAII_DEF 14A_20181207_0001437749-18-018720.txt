PROXY STATEMENT
We are providing this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors of Natural Alternatives International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company" or "we," "our," or "us"), for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Friday, December 7, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time, at Natural Alternatives International, Inc., 1215 Park Center Drive, Vista CA 92081 and at any adjournment or postponement thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). We expect to mail this proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card on or about November 2, 2018 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
VOTING INFORMATION
Who can vote? 
You may vote if you were a stockholder of record as of the close of business on October 22, 2018. This date is known as the record date. You are entitled to one vote for each share of common stock you held on that date on each matter presented at the Annual Meeting. As of October 22, 2018, 7,570,871 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, were issued and outstanding, net of 1,105,806 treasury shares.
How many votes are needed to hold the Annual Meeting? 
To take any action at the Annual Meeting, a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote as of October 22, 2018, must be represented, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. This is called a quorum.
What is a proxy? 
A "proxy" allows someone else to vote your shares on your behalf. Our Board of Directors is asking you to allow Mark A. LeDoux, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Kenneth E. Wolf, our President and Chief Operating Officer, to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting.
How do I vote by proxy? 
Whether you hold shares directly as a stockholder of record or beneficially in street name, you may vote without attending the Annual Meeting. You may vote by granting a proxy or, for shares held in street name, by submitting voting instructions to your broker or nominee. To vote by proxy, please follow the instructions on the enclosed proxy card. You may vote by telephone, by Internet or by mail. Shares held in street name may be voted by telephone or by Internet only if your broker or nominee makes those methods available. Your broker or nominee will enclose instructions for voting shares held in street name by telephone or by Internet with this proxy statement if your broker or nominee has chosen to make those methods available.
If you vote by proxy, your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner you indicate. If you vote by mail and return a signed proxy card with no specific instructions, your shares will be voted as the Board of Directors recommends.
Can I change my vote after I submit my proxy? 
Yes. You can change or revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted by submitting another proxy with a later date. You may also send a written notice of revocation to Natural Alternatives International, Inc., 1535 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California 92008, Attention: Mr. Kenneth Wolf, Secretary.
Can I vote in person at the Annual Meeting instead of voting by proxy? 
Yes. However, we encourage you to vote your shares at your earliest convenience to ensure that your shares are represented and voted. If you vote your shares by proxy and later decide you would like to attend the meeting and vote your shares in person, you will need to provide a written notice of revocation to the secretary of the meeting before your proxy is voted.
How are votes counted? 
Except as noted, all proxies received will be counted in determining whether a quorum exists and whether we have obtained the necessary number of votes on each proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum for the Annual Meeting, but broker non-votes are not counted for purposes of determining the number of shares entitled to vote with respect to any proposal. Accordingly, broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for the election of directors or any other proposed matter. Generally, broker non-votes occur when shares held by a broker for a beneficial owner are not voted with respect to a particular proposal because (i) the broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner and (ii) the broker lacks discretionary voting power to vote such shares.
Stockholders of record who are present in person or by proxy and who abstain, including brokers holding customers' shares of record who cause abstentions to be recorded at the meeting, are considered stockholders who are present and entitled to vote on the proposals. Accordingly, a properly executed proxy marked "ABSTAIN" or "WITHHOLD" with respect to any matter will not be voted, will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors, and will have the same effect as a vote "AGAINST" any other proposed matter.
What is the effect of not casting my vote? 
If you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that you cast your vote if you want it to count in the election of directors. In the past, if you held your shares in street name and you did not indicate how you wanted your shares voted in the election of directors, your bank or broker was allowed to vote those shares on your behalf in the election of directors as they felt appropriate.
Recent changes in regulations were made to take away the ability of your bank or broker to vote your uninstructed shares in the election of directors on a discretionary basis. Thus, if you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank or broker how to vote in the election of directors, no votes will be cast on your behalf. Your bank or broker will, however, continue to have discretion to vote any uninstructed shares on the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm.
How many votes are required to approve each of the proposals? 
For the election of the Class I directors, a plurality of the votes is required for the election of the directors. This means that the two candidates who receive the most votes will be elected to the available Class I positions on the Board of Directors. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required to approve all of the other proposals.
As of October 22, 2018, our executive officers and directors were entitled to vote 2,035,163 shares, or approximately 26.88% of our issued and outstanding common stock. Our executive officers and directors have indicated their intention to vote "for" the election of the nominees for Class I director, and "for" Proposal 2.
You will not have any rights of appraisal or similar dissenter's rights with respect to any matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting.
Who pays for this proxy solicitation? 
We will pay the cost of soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the costs of preparing, assembling and mailing the proxy materials. We will provide copies of proxy materials to fiduciaries, custodians and brokerage houses to forward to the beneficial owners of shares held in their name. We may reimburse such fiduciaries, custodians and brokers for their costs in forwarding the proxy materials.
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, certain of our officers and other employees may also solicit proxies personally or by telephone, facsimile, or other means. No additional compensation will be paid to these individuals for any such services.
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Board Members 
Our Board of Directors is responsible for the overall management of the Company. The Board of Directors is divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II and Class III. The Board of Directors currently includes two Class I directors, two Class II directors, and one Class III director. Members of each class of our Board of Directors are elected to serve for a three-year term. The three-year terms of the members of each class are staggered, so that each year the members of a different class are due to be elected at the annual meeting. The Class I directors are currently serving a term that is due to expire at the Annual Meeting. The Class II directors are currently serving a term that is due to expire at our 2019 annual meeting, and the Class III director is serving a term that is due to expire at the next annual meeting thereafter. The name, age, positions held with the Company, and term of office of each of our directors are shown below.

We believe Mr. LeDoux's qualifications to continue to serve on our Board of Directors include his extensive industry, technical and Company knowledge, his experience as one of the founders of the Company and his long service as a director and executive officer of the Company.
Lee G. Weldon 
Mr. Weldon has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1992, a member of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors since 1993, and a member of the Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors since 2004.

He has more than 40 years of management experience in the nutritional supplement business, including all aspects of operations, sales, marketing, finance and strategic planning, having led several companies within the industry, including a former customer of the Company.
Board Meetings 
The Board of Directors held four meetings during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all members of the Board of Directors attended all of the meetings held by the Board of Directors, and all of the members of each of the committees of the Board of Directors attended all of the meetings of each of the committees on which they served.
Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board of Directors is comprised of five members, four of whom are independent. The remaining member, Mr. LeDoux, is the Company's founder, Chief Executive Officer and largest stockholder. Mr. LeDoux also serves as the Chairman of the Board. We do not have a lead independent director. The Chairman of the Board is not an officer position. The Chairman presides over meetings of the Board of Directors but in his capacity as a director Mr. LeDoux does not possess any other rights or responsibilities as a result of being the Chairman of the Board that differ from the other members of the Board of Directors. We believe a five-member board, 80% of which is comprised of independent members, is appropriate for the size and operations of our Company. The Board of Directors has Audit, Human Resources and Nominating Committees as described in more detail below. The Board of Directors is principally responsible for providing risk oversight of the Company.
Independence 
Nasdaq rules require listed companies to have a board of directors with at least a majority of independent directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that four of our five directors are independent under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. The members determined to be independent are Messrs. Davis, Dunn, Lane and Weldon.
Board Committees 
The Board of Directors has an Audit Committee, a Human Resources Committee, which includes the functions of a compensation committee, and a Nominating Committee. Membership on each committee is limited to independent directors as defined under the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. In addition, members of the Audit Committee must also meet the independence standards for audit committee members adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). The members of the committees of our Board of Directors are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Committee        Human Resources Committee        Nominating Committee

 Alan J. Lane*        Alan G. Dunn        Alan J. Lane  
 *   The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Davis, Lane and Dunn are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable rules adopted by the SEC.  
[END TABLE]
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, the Audit Committee held four meetings, the Human Resources Committee held two meetings, and the Nominating Committee held one meeting.
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee operates under a charter originally adopted by the Board of Directors in 2000, amended and restated in April 2004, and further amended in August 2007 and September 2009. While the Audit Committee charter is not currently available on our website, a copy of the charter, as amended, was included as Attachment A to the Company's proxy statement for fiscal year 2011-2012. The general function of the Audit Committee is to oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits of our financial statements. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the accounting, reporting and financial practices of the Company, including the integrity of our financial statements and disclosures; the surveillance of administration and financial controls and our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the qualification, independence and performance of our independent registered public accounting firm; and the performance of our internal audit function and control procedures. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending matters to the Board of Directors, but has no authority to make final decisions except as set forth in the Audit Committee's charter. The Audit Committee has the sole authority to appoint, determine funding for, and oversee our independent registered public accounting firm.
Human Resources Committee. The Human Resources Committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors in January 2006, and amended in August 2007, September 2009 and September 2015. While the Human Resources Committee charter is not currently available on our website, a copy of the charter, as amended, was included as Attachment A to the Company's proxy statement for the fiscal year 2014-2015. The primary purpose of the Human Resources Committee is to oversee the Company's overall compensation and incentive programs for the Company's executive officers and certain other key personnel. The Human Resources Committee is responsible for reviewing and recommending matters to the Board of Directors, which may be based on recommendations from the Company's management, but has no authority to make final decisions except with respect to the Company's incentive plans as described below or as otherwise set forth in the committee's charter. Among other things, the Human Resources Committee recommends to the Board of Directors the amount of compensation to be paid or awarded to our officers and certain other personnel including salary, bonuses, other cash or stock awards under our incentive compensation plans as in effect from time to time, retirement and other compensation, and is responsible for evaluating the performance of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and making recommendations to the Board of Directors concerning the compensation for such officer. In addition, the Human Resources Committee has delegated to its Chairman the authority to administer the Company's 2009 Omnibus Incentive Plan with respect to employees who are not officers or directors of the Company, to the sole extent of approving stock option grants under the plan to such employees, within the limitations of such plan, and only for grants proposed by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer not exceeding 5,000 shares, and with a term not exceeding five years, an exercise price equal to at least 110% of the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant, and vesting over a period of not less than three years. The Human Resources Committee may engage the services of an independent compensation and benefits consulting company when the committee deems appropriate to conduct a survey and review of the Company's compensation programs as compared to other similarly situated companies taking into account, among others, industry, size and location.
Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee operates under a charter adopted by the Board of Directors in August 2004, and amended in August 2007 and September 2009. While the Nominating Committee charter is not currently available on our website, a copy of the charter, as amended, was included as Attachment C to the Company's proxy statement for fiscal year 2011-2012. The purpose of the Nominating Committee is to assist the Board of Directors in identifying qualified individuals to become members of the Board of Directors and in determining the composition of the Board of Directors and its various committees. The Nominating Committee periodically reviews the qualifications and independence of directors, selects candidates as nominees for election as directors, recommends directors to serve on the various committees of the Board of Directors, reviews director compensation and benefits, and oversees the self-assessment process of each of the committees of the Board of Directors.
The Nominating Committee considers nominee recommendations from a variety of sources, including nominees recommended by stockholders. Persons recommended by stockholders are evaluated on the same basis as persons suggested by others. Stockholder recommendations may be made in accordance with our Stockholder Communications Policy. See "Stockholder Communications with Directors" below. The Nominating Committee has the authority to retain a search firm to assist in the process of identifying and evaluating candidates.
The Nominating Committee has not established any specific minimum requirements for potential members of our Board of Directors. Instead, the Nominating Committee's evaluation process includes many factors and considerations including, but not limited to, a determination of whether a candidate meets Nasdaq and/or SEC requirements relating to independence and/or financial expertise, as applicable, and whether the candidate meets the Company's desired qualifications in the context of the current make-up of the Board of Directors with respect to factors such as business experience, education, intelligence, leadership capabilities, integrity, competence, dedication, diversity, skills, and the overall ability to contribute in a meaningful way to the deliberations of the Board of Directors respecting the Company's business strategies, financial and operational performance and corporate governance practices. The Nominating Committee will generally select those nominees whose attributes it believes would be most beneficial to the Company in light of all the circumstances.
Stockholder Communications with Directors 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Stockholder Communications Policy to provide a process by which our stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors. Under the policy, stockholders may communicate with the Board of Directors as a whole, with the independent directors, with a committee of the Board, or with a particular director. Stockholders wishing to communicate directly with our Board of Directors may do so by mail addressed to Natural Alternatives International, Inc., 1535 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California, 92008, Attn: Corporate Secretary. The envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Stockholder-Board Communication" or "Stockholder-Director Communication." All such letters must identify the author as a stockholder of the Company and clearly state whether the intended recipients are all members of the Board of Directors, all independent directors, all members of a committee of the Board, or certain specified individual directors. The Corporate Secretary will review the communications received from stockholders at the above designated address on a regular basis and if they are relevant to the Company's operations and policies, they will be copied and forwarded to the appropriate director or directors as expeditiously as reasonably practical. By way of example, communications that are unduly hostile, threatening, obscene, illegal or similarly inappropriate will not be forwarded to any director. Matters deemed to be trivial in the sole discretion of the Corporate Secretary will be delivered to the appropriate director or directors at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. The Corporate Secretary will periodically provide the Board of Directors with a summary of all communications received that were not forwarded and will make those communications available to any director upon request. The Board of Directors will determine whether any communications sent to the Board of Directors should be properly addressed by the entire Board or a committee thereof and whether a response to the communication is warranted.
Attendance at Annual Meetings 
The members of the Board of Directors are encouraged, but not required, to attend each of the Company's annual meetings of stockholders. It may not be possible or practical, in light of other business commitments of the directors, for all of the members of the Board of Directors to attend all of the Company's annual meetings of stockholders. At the Company's most recent annual meeting of stockholders held on December 5, 2017, all of the members of the Board of Directors were present.
PROPOSAL 1 
ELECTION OF CLASS I DIRECTORS 
Nominees 
At the Annual Meeting, two Class I directors are to be elected, to serve until the next meeting of stockholders held to elect Class I directors and until their respective successors are elected and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal. The Board of Directors proposes the election of the nominees named below, who currently serve as Class I members of our Board of Directors.
Unless authorization to do so is withheld, proxies received will be voted "for" the nominees named below. If either of the nominees should become unavailable for election before the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as the present Board of Directors may propose. The person nominated for election has agreed to serve if elected, and the Board of Directors has no reason to believe that the nominee will be unable to serve.
Our Board of Directors proposes the election of the following nominees as the Class I members of the Board of Directors:
Joe E. Davis
Mark A. LeDoux
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" the election of the nominees as 
Class I directors of the Company.
PROPOSAL 2 
RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF 
INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected and approved Haskell & White LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019. One or more representatives of Haskell & White LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions and to make a statement if they desire to do so. Haskell & White LLP was first appointed to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015.
Audit Fees 
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Haskell & White LLP, billed us aggregate fees in the amount of $187,575 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, and $187,845 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual financial statements, the reviews of the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other services provided in connection with our regulatory filings.
Audit-Related Fees 
There were fees in the amount of $8,500 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 billed to the Company by Haskell & White LLP for assurance and related services reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and not included under "Audit Fees." There were no audit-related fees billed to the Company by Haskell & White LLP for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017.
Tax Fees 
There were no tax fees billed to the Company by Haskell & White LLP during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
All Other Fees
There were no other fees billed to the Company by Haskell & White LLP for products and services provided during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and June 30, 2017.
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
On June 23, 2003, the Audit Committee approved certain policies and procedures under which all audit and non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. Under these policies and procedures, proposed services to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm may either be pre-approved without consideration of specific case-by-case services by the Audit Committee ("general pre-approval"), or require the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee ("specific pre-approval"). The Audit Committee may delegate either type of pre-approval authority to one or more of its members, who would then be required to report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. Unless a type of service has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee if it is to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budgeted amounts also will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. In granting both general and specific pre-approval, the Audit Committee will consider whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on auditor independence, as well as whether our independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as familiarity with our business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile and other factors, and whether the service might enhance our ability to manage or control risk or improve audit quality. The term of any general pre-approval will be 12 months, unless the Audit Committee determines otherwise. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all of the audit and non-audit services described herein were approved pursuant to these policies and procedures, as adopted by the Audit Committee, and none of the services were approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to a waiver of pre-approval, as contemplated by Regulation S-X, Rule 201(c)(7)(i)(C).
Audit Services. The annual audit services engagement terms and fees are subject to specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Audit services include the annual financial statement audit and quarterly reviews, subsidiary audits, and other services necessary for the auditors to form an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee monitors the audit services engagement no less frequently than quarterly and also approves, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, Company structure or other items. In addition, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to other audit services, which include statutory or financial audits for subsidiaries of the Company and services associated with SEC registration statements, periodic reports and other documents filed with the SEC or issued in connection with securities offerings.
Audit-Related Services. The Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval of audit-related services, which are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company's financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent registered public accounting firm. Audit-related services include due diligence services pertaining to any potential business acquisitions or dispositions, consultations related to accounting, financial reporting or disclosure matters not classified as audit services, assistance with the implementation of new accounting and financial reporting rules and guidance, financial audits of employee benefit plans, and assistance with internal control reporting requirements.
Tax Services. To the extent the Company retains its independent registered public accounting firm to provide tax services, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval for those tax services that historically have been provided by its independent registered public accounting firm and that the Audit Committee has reviewed and determined would not impair the independence of the auditor. Generally, tax services involving large and complex transactions must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee. For quite a few years the Company has exclusively used another firm of Certified Public Accountants to provide tax services and has not relied for tax services upon the independent registered public accounting firm that provides the Company audit and audit related services.
Other Services. The Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit services that it determines are routine and recurring services and that would not impair auditor independence. All other services not otherwise classified above must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
Procedures. All services proposed to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that do not require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee are submitted to the Company's Chief Financial Officer, who determines whether such services are included within those that have received general pre-approval by the Audit Committee. All services proposed to be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm that require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee are submitted to the Audit Committee or its delegated member by both the independent registered public accounting firm and the Company's Chief Financial Officer. The Chief Financial Officer is responsible for monitoring the performance of the services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, determining whether such services are in compliance with the Audit Committee's pre-approval policies, and reporting the results of his monitoring on a periodic basis to the Audit Committee.
Effect of Ratification 
Ratification by stockholders of the selection of Haskell & White LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by applicable law. However, as a matter of policy and sound corporate practice, we are submitting the selection to our stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. If stockholders fail to ratify the selection of Haskell & White LLP, the Board of Directors will reconsider the matter. Even if the selection is ratified by stockholders, the Board of Directors may select a different firm to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it believes a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
Our Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote "FOR" Proposal 2.

In certain cases, subsidiaries of Dimensional Fund Advisors LP may act as an adviser or sub-adviser to certain Funds. In its role as investment advisor, sub-adviser and/or manager, Dimensional Fund Advisors LP or its subsidiaries (collectively, "Dimensional") may possess voting and/or investment power over the securities of the Issuer that are owned by the Funds and may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares of the Issuer held by the Funds.

The foregoing is based entirely on the statements of Dimensional Fund Advisors LP as set forth in its Schedule 13G filing.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Each of the non-employee directors (Messrs. Davis, Dunn, Lane and Weldon) receives an annual retention fee of $10,000, and a fee of $1,000 for each board and committee meeting such director attends. The $1,000 paid for each board and committee meeting a director attends applies to both regular and special meetings of the board and of a committee, including any regular or special meetings of the board or a committee held via teleconference, unless otherwise expressly determined by the Board on a case by case basis; provided, however, that payment for attendance at committee meetings in person or by telephone shall only be made to members of the applicable committee. The annual retention fee is paid in advance at the beginning of each year of a director's term, which is determined to commence on the date of the annual meeting held to elect any class of directors and to continue until the next annual meeting of stockholders held to elect any class of directors. Directors appointed during a term year may receive a proportional amount of the annual retention fee for that year. Options and other equity awards may be granted to directors on a discretionary basis. Mr. LeDoux receives no additional compensation for serving as a director. Directors are reimbursed for travel and other expenses incurred in connection with attending board and committee meetings. The Company may invite directors and their spouses to attend Company-related events and generally provides for, or reimburses expenses of, such directors' and spouses' travel, food and lodging for attendance at such events. The table below provides information about the compensation of the Company's directors during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018.

CODE OF ETHICS 
We have adopted a Code of Business Behavior and Conduct that applies to all of our employees and directors, including all of our officers and our non-employee directors. The Audit Committee periodically reviews the policy and the Company's compliance with the policy. A copy of our Code of Business Behavior and Conduct is posted on our website at www.nai-online.com. Our Code of Business Behavior and Conduct is not incorporated in, and is not a part of, this proxy statement and is not proxy-soliciting material.
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors, executive officers and any person who owns more than 10% of our common stock, to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership of our common stock within 10 days of becoming a director, executive officer or greater than 10% stockholder, and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock before the end of the second business day following the day on which a transaction resulting in a change of ownership occurs. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulations to provide us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of Section 16(a) reports provided to us during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, all required Section 16(a) reports applicable to our directors, and executive officers were timely filed.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS
Pursuant to the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee conducts a review of all related party transactions for potential conflict of interest situations on an ongoing basis. The Company may not enter into a related party transaction unless the transaction is approved by the Audit Committee. A transaction is considered a "related party transaction" if the transaction would be required to be disclosed herein pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K. There have been no material related party transactions since July 1, 2013, nor are any currently proposed.
Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 with the Company's management, and discussed with Haskell & White LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees". The Audit Committee received the written disclosures from Haskell & White LLP required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding independent accountant communications with audit committees concerning independence and discussed with Haskell & White LLP its independence. Based on the Audit Committee's above described review and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year for filing with the SEC.
Members of the Audit Committee
Joe E. Davis, Chairman
Alan G. Dunn
Alan J. Lane
The Audit Committee Report above is not considered proxy-soliciting material, is not deemed to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this proxy statement into any filing with the SEC, except to the extent we specifically incorporate this information by reference.
ANNUAL REPORT
Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 ("2018 Annual Report"), as filed with the SEC, excluding exhibits, is being mailed to stockholders with this proxy statement. We will furnish any exhibit to our 2018 Annual Report free of charge to any stockholder upon written request to the Company at 1535 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California 92008. The 2018 Annual Report is not incorporated in, and is not a part of, this proxy statement and is not proxy-soliciting material. We encourage you to review the 2018 Annual Report, and any later information that we file with the SEC and other publicly available information.
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS
Stockholders who wish to submit a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials to be distributed in connection with next year's annual meeting must submit their proposal so that we receive it no later than the close of business on August 12, 2019. Any such proposal must be in accordance with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Pursuant to such rule, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee that it will be included in our proxy materials.
In accordance with our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, to be properly brought before an annual meeting, a stockholder must deliver timely notice of any matter the stockholder wishes to present. To be timely, we must receive the notice at least 60 days before the original scheduled meeting date. However, if we provide less than 70 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the meeting date, to be timely we must receive the notice before the close of business on the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which we mailed notice of the meeting date or the day on which we publicly disclosed the meeting date. To be in proper form, the notice must be in writing and include the specified information set forth in Article Fifteenth of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation.
All proposals and notices should be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to Natural Alternatives International, Inc., 1535 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California 92008, Attn: Mr. Kenneth Wolf, Secretary. We reserve the right to reject, rule out of order, or take other appropriate action with respect to any proposal or matter that does not comply with these and other applicable requirements.
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.
Brokers with account holders who are the Company's Stockholders may be "householding" the Company's proxy materials. A single Proxy Statement may be delivered to multiple Stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Stockholders. If you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement and annual report, please notify your broker. If you currently receive multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and annual report at your addresses and would like to request "householding" of your communications, you should contact your broker.
Please note that only one Proxy Statement and annual report may be delivered to two or more Stockholders who share an address, unless the Company has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and annual report or for instructions as to how to request a separate copy of this document and annual report or as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies of this document and annual report are received, Stockholders should contact the Company at the address and phone number set forth below.
Requests should be directed to the Company at 1535 Faraday Avenue, Carlsbad, California 92008. Copies of these documents may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's home page on the Internet at http://www.sec.gov.
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board of Directors does not know of any other matters that will be presented for consideration at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof, the proxy holders named in the accompanying proxy card will have discretionary authority to vote all proxies in accordance with their best judgment with respect to any such matters.
