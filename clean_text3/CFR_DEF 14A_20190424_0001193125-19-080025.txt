PROXY STATEMENT FOR THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
To Be Held on April 24, 2019 
INTRODUCTION 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. ("Cullen/Frost" or the "Company") is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") and any adjournment or postponement thereof. The Annual Meeting will be held in the Commanders Room at Frost Bank, 100 West Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205, on Wednesday, April 24, 2019 at 11:00 a.m., San Antonio time. This Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card will be mailed to shareholders beginning on or about March 20, 2019. 
IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS: 
We are pleased to provide access to our proxy materials on the Internet. We have elected to provide access to our proxy materials both by sending you this full set of proxy materials, including a proxy card, and by notifying you of the availability of our proxy materials on the Internet. This Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and our 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders are available at our proxy materials website at cfrvoteproxy.com. This website does not use any functions that identify you as a visitor to the website, and thus protects your privacy. 
You have the option to vote and submit your proxy over the Internet. If you have Internet access, we encourage you to record your vote over the Internet. We believe it will be convenient for you, and it saves postage and processing costs. In addition, when you vote over the Internet, your vote is recorded immediately, and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your vote to arrive late and therefore not be counted. If you do not vote over the Internet, please vote by telephone or by completing and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage prepaid envelope provided. Submitting your proxy over the Internet or by telephone or mail will not affect your right to vote in person if you decide to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Record Date and Voting Rights 
The close of business on March 5, 2019 has been fixed as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The only class of securities of Cullen/Frost outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is our Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share. On March 5, 2019, there were 63,063,022 shares of Common Stock outstanding, with each share entitled to one vote. 
Proxies 
All shares of Cullen/Frost Common Stock represented by properly executed proxies, if timely returned and not subsequently revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in the manner directed in the proxy. If a properly executed proxy does not specify a choice on a matter, the shares will be voted for the fifteen nominees to serve on the Board as Directors (each, a "Director") for a one-year term that will expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting of 
-1- 
 Shareholders, for the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP to act as our independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year, for the non-binding approval of executive compensation, and in the discretion of the persons named as proxies with respect to any other business that may properly come before the meeting. 
A shareholder may revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted by delivering a written revocation notice to the Corporate Secretary of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., 100 West Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205. A shareholder who attends the Annual Meeting may, if desired, vote by ballot at the meeting, and such vote will revoke any proxy previously given. 
Quorum and Voting Requirements 
A quorum of shareholders is required to hold a valid meeting. If the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Cullen/Frost Common Stock entitled to vote are present at the Annual Meeting in person or represented by proxy, a quorum will exist. Abstentions and broker non-votes, are counted as "present" for establishing a quorum. 
Directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast by the holders of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock entitled to vote at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present, provided that if the number of Director nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected at such a meeting, the Directors shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the holders of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock entitled to vote at such meeting at which a quorum is present. With respect to the election of Directors, (i) a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" the election of a Director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that Director and (ii) abstentions and broker non-votes shall not be counted as votes cast either "for" or "against" any nominee for Director. 
With respect to the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP to act as our independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock entitled to vote on this proposal, and who are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, will be the act of the shareholders. In voting for this matter, shares may be voted "for", "against" or "abstain". An abstention will have the effect of a vote against this matter. 
With respect to the resolution to provide nonbinding approval of executive compensation, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock entitled to vote on this proposal, and who are present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, will be the act of the shareholders. In voting for this matter, shares may be voted "for", "against" or "abstain". An abstention will have the effect of a vote against this matter. Broker non-votes (as further discussed below) will have no effect on the outcome of this vote. This resolution is advisory only and will not be binding upon Cullen/Frost or the Board. 
Under the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., member brokers generally may not vote shares held by them in street name for customers who do not provide voting instructions, and instead must submit a so-called "broker non-vote" unless they are permitted to vote the shares in their discretion under the rules of any national securities exchange of which they are members. Under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE"), a member broker that holds shares in street name for customers has authority to vote on certain "routine" items if it has transmitted proxy-soliciting materials to the beneficial owner but has not received instructions from that owner. The proposal to ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to act as Cullen/Frost's independent auditors is a "routine" item, and the NYSE rules permit member brokers that do not receive instructions to vote on this item. 
If you hold shares of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock through the Cullen/Frost 401(k) Stock Purchase Plan and do not provide voting instructions to the plan's trustees or administrators, such shares will be voted in the same proportion as the shares beneficially owned through such plan for which voting instructions are received, unless otherwise required by law. 
-2- 
Expenses of Solicitation 
Cullen/Frost will pay the expenses of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, Directors, officers, and employees of Cullen/Frost may solicit proxies by telephone, facsimile, in person or by other means of communication. Cullen/Frost also has retained Okapi Partners LLC ("Okapi") to assist with the solicitation of proxies. Directors, officers, and employees of Cullen/Frost will receive no additional compensation for the solicitation of proxies, and Okapi will receive a fee not to exceed $8,000.00, plus reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses. Cullen/Frost has requested that brokers, nominees, fiduciaries and other custodians forward proxy-soliciting material to the beneficial owners of Cullen/Frost Common Stock. Cullen/Frost will reimburse these persons for out-of-pocket expenses they incur in connection with its request.

The Board has adopted written charters of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Benefits Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, the Risk Committee and the Technology Committee. All of these charters are available at frostbank.com or in print to any shareholder making a request by contacting the Corporate Secretary, at 100 West Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205. As described in more detail below under "Certain Corporate Governance Matters—Director Independence," the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation and Benefits Committee, and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is independent within the meaning of the rules of the NYSE. The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. In addition, the Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is "financially literate" and that at least one member of the Audit Committee has "accounting or related financial management expertise," in each case within the meaning of the NYSE's rules. The Board has also determined that Ms. Cynthia J. Comparin and Mr. David J. Haemisegger are "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of the SEC's rules. 
Leadership Structure 
As provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board selects its Chair, Lead Director and CEO in a way that it considers to be in the best interests of Cullen/Frost. The Board does not have a policy on whether the role of Chair and CEO should be separate or combined, but believes that the most effective leadership structure for Cullen/Frost is to combine these responsibilities. This structure avoids the potential confusion and conflict over who is leading the Company, both within the Company and when dealing with investors, customers and counterparties, and the duplication of efforts that can result from the roles being separated. The Board also believes that combining these roles in one person enhances accountability for the performance of Cullen/Frost. Furthermore, as Cullen/Frost has traditionally combined these roles (for some 30+ years now), separating them could cause significant disruption in oversight and lines of reporting. Nevertheless, depending upon the circumstances, the Board could choose to separate the roles of Chair and CEO in the future. 
-7- 
To help ensure strong oversight by our non-management directors, our Audit Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, and Compensation and Benefits Committee are composed only of independent directors, and a majority of our Risk Committee, including the chairperson of the Risk Committee, is composed of independent directors. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee acts as the Lead Director and presides at executive sessions of non-management directors and presents to the full Board any matters that may need to be considered by the full Board. Mr. Charles W. Matthews, the current Lead Director, also is the Chair of the Compensation and Benefits Committee and is a member of several other Board committees. As a result, the Lead Director is well informed regarding all activities of the Board and most of its committees. In addition to presiding at the executive sessions of the non-management directors, the Lead Director also reviews the agenda, schedule and materials for each Board Meeting and Board committee meeting (for each committee on which he sits) and executive session, and facilitates communication between the non-management directors and the Chair and CEO. 
The Board is responsible for overseeing all aspects of management of Cullen/Frost, including risk oversight, which is effected primarily through the Audit and Risk Committees. The Risk Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities for oversight of the Company's enterprise-wide risk management framework, including reviewing the Company's overall risk appetite, risk management strategy and the policies and practices established by the Company's management to identify and manage risk to the Company. The Audit Committee receives reports on, and reviews, Frost Bank's principal risk exposure, including financial reporting, credit, and liquidity risk. Cullen/Frost management regularly discusses macro-economic and business-specific factors with the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee, as well as the potential impact of these factors on the risk profile (including the financial situation) of the Company. Cullen/Frost management also periodically reviews with the Board specific risk analyses, such as sensitivity and scenario analyses. In addition, the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee receive written packages and detailed oral postings on various types of risk and other matters (which come from a combination of the Company's CEO, CFO and Chief Risk Officer) at regularly scheduled meetings. The Board also interacts on a regular basis with executive officers, from both the control and line of business sides of Cullen/Frost. Furthermore, members of the Board of Cullen/Frost also serve as members of the Board of Directors of Frost Bank, and as such receive regular reports on the operations of Frost Bank. The Board of Directors of Frost Bank has an additional committee, the Wealth Advisors Committee, that is not a committee of the Board of Cullen/Frost. This Frost Bank Board committee has a majority of independent directors and reviews risks and approves policy exceptions in trust services. 
In addition, each standing committee of the Boards of Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank has oversight responsibility for risks inherent within its area of oversight. For example, the Technology Committee oversees the information technology security of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and Frost Bank, including cybersecurity issues, considerations and developments. Among other responsibilities, the Technology Committee reviews and discusses with management, as and when appropriate, risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding information technology security, including the quality and effectiveness of information technology security and disaster recovery capabilities. 
It is through these various channels that the Board receives the necessary information to oversee the Company's risk management. The Boards of Directors of Cullen/Frost and Frost Bank, and their relevant committees, typically meet in joint session. 
Director Nomination Process 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is responsible for identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board and for recommending to the Board the nominees to stand for election as Directors. 
In identifying Director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may seek input from Cullen/Frost's management and from current members of the Board. In addition, it may use the services of an outside consultant. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider candidates 
-8- 
 recommended by shareholders. Shareholders who wish to recommend candidates may do so by writing to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., c/o Corporate Secretary, 100 West Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205. Recommendations may be submitted at any time. The written recommendation must be made in the manner and form required by Cullen/Frost's Bylaws, including by providing the name of the candidate, the number of shares of Cullen/Frost Common Stock owned by the candidate and the information regarding the candidate that would be included in a proxy statement for the election of Directors pursuant to paragraphs (a), (e) and (f) of Item 401 of Regulation S-K adopted by the SEC. 
In evaluating Director candidates, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee initially considers the Board's need for additional or replacement Directors. It also considers the criteria approved by the Board and set forth in Cullen/Frost's Corporate Governance Guidelines, which include, among other things, the candidate's personal qualities (in light of Cullen/Frost's core values and mission statement), accomplishments and reputation in the business community, the fit of the candidate's skills and personality with those of other Directors and candidates, the ability of the candidate to commit adequate time to Board and committee matters and the candidate's contribution to the Board's overall diversity of viewpoints, background, experience and other demographics. The objective is to build a Board that is effective, collegial and responsive to the needs of Cullen/Frost. In addition, considerable emphasis is also given to Cullen/Frost's mission statement and core values, statutory and regulatory requirements, and the Board's goal of having a substantial majority of independent directors. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates all Director candidates in the same manner, including candidates recommended by shareholders. In considering whether candidates satisfy the criteria described above, the Committee will initially utilize the information it receives with the recommendation and other information it otherwise possesses. If it determines, in consultation with other Board members, including the Chair, that more information is needed, it may, among other things, conduct interviews.

Cullen/Frost employees receive no fees for their services as members of the Board of Directors or any of its committees. Beginning as of our 2018 Annual Meeting, non-employee Directors receive an annual cash retainer fee of $60,000. Additionally, the Lead Director receives an annual cash retainer of $15,000; the Audit Committee Chair receives an annual cash retainer of $20,000; the Compensation and Benefits Committee Chair receives an annual cash retainer of $12,000; and all other Committee Chairs receive an annual cash retainer of $10,000.

Non-employee Directors are also eligible to receive stock-based compensation each year under Cullen/Frost's 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. In April 2018, each non-employee Director in office at that time received 548 deferred stock units. Upon retirement from Cullen/Frost's Board of Directors, non-employee directors will receive one share of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock for each deferred stock unit held. The deferred stock units were fully vested upon being awarded and holders will receive equivalent dividend payments as such dividends are declared on Cullen/Frost's Common Stock. 
Each of the Cullen/Frost Directors also serves on the Board of Directors of Frost Bank, a subsidiary of Cullen/Frost. 
As outlined in its charter, the Compensation and Benefits Committee has the authority to review and make recommendations to the Board with respect to the components and amount of Board compensation in relation to other similarly situated companies. Periodically, but not less than every two years, the Committee directs its compensation consultant to provide an independent assessment of the Company's Board compensation program. The consultant analyzes and compares the Company's Board compensation program against the same peer group used to benchmark executive officer compensation (see page 27 for further details about the peer group). The Committee targets total Board compensation levels at a competitive range of peer group total Board compensation. The Committee considers total aggregate Board compensation and other factors when making recommendations to the Board for approval.

Miscellaneous Information 
There are no arrangements or understandings between any Director nominee of Cullen/Frost and any other person regarding such nominee's selection as such. 
CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Cullen/Frost believes that it has operated over the years with sound corporate governance practices that exemplify its commitment to integrity and to protect both the interests of its shareholders and the other constituencies that it serves. These practices include a substantially independent Board, periodic meetings of non-management Directors, and a sound and comprehensive code of conduct, which obligates Directors and all employees to adhere to the highest legal and ethical business practices. A review of some of Cullen/Frost's corporate governance measures is set forth below. 
-19- 
Director Independence 
The Board believes that a substantial majority of its members should be independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules. To this end, the Board reviews annually the relevant facts and circumstances regarding relationships between Directors and Cullen/Frost. The purpose of the Board's review is to determine whether any Director has a material relationship with Cullen/Frost (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Cullen/Frost). 
In connection with the Board's latest review, the Board determined that the following Director nominees, who compose 80% of the fifteen nominees, are independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules: Mr. Carlos Alvarez, Dr. Chris M. Avery, Ms. Cynthia J. Comparin, Mr. Samuel G. Dawson, Mr. Crawford H. Edwards, Mr. David J. Haemisegger, Mr. Jarvis V. Hollingsworth, Mrs. Karen E. Jennings, Mr. Richard M. Kleberg, III, Mr. Charles W. Matthews, Mrs. Ida Clement Steen, and Mr. Horace Wilkins, Jr. In addition, the Board determined that former Director Mr. Ruben M. Escobedo, who retired from the Board in April 2018, was independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules. 
Mr. Patrick B. Frost and Mr. Phillip D. Green are not independent because they are executive officers of Cullen/Frost. The Board has determined that Mr. Weston is not independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules because he controls, and has a 21% ownership interest in, entities that have entered into certain banking, property and service transactions with Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries, described under "Certain Transactions and Relationships", that exceed the quantitative thresholds set forth in the NYSE's bright-line independence tests. While these transactions involve payments to, and payments from, Frost Bank in amounts that exceed the greater of $1,000,000 and 2% of the Weston affiliated entities' consolidated gross revenues, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has reviewed each of these transactions in accordance with the criteria described in "Certain Transactions and Relationships-Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Party Transactions" and has determined that the transactions were all entered into in the ordinary course of business, have substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to Cullen/Frost, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. In particular, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee noted that Mr. Weston was not a Director or nominee for Director at the time these transactions were entered into. In addition, the Board determined that former Director R. Denny Alexander, who retired from the Board in April 2018, was no longer independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules because he is the managing general partner of, and owns a 13.33% interest in, an entity that received payments from subsidiaries of Cullen/Frost during 2017 in amounts that, for the first time, exceeded the greater of $1,000,000 and 2% of such entity's gross revenues. 
In making its independence determinations, the Board considers the NYSE's rules, as well as the standards set forth below. The Board adopted these standards pursuant to the NYSE's rules to assist in making independence determinations. For purposes of the standards, the term "Cullen/Frost Entity" means, collectively, Cullen/Frost and each of its subsidiaries. 
Credit Relationships.    A proposed or outstanding relationship that consists of an extension of credit by a Cullen/Frost Entity to a Director or a person or entity that is affiliated, associated or related to a Director should not be deemed to be a material relationship adversely affecting such Director's independence if it satisfies each of the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• It is not categorized as "classified" by the Cullen/Frost Entity or any regulatory authority that supervises the Cullen/Frost Entity.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• It is made on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that are substantially similar to those prevailing at the time for comparable  relationships with other unrelated persons or entities and, if subject to the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation O (12 C.F.R. Part 215), is made in accordance with Regulation O.  
[END TABLE]
-20- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In the event that it was not made, in the case of a proposed extension of credit, or it was terminated in the normal course of the Cullen/Frost  Entity's business, in the case of an outstanding extension of credit, the action would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Director or the business results of operations or financial condition of any person or  entity related to such Director.  
[END TABLE]
The Board determined that credit relationships with each of our independent Directors satisfied these criteria. 
Non-Credit Banking or Financial Products or Services Relationships.    A proposed or outstanding relationship in which a Director or a person or entity that is affiliated, associated or related to a Director procures non-credit banking or financial products or services from a Cullen/Frost Entity should not be deemed to be a material relationship adversely affecting such Director's independence if it (i) has been or will be offered in the ordinary course of the Cullen/Frost Entity's business and (ii) has been or will be offered on terms and under circumstances that were or are substantially similar to those prevailing at the time for comparable non-credit banking or financial products or services provided by the Cullen/Frost Entity to other unrelated persons or entities. The Board determined that non-credit banking or financial products or services relationships with each of our independent Directors satisfied these criteria. 
Property or Services Relationships.    A proposed or outstanding relationship in which a Director or a person or Entity that is affiliated, associated or related to a Director provides property or services to a Cullen/Frost Entity should not be deemed to be a material relationship adversely affecting such Director's independence if the property or services (i) have been or will be procured in the ordinary course of the Cullen/Frost Entity's business and (ii) have been or will be procured on terms and under circumstances that were or are substantially similar to those that the Cullen/Frost Entity would expect in procuring comparable property or services from other unrelated persons or entities. The Board determined that the following property or services relationships involving amounts less than $120 thousand satisfied these criteria: lease arrangements involving Cullen/Frost Entities and a company in which Mr. Crawford H. Edwards has interests; jewelry products provided to Cullen/Frost Entities by a company in which Dr. Chris M. Avery has interests; and engineering services provided to Cullen/Frost Entities by a company in which Mr. Samuel G. Dawson has interests. For details regarding relationships involving amounts greater than $120 thousand, see "Certain Transactions and Relationships" elsewhere in this document.

Delegation authority.    Although the Committee approves the normal annual grant of equity to officers, it delegates authority to the CEO to allocate a specified pool of equity compensation awards to address special needs as they arise. 
Role of executive officers.    After consulting with the Committee's compensation consultant, the CEO recommends to the Committee base salary, target incentive levels, actual incentive payments and long-term incentive grants for Company executive officers. The Committee considers, discusses and modifies the CEO's recommendations, as appropriate, and takes action on such proposals. The CEO does not make recommendations to the Committee on his own pay levels. The Committee, in executive session and without the CEO present, determines the pay levels for the CEO to be ratified by the Board.

Meridian's role is to serve and assist the Committee in its review and oversight of executive and director compensation practices and to assist the CEO and company management in reviewing, assessing, and developing recommendations for Cullen/Frost's executive compensation programs.

Specifically, the Committee took into account the six independence factors as adopted by the SEC in Rule 10C-1 under the Exchange Act and applicable NYSE rules. The Committee determined that Meridian is an independent adviser to the Committee. 
The Committee's consultant from Meridian attended all of the regularly scheduled Committee meetings in 2018. The Committee's consultant assisted the Committee with the market data and an assessment of executive compensation levels and program design, CEO compensation, outside Director compensation and support on various regulatory and technical issues. 
Compensation and Benefits Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
During the last fiscal year, none of the members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee (Dr. Chris M. Avery, Mrs. Karen E. Jennings, Mr. Charles W. Matthews and Mr. Ruben M. Escobedo, who retired from the Board effective April 25, 2018) was or had ever been one of our officers or employees. In addition, during the last fiscal year, none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or the compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation and Benefits Committee. Some of the members of the Compensation and Benefits Committee, and some of their associates, are current or past customers of one or more of Cullen/Frost's subsidiaries and, since January 1, 2018, transactions between these persons and such subsidiaries have occurred, including borrowings. In the opinion of management, all of the transactions have been in the ordinary course of business, have had substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the lender, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. Additional transactions may take place in the future. See "Certain Transactions and Relationships" for a description of an immediate family member of Mr. Charles W. Matthews and Cullen/Frost. 
Compensation and Benefits Committee Report 
The Compensation and Benefits Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on our review and discussions, we have recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into Cullen/Frost's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Executive Summary 
Cullen/Frost is a financial holding company, headquartered in San Antonio, Texas, with over 130 financial centers throughout Texas. We provide a wide range of banking, investment and insurance services to businesses and individuals in the Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Permian Basin, Rio Grande Valley, San Antonio and Victoria regions. Founded in 1868, we have helped clients with their financial needs during three centuries. Over the years, we've grown significantly, but what hasn't changed is our commitment to our values and to the relationships we've forged. Those relationships include our employees. We believe a key factor in our success is consistency—consistency in culture, philosophy and management as well as consistency in executive pay philosophy and practices. 
-24- 
At Cullen/Frost, we enjoy a strong history of sound and profitable performance. We believe everyone is significant at our Company and successful performance occurs when everyone works together as a team with common goals. As a result, our executive compensation programs generally focus on total company success. We believe in providing a "square deal" for our shareholders, customers and employees. Therefore, we generally target our executive compensation to be in a competitive range of our peer group while taking into account various other factors, including market conditions, company performance, internal equity, and individual experience levels, among other things. Because we believe Cullen/Frost is a safe and sound place to do business, we strive to avoid excessive risk, and do not offer executive compensation programs that would encourage the taking of such risks. Further, we believe that the consistency and continuity of our management team serves to enhance our conservative risk profile. The average tenure with Cullen/Frost of the five Named Executive Officers (as defined below) included in this proxy statement is in excess of 36 years. Finally, we structure our executive compensation programs to align management and shareholder interests. 
As we celebrate our 151st anniversary this year, we gratefully acknowledge that we enjoy a very rich history as a company. We appreciate a robust tradition of not only solid financial performance, but of strengthening and enhancing the communities we serve and making people's lives better. It is with pride and great anticipation that we carry this heritage and culture into our future. 
Key 2018 Company Performance Outcomes.    2018 was another great year for Cullen/Frost: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We achieved a strong level of net income of approximately $447 million (as disclosed in our annual report on Form  10-K filed with the SEC on February 6, 2019) realizing record earnings for our Company as well as significantly exceeding our budgeted expectations of $407 million.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As a result of our strong performance and consistent with our  pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, annual incentives paid to our Named Executive Officers for 2018 performance were generally paid at 15% above target.   
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Actions.    During 2018, in light of our continued strong financial performance, our management team's performance and to ensure that our executive team's compensation remains competitive with our peer group (as described below), the following decisions were made concerning compensation of the Named Executive Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increases to base pay approximating 2.4% on average effective January 1, 2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentive payments for 2018 performance paid in 2019 generally at 15% above target; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive award grants consisting of 50% performance share units and 50% restricted stock units.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that our executive compensation programs successfully balance elements of fixed compensation, short-term and long-term incentives and benefit programs consistent with our core values of integrity, caring and excellence. 
2018 Say On Pay Vote 
The 2018 Annual Shareholders Meeting was held on April 25th. The shareholders showed their approval of the Company's executive pay programs with over 97% of all votes cast being in favor of approval of the executive pay programs. The Compensation and Benefits Committee (the "Committee") and the Board were very appreciative of the positive vote and the strong message it delivered. The strong shareholder support has reaffirmed the Committee's approach to executive compensation philosophy and programs. Accordingly, for 2018 the Committee continued to administer the same conservative reward programs and to demonstrate the same consistent pay philosophies that have been in place historically.

Design of the Total Compensation Program and Overview of Compensation Decisions Made in 2018 
Pay Philosophy/Pay Determination Process 
In general, it is Cullen/Frost's compensation philosophy to target aggregate executive compensation for each of our executives to be in a competitive range of our peer group (as described below). Actual compensation realized by executives is primarily based on the Company's performance. In addition to external competitiveness, the Committee evaluates the following factors when making compensation decisions for executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance (Company, segment and individual);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Internal equity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strategic importance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Technical implications such as tax, accounting, and shareholder dilution; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advice from our independent compensation consultants.  
[END TABLE]
-26- 
The Committee does not assign a specific weighting to these factors and may exercise its discretion when making compensation decisions for Named Executive Officers. 
When reviewing the components of the compensation program, the Committee, together with Mr. Green, the Chief Human Resources Officer, and the Committee's independent compensation consultant, work to ensure the total package is competitive with the external marketplace and remains balanced from an internal equity standpoint. However, the Committee believes that it is the total package that should be competitive, and not necessarily the individual elements. 
Mr. Green makes recommendations to the Committee on the pay levels of his direct reports (including the other Named Executive Officers) for the Committee's review and approval. The Committee reviews a total compensation tally sheet for Mr. Green annually. Cullen/Frost uses the tally sheet to inform the Committee on Mr. Green's total compensation and accumulated wealth from the Company's equity and retirement benefit plans. Mr. Green does not make recommendations to the Committee on his own pay levels. The Committee, in executive session and without Mr. Green present, determines the pay levels for Mr. Green to be ratified by the Board. For additional information about the Committee's compensation-setting process, see the section above entitled "Compensation and Benefits Committee Governance" on page 22. 
The Committee does not maintain a stated policy with regard to cash versus non-cash compensation. However, the allocation of cash and non-cash compensation for each of the Named Executive Officers is reviewed by the Committee annually. 
In general, the Committee does not take into account amounts realizable from prior compensation when making future pay decisions. However, previous grant date amounts and values are considered, particularly when establishing long-term incentive award grant levels. 
In light of the volatility in the U.S. financial markets and the concern over executive compensation among financial institutions, the Committee has traditionally met at least annually with senior officers, including the Chief Risk Officer, along with the Committee's compensation consultant, to discuss the risk profile of our total executive compensation program for Named Executive Officers. For 2018, the Committee determined that the Company's total compensation program, which balances fixed compensation (base pay and retirement benefits) and various forms of shorter- and longer-term incentive pay (annual cash incentive and equity compensation), did not encourage excessive or unnecessary risks. 
Benchmarking and Peer Companies 
Under the direction of the Committee, the Company, together with Meridian, the Committee's independent external compensation consultant, conducts an annual competitiveness review of base pay, annual incentive pay and long-term incentive pay. The competitiveness of other forms of pay is reviewed on a periodic basis, as determined by the Committee. 
External market data is provided by Meridian. For purposes of benchmarking executive compensation, the Committee has determined that the external market should be defined as peer companies in the banking industry of a similar asset size to Cullen/Frost. For 2018, Meridian provided market data collected from public filings for the following 24 peer companies.

For 2018, Meridian reviewed our compensation peer group and recommended the following additions, which were approved by the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• IBERIABANK Corporation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PacWest Bancorp  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sterling Bancorp  
[END TABLE]
These new additions were recommended because each had grown to satisfy the existing peer group criteria. The peer group was developed based on the following criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Size—Companies with assets comparable to Cullen/Frost. The median asset size of the peer group listed above is $31.6 billion as of  June 30, 2018 as compared to Cullen/Frost's asset size of $30.7 billion as of the same date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Industry—Companies in the commercial banking industry sector.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Locality—Commercial banks headquartered across the United States.  
[END TABLE]
Additionally, market data was collected by Meridian from multiple published survey sources representing national financial institutions of a similar asset size to Cullen/Frost. The Committee believes that the combination of peer company data and survey data reflects Cullen/Frost's external market for business and executive talent. Accordingly, the Committee uses both of these sources when comparing Cullen/Frost's executive target aggregate compensation to the external market. The Committee does not utilize any stated weighting of external market data relative to other factors to determine compensation levels of the Named Executive Officers. Instead, the Committee, in consultation with Meridian evaluates the market data, along with the other factors listed previously to determine the appropriate compensation levels of the Named Executive Officers on an individual basis. 
Relation of Pay Practices to Risk Management 
Key elements of Cullen/Frost's mission are to build long-term relationships based on safe, sound assets. In support of its mission, our Company has long adhered to compensation policies and practices, described below, that are designed to support strong risk management. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We pay base salaries to our employees that are competitive and that represent a significant portion of their compensation and, therefore, do not  encourage excessive risk taking to increase compensation. We believe that our Company generally pays a greater share of total compensation to our employees in base salary than do our competitors which we believe is an effective risk management tool.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash annual incentive compensation, which represents a small percentage of the Company's total revenue, is awarded to many employees within  Cullen/Frost to encourage excellence in delivering value to our customers and sustained superior financial performance to our shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As our Company is dedicated to relationship banking, incentives for business line employees typically emphasize such factors as the level of client  contact and success in meeting clients' overall needs, as well as production volume.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our employees as a group, through long-term equity-based awards and investment in Company stock under the 401(k) Plan (described below) for employees  of Cullen/Frost, are significant holders of Cullen/Frost stock.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the points above, the Committee therefore does not believe that our compensation policies and practices encourage taking excessive or unnecessary risk. The Committee, together with our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Risk Officer, regularly reviews all plans identified as potentially creating risk, 
-28- 
 regardless of magnitude, particularly with respect to executive officers. Based on the structure of our Company's longstanding compensation policies and practices, the Committee believes that those compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Cullen/Frost. 
Elements of Compensation: the 2018 Compensation Program Detail and Key 2019 Actions 
Elements of Compensation 
To ensure achievement of our executive compensation program objectives, compensation is provided to the Named Executive Officers in the following elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Element     Purpose 
 Base Pay    Base Pay is an important element of executive compensation because it provides executives with a base level of monthly income. 
 Annual Incentive Compensation    Annual incentive compensation is provided to Named Executive Officers to recognize achievement of annual financial targets and is paid in accordance with the quantitative and  qualitative terms of the Bonus Plan for the Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Management Bonus Plan, which covers the other Named Executive Officers. 
 Long-Term Incentive Pay    Long-term incentives in the form of equity-based awards are awarded to the Named Executive Officers in an effort to align management and shareholder interests, ensure future  performance of Cullen/Frost, enhance stock ownership opportunities, and increase shareholder value, in each case, over the longer term. 
 Benefits and Perquisites    Cullen/Frost provides an employee benefits package, including retirement, along with health and welfare benefits, to remain competitive with the market and to help meet the  health and retirement security needs of our employees, including the Named Executive Officers. 
[END TABLE]
-29- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Compensation Element     Purpose 
 Agreements with Executive Officers    We do not provide severance benefits to our executive officers other than in the event of a qualifying termination following a change-in-control. 
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Program Detail 
Base Pay.    Base salary levels for our Named Executive Officers are listed in the chart below and are also shown in the Summary Compensation Table. During its Fall 2018 meeting, the Committee approved 2019 base pay increases for the Named Executive Officers. The increases were based on external market data provided by Meridian, internal equity, any change in responsibility, and each individual's performance. The base pay increases approved by the Committee are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officer    2018 Base Salary      2019 Base Salary% Change   
 Phillip D. Green    $ 990,000      $ 1,010,000        2.0%  
 Jerry Salinas      560,000        575,000        2.7%  
 Paul H. Bracher      565,000        585,000        3.5%  
 Patrick B. Frost      545,000        555,000        1.8%  
 William L. Perotti      545,000        555,000        1.8%  
[END TABLE]
The base pay increases approved by the Committee for the Named Executive Officers became effective January 1, 2019 and approximated an average of 2.4% of existing base pay. 
Annual Incentive Pay.    Annual incentive pay for our Named Executive Officers is paid under two different plans. 
-30- 
2018 Annual Incentives for the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; 2019 Action.    For 2018, the Committee approved Mr. Green's annual incentive target at 110% of his base salary. As described below, in 2018, we achieved record earnings of approximately $447 million. To determine Mr. Green's 2018 annual incentive payment amount, the Committee took into account our 2018 net income achievement and exercised discretion based on Mr. Green's 2018 performance under the following qualitative measures approved by the Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance Measures     Description 
 Operating Results    Provides direction to ensure that Cullen/Frost meets its financial goals, both in terms of achieving budgetary results and in its commitment to performance compared to its  peers. 
 Leadership    Leads Cullen/Frost, setting a philosophy—based on the corporate culture—that is well understood, widely supported, consistently applied, and effectively  implemented. 
 Strategic Planning    Establishes clear objectives and develops strategic policies to ensure growth in Cullen/Frost's core business and expansion through appropriate acquisitions. Is committed  to the utilization of advanced technology applications to support these growth goals, and maintains the long-term interest of Cullen/Frost in all actions. 
 Human Capital Management and Development    Ensures the effective recruitment of a diverse workforce, consistent retention of key employees and the ongoing motivation of all staff. Offers personal involvement in the  recruiting process and provides feedback. 
 Communications    Serves as chief spokesperson for Cullen/Frost, communicating effectively with all of its shareholders. 
 External Relations    Establishes and maintains relationships with the investment community to keep them informed on Cullen/Frost's progress. Serves in a leadership role in civic, professional  and community organizations. Reinforces key customer relationships through regular market visits and customer contacts. 
 Board Relations    Works closely with the Board to keep them fully informed on all important aspects of the status and development of Cullen/Frost. Facilitates the Board's composition and  committee structure, as well as its governance and any regulatory agency relations. 
[END TABLE]
The Board ratifies the annual incentive payment amount determined and certified by the Committee for Mr. Green. 
Cullen/Frost's net income budget for a given year typically represents a meaningful increase in earnings per share over the previous year. In finalizing a budget, the current economic, regulatory and interest rate environments are considered as well as market expectations. The budget must be ratified by the Board. For 2018, the Company's budgeted level for net income was $407 million. Actual performance for 2018 significantly exceeded this level, as the Company realized actual net income of approximately $447 million. 
In light of these factors, and taking into account the qualitative measures shown above, the Committee, in its discretion, elected to pay an annual incentive to Mr. Green at 15% above target or $1,252,350. This was ratified by the Board on January 30, 2019, and is shown in the Summary Compensation Table. 
At its October 2018 meeting, the Committee reviewed the competitiveness of Mr. Green's annual incentive target. The target level appeared to be generally consistent with prevailing target levels in the external market. Therefore, the Committee chose to maintain a 110% annual target incentive for Mr. Green for 2019. 
-31- 
2018 Annual Incentives for the Other Named Executives; 2019 Action.    The remaining Named Executive Officers participate in the Executive Management Bonus Plan. Annually, an incentive pool is generated based on the financial performance of Cullen/Frost versus the budgeted expectations for the year. The incentive pool is funded at target if Cullen/Frost's financial performance meets our budgeted net income goal and is funded below target if Cullen/Frost's financial performance falls below budget. A minimum percentage of budgeted net income must be achieved before the annual incentive pool is funded, and no incentive payments are made unless Cullen/Frost attains this minimum threshold. The incentive pool may be funded above target if Cullen/Frost achieves financial performance above budget. The Committee approves the corporate and individual objectives as well as the payment targets, which are expressed as a percentage of the executives' base salary earnings for the year. There is not a stated cap on this plan. However, over the past decade, the most paid to any Named Executive Officer was 15% above the executive's pre-established annual incentive target for the applicable year. 
For 2018, Cullen/Frost established the following individual targets as a percentage of 2018 base salary for the Named Executive Officers in the Executive Management Bonus Plan: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Jerry Salinas      75%  
 Paul H. Bracher      75%  
 Patrick B. Frost      75%  
 William L. Perotti      75%  
[END TABLE]
The individual targets are not formula driven and no specific weighting is targeted for annual incentive pay as a percentage of total compensation. For each of the Named Executive Officers in the Executive Management Bonus Plan, the targets are set at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer and are approved by the Committee. The incentive targets are based on external market data provided by Meridian, internal equity considerations, and strategic objectives for corporate performance. The individual targets for the next year are reviewed annually at the Fall meeting of the Committee and adjusted as deemed appropriate. 
Payment amounts for the Named Executive Officers, with the exception of the Chief Executive Officer, are made based on recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and approval of the Committee. Annual incentive amounts in excess of, or below target may be paid at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer with the approval of the Committee. Before the Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Committee regarding annual incentive payments for the other Named Executive Officers, the Chief Executive Officer discusses these issues with Meridian. The Committee has the discretion to approve, disapprove or adjust the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations. 
The primary criterion for annual incentive payments for the Named Executive Officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) is the measurement of actual net income vs. budgeted net income for Cullen/Frost. 
As previously stated, Cullen/Frost's actual 2018 net income performance met and significantly exceeded our budgeted net income goal for 2018. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer recommended to the Committee that annual incentive payments be paid to Mr. Salinas, Mr. Bracher, Mr. Frost and Mr. Perotti at 15% above target for 2018. The Committee approved this recommendation. The 2018 annual incentives were paid in February of 2019 and are shown in the Summary Compensation Table. 
In October 2018, the Committee reviewed the competitiveness of each Named Executive Officer's incentive target level and determined that they were generally in line with the 50th percentile of the external market for their positions based on the information provided by Meridian. The Committee elected to maintain the same target levels for the Named Executive Officers in 2019 as they had in 2018. As previously stated, the target represents a percentage of base salary earnings. 
-32- 
Long-Term Incentive Pay.    Cullen/Frost maintains the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan which was approved by shareholders and authorizes the granting of the following types of awards for executives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Appreciation Rights;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Unit and Performance Share Awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash-Based Awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Stock-Based Awards.  
[END TABLE]
As shown in the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table below, long-term incentives are awarded to the Named Executive Officers in the form of performance share units and restricted stock units. The size of the long-term incentive grant is determined by the Committee, taking into account a variety of factors including the value of prior year grants when made, external market data, internal equity considerations, individual and company performance, overall share usage, shareholder dilution and cost. It is the Committee's current practice to award long-term incentives in a combined package of approximately half performance share units and half restricted stock units, based on the estimated economic value of awards on the date of grant. The weighting between performance share units and restricted stock units allows Cullen/Frost to strike a balance between performance and retention and minimizes the impact to shareholder dilution. 
Performance Share Units.    Performance share units are utilized to align management and shareholder interests and to reward executives with shareholder value creation. In 2018, performance share units were granted based on a market price of $94.81, the closing price of a share of the Company stock on the date of grant, October 23, 2018. The grant includes a three-year performance period beginning January 1, 2019 and ending December 31, 2021. The performance metric is Return on Assets relative to the Peer Group as previously listed. Award vesting is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Return on Assets Performance  Level Achieved Relative to Peer Group     Award Payout Percentage 
 <25th Percentile    0% of Target 
 25th Percentile    50% of Target 
 50th Percentile    100% of Target 
 75th Percentile or greater    150% of Target 
[END TABLE]
The vesting of the performance share units is subject to Committee certification and the exercise of downward discretion. Achievement between the 25th and 75th percentiles listed above will be determined based on straight-line interpolation as determined by the Committee in its discretion. The performance metric and vesting schedule were structured to align executives with long-term shareholder value creation, to be competitive, to enhance our retention efforts and to minimize shareholder dilution. 
Restricted Stock Units.    Restricted stock units are granted to create an immediate link to shareholder interests, enhance ownership opportunities and maintain a stable executive team. The awards granted in 2018 generally vest 100% four years from the date of the grant. This vesting schedule is both competitive and consistent with our traditional practice and encourages long-term value creation. 
While the Committee believes a significant portion of Named Executive Officers' total compensation should be linked to Cullen/Frost's stock price, no specific weighting is targeted for long-term incentive pay as a percentage of total compensation. 
During its October 2018 meeting, the Committee reviewed the competitiveness of the long-term incentive program for the Named Executive Officers. External market data was provided by Meridian. In reviewing peer 
-33- 
 data, the Committee observed that the long-term incentive opportunities for Cullen/Frost's Named Executive Officers were generally at the lower end of the competitive range relative to the external market data. 
The Committee primarily considered these external factors, along with internal factors such as equity, performance, share usage, dilution, and cost to determine the 2018 long-term incentive grants. 
In its review, the Committee determined that it was critical to continue to place a strong emphasis on future financial performance and increasing shareholder value, while offering a competitive total compensation package overall. In 2018, the Committee took into account the change in the market value of Company stock as compared to the prior year, along with the Committee's desire to maintain competitive posture as it relates to award value, and, in its discretion, awarded long-term incentives to the Named Executive Officers. In some instances, the grant was of similar economic value to the prior year, in others, the grant was somewhat higher than the prior year's grant in order to maintain a competitive stance. For long-term incentives granted in 2018, the Committee elected to continue to utilize a mix of half performance share units and half restricted units, based on the estimated economic value of the awards at the time of grant. The awards granted in 2018 are shown in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 
The Committee believes that the Company's use of performance share units and restricted stock units continues to create a strong alignment of executive team and shareholder interests. 
Historically, the Committee has generally approved and granted long-term incentive awards to the Named Executive Officers and any other designated employees at its Fall meeting. While Cullen/Frost maintains no policy, whether official or unofficial, for timing the granting of stock options or other equity-based awards in advance of the release of material nonpublic information, our practice has been to grant long-term incentive awards on the date of the Fall Committee meeting. 
-34- 
Benefits.    Cullen/Frost provides a benefits package including health and welfare and retirement benefits to remain competitive with the market and to help meet the health and retirement security needs of our employees, including the Named Executive Officers. The following table provides a brief summary of Cullen/Frost's retirement benefit programs and those eligible to participate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Retirement Benefit Plan    Purpose   Named Executive Officer Participation   All Employee Participation 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The Retirement Plan and the Retirement Restoration Plan were frozen on December 31, 2001.  
[END TABLE]
For a detailed description of the above-referenced benefit plans, see the narrative following the 2018 Pension Benefits Table. See the All Other Compensation Table for detail on benefits received by the Named Executive Officers. 
Perquisites.    Cullen/Frost uses perquisites for Named Executive Officers to provide a competitive offering and to provide certain conveniences that we believe are reasonable. We do not pay tax reimbursements on perquisites. The aggregate perquisite value received by each Named Executive Officer are shown in the All Other Compensation Table. Below is a brief summary of the perquisites provided and the rationale for their use: 
Physical Examinations.    In order to ensure the continued health of our executive team, the Named Executive Officers were given the opportunity to undergo a thorough physical examination with the physician of their choice with the cost to be underwritten by Cullen/Frost subject to a cap. 
Personal Financial Planning Services.    To ensure the continued financial stability of our executive team, and to help maximize the amount executives realize from our compensation programs, the Named Executive Officers were given the opportunity to engage a financial advisor of their choice to provide personal financial planning services with the cost to be underwritten by Cullen/Frost subject to a cap. 
-35- 
Home Security Services.    To ensure the safety of our executive team, home security services are provided in certain instances. 
Club Memberships.    Club memberships are provided to all the Named Executive Officers to be used at their discretion for both personal and business purposes. This provides the Named Executive Officers with the ongoing opportunity to network with other community leaders. 
Use of Jet Aircraft.    Through a provider in the fractional aircraft industry, Cullen/Frost has acquired use of jet aircraft hours. Use of these aircraft hours is provided to the Named Executive Officers in connection with their extensive business travel requirements. This service is afforded to the Named Executive Officers to reduce travel time and related disruptions and to provide additional security, thereby increasing their availability, efficiency, and productivity. Mr. Green has been authorized to use a portion of the aircraft hours for non-business purposes, which should generally not exceed ten percent of the available hours annually. Mr. Green did not use the jet aircraft hours for non-business purposes during 2018. Mr. Green and Mr. Salinas, did incur imputed income in connection with family members accompanying them on business related travel. Imputed income rates are determined using the Standard Industry Fare Level (SIFL). 
Life Insurance.    Group life insurance is provided to the Named Executive Officers with a death benefit equal to three times base salary earnings for the most recent year, not to exceed $2,000,000. See the All Other Compensation Table for more detail. 
Agreements with Named Executive Officers 
Change in Control Agreements.    Cullen/Frost has change-in-control agreements with each of its Named Executive Officers as well as certain other key employees of the Company. The primary intent of these agreements is to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• help executives evaluate objectively whether a potential change in control is in the best interests of shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• help protect against the departure of executives, thus assuring continuity of management, in the event of an actual or threatened merger or change in  control; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide compensation and benefit protection following a change in control that is comparable to the protections available from competing employers.   
[END TABLE]
Under the agreements, Mr. Green and Mr. Frost could receive severance payments of three times base salary and target annual incentive compensation plus a prorated annual incentive payment for the year of termination, and Mr. Salinas, Mr. Bracher and Mr. Perotti could receive severance payments of two times base salary and target annual incentive compensation plus a prorated annual incentive payment for the year of termination, if within two years following a "Change in Control" their employment was terminated by Cullen/Frost, for reasons other than Cause, death, disability or retirement. "Cause" is generally defined in the agreements as an executive's (1) willful and continued failure to substantially perform his duties after delivery of a written demand for substantial performance; (2) willful engagement in conduct materially injurious to Cullen/Frost; or (3) conviction of a felony. The Committee established the change-in-control benefits at their current level to be competitive and to provide executives with a level of pay and benefits comparable to what they had immediately prior to a change in control. 
"Change in Control'' is generally considered in the agreements to be: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of Cullen/Frost Common Stock by an individual, corporation, partnership, group, association, or  other person;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• certain changes in the composition of a majority of the Board; or  
[END TABLE]
-36- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• certain other events involving a merger or consolidation of Cullen/Frost or a sale of substantially all of its assets.  
[END TABLE]
Further, the change-in-control agreements provide that the Named Executive Officers would receive the severance payments described above if they terminate their employment for Good Reason within two years following a change-in-control. "Good Reason" is generally considered in the agreements as one or more of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a significant change or reduction in the executive's responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an involuntary transfer of the executive to a location that is 50 miles farther than the distance between the executive's current residence and  Cullen/Frost's headquarters;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a significant reduction in the executive's current compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the failure of any successor to Cullen/Frost to assume the executive's  change-in-control agreement; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any termination of the executive's employment that is not effected pursuant to a written notice which indicates the reasons for the termination.   
[END TABLE]
The change-in-control agreements also provide for a continuation of the welfare benefits of health care, life and accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance coverage for three years for Mr. Green and Mr. Frost, and two years for the remaining Named Executive Officers following termination of employment without Cause or for Good Reason. The agreements do not provide for any tax gross-up payments. Instead, the agreements contain a "net-better" cutback provision, meaning that an executive's severance and other change-in-control benefits would be cut back to the level that eliminates the excise taxes due to excess parachute payments if such a cutback would put the executive in a better after-tax position than receiving the severance and other change-in-control benefits and paying the corresponding excise tax. 
Under the change-in-control agreements, if the executive becomes entitled to the severance benefits described above, all stock options that did not otherwise vest in conjunction with the change in control would become immediately exercisable and all the vesting restrictions would lapse on all outstanding restricted shares and restricted stock units. Additionally, the performance metric on any outstanding performance share units would be determined to have been earned as of the change-in-control date but the award itself would continue to be subject to the time-based vesting for the remainder of the performance period. The exception to this schedule would be if the Named Executive Officer were terminated without Cause within two years following the change-in-control and then the award would become fully vested as of that date if earlier than the original close of the time-based vesting period. As described in previous years' proxy statements, the 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan that was approved by our shareholders in 2015 provides for "double-trigger" vesting of equity-based awards on a change-in-control, thereby eliminating the immediate "single-trigger" vesting of stock options and lapsing of restrictions of restricted shares/units upon a change-in-control that was a provision of our prior equity plan. 
Under the change-in-control agreements, a change in control would have no impact on benefits available to Named Executive Officers under the frozen retirement and retirement restoration plans. 
The Committee believes that the change-in-control agreements are consistent with our objective to remain competitive, as compared to the external marketplace, with our executive compensation program. The change-in-control agreements do not affect decisions to be made regarding other elements of compensation and with the change to double-trigger equity vesting under these agreements in 2015, we believe we have strengthened our commitment to our originally stated objectives. 
For detailed estimated payments upon a qualifying termination following a change in control, please see the Change-in-Control Payments Table. 
Cullen/Frost does not maintain any other severance policies or employment contracts in place for its Named Executive Officers.

Tax Considerations 
For tax years prior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed an income tax deduction to public companies for compensation over $1 million paid to certain executive officers; however, qualifying performance-based compensation was not subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted tax reform legislation, which, among other things, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m). As a result we currently expect that, with respect to 2018 and beyond, compensation amounts over $1 million paid to any Named Executive Officer and any other employee covered by Section 162(m) generally will no longer be deductible unless grandfathered under the exception for pre-existing contractual arrangements. The Committee continues to consider the deductibility of compensation, including in light of the changes to Section 162(m). However, the primary goals of our executive compensation programs are to attract, incentivize and retain key employees and align pay with performance, and the Committee retains the ability to provide compensation that exceeds deductibility limits as it determines appropriate. 
Other Policies 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Committee maintains Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers and Directors. The guidelines approved by the Committee are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Participant     Target Ownership Level 
 Chairman and Chief Executive Officer    Five times Base Salary 
 All Other Executive Officers    Three times Base Salary 
 Outside Directors    Five times Annual Cash Retainer 
[END TABLE]
For purposes of determining stock ownership levels, the following forms of equity interests are included in stock ownership calculations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock owned outright or under direct ownership control;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Unvested restricted stock and unvested restricted stock units;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deferred stock units; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares owned through Company retirement plans.  
[END TABLE]
Any new participants are given five years from the date they become an eligible participant to reach the guideline. 
Participants' actual ownership levels are compared to the stated guidelines by the Chairman of the Board and reviewed by the Committee annually. All Named Executive Officers have satisfied the guidelines. 
Anti-Hedging Policy 
The Committee maintains an Anti-Hedging Policy for Directors and Executives. The policy states that it is inappropriate for any Executive Officer or Director to enter into any financial transaction that reduces the monetary risk associated with owning Cullen/Frost stock. 
Policy on Recovery of Awards 
Cullen/Frost currently has no written policy with respect to recovery of awards when financial statements are restated. However, in the event of a restatement of Cullen/Frost's financial statements, we would recover any awards as required by applicable law.

Conclusion 
The Committee strongly believes that our 2018 Compensation Program was competitive from an external standpoint and equitable from an internal standpoint. In addition, we are satisfied that our objectives were met by the program. We fully anticipate continuing to administer an executive compensation program that is conservative, remaining consistent with our corporate philosophy.

(2)  Because both the Retirement Plan and the Retirement Restoration Plan were frozen as of December 31, 2001, the number of years of credited  service shown above for each Named Executive Officer is also as of that date. At the time these plans were frozen, Cullen/Frost adopted the defined contribution Profit Sharing Plan and the accompanying nonqualified Profit Sharing Restoration Plan.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Under the terms of the Retirement Plan and the Retirement Restoration Plan, all of the Named Executive Officers are eligible for early  retirement. Eligibility for early retirement is defined as age 55 or older with five years of service.  
[END TABLE]
Profit Sharing Plan 
On January 1, 2002, Cullen/Frost adopted a qualified profit sharing plan that replaced its defined benefit plan. The Profit Sharing Plan is a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan that covers all employees, including the Named Executive Officers, who have completed at least one year of service, are age 21 or older, and are otherwise eligible for benefits. All contributions to the plan are made at the discretion of the Chief Executive Officer based upon Cullen/Frost's fiscal year profitability, and are not formula driven. Contributions are allocated to eligible participants uniformly, based upon compensation, age and other factors. Historically, contributions, subject to IRS limits, have approximated 2% of eligible salaries, which is generally defined as base salary plus cash incentives plus additional percentage adjustments for certain age levels. Plan participants self-direct the investment of allocated contributions by choosing from a menu of investment options. Account assets are subject to withdrawal restrictions and participants vest in their accounts after three years of service. No distributions were made during 2018 to any of the Named Executive Officers. 
-44- 
Profit Sharing Restoration Plan 
Cullen/Frost maintains a separate nonqualified profit sharing plan for certain employees, including the Named Executive Officers, whose participation in the tax-qualified Profit Sharing Plan is limited by IRS rules. Contributions to the Profit Sharing Restoration Plan are made using the same approach as contributions to the Profit Sharing Plan but for eligible compensation dollars earned in excess of IRS limits. Distributions under this plan are made at the same time and in the same form as under the Profit Sharing Plan. No distributions were made during 2018 from the Profit Sharing Restoration Plan to any of the Named Executive Officers. 
Retirement Plan 
The tax-qualified Retirement Plan for employees of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its Affiliates (as amended and restated), is a defined benefit plan that was frozen on December 31, 2001. This frozen plan provides, subject to IRS limits, a monthly benefit based on a formula-driven percentage of an eligible employee's final average compensation, based on the highest three years of compensation in the last ten years of service prior to January 1, 2002, and years of credited service as of that date. Participants in this plan are fully vested in their accrued benefits upon attaining age 65 or after five years of service, whichever occurs first. 
Retirement Restoration Plan 
The nonqualified Restoration of Retirement Income Plan for Participants in the Retirement Plan for employees of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its Affiliates (as amended and restated), which was also frozen on December 31, 2001, exists to provide benefits comparable to the Retirement Plan for those employees, including the Named Executive Officers whose participation in the Retirement Plan is limited by IRS rules. 
401(k) Plan 
Cullen/Frost maintains a 401(k) plan that permits each participant to make before- or after-tax contributions in an amount not less than 2% of eligible compensation and not exceeding 50% of eligible compensation and subject to dollar limits from IRS rules. Cullen/Frost matches 100% of the employee's contributions to the plan based on the amount of each participant's contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. Eligible employees must complete 90 days of service in order to enroll and vest in Cullen/Frost's matching contributions immediately. Cullen/Frost's matching contribution is initially invested in Cullen/Frost Common Stock. However, employees may immediately reallocate Cullen/Frost's matching portion, as well as invest their individual contribution in a variety of investment alternatives offered under the 401(k) plan. 
Thrift Incentive Plan 
Cullen/Frost maintains a nonqualified thrift incentive stock purchase plan (the "Thrift Incentive Plan") for certain employees, including the Named Executive Officers, whose participation in the 401(k) Plan is limited by IRS rules as an alternative means of receiving comparable benefits. Cullen/Frost uses a similar approach to contributions to the Thrift Incentive Plan as used in the 401(k) Plan, matching 100% of the employee's contributions to the plan based on the amount of each participant's contributions up to a maximum of 6% of base salary only. The value of amounts allocated to a participant is distributed to such participant at the end of each calendar year in the form of common stock. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement, under the existing change-in-control agreements, each Named Executive Officer could receive severance payments 
-45- 
 representing a multiple of base salary and target annual incentive plus a prorated annual incentive payment for the year of termination if his position were terminated by Cullen/Frost without "Cause" or by the Named Executive Officer for "Good Reason" within two years following a change in control. Multiples are shown below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Jerry Salinas      Two Times   
 Paul H. Bracher      Two Times   
 Patrick B. Frost      Three Times   
 William L. Perotti      Two Times   
[END TABLE]
The severance payment would be made in a lump sum. In addition, the plan calls for a continuation of welfare benefits for either two or three years as discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. Where applicable, any potential payments under the change-in-control agreements would be made in compliance with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which may require certain payments made on separation of service to be deferred for six months. The agreements do not provide for a tax gross-up payment. Instead, the agreements include a "net-better" benefit as previously discussed. Mr. Green, Mr. Salinas and Mr. Frost would have triggered an excise tax under the scenario modeled in the Change in Control table as of December 31, 2018. However, under the "net-better" provision, only Mr. Frost would have his benefits under the plan cut back $445,139. Please see the Change in Control table following this discussion. 
There are no other severance policies or employment contracts in place for the Named Executive Officers and, generally, vesting of unvested stock options and restricted stock/restricted stock unit awards will not accelerate upon termination of employment other than in certain circumstances following retirement of the Named Executive Officer after attaining the age of 65 (i.e. retirement-eligibility). 
Under the terms of the Company's 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended and restated, equity-based awards generally vest upon the occurrence of a change in control. As previously discussed, the 2015 Omnibus Plan approved in April 2015, includes a provision for "double-trigger" vesting for equity awards in a change in control. 
For calculation purposes, the change in control and termination of employment are assumed to have occurred on December 31, 2018, the last business day of the year. The closing price of the stock on December 31, 2018, $87.94, was used to calculate the value of the unvested stock option spread and the value of the unvested restricted stock awards and unvested restricted stock units. 
In the event of retirement of a Named Executive Officer, potential payments would consist of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock options that would continue to vest on their original schedule;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted stock units that would vest on the sooner of their original schedule of four years from grant date or three years from date of retirement;   
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The amounts shown above as cash severance for the Named Executive Officers represent severance equal to the base salary and target annual  incentive multiplied by three plus the prorated target annual incentive for Mr. Green and Mr. Frost. The cash severance shown for the remaining Named Executive Officers represents the base salary and target annual incentive multiplied by  two plus the prorated target annual incentive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  The amounts shown above represent the difference between the exercise price and the closing market price on December 31, 2018 on the  shares underlying unvested stock options along with the value of all unvested restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units as of December 31, 2018 using the closing market price on December 31, 2018 of $87.94. In  addition, the figures shown include accelerated dividends on the underlying performance share units at target performance levels.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amounts shown above represent the value of three years' health and welfare benefits for Mr. Green and Mr. Frost and two  years' health and welfare benefits for Mr. Bracher, Mr. Perotti and Mr. Salinas.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Based on the assumptions described above, the payments and benefits that would have been payable to the Named Executive Officers under the change-in-control agreements or other plans would have exceeded the safe harbor limit for payments contingent on a change in control set forth in Internal Revenue Code  Section 280G for Mr. Green, Mr. Salinas and Mr. Frost. As a result, the payments and benefits described above would have been subject to an excise tax under Internal Revenue Code Section 4999 for all three. However, under  the "net-better" provision, only Mr. Frost would have forfeited $445,139 in payments. No excise tax would have been triggered for the remaining Named Executive Officers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  As discussed in the preceding narrative, all elements of severance pay and benefits available to the Named Executive Officers under the change-in-control agreements are attributable to "double trigger" arrangements with the exception of equity awards issued prior to 2015, which are subject to  "single trigger" vesting on the occurrence of a change in control. As previously discussed, the 2015 Omnibus Plan includes a provision for "double trigger" vesting of equity awards in a change-in-control scenario.  
[END TABLE]
Pay Ratio 
As a result of the adopted rules under the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC requires disclosure of the CEO to median employee pay ratio. 
As shown in the Summary Compensation Table, Mr. Green received total annual compensation in 2018 of $4,617,644. Our median employee's total annual compensation was $54,575. As a result, the ratio of Mr. Green's compensation to that of our median employee was approximately 84.6:1. 
To identify our median employee, we used our entire workforce population as of December 31, 2017 and measured compensation based on IRS reportable wages. As permitted under the SEC rules, we are using the 
-47- 
 same median employee for our 2018 Pay Ratio that we used for our 2017 Pay Ratio. After identifying our median employee, we calculated 2018 annual total compensation for our median employee using the same methodology that we used to determine our CEO's 2018 annual total compensation for the Summary Compensation Table.

CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS 
Certain Cullen/Frost Director nominees, executive officers, and their immediate family members, and their affiliates were customers of, and had transactions with, Cullen/Frost and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business during 2018, and additional transactions may be expected to take place in the ordinary course of business. Included in these transactions are banking, property and services transactions involving these related persons and Frost Bank, all of which were made on substantially the same terms, including, in the case of loans and lending commitments, interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to Cullen/Frost and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. 
The offices of the Hulen Financial Center of Frost Bank in Fort Worth, Texas were leased on a long-term basis from 4200 S. Hulen Partners, L.P. of which Mr. R. Denny Alexander, a former Director of Cullen/Frost who retired from the Board in April 2018, owns a 13.33% interest and is the managing general partner. These offices were the headquarters of Overton Bancshares, Inc., which Cullen/Frost acquired in 1998. Cullen/Frost assumed this lease in the acquisition and had maintained it since. During 2018, lease payments of $208,896 were made by Frost Bank and Frost Insurance Agency, Inc. to 4200 S. Hulen Partners, L.P. The lease expired in September 2018. 
-49- 
In addition, the offices of the Clearfork Branch of Frost Bank in Fort Worth, Texas, are leased on a long-term basis from Clearfork Retail Venture, LLC. Mr. Crawford H. Edwards, a Director of Cullen/Frost, owns a 3.12% interest in Clearfork Retail Venture, LLC. During 2018, lease payments of $240,810 were made by Frost Bank to Clearfork Retail Venture, LLC. The lease payments payable in the future through the end of the lease term total $2,282,580. 
Also, two siblings of Mr. Patrick B. Frost served in non-executive officer positions of Frost Bank during 2018 and received cash compensation in an aggregate amount of approximately $489,921. In addition, they received equity awards with an aggregate grant date fair value of approximately $100,025. The compensation of Mr. Frost's siblings is in accordance with the Company's employment and compensation practices applicable to employees with equivalent qualifications and responsibilities and holding similar positions. Mr. Frost does not have a material interest in the employment relationships of his siblings nor do any of them share a household with Mr. Frost. 
In addition, an immediate family member of Mr. Charles W. Matthews, a Director of Cullen/Frost and Lead Director, serves as a Shareholder of Winstead PC, a law firm, and has less than a 1.00% interest therein. During 2018, Cullen/Frost paid $457,781 to Winstead PC for legal services, none of which services were provided by Mr. Matthews's immediate family member. Mr. Matthews does not have an interest in the business relationship of Winstead PC with Cullen/Frost. 
Prior to his nomination and appointment to the Board in 2017, entities controlled by Mr. Graham Weston, a Director of Cullen/Frost, entered into a series of transactions with subsidiaries of Cullen/Frost as part of a comprehensive development agreement pursuant to which a new office building is being constructed in downtown San Antonio (the "New Frost Headquarters"). The New Frost Headquarters is owned by WUKDC 1, LP, (the "Headquarters Owner"), an entity controlled by Mr. Weston. Mr. Weston is a managing member of the general partner of the Headquarters Owner and has a 21% indirect ownership interest in the Headquarters Owner. 
Frost Bank has leased a portion of the New Frost Headquarters from the Headquarters Owner pursuant to a lease agreement under which Frost Bank will pay the Headquarters Owner approximately $9.8 million on average in base rent over the life of the lease. Rent under Frost Bank's lease of the New Frost Headquarters is scheduled to commence on July 1, 2019. 
Frost Bank is also the lead lender on a $141 million loan extended to the Headquarters Owner in connection with the construction of the New Frost Headquarters (the "Construction Loan"). Frost Bank's portion of the Construction Loan is approximately $76 million. As of February 1, 2019, $81,266.235.18 was outstanding under the Construction Loan (Frost Bank's portion being $43,809,855.35) and since January 1, 2019, such amounts were the largest aggregate amounts of principal outstanding under the Construction Loan. Interest on the Construction Loan has been paid current through February 1, 2019. No principal has been paid on the Construction Loan. The Construction Loan bears interest at a rate equal to the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate plus 2.25%. 
Frost Bank also leases land and improvements in San Antonio from 425 Loneliness, Ltd. (the "Motorbank Owner") for the operation of a motorbank. During 2018, lease payments in the amount of $185,742 were made by Frost Bank to the Motorbank Owner and the lease payments payable in the future through the end of the lease term total $1,500,421. Mr. Weston serves as managing member of the general partner of the Motorbank Owner and has a 99% indirect interest in the Motorbank Owner. 
In connection with the construction of the New Frost Headquarters, Frost Bank also intends to sell two parcels of land to entities affiliated with Mr. Weston at a time yet to be determined for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $6.5 million. No definitive agreement on these two sales has yet been reached. 
In the opinion of Cullen/Frost's management, all of the foregoing transactions related to Mr. Weston that have been consummated were entered into in the ordinary course of business, have substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not

 related to Cullen/Frost, and did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. In addition, Mr. Weston was not a Director or nominee for Director at the time these transactions were entered into. 
Policies and Procedures for Review, Approval or Ratification of Related Person Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written related-party transaction policy. Cullen/Frost regularly monitors its business dealings and those of its Directors, Director nominees and executive officers to determine whether any existing or proposed transactions would constitute a related-party transaction requiring approval under this policy. In addition, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires Directors and executive officers to notify Cullen/Frost of any relationships or transactions that may present a conflict of interest, including those involving family members. Our Directors and executive officers are also required to complete a questionnaire on an annual basis designed to elicit information regarding any such related-party transactions. 
When Cullen/Frost becomes aware of a proposed or existing transaction with a related party, Cullen/Frost's Corporate Counsel/Corporate Secretary, in consultation with management and counsel, as appropriate, determines whether the transaction would constitute a related-party transaction requiring approval under this policy. If such a determination is made, management and Cullen/Frost's Corporate Counsel/Corporate Secretary, in consultation with external counsel, determine whether, in their view, the transaction should be permitted, whether it should be modified to avoid any potential conflict of interest, whether it should be terminated, or whether some other action should be taken. Such action is then referred to Cullen/Frost's Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee at its next meeting (or earlier, if appropriate), for review and final determination as it deems appropriate. 
In determining whether to approve a related-party transaction, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider, among other factors, the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the terms of the transaction are fair to Cullen/Frost and on the same basis as would apply if the transaction did not involve a related party;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether there are business reasons for Cullen/Frost to enter into the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction would impair the independence of an outside director; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any related party of Cullen/Frost, taking into account the size of the  transaction, the overall financial position of the related party, the direct or indirect nature of the related party's interest in the transaction, and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship.  
[END TABLE]
Any member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee who has an interest in the transaction under discussion will abstain from voting on the approval of the transaction, but may, if so requested by the Chairman of the Committee, participate in some or all of the Committee's discussions of the transaction. 
-51- 
SELECTION OF AUDITORS 
(Item 2 On Proxy Card) 
The Board recommends that the shareholders of Cullen/Frost ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP, certified public accountants, as independent auditors of Cullen/Frost. Ernst & Young LLP have audited the financial statements of Cullen/Frost since 1969. 
Neither Cullen/Frost's Articles of Incorporation nor its Bylaws require that the shareholders ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as its independent auditors. Cullen/Frost is doing so because it believes it is a matter of good corporate practice. Should the shareholders not ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider its determination to retain Ernst & Young LLP, but may elect to continue to retain Ernst & Young LLP. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may change the appointment at any time during the year if it determines that the change would be in the best interests of Cullen/Frost and its shareholders. 
The following table provides information on fees incurred by Cullen/Frost to Ernst & Young LLP. 
Fees Incurred To Independent Auditors 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(1)    $ 1,306,446      $ 1,299,589   
 Audit-Related Fees(2)      147,000        193,500   
 Tax Fees(3)      299,779        222,906   
 All Other Fees      —        —   
 Total Fees    $ 1,753,225      $ 1,715,995   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Audit fees include fees for the audit of management's assessment of the effectiveness of Cullen/Frost's internal control over  financial reporting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Audit-related fees are fees for audits of employee benefit plans and internal control reviews of Frost Wealth Advisors operations.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Tax fees include fees associated with tax compliance and consulting services. Tax compliance services include the preparation of Federal  income tax and Texas franchise tax returns, including estimated tax payments and extension requests. Tax consulting services include routine tax advice and consultation.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee pre-approves each audit and non-audit service provided to Cullen/Frost by Ernst & Young LLP. Pursuant to the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee has delegated to each of its members the authority to pre-approve any audit or non-audit service to be performed by the independent auditors, provided that any such approvals are presented to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
Representatives from Ernst & Young LLP are not expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. If any shareholder desires to ask Ernst & Young LLP a question, management will ensure that the question is sent to Ernst & Young LLP and that an appropriate response is made directly to the shareholder. 
-52- 
NONBINDING APPROVAL OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(Item 3 On Proxy Card) 
Section 14A of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requires that issuers permit a separate nonbinding "say on pay" shareholder vote to approve the compensation of executives at least every three years. As discussed below, the Board recommends that, consistent with the nonbinding resolution adopted by the shareholders at the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders, this vote should take place every year. 
The proposal gives shareholders the opportunity to vote for or against the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
Your vote is advisory, which means it will not be binding upon the Board and will not overrule any decision by the Board. However, the Compensation and Benefits Committee may, in its sole discretion, take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
We encourage you to carefully review the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and "2018 Compensation" sections of this proxy statement for a detailed discussion of the Company's executive compensation program. 
Our compensation policies and procedures are designed to pay for performance in a way that is strongly aligned with the long-term interests of our shareholders. The Compensation and Benefits Committee, which is composed entirely of independent Directors, in consultation with a leading human resources consulting firm, oversees our executive compensation program. (For more information regarding the Compensation and Benefit Committee's use of consultants, please see Role of Compensation Consultants on page 23, above.) The Committee continually monitors our policies to ensure that they continue to reward executives for results that are consistent with shareholder interests and strong risk management. 
Our Board and our Compensation and Benefits Committee believe that our commitment to these responsible compensation practices justifies a vote by shareholders FOR the resolution approving the compensation of our executives as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
The Board recommends you vote "FOR" this Proposal 3.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of: (i) the integrity of Cullen/Frost's financial statements; (ii) Cullen/Frost's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the independent auditors' qualifications and independence; and (iv) the performance of the independent auditors and Cullen/Frost's internal audit function. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a written charter that is available at frostbank.com or in print by contacting the Corporate Secretary, at 100 West Houston Street, San Antonio, Texas 78205. The Committee met six times in 2018. The Board has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is independent within the meaning of the NYSE's rules and the SEC's rules. The Board has also determined that each member of the Audit Committee is "financially literate" and that at least one member of the Audit Committee has "accounting or related financial management expertise," in each case within the meaning of the NYSE's rules. In addition, the Board has determined that Mr. David J. Haemisegger and Ms. Cynthia J. Comparin are "audit committee financial experts" within the meaning of the SEC's rules. 
Management of Cullen/Frost is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of Cullen/Frost's financial statements, for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and for the maintenance of appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls and procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out a proper audit of Cullen/Frost's annual consolidated financial statements, for expressing an opinion as to conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, and for auditing management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting. Members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of Cullen/Frost and are not, and do not represent themselves to be, performing the functions of auditors or accountants. Accordingly, as described above, the Audit Committee provides oversight of the responsibilities of management and the independent auditors. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees. In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, as currently in effect, and has discussed with the independent auditors the independent auditors' independence. 
Based upon the reviews and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in its charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in Cullen/Frost's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Richard M. Kleberg, III, Committee Chair 
Cynthia J. Comparin

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires Cullen/Frost's Directors and executive officers to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to their ownership and changes in ownership of Cullen/Frost's Common Stock. Based on information provided by Cullen/Frost's Directors and executive officers and a review of such reports, Cullen/Frost believes that all required reports were filed on a timely basis during 2018 except: (1) former Director Mr. R. Denny Alexander made one late Form 4 filing regarding one transaction following his retirement announcement and, (2) Mr. Graham Weston made one late Form 4 filing regarding one transaction due to an inadvertent administrative error. 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
To be eligible under the Securities and Exchange Commission's shareholder proposal rule (Rule 14a-8) for inclusion in Cullen/Frost's proxy statement, proxy card, and presentation at Cullen/Frost's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (currently scheduled to be held on April 29, 2020), a proper shareholder proposal must be received by Cullen/Frost at its principal offices no later than November 21, 2019. For a proper shareholder proposal submitted outside of the process provided by Rule 14a-8 to be eligible for presentation at Cullen/Frost's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, timely notice thereof must be received by Cullen/Frost not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days before the date of the meeting (for an April 29, 2020 meeting, the date on which the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders is currently scheduled, notice is required no earlier than January 30, 2020 and no later than February 29, 2020). The notice must be in the manner and form required by Cullen/Frost's Bylaws. If the date of the 2020 Annual Meeting is changed, the dates set forth above may change. 
OTHER MATTERS 
Management of Cullen/Frost knows of no other business to be presented at the meeting. If other matters do properly come before the meeting, the enclosed proxy confers discretionary authority on the persons named as proxies to vote the shares represented by the proxy as to those other matters. 
By Order of the Board of Directors, 
JAMES L. WATERS 
Group Executive Vice President 
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary 
Dated: March 20, 2019
