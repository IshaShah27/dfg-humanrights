Dear Fellow Shareholder: 
We are pleased to send you the 2019 General Dynamics Proxy Statement. We remain committed to sound corporate governance and to a strong link between executive pay and company performance in our compensation program. The details of our governance and executive compensation programs are contained in this Proxy Statement and referenced documents. 
Strong 2018 Performance. Our company's 2018 financial results reflected solid performance across our businesses. Growth in a number of metrics – revenue, operating earnings, earnings from continuing operations, earnings per share – resulted from organic growth as well as our acquisition of CSRA Inc. in April 2018, the largest acquisition in the company's history. Gulfstream delivered 10 of its new G500 aircraft and continued toward certification of the G600. In the defense businesses, significant backlog growth supports future growth opportunities. 
Robust Shareholder Engagement and Responsiveness. Shareholder engagement remains a key focus for our company to ensure we are aware of your top priorities. With feedback received from shareholders, the advisory vote on executive compensation at the 2018 annual meeting and a review of market practices, the Compensation Committee approved changes to our executive compensation program that are directly responsive to shareholder input. The changes are discussed in this proxy statement and further evidence our commitment to long-term, performance-based compensation. We also engaged with shareholders in 2018 on a number of other important topics, including our acquisition of CSRA, recent achievements in our business, our strong corporate governance practices, human capital management and our corporate sustainability program. We continue to value the input we receive from our shareholders. 
Highly Engaged and Well-Qualified Board. Our Board continues to reflect a diverse and well-qualified group of business leaders, aerospace and defense industry experts, and financial and strategic advisors. To ensure that our Board continues to represent diverse skills and experiences, we have added several new directors over the past several years. Our newest director, Cecil Haney, brings valuable insight as to the needs of one of our largest customers, the U.S. Navy, as well as important knowledge about advanced technology and national security matters. 
On behalf of the Board of Directors, I invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and, even if you are not able to attend, encourage you to vote by proxy. The accompanying Proxy Statement contains information about the matters on which you are asked to vote. I urge you to read the materials carefully and vote in accordance with the recommendations of the Board of Directors. Your vote is very important.

SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
Our Board is Committed to Robust Shareholder Engagement.  Each year, we conduct outreach to shareholders representing over 60% of our outstanding shares to receive feedback on matters regarding our executive compensation and corporate governance practices. Additionally, an ad hoc group of directors, anchored by the chairman and the independent Lead Director, is in place to liaise with significant shareholders. 
In early 2018 and in advance of our annual meeting, we reached out to shareholders and actively engaged with holders representing over 50% of our outstanding shares to solicit feedback on our executive compensation program and the shareholder proposal presented at the 2018 annual meeting. Our core shareholder engagement team comprised senior members of our Investor Relations, Corporate Governance and Human Resources (including Executive Compensation) groups, supplemented by our Lead Director as appropriate. 
Based on the feedback received, we concluded that the following two items were of most concern: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The allocation within our long-term incentive compensation plan among performance shares, stock options and restricted  stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The absence of a relative metric applicable to performance shares under our long-term incentive plan   
[END TABLE]
Considering this feedback and the results of the advisory vote on executive compensation at our 2018 annual meeting, senior management and the Compensation Committee conducted a comprehensive review of our executive compensation program as applicable to our named executive officers (NEOs). Following this review, significant changes were made to the allocation among our long-term incentive plan components and the metrics applicable to performance shares. In particular, the Compensation Committee approved the following changes to further align pay and performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  A change to the long-term incentive grant mix by doubling the overall weighting of performance stock units (PSUs) to  be 50 percent, with 30 percent in stock options and 20 percent in restricted stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  The addition of a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) modifier to be applied against return on invested capital  (ROIC) performance results on PSUs  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
✓  A modification to the peer group to add nine companies that match well to General Dynamics  
[END TABLE]
In the fall of 2018, we continued our shareholder engagement efforts by conducting outreach to holders of approximately 65% of our outstanding shares. Once again, our engagement team, comprised of senior management and our Lead Director for select meetings, met with holders representing over 50% of our outstanding shares. During these conversations we discussed the changes made to our executive compensation program for 2019 and other matters of importance to the company and shareholders. Overall, shareholders expressed strong support for the changes made to our future pay structure and the increased alignment of pay with company performance.

Pay for Performance.  Annual incentive payouts for 2018 were determined taking into account the company's 2018 performance against its goals. Annual incentives for 2018 performance reflect an average decline of more than 11 percent for the NEOs compared to the prior year. Similarly, for annual long-term incentive grants awarded in March 2019, the amount of long-term incentive compensation granted to the NEOs was comparatively less than in prior years due to 2018 performance, particularly the company's cash performance. See the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section for more information. 
Board Responsiveness to Shareholder Feedback and Executive Compensation Program Changes.  At the 2018 annual meeting, the shareholder advisory vote on our executive compensation program received the support of 68 percent of our shareholders, which was significantly lower than the support shown in previous years. As part of its ongoing review of the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considered this vote and the viewpoints expressed during our extensive shareholder engagement discussions. While the committee noted that the majority of our shareholders supported our executive compensation program and the incentives it has created for strong company performance, the committee determined that changes to the long-term incentive portion of our executive compensation program would enhance further the pay-for-performance philosophy at the heart of the program. Accordingly, the Compensation Committee implemented changes to the long-term incentive component to (1) double the portion represented by PSUs from 25 percent to 50 percent and (2) add a relative TSR modifier to be applied to the ROIC performance results on the PSUs. The objective of our executive compensation program remains to align compensation with company, business segment and individual performance and provide the incentives necessary to attract, motivate and retain our executives to drive company success and increase shareholder value.

OUR CULTURE OF ETHICS 
As part of our commitment to strong corporate governance practices, we maintain an active and robust ethics program. Our ethics program is rooted in our ethos – our distinguishing moral nature. Our ethos is defined by four values: Alignment, Honesty, Transparency and Trust. These values: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• drive how we operate our business.  
• govern how we interact with each other and our customers, partners and suppliers.  
• guide the way we treat our workforce.  
• determine how we connect with our communities.  
[END TABLE]
Adherence to our ethos ensures that we continue to be good stewards of the investments in us by our shareholders, customers, employees and communities. 
We have a Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct Handbook that applies to all employees. This handbook, known as the Blue Book, has been updated and improved as we have grown and changed over the years. Our ethics program also includes periodic training on ethics and compliance topics for all employees and a 24-hour ethics helpline, which employees can access via telephone or online to communicate any business-related ethics concerns. 
We have adopted ethics codes specifically applicable to our Board of Directors and our financial professionals. The Code of Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors embodies our Board's commitment to manage our business in accordance with the highest standards of ethical conduct. The Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals, which supplements the Blue Book, applies to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, controller and persons performing similar financial functions.

Any amendments to or waivers from the Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct, Code of Ethics for Financial Professionals or Code of Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors on behalf of any of our executive officers, financial professionals or directors will be disclosed on our website. The current Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct are available on our website at www.gd.com/Responsibility. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board comprises independent, accomplished and experienced directors who provide advice and oversight to further the interests of our company and our shareholders. The Board evaluates regularly its leadership structure, including whether to combine the positions of chairman and chief executive officer. This decision cannot be made in the abstract, but rather depends on the then-prevailing facts and circumstances. Academic research into any demonstrable advantage of combining or separating the chairman and chief executive officer roles has been inconclusive. Accordingly, the Board continues to believe that it must exercise its best business judgment in determining the appropriate leadership structure at a particular time under particular circumstances instead of adopting a rigid doctrine favoring one approach at all times and in all circumstances. 
Our Board currently believes that the combination of the chairman and chief executive roles while employing a strong Lead Director position provides a framework for independent leadership and engagement while ensuring appropriate insight into the operations and strategic issues of the company. 
Chairman – Strong and Effective Leadership.  Our Board elects a chairman annually from among the directors. The Board believes that Ms. Novakovic's deep understanding of the company's business, day-to-day operations, growth opportunities, challenges and risk management practices gained through several leadership positions enable her to provide strong and effective leadership to the Board and to ensure the Board is informed of important issues facing the company. The Board also believes that having a combined role promotes a cohesive, strong and consistent vision and strategy for the company. 
Independent Lead Director – Additional Independent Oversight.  The Board has created the position of a Lead Director, elected annually by the Board from among the independent directors. Mr. Crown currently serves as Lead Director. The Board believes the Lead Director position provides additional independent oversight of senior management and Board matters. The selection of a Lead Director facilitates communication among the directors or between any of them and the chairman. Directors frequently communicate among themselves and directly with the chairman. The Lead Director's authority and responsibilities are as follows:

Governance of the Company 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Independence Standards.   Our Board of Directors assesses the independence of our directors and examines the nature and extent of any relationships between General Dynamics and our directors, their families and their affiliates. Our Board has established an objective that at least two-thirds of the directors be independent. For a director to be considered independent, the Board must determine that a director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with General Dynamics. Our Board has established director independence guidelines (the Director Independence Guidelines) as part of the Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist in determining director independence in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR UNDER OUR  DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE GUIDELINES:

[END TABLE]
Independence Determinations.  In March of each year and at other times during the year for director nominations or appointments occurring outside of the annual meeting, the Board of Directors considers whether each director and nominee to the Board meets the definition of an "independent director" in accordance with the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the Director Independence Guidelines. The Board has determined that Ms. Reynolds, Ms. Schumacher and Messrs. Crown, deLeon, Haney, Lyles, Malcolm, Nye, Osborn and Wall each qualifies as an independent director. To make these independence determinations, the Board reviewed all relationships between General Dynamics and the directors and affirmatively determined that none of the individuals qualifying as independent has a material business, financial or other type of relationship with General Dynamics, other than as a director or shareholder of the company. Specifically, the Board considered the relationships listed below and the related person transactions listed beginning on page 21 of this Proxy Statement and found them to be immaterial. For each of the relationships that the Board considered for 2016, 2017 and 2018, the payments made or received by General Dynamics, and the charitable contributions made by General Dynamics, fell below the thresholds in our Director Independence Guidelines (the greater of $1 million or 2 percent of the consolidated gross revenues of the other company). Listed below are the relationships that existed in 2018 that were considered by the Board as part of their independence determinations. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Reynolds and Messrs. Crown, deLeon, Lyles and Osborn serve as members of the boards of trustees or boards of  directors of charitable and other non-profit organizations to which General Dynamics (i) has made payments for memberships, sponsorships, tradeshow exhibit space or tuition in the usual course of our  business, (ii) made and received payments for products and services in the usual course of our business or (iii) made contributions as part of our annual giving program. The 2018 payments fell below the greater of $1 million or  2 percent of the consolidated gross revenues of the organizations. None of the 2018 charitable contributions to these organizations exceeded $122,000.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Messrs. Crown, Haney, Nye and Osborn serve as directors of companies, and Mr. Nye and Ms. Schumacher are  executive officers of companies, to which General Dynamics has sold products and services, or from which General Dynamics has purchased products and services, in the ordinary course of business. None of the directors had any material interest in, or  received any

   compensation in connection with, these ordinary-course business relationships. Each of the payments made or received by General  Dynamics fell below the greater of $1 million or 2 percent of the other company's revenues.  
[END TABLE]
BOARD MEETINGS, BUSINESS UNIT VISITS AND ATTENDANCE 
During 2018, the Board of Directors held 11 meetings. Each of our directors attended 100 percent of the meetings of the Board and committees on which they served in 2018. This included a multi-day meeting in February to review our 2018 operating plan, including the operating plans of each of our business segments. In August 2018, the Board visited facilities of our General Dynamics Land Systems business unit and met with that business unit's management team. We encourage directors to attend each annual meeting of shareholders, and in 2018 nine of our ten directors attended the annual meeting. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF THE BOARD 
Our Board holds executive sessions of the non-management directors following all regularly scheduled Board meetings. The non-management directors may also meet without management present at other times as requested by any non-management director. The independent Lead Director serves as chair at the executive sessions. 
BOARD COMMITTEES 
The Board of Directors has established the following four standing committees to assist in executing its duties: Audit, Compensation, Finance and Benefit Plans, and Nominating and Corporate Governance. The primary responsibilities of each of the committees are described below, together with the current membership and number of meetings held in 2018. Currently, all of our Board committees are composed entirely of independent, non-management directors. Each of the Board committees has a written charter. Copies of these charters are available on our website at www.gd.com/CorporateGovernance, or in print upon request. 
Committee Members.  Listed below are the members of each of the four standing committees as of March 7, 2019. Mr. Haney, who joined the Board in March 2019, has not yet been assigned to a committee.

RISK OVERSIGHT 
Our comprehensive risk management program is conducted by senior management and overseen by the Board of Directors. In particular, the Board oversees management's identification and prioritization of risks that are material to our business. We believe that our risk management processes are well supported by the current board leadership structure. 
How We Manage Risk.  The following summarizes the key elements of the Board's, senior management's and external advisors' roles in our risk management program. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board oversees risk management, focusing on the most significant risks facing the company, including strategic,  operational, financial, legal, cyber and reputational risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each Board committee is integral to risk management and reports specific risk-management matters as necessary to the  full Board.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior management is responsible for  day-to-day risk management and conducts a thorough assessment of the company's risk profile through internal management processes and controls.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The chief executive officer and senior management team provide to the Board a dedicated and comprehensive briefing of  material risks at least twice per year, and the Board is briefed throughout the year as needed on specific risks facing the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Topics discussed in 2018 include our cyber security risk management program, human capital management, data privacy and  program-specific matters.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• External advisors provide independent advice on specific risks and review and comment on risk management processes and  procedures as necessary.  
[END TABLE]
The Role of the Board of Directors in Risk Management.  The full Board reviews and approves annually a corporate policy addressing the delegation of authority and assignment of management responsibility to ensure that the responsibilities and authority delegated to senior management are appropriate from an operational and risk-management perspective. In addition, the Board assesses the company's strategic and operational risks throughout the year, with particular focus on these risks at an annual multi-day Board meeting in early February. At this meeting, senior management reports on opportunities and risks in the markets in which the company conducts business. Additionally, each business unit president and each business segment executive vice president presents the unit's and segment's respective operating plan and strategic initiatives for the year, including notable business opportunities and risks. The Board reviews, adjusts where appropriate, and approves the business unit and business segment goals and adopts our company operating plan for the year. These plans and related risks are monitored throughout the year as part of periodic financial and performance reports given to the Board by the chief financial officer and executive vice presidents of each business segment. The Board also receives briefings from senior management concerning a variety of topics and related risks to the company, including defense budget and acquisition matters, cyber security, human capital management and specific customer or program developments. 
In addition, each of the Board committees considers risk as it relates to its particular areas of responsibility. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee has responsibility for oversight of the company's policies  and practices concerning overall risk assessment and risk management. The committee reviews and takes appropriate action with respect to the company's annual and quarterly financial statements, the internal audit program, the ethics program and  internal controls over financial reporting. To facilitate these risk oversight responsibilities, the committee receives regular briefings from members of senior management on accounting matters; the internal audit plan; internal control over  financial reporting matters; significant litigation and other legal matters; and ethics program matters. The committee also holds regular executive sessions with internal audit and regular executive sessions with the partners of the KPMG LLP audit  team.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation Committee.  The Compensation Committee oversees our executive compensation program to  ensure that the program creates incentives for strong operational performance and for the long-term benefit of the company and its shareholders without encouraging excessive risk-taking. The committee receives briefings from the chairman and chief  executive officer, human resources senior management and outside consultants and advisors on compensation matters.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Finance and Benefit Plans Committee.  The Finance and Benefit Plans Committee oversees the management  of the company's finance policies and the assets of the company's defined benefit plans for employees. The committee oversees market risk exposure with respect to assets within the company's defined benefit plans and related to the  capital structure of the company, including borrowing, liquidity, allocation of capital and funding of benefit plans. To assess risks in these areas, the committee receives regular briefings from our senior management or external advisors on finance  policies, pension plan liabilities and funding, and asset performance.

Governance of the Company 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee  oversees risks related to the company's governance structure and processes and risks arising from related person transactions. The committee receives briefings from the senior vice president, general counsel and secretary.   
[END TABLE]
The Role of External Advisors in Risk Management.  The company's external advisors support the risk management program in a number of ways. Specifically, external advisors support the program by: (1) auditing our financial statements; (2) reviewing and suggesting updates and improvements to our risk management processes and procedures; (3) assisting in the implementation of Board and senior management responsibilities regarding risk management; and (4) supporting and assisting with public disclosure regarding risk management and company risks. 
Succession Planning and Risk Management.  The Board considers senior management succession planning a core part of the company's risk management program. At least annually, the Board reviews with the chief executive officer succession planning for senior leadership positions, and the timing and development required to ensure continuity of leadership over the short and long term. 
DIRECTOR ORIENTATION AND CONTINUING EDUCATION 
Within six months of election to the Board, each new director receives an orientation that consists of a series of in-person briefings provided by corporate officers on our business operations; significant financial, accounting and risk-management matters; corporate governance; ethics; and key policies and practices. The new director receives briefings on the responsibilities, duties and activities of the committees on which the director will initially serve. New directors also have the opportunity to visit business units within each of our business segments and receive briefings from the respective segment executive vice president and members of business unit management teams. 
To further support directors, the general counsel and chief financial officer periodically provide materials and briefing sessions on subjects that assist directors in fulfilling their duties. Annually, the Board holds a multi-day meeting with our senior management to review and approve the operating plans of each of our business units and business segments and the company as a whole. Directors also visit our business units periodically. These visits allow the directors to interact with the business unit management teams and employees and gain a firsthand view of our operations. 
BOARD AND COMMITTEE PERFORMANCE SELF-ASSESSMENTS 
Each year, the directors undertake a self-assessment for the Board and each committee on which they serve to elicit feedback on the performance and effectiveness of the Board and its committees. As part of this self-assessment, the directors are asked to consider the Board's role, relations with management, composition and meetings. Each committee is asked to consider its role and the responsibilities articulated in the committee charter, the composition of the committee and the committee's operation. The self-assessment responses and comments are compiled by the Corporate Secretary and presented to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for initial review. The responses and comments are reviewed with each committee and the full Board. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE BOARD
Any shareholder or other interested party who has a concern or question about the conduct of General Dynamics may communicate directly with our non-management directors, the chairman or the full Board. Communications may be confidential or anonymous. Communications should be submitted in writing to the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in care of the Corporate Secretary, General Dynamics Corporation, 2941 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 100, Falls Church, Virginia 22042. The Corporate Secretary will receive and process all written communications and will refer all substantive communications to the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with guidelines approved by the independent members of the Board. The chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and, if necessary, investigate and address all such communications and will report the status of these communications to the non-management directors as a group or the full Board on a quarterly basis. 
Our employees and other interested parties may also communicate concerns or complaints about our accounting, internal control over financial reporting or auditing matters directly to the Audit Committee. Communications may be confidential or anonymous and can be submitted in writing or reported by telephone. Written communications should be submitted to the chair of the Audit Committee in care of our ethics officer at the address in the preceding paragraph or at the address in the Standards of Business Ethics and Conduct Handbook provided to all employees. Our employees can call a toll-free helpline number or access the helpline online, each of which is provided to all employees. The ethics officer will review, investigate and address any concerns or complaints unless the Audit 
20     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
Governance of the Company 
Committee instructs otherwise. The ethics officer will report the status of all concerns and complaints to the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may also direct that matters be presented to the full Board and may direct special treatment of any concern or complaint addressed to it, including the retention of outside advisors or counsel. 
RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS POLICY 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written policy on the review and approval of related person transactions. Related persons covered by the policy are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)     executive officers, directors and director nominees;   
    (1)     executive officers, directors and director nominees;   
      (2)     any person who is known to be a beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of our voting securities;   
      (2)     any person who is known to be a beneficial owner of more than 5 percent of our voting securities;   
      (3)         any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons;  or   
      (3)         any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons;  or   
      (3)         any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons;  or   
      (4)       any entity in which any of the foregoing persons has or will  have a direct or indirect material interest.   
      (4)       any entity in which any of the foregoing persons has or will  have a direct or indirect material interest.   
[END TABLE]
A related person transaction is defined by this policy as a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) in which: General Dynamics will be a participant; the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and any related person will have a direct or indirect material interest. The following interests and transactions are not subject to the policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    (1)     director compensation that has been approved by the Board;   
    (1)     director compensation that has been approved by the Board;   
    (2)     a transaction where the rates or charges are determined by competitive bid; or   
    (3)     a compensatory arrangement solely related to employment with General Dynamics (or a subsidiary) that has been approved by the  Compensation Committee, or recommended by the Compensation Committee to the Board.   
    (3)     a compensatory arrangement solely related to employment with General Dynamics (or a subsidiary) that has been approved by the  Compensation Committee, or recommended by the Compensation Committee to the Board.   
[END TABLE]
In considering the appropriate action to be taken regarding a related person transaction, the committee or the Board will consider the best interests of General Dynamics and whether the transaction is fair to the company, is on terms that would be obtainable in an arm's-length transaction or is pursuant to a company discount program for which the related person is eligible, serves a compelling business reason and any other factors it deems relevant. As a condition to approving or ratifying any related person transaction, the committee or the Board may impose whatever conditions and standards it deems appropriate, including periodic monitoring of ongoing transactions. 
The following transactions with a related person were determined to pose no actual conflict of interest and were reviewed and approved by the committee or the Board pursuant to our related person transactions policy: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based upon Schedule 13G filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), BlackRock, Inc., a global  provider of investment, advisory and risk management solutions, has reported beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of our outstanding common stock. An affiliate of BlackRock provides investment management services for certain of our  defined benefit plans, including plans acquired in the CSRA acquisition. The agreements with BlackRock were negotiated in arm's-length transactions and the ownership of General Dynamics stock plays no  role in the business relationship between General Dynamics and BlackRock. In addition, we believe the agreements represent standard terms and conditions for investment management services. For providing the services, BlackRock received fees in 2018  totaling approximately $3.1 million. In accordance with the related person transactions policy, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviewed and approved the services for 2018 and approved the continuation of the services in 2019.

As part of the Compensation Committee's annual review in early 2018 and at its request, management engaged Aon to conduct a director compensation survey. Aon provided director compensation data for the peer group that we used to benchmark executive compensation. This information showed that the directors' pay program was approximate to the median of the peer group. Based on this review, the committee recommended no changes to director compensation. 
Each non-management director has the option of receiving all or part of the annual retainer in the form of Common Stock. The annual retainer, additional committee chair retainer (if any) and attendance fees paid to each director during 2018 are reflected in the Fees Earned or Paid in Cash column of the Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table, irrespective of whether a director took the annual retainer in shares of Common Stock. The annual equity award consists of restricted stock and stock options granted pursuant to our shareholder-approved equity compensation plan and on the same terms, limits and schedule as awards to other plan participants. 
In light of the travel required by service on the Board, we also provide each director with accidental death and dismemberment insurance coverage. Payments by General Dynamics for director accidental death and dismemberment insurance premiums are reflected in the All Other Compensation column of the Director Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table. 
2019 Compensation.  In early 2019, as part of its annual review of director compensation, the Compensation Committee requested that management update its director compensation analysis. Management again engaged Aon to provide survey data for the peer group used to benchmark executive compensation. The committee reviewed the survey data regarding director compensation provided by Aon. Based on this review, the committee recommended no changes to director compensation.

DIRECTOR STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The Board of Directors believes that each director should develop a meaningful ownership position in General Dynamics. Therefore, the Board of Directors adopted stock ownership guidelines for non-management directors. Pursuant to these guidelines, each non-management director is expected to own shares of our Common Stock having a value equal to at least eight times the annual retainer. Non-management directors are subject to the same holding requirements as our NEOs and are expected to retain shares received upon the vesting of restricted stock or exercise of options until the ownership guidelines are met. Management directors are subject to the ownership requirements discussed under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Stock Ownership Guidelines. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE 
The table below provides total compensation for 2018 for each of General Dynamics' non-management directors serving during the year. Each director is awarded the same number of shares of restricted stock and stock options each year.

General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     23 
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 
(PROPOSAL 2) 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has the sole authority to retain the company's independent auditors and is responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditors for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit report or related work. The Audit Committee has selected KPMG LLP (KPMG), an independent registered public accounting firm, as our independent auditors for 2019. KPMG has been retained as the company's independent auditors since 2002. In order to assure continuing auditor independence, the Audit Committee periodically considers whether there should be a regular rotation of the independent audit firm. The members of the Audit Committee believe that the continued retention of KPMG to serve as the company's independent auditors is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. 
Your Board of Directors is submitting this selection of KPMG as the independent auditors for 2019 to an advisory vote of the shareholders. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that the Audit Committee be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the audit work of the independent auditors. Nevertheless, as a good corporate governance practice, your Board has determined to solicit the vote of the shareholders on an advisory basis in making this appointment. 
If the shareholders do not vote on an advisory basis in favor of the selection of KPMG as our independent auditors, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether to engage KPMG and may ultimately determine to engage that firm or another audit firm without resubmitting the matter to shareholders. Even if the shareholders vote in favor of the selection of KPMG, the Audit Committee may in its sole discretion terminate the engagement of KPMG and direct the appointment of another independent audit firm at any time during the year. 
Audit and Non-Audit Fees.  The following table shows aggregate fees for professional services rendered by KPMG for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements for the years 2018 and 2017, and fees billed for other services rendered by KPMG during those years.

 Audit-related Fees (b)           3,149,000              1,882,000      
 Tax Fees (c)           1,107,000              1,226,000      
 All Other Fees (d)           76,000              5,000      
 Total Fees         $     27,747,000              $     23,080,000          
 Total Fees         $     27,747,000              $     23,080,000          
  (b)  Audit-related fees are fees for assurance and related services performed by KPMG that are reasonably related to the  performance of the audit or review of our consolidated financial statements. These fees consist primarily of fees for professional services for benefit plan audits and evaluation of new accounting standards.  
  (c)  Tax fees are fees for professional services performed by KPMG for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning. These  fees consist primarily of fees for tax return preparation and review, tax compliance services for expatriates and advice regarding tax implications of certain transactions.  
  (d)  All other fees are primarily related to professional services performed by KPMG for information technology contract  compliance, assessment and advisory services.  
[END TABLE]
Auditor Independence. The Audit Committee has considered whether the services rendered by KPMG are compatible with maintaining KPMG's independence. Representatives of KPMG are expected to attend the Annual Meeting, may make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to questions. 
Policy on Pre-Approval. The company and the Audit Committee are committed to ensuring the independence of the independent auditors, both in fact and in appearance. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable rules of the SEC, the Audit Committee has established policies and procedures for pre-approval of all audit and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors. The Audit Committee determines annually whether to approve all audit and permitted non-audit services proposed to be performed by the independent auditors (including an estimate of fees). If other audit or permitted non-audit services not included in the pre-approved services are required during the year, such services must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee may delegate authority to grant pre-approvals to its chair or a subcommittee as it deems appropriate, subject to a reporting obligation to the Audit Committee. All audit and permitted non-audit services listed above were pre-approved. 
YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL. 
24     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
The following Audit Committee Report shall not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating by reference this Proxy Statement or any portion hereof into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act) or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), and shall not otherwise be deemed filed under such acts. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has furnished the following report. 
The following five directors serve on the Audit Committee: Mark M. Malcolm (Chair), James S. Crown, Lester L. Lyles, William A. Osborn and Catherine B. Reynolds. 
None of these directors is an officer or employee of General Dynamics. They all meet the independence requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act. The Board has determined that Mr. Malcolm, Mr. Osborn and Ms. Reynolds each qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter approved by the Board. In accordance with that charter, the Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the quality and integrity of the accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices of General Dynamics. The Committee held eight meetings in 2018. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and the company's independent auditors for 2018, KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, the company's audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018, and for the year ended on that date. Management is responsible for the company's financial reporting process, including maintaining a system of internal controls, and for preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). KPMG is responsible for auditing those consolidated financial statements and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the consolidated financial statements with GAAP. In addition, in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG management's report on the operating effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and KPMG's attestation report on the company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG the matters required under applicable professional auditing standards and regulations adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. In addition, the Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and letter from KPMG required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding KPMG's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with KPMG its independence, including the compatibility of non-audit services with maintaining KPMG's independence. Based on the foregoing discussions and reviews, the Audit Committee has satisfied itself as to the independence of KPMG. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the inclusion of the audited consolidated financial statements in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
This report is submitted by the Audit Committee.

ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
(PROPOSAL 3) 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking shareholder input on our executive compensation as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. The Board and the Compensation Committee actively monitor our executive compensation practices in light of the industry in which we operate and the marketplace for talent in which we compete. We remain focused on compensating our executive officers fairly and in a manner that emphasizes performance while providing the tools necessary to attract and retain the best talent. 
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, our executive compensation program is designed to create incentives both for strong operational performance in the current year and for the long-term benefit of the company, thereby closely aligning the interests of management with the interests of our shareholders. 
For these reasons, the Board recommends shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
The vote is advisory and is not binding on the Board. However, the Compensation Committee of the Board expects to take into account the outcome of the vote as it continues to consider the company's executive compensation program. 
YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORSUNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THIS PROPOSAL.

 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RESPONSIVENESS TO SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK   
 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF RESPONSIVENESS TO SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK   
   At the 2018 annual meeting, the advisory vote in favor of our  executive compensation program received 68 percent support, which is significantly lower than the support shown in recent years.

COMPANY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
Financial Performance Summary.  In 2018, the company's commitment to operational excellence delivered another year of revenue and earnings growth and a double-digit increase in earnings per share for shareholders. The success of our approach under Ms. Novakovic's leadership is evident in higher revenue at each of our five business segments, which drove growth in earnings from continuing operations. We continue to balance our focus on operations with a thoughtful capital deployment strategy. As stewards of your capital, in 2018 we enhanced shareholder value through our prudent use of capital, including investment in long-term business opportunities, an increase in the dividend for the 21st consecutive year, tactical share repurchases and the acquisition of complementary businesses. In the sixth year under Ms. Novakovic's leadership, the company added new, key contracts, which helped us grow our backlog by over 7 percent, providing the opportunity to deliver strong operating results in the future. 
CSRA Acquisition.  On April 3, 2018, we completed a $9.7 billion acquisition of CSRA Inc. (CSRA), our largest acquisition to date. The combination of General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT) and CSRA created a premier provider of technology solutions and mission services to help customers across defense, intelligence and federal civilian markets advance mission performance and transform operations. Integrating these two businesses has enhanced our ability to develop cost-effective, next-generation technology solutions, leverage our expanded and deep experience across multiple agencies and pursue large-scale enterprise solutions for our customers.

Our management team delivers shareholder returns through disciplined execution on backlog, efficient cash flow conversion and prudent capital deployment. We manage costs, undertake continuous improvement initiatives, and collaborate across our businesses to achieve our goals of maximizing earnings and cash flow and creating value for our shareholders. Management's focus on these metrics is reflected in the goals set forth in the company's incentive plans because we believe successful execution in these areas directly translates to shareholder value creation. Thus, NEO performance is assessed based on company-wide measures, the key metrics the Committee considers when making executive compensation decisions for the NEOs. Ultimately, the pay delivered to our NEOs is based on our long-standing pay-for-performance philosophy.

At our 2018 annual shareholders' meeting, approximately 68 percent of the votes cast were in favor of the advisory resolution to approve our company's executive compensation program. This level of support was a significant decline from the 2017 vote, when approximately 96 percent of the votes cast were in favor of this proposal. In connection with the 2018 annual meeting, we conducted an extensive shareholder outreach campaign through which senior representatives of our Investor Relations, Corporate Governance and Human Resources (including Executive Compensation) groups, supplemented by our Lead Director as appropriate met in-person or by phone with shareholders representing over 50 percent of our outstanding shares of Common Stock to gather feedback on our executive compensation program, operational performance and other business topics. 
Based on the feedback received, we concluded that the following two items were of most concern: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The allocation within our long-term incentive compensation plan among performance shares, stock options and restricted  stock  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The absence of a relative metric applicable to performance shares under our long-term incentive plan   
[END TABLE]
Considering this feedback and the results of the advisory vote on executive compensation at our 2018 annual meeting, senior management and the Committee conducted a comprehensive review of our executive compensation program as applicable to our NEOs. Following this review, significant changes were made as shown below.

A relative performance measure should be incorporated into the program    Starting with the 2019  equity awards, a relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) modifier will be applied against ROIC performance results on performance stock units. The TSR modifier can increase or decrease the PSU payout by as much as one-third depending on the  company's performance ranking relative to the TSRs of the companies in the S&P 500 thus better aligning long-term compensation to the relative stock performance of the company and ensuring alignment with our shareholders. 
 Peer group should be expanded    The Committee revised the peer group it uses to benchmark  executive pay levels. Eight new companies of reasonably similar size, scope and complexity were added, and two companies, Rockwell Collins, Inc. and L-3 Technologies, Inc., were removed. The Committee believes this new peer group of 15 companies is  appropriate for our industry and reflects companies with whom we compete for talent.

In the fall of 2018, we continued our shareholder engagement efforts by conducting outreach to holders of approximately 65 percent of our outstanding shares. Once again, our engagement team, comprised of senior management and our Lead Director for select meetings, met with holders representing over 50 percent of our outstanding shares. During these conversations, we discussed the changes made to our executive compensation program for 2019 and other matters of importance to the company and shareholders. Overall, the shareholders with whom we engaged expressed strong support for the changes made to our future pay structure and the increased alignment of pay with company performance.

The Committee approves and is actively engaged in the design and implementation of the executive compensation program, with the support of the independent compensation consultant and company management. The program is structured to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide market-competitive total target compensation

[END TABLE]
The program objective of pay for performance is achieved through the use of short- and long-term incentives. The company targets the median pay of our peers as further discussed in detail below. In addition, through the annual incentive plan, the NEOs are rewarded for achieving annual company goals. 
SETTING COMPENSATION LEVELS AND EVALUATING PERFORMANCE 
Setting compensation for senior executives is a 16-month process that begins in the fall of each year. The first steps in this process focus on establishing the operating goals for the company for the upcoming year. During this phase, the business units develop challenging but achievable goals which then form the basis of the business segment operating plans. In consultation with the chairman and chief executive officer and the chief financial officer, these plans are presented to the Board of Directors early the next year. After review and, where appropriate, adjustment, by the Board, the company operating plan for the year is adopted. Throughout the year, the Board reviews and monitors company performance as compared to the operating plan through a series of financial and operating reports given by the chief financial officer and the executive vice presidents. 
Compensation discussions begin immediately following the execution of the operating plan. Based on company and individual performance for the prior fiscal year, the chairman and chief executive officer calculates and assigns a score to each NEO (other than herself) using a scorecard. The score for the chief executive officer is calculated solely by a review of independent directors. The scores determine the compensation recommendations that are made in the first quarter of the year. In February, the Committee reviews the NEO scorecards, calculates the score for the chief executive officer and reviews the compensation recommendations supported by the scores. As part of this process, the Committee reviews market data to ensure that any base salary increase does not place the NEOs' annual salary in excess of the 50th percentile of our peer group. 
The Committee convenes again in early March to review the final scorecards for the company and approves any base salary increases, annual incentive payments for the prior year's performance and current-year long-term incentive grants. The Committee reviews, refines and approves compensation for the chairman and chief executive officer in executive session at the March meeting. The Committee approves compensation based on the clearly defined and disclosed performance goals described in this Proxy Statement. The Committee's decisions also reflect factors such as the degree of difficulty of goals, market conditions and exceptional individual achievement.

PEER GROUP AND BENCHMARKING TO THE MARKET 
Each year the Committee, in consultation with management and with support from its independent compensation consultant, develops a peer group comprised of companies that are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In similar industries and where General Dynamics competes for business  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Likely sources of or competition for executive talent

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Included as peers of some of our peer companies  
[END TABLE]
In 2018, the Committee made material revisions to the peer group to arrive at a peer group of 15 companies. Seven of the nine similarly-sized aerospace and defense companies from the 2017 peer group were retained; two companies were removed: Rockwell Collins, which was acquired by current peer United Technologies, and L-3 due to its smaller size. Eight new companies that met the above-listed criteria were added. Peer group proxy data and survey data provided by Aon are utilized to assess the competitiveness of our executive compensation practices, structures and levels. The Committee reviews and analyzes the peer group annually for reasonableness and alignment with the objectives listed above.

  *See discussion regarding the 2019 changes to long-term incentive compensation on page 32 
Structural Alignment of Pay with Performance. We demonstrate our commitment to aligning compensation with company performance through the following key elements of the executive compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive compensation is linked strongly to the financial and operational performance of the company. In 2018, over 90  percent of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's total compensation was linked to metrics assessing company or stock performance and therefore meaningfully at risk, while over 80 percent of the other NEOs' compensation was in line  with a similar risk profile. A significant amount of the at-risk compensation is delivered through equity: PSUs, stock options and restricted stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To emphasize a culture of ownership and strengthen management's alignment with long-term shareholder interests, the  Committee requires one of the strictest set of stock ownership guidelines across the Fortune 100 for the NEOs. Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer is required to hold General Dynamics stock with a value at least equal to 15 times base salary.  The other NEOs are required to hold General Dynamics stock with a value at least equal to 10 times base salary.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Linking Pay Levels to the Market and General Dynamics Performance. NEO compensation is generally targeted to the median of the peer group by component and in total. To the extent compensation exceeds targeted levels, it is directly attributable to performance that increases shareholder value and exceeds measurable, clearly defined performance goals. Conversely, total compensation can be substantially less than target for performance that falls significantly short of pre-established targets. 
Setting Challenging Targets Based on Market Conditions. The annual incentive and the PSUs are based on measurable and objective performance metrics. Annual incentive performance targets were set in early 2018 based on backlog, anticipated order activity and expected market conditions. Three-year target goals for the PSUs were set in early 2018 based on our long-term operating plans. Targets were in line with guidance provided to the market by company management. 
ANNUAL BASE SALARY 
We pay each NEO a base salary that reflects the peer group median (50th percentile) salary. Salaries are reviewed annually, and increases, when they occur, are driven primarily by changes in the market. We believe that organizations that perform well over the long term, like General Dynamics, make an effort to pay salaries at or near the market median and create opportunities for executives to earn above-median compensation through annual and long-term incentives that are awarded based on performance relative to challenging and clear performance goals. The goal of our base salary is to provide a competitive, fixed-rate of cash compensation.

[END TABLE]
The NEOs are eligible to earn an annual incentive paid in cash based on the company's and their performance. The incentive is designed to place at risk a significant portion of each NEO's total target compensation. The incentive is based on performance against specific, measurable goals established at the beginning of the year and approved by the Committee as well as the Committee's assessment of each NEO's individual performance during the year. The goals are designed to be difficult but achievable through solid execution. The Committee believes the chosen incentive metrics are good indicators of the company's overall performance and lead to the creation of long-term value for our shareholders. 
NEO PERFORMANCE METRICS 
In 2018, the annual incentive for each NEO was determined initially based on the same two financial metrics: company earnings from continuing operations and free cash flow from operations. Because the executive vice presidents play a major role in the overall success of the company in addition to overseeing their business segment, the Committee believes that they should be evaluated on similar company-wide metrics as the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer. 
General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     37 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Committee approved these target goals, in alignment with our annual operating plan, in 2018 and believes these goals were appropriately challenging considering our business outlook at the time. The 2018 earnings from continuing operations target represented a 9.3 percent growth from the 2017 actual performance for this metric, demonstrating significant goal rigor. The 2018 free cash flow from operations goal was set below 2017 actual performance for this metric because of the anticipated operating working capital growth required to support an international wheeled armored vehicle contract with the Canadian government in our Combat Systems segment and the new G500 and G600 aircraft programs in our Aerospace segment.

However, the impact of the below-target performance on the free cash flow from operations was tempered somewhat as it resulted from a unique and unexpected diplomatic situation between the Canadian government and its customer on our armored vehicle supply contract and was not reflective of operational issues or management's deficiency. Ultimately, all of our NEOs exhibited exceptional individual performance and the company delivered solid operational and financial performance in 2018, with all-time highs for revenue, earnings from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations. 
Other notable 2018 accomplishments included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of our five segments experienced organic revenue growth. We, once again, achieved double-digit year-over-year  growth in diluted earnings per share, which was up 17.4 percent over 2017. We had a book-to-bill ratio of 1:1 on a consolidated basis and ended the year with total backlog of $67.9 billion, up 7.4 percent over 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Aerospace segment successfully managed through a new model transition while achieving good order intake, industry  leading operating margins and increased deliveries of large cabin aircraft. We achieved FAA certification and began customer deliveries of the all-new G500 business jet. Additionally, we resolved a significant supplier challenge, which will support  improved quality and lower costs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Defense businesses demonstrated strong operating performance while continuing to book significant new business.  Backlog in the defense segments grew by 11.4 percent over 2017 with each of the segments achieving an organic book-to-bill ratio equal to or greater than 1:1. We embarked on a multi-year capital investment plan to support the substantial growth we  anticipate in our Marine Systems segment driven by the Columbia-class submarine program.

Setting Long-term Grant Amounts. The Committee uses guidelines that are constructed around the market median and balances other considerations such as prior-year performance, complexity of the role, length of service, future expected contributions to the company and impact on dilution, when determining actual LTI grant amounts. We believe that this approach allows for the consideration of factors in addition to the quantitative metrics that drive annual incentive payments. This allows the Committee to make grant decisions that better meet the needs of our business and shareholders. 
General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     39 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
As shown below, for annual LTI grants awarded in March 2019, the amount of LTI compensation granted to the NEOs was comparatively less than in prior years due to 2018 performance, particularly the company's cash performance.

Performance Stock Units (PSUs) are a form of equity compensation tied to the achievement of specific performance goals and linked to the long-term performance of the company. This element of executive compensation closely connects NEOs to the company's financial and stock performance over the long term and acts as a retention tool. NEOs who voluntarily resign or are terminated for cause prior to the end of the applicable performance period immediately forfeit all PSUs that have not vested unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 
2016-2018 PSU Achievement. In March 2019, the Committee certified the three-year ROIC achievement for PSUs granted in 2016, against the target established for the 2016 – 2018 performance period. After reviewing company results, the Committee certified our three-year average ROIC of 17.8 percent which was 2.5 percent above the target and translated into a payout of 150 percent of the target number of PSUs granted to each NEO. Because the PSU target did not contemplate the acquisition of CSRA, the Committee excluded the impact of the acquisition from the 2018 ROIC results (see discussion in Appendix A). 
2018 PSU GRANT (2018 – 2020 PERFORMANCE CYCLE) 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the 2018 – 2020 performance period, the ROIC target was set at 13.4 percent. This target is modestly below  the 15.2 percent target of the previous performance period. In setting the target, the Committee considered the company's 2018 $9.7 billion acquisition of CSRA and the impact that this important investment will have on ROIC results. In  particular, the Committee acknowledged the limitations of comparing the ROIC target to prior-period targets and performance due to the significant amount of capital deployed to fund the CSRA acquisition. The acquisition-related indebtedness  increased the company's invested capital, a key component of the ROIC computation, and therefore decreased the ROIC target for the 2018 – 2020 performance period.    
• The three-year ROIC target is set on the date of grant and reflects the best judgment of the Committee at that time.     
• The performance target is set to be challenging, yet achievable.    
• The company operates in a dynamic and competitive environment. As such, the target established each year represents the  outlook for the upcoming three-year period and may not be comparable to past targets or prior achievement.    
• Additionally, the Committee and management believe that the target reflects the multi-year operating plan for the  company and reflects management's assessment of future company performance and needed investments in the company's businesses to support the long-term growth of the company.

Relative Total Shareholder Return Metric Beginning in 2019. Starting with the 2019 PSU award, the resulting percentage earned from three-year average ROIC will be subject to a relative TSR modifier, which compares our relative TSR performance to the TSR performance of the S&P 500 to produce the final number of earned shares. The Committee believes that the S&P 500 provides a more comprehensive comparison for our share price performance compared to our compensation peer group, which is a customized benchmark based on a limited number of companies. The relative TSR modifier will increase or decrease the PSU payout by as much as one-third, resulting in a payout range between zero percent and 200 percent of the units granted.

RESTRICTED STOCK 
Restricted stock awards are a form of equity compensation tied to the completion of a service period. This element of executive compensation closely connects NEOs to the company's stock performance over the vesting period and therefore acts as a retention tool. NEOs who voluntarily resign or are terminated for cause prior to the end of the applicable vesting period forfeit their restricted stock unless otherwise determined by the Committee. 
In 2018, the Committee approved the grant of restricted stock to each NEO. The shares are subject to a three-year cliff vesting period (i.e., 100 percent of the shares vest on the third anniversary of the grant). The Committee has determined that the use of three-year cliff vesting on our restricted stock ensures that executives are focused on long-term value creation while supporting the company's need to attract and retain executives during all market conditions. During the restriction period, NEOs may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign, or otherwise convey their restricted shares. NEOs are eligible, however, to vote their shares and receive dividend payments and other distributions on our Common Stock when declared by the Board of Directors. 
STOCK OPTIONS 
Stock options are a form of equity compensation linked to the long-term share performance of the company. This element of executive compensation closely connects NEOs to the company's stock performance over the long term and acts as a retention tool. A stock option gives our NEOs the right to buy up to a specified number of shares of our Common Stock over the term of the option at a predetermined fixed exercise price. A stock option's exercise price is the average of the high and low share price of our Common Stock on the date of grant. 
In March 2018, the Committee approved a grant of stock options to each NEO. The exercise price of these stock options was set at $223.93. The stock options vest as follows: 50 percent of the grant becomes exercisable after two years and 50 percent becomes exercisable after three years. Vested stock options remain exercisable through the options' expiration date, which occurs on the tenth 
General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     41 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis anniversary of the grant date. Due to our strenuous stock ownership guidelines (10 times base salary and 15 times for the chief executive officer) stock options must be exercised and held as shares until the ownership requirement is met. 
As with restricted stock and PSU awards, NEOs who voluntarily resign or are terminated for cause immediately forfeit all stock options that have not vested unless otherwise determined by the Committee. Our equity compensation plan prohibits the repricing of stock options, including the exchange of underwater stock options for another award or for cash, without the approval of shareholders. 
BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES 
BENEFITS 
General Dynamics-provided benefits are an important tool used to attract and retain outstanding executives. Benefit levels are reviewed periodically to ensure they are cost-effective, competitive and support the overall needs of our employees. The company makes available medical, dental, vision, life insurance and disability coverage to all of the NEOs. NEOs can select the level of coverage appropriate for their circumstances. The company also provides NEOs group life insurance coverage worth two times base salary and long-term disability coverage worth 50 percent of base salary. 
COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS 
We provide retirement plans to our eligible employees, including the eligible NEOs, through a combination of qualified and non-qualified plans. Following is a description of the retirement plans in which the NEOs participate: 
Defined-Benefit Retirement Plan.  Each NEO other than Mr. Johnson participates in a company-sponsored defined-benefit plan called the General Dynamics Salaried Retirement Plan. Beginning January 1, 2014, pension accruals under this plan stopped for employees at our corporate headquarters, including the participating NEOs. 
The benefit under the plan is payable as a life annuity. The Salaried Retirement Plan is a funded, tax-qualified, noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan. It was amended effective January 1, 2007, to exclude any employee initially hired or who incurs a break in service after that date. The benefit formula under the Salaried Retirement Plan for employees hired before December 31, 2006, is 1.0 percent times a participant's highest final average pay frozen as of December 31, 2013, multiplied by years of service earned on or after January 1, 2007, and before January 1, 2014, plus 1.333 percent times a participant's highest final average pay frozen as of December 31, 2010, multiplied by years of service earned prior to January 1, 2007. Final average pay for purposes of calculating retirement benefits includes a NEO's base salary and annual incentive. The company makes contributions to the Salaried Retirement Plan through payments into a trust fund from which the benefits are paid. 
Supplemental Retirement Plan.  The amount of cash compensation used to calculate pension benefits for participants in the Salaried Retirement Plan is limited by the Internal Revenue Code ($275,000 in 2018). To provide a benefit calculated on compensation in excess of this compensation limit, the company provides eligible executives coverage under the General Dynamics Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan. Benefits under the Supplemental Retirement Plan are general unsecured obligations of General Dynamics. Each NEO, other than Mr. Johnson, participates in the Supplemental Retirement Plan. Beginning January 1, 2014, pension accruals under this plan stopped for employees at our corporate headquarters including the participating NEOs. 
Anteon International Corporation Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan.  Mr. Johnson has an account balance under the frozen Anteon International Corporation Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan. Under the plan, certain eligible employees of Anteon could defer receipt of all or a portion of their annual cash compensation prior to the plan being frozen in 2007. Upon his retirement, Mr. Johnson elected to receive the deferred compensation in a lump sum. 
401(k) Plan.  Each NEO is eligible to participate in the General Dynamics Corporation 401(k) Plan, a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan. Each NEO is eligible to make before-tax contributions and receive company matching contributions under the 401(k) Plan. During 2018, the 401(k) Plan provided for a company-matching contribution of 100 percent on before-tax contributions up to the first 6 percent of a participant's eligible pay. Our matching contributions during 2018 for the NEOs are included in footnote (d) to the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
42     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Supplemental Savings Plan.  The company provides a Supplemental Savings Plan to key employees, including each NEO. The purpose of the Supplemental Savings Plan is to allow key executives to defer salary and receive matching contributions on compensation in excess of the compensation limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Service on earnings used to calculate 401(k) contributions. Matching contributions during 2018 for the NEOs are included in footnote (d) to the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
Other Retiree Benefits.  Eligible key executives throughout the company, including the NEOs, can purchase group term life insurance prior to retiring of up to two times their base pay. For executives who retire early (prior to age 65), we pay for insurance coverage equal to one-half the executive's base salary until the executive reaches age 65. For early retirees who elect coverage in excess of one-half of base pay they will pay monthly premiums for the additional coverage. For executives retiring at or after age 65, we pay for insurance coverage up to two times an executive's base salary. This coverage is ratably reduced over a five-year period following the executive's retirement, or beginning at age 65 for early retirees, subject to a maximum coverage level of 25 percent of the coverage in effect at the time of retirement. 
PERQUISITES 
We provide our NEOs perquisites that the Committee believes are reasonable yet competitive. The company provides perquisites to the NEOs for purposes of recruitment, retention and security. We provide perquisites to ensure the security and accessibility of our executives to facilitate the transaction of business. As a reasonableness test, we compare these perquisites to generally accepted corporate practices. 
In 2018, the perquisites provided to our NEOs were financial planning and tax preparation services, physical examinations, home security systems, personal liability and supplemental accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and the personal use of automobiles owned or leased by the company. In addition, personal use of our aircraft was provided only to our chairman and chief executive officer as required by the Board to help ensure her security and accessibility. 
We have provided additional information on perquisites in footnote (d) to the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
POTENTIAL SEVERANCE AND CHANGE IN CONTROL BENEFITS 
The company has change in control agreements, also known as severance protection agreements, with each of the NEOs. The company believes that these agreements are an important tool for recruiting and retaining highly qualified executives. The agreements are structured to protect the interests of shareholders by including a "double trigger" mechanism that results in a severance payout only when: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A change of control is consummated, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The executive's employment is terminated by the company without cause or by the executive for good reason within 24  months following the change in control.  
[END TABLE]
A "change in control" is defined to include specified stock acquisition, merger or disposition transactions involving General Dynamics. The Committee evaluates and reviews payment and benefit levels under the change in control agreements regularly. These reviews support the view that the agreements are consistent with the practices of our peer group companies. Our severance protection agreements for NEOs exclude any provision for reimbursement of excise taxes that may become due upon a change in control. 
Payments and benefits provided to NEOs pursuant to the change in control agreements are described in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control section beginning on page 53 of this Proxy Statement.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
ROLEOF THE INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION CONSULTANT 
The Committee's charter provides that the Committee has sole authority to engage the services of an independent compensation consultant for the Committee and approve fees paid to the consultant by the company. The Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian) as an independent compensation consultant to provide advice on executive compensation matters. The Committee found that Meridian provided important perspectives about market practices for executive compensation, peer company analysis and selection, the levels and structure of the compensation program, and compensation governance. During 2018, at the Committee's request, Meridian performed the following specific services:

• Provided information and advice relating to executive compensation matters  
[END TABLE]

• Reviewed compensation-related disclosures in the company's proxy statement  
[END TABLE]
Before engaging Meridian, the Committee reviewed the factors influencing independence (as specified by the New York Stock Exchange listing standards) and determined that no conflict of interest exists. 
ANTI-HEDGINGAND ANTI-PLEDGING POLICIES 
The company has a longstanding policy in place that prohibits all directors and executive officers from hedging company securities. Since 2014, the company has maintained a policy prohibiting all directors and executive officers from pledging company securities that they own directly. 
Mr. Crown has the ownership of certain shares attributed to him that arise from the business of Henry Crown and Company, an investment company where Mr. Crown serves as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and trusts of which Mr. Crown serves as trustee (Attributed Shares). Mr. Crown disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares, except to the extent of his pecuniary interest. The Attributed Shares are distinct from shares owned by Mr. Crown or his spouse individually, or shares held in trusts for the benefit of his children (Crown Personally Held Shares). The company has reviewed the potential pledging of the Attributed Shares with Mr. Crown, recognizes Mr. Crown's distinct obligations with respect to Henry Crown and Company and the trusts, and believes such shares may be prudently pledged or held in margin loan accounts. Under the company's anti-pledging policy, Crown Personally Held Shares are considered company securities that are owned directly by Mr. Crown and, accordingly, may not be and are not held in margin accounts or otherwise pledged as collateral, nor may the economic risk of such shares be hedged. 
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES AND HOLDING REQUIREMENTS 
Our stock ownership and retention guidelines are the most stringent in our peer group. Stock ownership guidelines strongly align the interests of management with the interests of shareholders because executives become shareholders with a considerable investment in General Dynamics. 
Our stock ownership and retention guidelines preclude NEOs from selling shares of General Dynamics common stock until they own shares with a market value of 10 times their base salary and 15 times for the chief executive officer. Shares held outright and shares held through our 401(k) plans are counted for purposes of meeting the ownership guidelines. Stock options (whether vested or not), PSUs and unvested shares of restricted stock are not counted in the ownership calculation.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
When exercising options, executives who have not met the ownership guideline may sell shares acquired upon exercise to cover transaction costs and taxes and are expected to hold any remaining shares until the guidelines are met. Similarly, shares received upon vesting of restricted stock and PSUs may not be sold until the ownership guidelines are met. Once an officer attains the required ownership level, the officer must maintain that ownership level until he or she no longer serves as an officer. The stock ownership and retention guidelines are reviewed annually by the Committee. 
CLAWBACK POLICY 
The company has in place an executive compensation recoupment policy, or "clawback" policy, which applies to senior executive officers of the company (referred to as the covered executive officers), including the NEOs. In the event of a restatement of our financial results due to a covered executive officer engaging in fraud or intentional illegal conduct, the result of which is that any equity or other performance-based compensation paid to that covered executive officer would have been a lower amount had it been calculated based on the restated results, the Committee will have the authority to recover any excess compensation that was awarded to that covered executive officer. In determining the excess compensation, the Committee will take into account its good faith estimate of the value of awarded and actual compensation that may have been affected by the restatement and the events leading to it. This includes all performance-based cash incentives and equity-based grants which may have vested or been exercised during the period in question. 
COMPENSATION AND RISK MANAGEMENT
With the support of management and the independent compensation consultant, the Committee evaluates the company's overall risk profile relative to the incentive components of compensation to ensure that NEOs are not overly incentivized to focus on short-term stock performance. The use of long-term equity incentive awards as a significant portion of total direct compensation and robust stock ownership guidelines are structured to ensure management is focused on the long term and not incentivized to take excessive risk. 
TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally precludes the company from taking a tax deduction for certain executive officers' compensation in excess of $1 million. Prior to 2018, Section 162(m) exempted "performance-based compensation" from the $1 million limitation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 repealed this exemption effective for our 2018 year, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible for 2018 or future years, unless the compensation qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain compensation arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. For our arrangements to which transition relief applies, the Committee will continue to consider the implications of Section 162(m) when taking any actions concerning outstanding performance-based or other compensation.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
SUMMARY COMPENSATION 
The Summary Compensation Table conforms to requirements of the SEC and shows base salary, annual incentive, equity awards (restricted stock, performance stock units and stock options) and all other compensation, which includes among other things the value of perquisites, 401(k) contributions and tax reimbursements (see footnote (d) to the Summary Compensation Table for a complete listing of categories included in All Other Compensation). The table also includes a column titled Change in Pension Value and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings. For our eligible NEOs, this includes only the change in pension value (see footnote (c)), which is an actuarial estimate of the present value of the future cost of pension benefits. The value does not reflect a current cash cost to General Dynamics or, necessarily, the pension benefit that an executive would receive, since that is determined by a number of factors, including length of service, age at retirement and longevity.

2018 EQUITY-BASED AWARDS 
General Dynamics' long-term compensation for senior executives, including the NEOs, consists of equity awards in the form of restricted stock, PSUs and stock options. The following table provides information on the equity awards in 2018 for the NEOs. The table includes the grant date of each equity award, the number of shares of restricted stock, PSUs and stock options, the exercise price of the stock options, the closing price of our Common Stock on the date of grant and the grant date fair value of the equity awards. As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, we use the average of the high and low stock price of our Common Stock on the date of the grant, not the closing price, to value the restricted stock and PSUs and set the exercise price for stock options.

OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED 
The following table shows the stock options exercised by the NEOs and restricted stock released to them during 2018. As explained in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, we require officers to retain shares of Common Stock issued to them as compensation, up to pre-determined levels, based on their position with General Dynamics. Once an ownership level is attained, the officer must maintain that minimum ownership level until he or she no longer serves as an officer of General Dynamics. The amounts reported in the Value Realized on Exercise and the Value Realized on Vesting columns in the table below are before-tax amounts.

Salaried Retirement Plan. The General Dynamics Salaried Retirement Plan is a tax-qualified defined-benefit pension plan that provides benefits as a life annuity to retired participants. A participant's benefit under the Salaried Retirement Plan increases with each year of service. Participants who leave before they are eligible for early retirement are paid a substantially reduced amount. All the NEOs, other than Mr. Johnson, participate in the Salaried Retirement Plan. 
Earnings used to calculate pension benefits (pensionable earnings) include only a participant's base salary and cash bonus and exclude all other items of income, including equity awards. Under the Internal Revenue Code, the Salaried Retirement Plan does not take into account any earnings over a predetermined compensation limit, which was $275,000 for 2018, and does not pay annual benefits beyond a predetermined benefit limit, which was $220,000 for 2018. 
Beginning January 1, 2014, pension accruals stopped for employees at our corporate headquarters, including the participating NEOs. The Salaried Retirement Plan pays a monthly benefit equal to the product of (1) the benefit percentage times (2) the final average monthly pay times (3) the years of credited service. For credited service earned prior to January 1, 2007, the benefit percentage equals 1.333 percent. For credited service earned on or after January 1, 2007, the benefit percentage equals 1.0 percent. Final average monthly pay is equal to the average of the participant's highest 60 consecutive months of pensionable earnings out of the participant's last 120 months of employment. For credited service earned prior to January 1, 2007, the final average monthly pay used in the benefit calculation froze as of December 31, 2010. The normal retirement age under the Salaried Retirement Plan is age 65. The Salaried Retirement Plan benefit is calculated as a single-life monthly annuity beginning at age 65 and has multiple

Executive Compensation actuarially equivalent payment forms from which participants can choose to take their benefit. A cash lump sum is only available if a participant's accrued benefit is less than $5,000. None of the eligible NEOs had reached the normal retirement age as of December 31, 2018. 
A participant with at least 10 years of service qualifies for early retirement at age 55. Ms. Novakovic and Messrs. Casey and Roualet qualified for early retirement as of December 31, 2018. A participant who is eligible for early retirement is entitled to receive the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  for benefits based on credited service earned prior to January 1, 2007, if a participant retires between age 55  and 62, his or her age 65 benefit is reduced by 2.5 percent for each full year that he or she retires prior to age 62. If the participant retires between age 62 and 65, he or she will receive 100 percent of his or her age 65 benefit.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  for benefits based on credited service earned on or after January 1, 2007, a participant who is eligible for  early retirement and subsequently retires between age 55 and 65 will have his or her age 65 benefit reduced by 4.8 percent for each full year that he or she retires prior to age 65.  
[END TABLE]
Supplemental Retirement Plan. The General Dynamics Corporation Supplemental Retirement Plan is a nonqualified defined-benefit plan that provides retirement benefits to eligible employees whose salaries exceed the Internal Revenue Code compensation limit or whose annual benefits would exceed the Internal Revenue Code benefit limit. All the NEOs other than Mr. Johnson participate in the Supplemental Retirement Plan. 
Beginning January 1, 2014, Supplemental Retirement Plan pension accruals stopped for employees at our corporate headquarters, including the NEOs who participate in the plan. The Supplemental Retirement Plan provides benefits equal to the difference between (1) the amount that would have been provided under the Salaried Retirement Plan if the annual compensation limit and annual benefit limit did not apply, and (2) the benefit actually paid under the Salaried Retirement Plan. A participant's pensionable earnings and forms of payment are the same under the Supplemental Retirement Plan as the Salaried Retirement Plan. 
NONQUALIFIED DEFINED-CONTRIBUTION DEFERRED COMPENSATION 
As part of General Dynamics' overall retirement program, the NEOs and other key employees are eligible to participate in a nonqualified defined-contribution plan. The following table illustrates the amounts due each executive as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the table shows contributions made by both the NEOs and General Dynamics in 2018 along with the earnings on each executive's total account.

General Dynamics Corporation Supplemental Savings Plan.  The Supplemental Savings Plan is a nonqualified defined-contribution plan that provides key employees, including the NEOs, the opportunity to defer a portion of their salary without 
52     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
Executive Compensation regard to the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on the 401(k) Plan and receive employer matching contributions on a portion of the contributions. 
Effective January 1, 2014, for those who elect to participate in the Supplemental Savings Plan, a participant may contribute between 1 percent and 10 percent of the participant's base salary to the plan. The company will match the participant's contributions for the first 2 percent of the participant's base salary on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Investment performance mirrors the performance of the funds that are available to participants under the 401(k) Plan. 
Supplemental Savings Plan participants, including the NEOs, do not receive any earnings on their Supplemental Savings Plan accounts that are not otherwise paid to all other 401(k) Plan participants with a balance in the same investment fund. Participants receive lump-sum payments six months after their separation from service for balances (including earnings) accumulated on or after January 1, 2005. For balances accumulated prior to January 1, 2005, payment is made as soon as possible after termination and participants will receive a lump-sum payment unless they have previously elected to receive a deferred lump-sum payment or annual installment payments. 
Anteon International Corporation Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan.  Mr. Johnson has an account balance under the frozen Anteon International Corporation Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan. Under the plan, certain eligible employees of Anteon could defer receipt of all or a portion of their annual cash compensation prior to the plan being frozen in 2007. Upon his retirement, Mr. Johnson elected to receive the deferred compensation in a lump sum. 
POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
The following are estimated payments and benefits that would be provided to the NEOs in the event of termination of the executive's employment assuming a termination date of December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2018, Mr. Johnson retired from the company. The payments and benefits provided to Mr. Johnson in connection with his retirement reflect standard benefits discussed on pages 42 and 43. 
We have calculated these amounts for different termination scenarios based on our existing benefit plans and the General Dynamics Corporation equity compensation plan currently in effect (the Equity Compensation Plan). The actual amounts of the payments and costs of the benefits, however, can only be determined at the time of an executive's separation from General Dynamics and, depending on the payment or benefit, may extend over several years. 
For each termination and change in control scenario discussed below, the NEO would also be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  the pension benefits described in the Pension Benefits for Fiscal Year 2018 table, for those NEOs who are eligible to  receive benefits; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  the amounts listed in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018 table.  
[END TABLE]
The estimated totals presented in the table on the next page do not include these pension benefit and nonqualified deferred compensation amounts, nor do the totals include items that are provided to all employees, such as payment of accrued vacation. 
Change in Control Agreements – Double Trigger.  For a change in control situation, we have change in control agreements (also referred to as severance protection agreements) with key employees, including each of the NEOs. We have estimated the payments and benefits the NEOs could receive under our existing benefit plans, change in control agreements and the equity compensation plans. Our calculations assume the executive was terminated on December 31, 2018, and that this date was within 24 months following a change in control, thereby satisfying the "double-trigger" requirement under the change in control agreements. The actual amounts of the payments and costs of the benefits, however, can only be determined at the time of an executive's separation from General Dynamics and depending on the payment or benefit may extend over several years. As discussed under Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Potential Severance and Change in Control Benefits the change in control agreements contain a "double-trigger" mechanism that is triggered only under certain circumstances. Our severance protection agreements do not provide for excise tax gross-ups. Rather, the agreements provide that, in the event change in control benefits would trigger an excise tax under Section 280G and Section 4999, then the value of the benefits will be either (1) delivered in full or (2) subject to a cutback, whichever provides the executive officer the greatest benefit on an after-tax basis (with the excise tax being the responsibility of the executive to pay).

   grant. PSUs granted would be evaluated for achievement relative to goals and if earned, a pro rata amount (determined as  set forth in the respective award agreements) will vest and be released within two and one-half months following the death vesting date. The unvested stock options vest immediately and the restricted stock  held by the executive would be transferred to the estate and released at the time of death. The value of the unvested options reflected in the table represents the difference between the closing share price of $157.21 on December 31, 2018, and  the option grant price, multiplied by the number of retained unvested options. The value of the restricted stock represents the number of restricted shares held on December 31, 2018, multiplied by the closing share price of $157.21 on  December 31, 2018.  
(e)  The value of the prorated PSUs represents the number of earned units as of December 31, 2018, multiplied by the  closing share price of $157.21 on December 31, 2018.  
(f)  The present value of the restricted stock represents the number of restricted shares held on December 31, 2018,  multiplied by the closing share price of $157.21 on December 31, 2018, and applying a discount rate factor to account for the restriction periods.  
(g)  The present value of the unvested stock options reflected in the table represents the difference between the closing  share price of $157.21 on December 31, 2018, and the option grant price, multiplied by the number of retained unvested options, and applying a discount factor to account for the option exercise dates.  
(h)  Under the terms of the Equity Compensation Plan, most participants qualify for retirement treatment after reaching age  55 with at least five years of continuous service with the company. For participants who are elected officers of the company and who have reached age 55, the plan provides for retirement treatment with the consent of the company's chief  executive officer or, in the case of the chief executive officer, the Compensation Committee. For purposes of this Proxy Statement, we assume that any required consents for retirement treatment have been obtained. Since Ms. Novakovic and  Messrs. Casey and Roualet are eligible to retire, they would forfeit a portion of their unvested stock option awards based on days of service during the three-year period beginning on January 1 of the year of grant for options granted before  2017 and as of the grant date for options granted after 2017. The retained options would be exercisable in accordance with the terms of the original grant. The restricted stock award will pro rata vest at the end of the original restriction period  if retirement occurs prior to one-year from grant. The restricted stock award would be released at the end of the original restriction period if retirement occurs on or after  one-year from grant. The PSUs would be prorated (as set forth in the respective award agreements) and will be released within two and one-half months following their  respective scheduled vesting date, if earned based on the applicable performance goals. Because Mr. Aiken was not eligible to retire at December 31, 2018, the equity values in these scenarios would apply only in the case of disability.   
(i)  Any annual incentive amount paid in a change in control situation would be determined in accordance with the terms of  the applicable change in control agreement. Since we assume that a change in control and triggering event had occurred on December 31, 2018, the change in control scenarios identify the March 2018 bonus amounts.  
(j)  Calculated in accordance with the applicable change in control agreement. For the NEOs, this amount equals 2.99 times  their annual salary and annual incentive.  
(k)  Represents an additional 36 months of life, medical, dental and long-term disability benefits. These costs reflect an  amount equal to three times the 2018 annual employer premiums for these benefits.  
(l)  The costs of Ms. Novakovic's, Messrs. Casey's and Roualet's retiree benefits are reduced in this  scenario because the 36 months of continued active coverage described in Note (k) defers the commencement date of this coverage.  
(m)  Represents the estimated outplacement services costs, obtained from an outplacement vendor, for 12 months for a senior  executive.  
(n)  Represents financial counseling and tax planning services for 36 months following the termination date, at a total cost  not to exceed $30,000 for each NEO.  
(o)  Represents a supplemental retirement benefit payable in cash equal to company contributions to each  defined-contribution plan in which the executive participates.  
(p)  Our Equity Compensation Plan and the applicable award agreements contain a "double-trigger" mechanism for all  participants, including the NEOs. This mechanism provides that if, within two years following a change in control, a participant's employment is terminated by the company for any reason other than for Cause (as defined in the plan) or by the  executive for Good Reason (as defined in the plan), then all outstanding awards that have not vested will immediately vest and become exercisable and all restrictions on awards will immediately lapse.

Executive Compensation 
PAY RATIO RESULTS 
The chief executive officer pay ratio figures below are a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. 
Due to the acquisition of CSRA and divestitures within GDIT in 2018, there has been a change in our employee population that we reasonably believe would result in a significant change in our pay ratio disclosure. Therefore, we have re-identified the median employee for 2018 using the same methodology we employed in 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We determined that as of December 3, 2018 (our Determination Date), our total number of U.S. employees was  approximately 93,000 and our total number of non-U.S. employees was approximately 14,000. We excluded from this employee population a total of 5,251 employees from: Mexico (2,451), Spain (859), Germany (531),  Singapore (305), United Arab Emirates (247), Saudi Arabia (197), Italy (118), Estonia (74), Brazil (72), Colombia (70), Argentina (47), Netherlands (35), Russian Federation (30), France (28), Philippines (28), Bermuda (27), Israel (26), Malaysia  (25), India (20), New Zealand (17), Jamaica (14), Guyana (6), Bahamas (4), Barbados (4), Czech Republic (3), Indonesia (3), Malta (3), Chile (1), Ecuador (1), Ethiopia (1), Peru (1), Portugal (1), Trinidad (1) and Turkey (1) as the total  number of employees from these non-U.S. jurisdictions was less than 5 percent of our total employee population.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To determine our median employee pay, we chose base salary as our consistently applied compensation measure. We then  calculated an annual base salary for each employee, annualizing pay for those employees who commenced work during 2018 and any employees who were on leave for a portion of 2018. For hourly employees, we used a reasonable estimate of hours worked to  determine annual base pay. We used a clustered sampling methodology to identify the median base salary within this employee population.  
[END TABLE]
Total annual compensation for the median employee was valued at $86,432 and total annual compensation for the chief executive officer was valued at $20,720,254, resulting in a ratio of median employee total annual compensation to chief executive officer total annual compensation of 1:240. Total annual compensation for the median employee and the chief executive officer is calculated according to the disclosure requirements of the Summary Compensation Table and includes base salary, annual incentive, equity awards, change in pension values and other compensation such as perquisites and company-paid healthcare benefits.

General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     59 
APPROVAL OF THE 
GENERAL DYNAMICS UNITED KINGDOM SHARE SAVE PLAN 
(PROPOSAL 4) 
We currently have in place a Share Save Plan (the Prior U.K. Plan) approved by our shareholders in May 2009. The Prior U.K. Plan expires in March 2019. As a result, in February 2019, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved, the amended and restated General Dynamics United Kingdom Share Save Plan (the 2019 U.K. Plan) on terms substantially similar to the Prior U.K. Plan and recommended submission of the 2019 U.K. Plan to shareholders for their approval. The purpose of the 2019 U.K. Plan is to continue to provide our employees in the United Kingdom the opportunity to acquire an ownership position in General Dynamics and more closely align their interests with the interests of our shareholders. 
If the shareholders approve the 2019 U.K. Plan, no new options will be granted under the Prior U.K. Plan. Any options previously granted under the Prior U.K. Plan will remain outstanding and will, among other things, continue to be exercisable in accordance with their original terms and conditions. 
The 2019 U.K. Plan is being submitted to shareholders for approval. Your Board of Directors believes it is in the best interests of General Dynamics and its shareholders to approve the 2019 U.K. Plan. 
SUMMARY OF THE PLAN 
The principal features of the 2019 U.K. Plan are summarized below. The summary may not contain all information that is important to you. The complete text of the 2019 U.K. Plan is set forth as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement. 
Plan Administration.  The 2019 U.K. Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. 
Eligibility.  Participation in the 2019 U.K. Plan may be extended to our eligible employees in the United Kingdom. There are approximately 1,450 employees eligible to participate in this plan. Currently, this plan does not benefit any NEO or other executive officer or director of General Dynamics. 
Shares Subject to the Plan.  The 2019 U.K. Plan provides that 450,000 shares of Common Stock will be available for issuance under the plan. 
Benefits.  Under the 2019 U.K. Plan, a participant is invited to invest a designated amount in a savings account each month and receive a corresponding tax-free bonus payment. The bonus payment is set at the outset of a participant's savings contract. The participant may be granted an option to purchase a specified number of shares of Common Stock at an exercise price not less than 80 percent of the fair market value of Common Stock as of the later of the date on which the participant is invited to participate in the 2019 U.K. Plan, or the date on which the participant is notified of the exercise price. In practice, the exercise price has historically been set at 85 percent of the fair market value. We may grant options that can be exercised three or five years after the date of the grant. The participant may exercise his or her options but can only purchase the Common Stock with the proceeds of his or her savings account (including the tax-free bonus). Alternatively, the participant may elect to take the proceeds of his or her savings contract in cash or choose to exercise only part of the option and receive the rest in cash. Benefits under the 2019 U.K. Plan depend on the participant's election to participate and the fair market value of the Common Stock at various future dates. As a result, it is not possible to determine future benefits that will be received by participants. 
Amendment and Termination.  The Compensation Committee may amend the 2019 U.K. Plan. The 2019 U.K. Plan will terminate on the 10th anniversary of the date of adoption, or earlier by resolution of the Compensation Committee. 
Tax Consequences of Awards.  Under U.K. law, no income tax is due upon receipt of an option to purchase Common Stock under the 2019 U.K. Plan. Further, no income tax is due upon the exercise of the option by a participant unless the option is exercised within three years of its date of grant for reasons other than the death, injury, disability, layoff or retirement of the participant. If any 
60     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
UK Share Save Plan income tax liability does arise, it will be based on the fair market value of the shares less the exercise price. If a participant exercises an option to purchase Common Stock and then sells the Common Stock, capital gains tax may be due on the proceeds of the sale. Under U.K. law, however, a certain amount of capital gains are excludable from taxable income each year. The bonus payments are tax-free, but early termination of the savings contract will lead to the savings being either subject to tax or interest or there will be no return on the savings. Under U.K. law, we will be able to deduct the costs of establishing the 2019 U.K. Plan.

General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     61 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL – INDEPENDENT BOARD CHAIRMAN 
(PROPOSAL 5) 
We have been advised by John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 92078, owner of at least 100 shares of Common Stock, that he intends to present the following shareholder proposal at the Annual Meeting. We are not responsible for the accuracy or content of the proposal and supporting statement, presented below, as received from the proponent. Our reasons for opposing the proposal are also presented below. 
PROPOSAL AND SUPPORTING STATEMENT 
Proposal 5 – Independent Board Chairman 
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement. 
If the Board determines that a Chairman, who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above. 
Caterpillar is an example of a company changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had opposed a shareholder proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting. Wells Fargo also changed course and named an independent board chairman. 
It is especially important to have an independent board chairman when our Lead Director lacks independence. James Crown was Lead Director in spite of 31-years long-tenure. Long-tenure can impair the independence of a director no matter how well qualified. Independence is an all-important qualification for a Lead Director. 
Mr. Crown also had an oversized influence since he chaired our nomination committee and was on our executive pay and audit committees. The shareholder approval of General Dynamic's executive pay dropped precipitously from 97% in 2017 to 68% in 2018 – apparently not helped by Mr. Crown's oversight as a member of the executive pay committee. 
Plus we had 2 directors who came from the same military culture that emphasizes following orders. Retired military could be consultants instead of directors. 
Meanwhile there are challenges that face our company that need to be managed well and prevented from reoccurring that could be helped by having an independent chairman to run the Board of Directors and address the above director issues while our CEO focuses on day-to-day challenges like these: 
Complaint over alleged misclassification and underpayment of call center employees – General Dynamics Information Technology Inc. 
July 2018 
Criticisms over alleged role in controversial U.S. family separation policy 
June 2018 
Elimination of change-of-control excise tax gross-up in severance agreement of Phebe Novakovic – Chairman and CEO 
October 2016 
An independent Chairman is best positioned to build up the oversight capabilities of our directors while our CEO addresses the challenging day-to-day issues facing the company. The roles of Chairman of the Board and CEO are fundamentally different and should not be held by the same person. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between these positions to insure a balance of power and authority on the Board. 
Please vote yes: 
Independent Board Chairman – Proposal 5 
62     General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement 
Shareholder Proposal 
STATEMENT BY YOUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AGAINST THE SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL 
Your Board of Directors unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal. The Board believes that our shareholders' interests are best served when we retain the ability to select the appropriate person to serve in the chairman's role and that our current leadership structure is effective in its independent oversight of General Dynamics. Additionally, instead of confining discussion to the actual topic of board leadership structure, the proponent resorts to baseless, irrelevant and impertinent invective that redefines the proposal as a vote on ancillary points and not the core governance topic. This calumny should be rejected with a vote against the proposal.
Our Robust Lead Independent Director Role Provides Meaningful Independent Leadership and Oversight at the Board Level. Among the several shareholder protections in the company's corporate governance structure is a robust and clearly defined independent Lead Director role. Elected annually, the independent Lead Director's authority and responsibilities include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Acts as chair at board meetings when the chairman is not present, including meetings of the non-management directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Has the authority to call meetings of the non-management directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Coordinates activities of the non-management directors and serves as a liaison  between the chairman and the non-management directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Works with the chairman to develop and agree to meeting schedules and agendas, and agree to the nature of the  information that will be provided to directors in advance of meetings; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Is available for consultation and communication with significant shareholders, when appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
Our current independent Lead Director, James Crown, performs each of the substantive responsibilities outlined above as well as the following additional duties: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meets regularly with our chief executive officer to delve deeply into matters of interest to the Board, to provide  feedback on past Board meetings and to seek specific information for future Board meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consults regularly with Board members, particularly the non-management  directors, to ensure strong communication among each Board member; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Leads, as chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board's annual self-evaluation  process.  
[END TABLE]
Our Current Approach Allows the Board to Select the Most Appropriate Leadership Structure and Leaders for General Dynamics. The current policy on election of the Board's chairman, consistent with the company's Bylaws, is simple – the Board elects the best person to lead the Board in its mission to represent the interests of shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• While our current chairman is also the chief executive officer, that arrangement is simply a reflection of the  Board's view that Phebe Novakovic is the right person for those roles currently, and that the company and its shareholders would not be well served by splitting the roles at this time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• General Dynamics' Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Board will adopt a leadership structure that  best serves the company's needs at any particular time, and that such arrangement could involve either the separate or combined roles of chairman and chief executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accordingly, as part of the selection process each year the Board considers whether the roles should be separated and  whether the company and its shareholders are best served by the individual(s) serving the role(s).  
[END TABLE]
Our Strong Corporate Governance Practices Ensure Management Accountability and Provide Effective Independent Oversight of General Dynamics. In addition to the strong role and significant responsibilities of our independent Lead Director, the Board has in place many other mechanisms to ensure management accountability and a balanced governance structure: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board's four standing committees are each chaired by independent directors and are 100% independent.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board's non-management directors meet in executive session without  management present at every Board meeting.  
[END TABLE]
General Dynamics 2019 Proxy Statement     63 
Shareholder Proposal 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All directors, except the current chief executive officer, meet the independence requirements of the New York Stock  Exchange Listing Standards and the company's Corporate Governance Guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full Board and each committee have authority to retain their own independent outside legal, financial or other  advisors, as the members deem necessary.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The full Board participates in performance management and assessment of both senior management and itself.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our shareholders enjoy strong shareholder rights, including the right to request a special meeting of shareholders and  proxy access (the ability to nominate director candidates, and have those nominees included in our proxy statement).  
[END TABLE]
The Corporate Governance Concerns Raised by the Proponent are Unfounded and Do Not Accurately Reflect the Company's Leadership and Governance Practices. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• First, the proponent asserts that our independent Lead Director "lacks independence" because of his  substantial tenure on the Board. Mr. Crown is independent under all applicable independence standards and has continuously received very strong support from shareholders in his annual election to the Board. Additionally, Mr. Crown's  tenure and experience enable him to bring valuable and independent views to the boardroom, where he provides thoughtful leadership for both fellow directors and senior management.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Second, for the second year in a row the proponent suggests that he takes objection to anyone with a military background  serving as a director. Directors with prior military service provide our Board with an unparalleled understanding of the requirements and priorities of several of the company's key customers. With the U.S. Government representing on average  60 percent of our revenues over the past several years, intimacy with our customer's priorities and demands is critical. Our directors with prior military service play an irreplaceable role in advising our businesses on how to ensure that  our products and services remain effective and responsive to our customers in supporting national security and defense programs. Furthermore, these directors are actively engaged in the Board's deliberations and each exercises his own  independent judgment in fulfilling fiduciary duties and maximizing shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additionally, the proponent invokes three entirely irrelevant topics labeled as company challenges. A proposal  concerning Board leadership structure should not be an avenue for debating unrelated issues. There is no demonstrable or intuitive link between the items listed by the proponent and the Board's leadership structure. Two of the items invoked by  the proponent, without a full discussion of the issues concerned, are misleading and, in the case of the call center business, relates to a business that is no longer owned by the company. The third item, regarding the company's elimination of  excise tax gross-up payments, is unquestionably favorable to shareholders and cannot logically be criticized as evidencing a problem with the Board's governance.  
[END TABLE]
Conclusion: Our Current Structure of a Combined Chief Executive Officer and Chairman with a Strong Lead Independent Director Enhance Your Board's Ability to Govern the Company in Shareholders' Best Interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your Board believes that the decision of who should serve in the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, and  whether these roles should be combined, is the responsibility of the Board. This decision is not appropriately addressed with a  "one-size-fits-all" approach that assumes a single leadership structure works at all times.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your Board regularly evaluates the corporate governance structures in place at our company, including the roles of  chairman and chief executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• While the Board has in the past and may again in the future determine that the interests of the company would be best  served by separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, the Board believes that, on balance, a combined role works best at this time.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Your Board will continue to evaluate these structures to determine the appropriate board leadership structure for the  company. This model best serves our dynamic and successful company.

INFORMATION REGARDINGTHE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
All shareholders of record at the close of business on March 7, 2019, are entitled to vote their shares of Common Stock at the Annual Meeting. On the record date, General Dynamics had 288,769,918 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 
Following are questions and answers about the annual meeting and voting. 
ANNUAL MEETING ATTENDANCE 
Will I need to provide documentation to attend the Annual Meeting? Yes. All shareholders will need an admission ticket and personal photo identification for admission. You may print your own admission ticket and you must bring it to the meeting. Tickets can be printed by accessing Shareholder Meeting Registration at www.ProxyVote.com and following the instructions provided. If you are unable to print your tickets, please call Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (Broadridge) at 844-318-0137 toll-free or 925-331-6070 international toll for assistance. 
How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? A quorum of shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting. A quorum is the presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date. If you submit a properly completed proxy in accordance with one of the voting procedures described below or appear at the Annual Meeting to vote in person, your shares of Common Stock will be considered present. For purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, abstentions and broker non-votes (as described below) will be counted as present. Once a quorum is present, voting on specific proposals may proceed. In the absence of a quorum, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned. 
How are proxy materials being distributed for the Annual Meeting? As permitted by the rules of the SEC, we are providing the proxy materials for our 2019 Annual Meeting via the Internet to most of our shareholders. Use of the Internet will expedite receipt of the 2019 proxy materials by many of our shareholders and help to keep mailing costs for our Annual Meeting as low as possible. For shareholders who are participants in our 401(k) plans we are required generally to deliver proxy materials in hard copy. On March 21, we initiated delivery of proxy materials to our shareholders of record in one of two ways: (1) a notice containing instructions on how to access proxy materials via the Internet or (2) a printed copy of those materials. If you received a notice in lieu of a printed copy of the proxy materials, you will not automatically receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the notice provides instructions on how to access the proxy materials on the Internet and how to vote online or by telephone. If you received such a notice and would also like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, the notice includes instructions on how you may request a printed copy. 
VOTING 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? You must be a shareholder of record on the record date, which is March 7, 2019, to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting. 
How do I vote my shares? How you vote your shares will depend on whether you are a shareholder of record or a beneficial owner of your shares. 
Shareholders of record. Each shareholder of record is entitled to one vote on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting for each share of Common Stock held. You are considered a shareholder of record if your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A., as of the record date. If you are a shareholder of record, Broadridge provides proxy materials to you on our behalf. If your shares are registered in different names or held in more than one account, you may receive more than one proxy card or set of voting instructions. In that case, you will need to vote separately for each set of shares in accordance with the following voting procedures. 
Shareholders of record may cast their vote in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   By Internet:     access www.ProxyVote.com and follow the instructions    
   By Telephone:     call  1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions    
   By Mail:     sign and date each proxy card received and return each card using the prepaid postage envelope    
   In Person:     attend the Annual Meeting and vote by ballot

Annual Meeting Information 
The telephone and Internet voting systems are available 24 hours a day. They will close at 11:59 p.m. eastern time on April 30, 2019. Please note the voting deadline differs for participants in our 401(k) plans, as described below. All shares represented by properly executed, completed and unrevoked proxies that are received on time will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the specifications made in the proxy card. 
Beneficial Owners. If your shares are held by a bank, broker or other holder of record (sometimes referred to as holding shares in "street name"), the bank, broker or other holder is the shareholder of record and you are the beneficial owner of those shares. Your bank, broker or other holder of record will forward the proxy materials to you. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct the voting of your shares by following the voting instructions provided with these proxy materials. Please refer to the proxy materials forwarded by your bank, broker or other holder of record to see which voting options are available to you. 
401(k) Plan Participants. Fidelity Management Trust Company (Fidelity), as trustee, is the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock held in our 401(k) plans – the General Dynamics Corporation 401(k) Plan and the General Dynamics Corporation 401(k) Plan for Represented Employees. If you are a participant in one of these plans and in the fund that invests in shares of Common Stock, you are the beneficial owner of the shares of Common Stock credited to your plan account. As beneficial owner and named fiduciary, you have the right to instruct Fidelity, as plan trustee, how to vote your shares. If you do not provide Fidelity with timely voting instructions then, consistent with the terms of the plans, Newport Trust Company (Newport), will direct Fidelity, in Newport's discretion, how to vote the shares. Newport serves as the independent fiduciary and investment manager for the General Dynamics Stock Fund of the 401(k) plans. 
Broadridge provides proxy materials to participants in these plans on behalf of Fidelity. If you are a plan participant and also a shareholder of record, Broadridge may combine the shares registered directly in your name and the shares credited to your 401(k) plan account onto one proxy card. If Broadridge does not combine your shares, you will receive more than one set of proxy materials. In that case, you will need to submit a vote for each set of shares. The vote you submit via proxy card or the telephone or Internet voting systems will serve as your voting instructions to Fidelity. To allow sufficient time for Fidelity to vote your 401(k) plan shares, your vote, or any re-vote, must be received by 9:00 a.m. eastern time on April 29, 2019. 
Can I change or revoke my proxy vote? A shareholder of record may change or revoke a proxy at any time before it is voted at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Sending written notice of revocation to our Corporate Secretary 
    Submitting another proxy card that is dated later than the original proxy card 
    Re-voting by using the telephone or Internet voting systems, or 
     Attending the Annual Meeting and voting by ballot (attendance at the Annual Meeting  alone will not act to revoke a prior proxy). 
[END TABLE]
Our Corporate Secretary must receive notice of revocation, or a subsequent proxy card, before the vote at the Annual Meeting for a revocation to be valid. Except as described above for participants in our 401(k) plans, a re-vote by the telephone or Internet voting systems must occur before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on April 30, 2019. If you are a beneficial owner, you must revoke your proxy through the appropriate bank, broker or other holder of record.

Annual Meeting Information 
VOTE REQUIRED
What is a broker non-vote? A broker non-vote occurs when a bank, broker or other holder of record holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because that holder does not have discretionary voting power for the proposal and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Banks, brokers and other holders of record have discretionary authority to vote shares without instructions from beneficial owners only on matters considered "routine" by the New York Stock Exchange, such as the advisory vote on the selection of the independent auditors. On non-routine matters, such as the election of directors, executive compensation matters, approval of an equity compensation plan and the shareholder proposal, these banks, brokers and other holders of record do not have discretion to vote uninstructed shares and thus are not "entitled to vote" on such proposals, resulting in a broker non-vote for those shares. We encourage all shareholders that hold shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record to provide voting instructions to those holders to ensure that their shares are voted at the Annual Meeting. 
What is the vote required for each proposal, and what is the effect of an abstention or broker non-vote on the voting?

APPENDIX A 
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) 
This Proxy Statement contains non-GAAP financial measures, as defined by Regulation G of the SEC. 
We emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns. As described below, we use free cash flow from operations and ROIC to measure our performance in these areas. While we believe these metrics provide useful information, they are not defined operating measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and there are limitations associated with their use. Our calculation of these metrics may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these metrics should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, other GAAP measures. 
Free Cash Flow. We define free cash flow from operations as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, repurchasing our Common Stock and paying dividends. We use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management. The following table reconciles the free cash flow from operations with net cash provided by operating activities: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year Ended December 31      2018        2017        2016   
 Net cash provided by operating activities    $ 3,148      $ 3,876      $ 2,163   
 Capital expenditures      (690)       (428)       (392)  
 Free cash flow from operations    $ 2,458      $ 3,448      $ 1,771   
[END TABLE]
Return on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a useful measure for investors because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations. We use ROIC to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management. We define ROIC as net operating profit after taxes divided by average invested capital. Net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after-tax interest and amortization expense, calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate. Average invested capital is defined as the sum of the average debt and shareholders' equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive loss. ROIC excludes goodwill impairments and non-economic accounting changes as they are not reflective of company performance. ROIC is calculated as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Year Ended December 31      2018        2017        2016   
 Earnings from continuing operations    $ 3,358      $  2,912      $  2,679   
 After-tax interest expense      295        76        64   
 After-tax amortization expense      213        51        57   
 Net operating profit after taxes    $ 3,866      $  3,039      $  2,800   
 Average invested capital    $ 25,367      $ 18,099      $ 17,168   
 Return on invested capital      15.2%       16.8%       16.3%  
[END TABLE]
In evaluating the company's ROIC performance for the 2016 – 2018 period, the Compensation Committee excluded the effects of the early 2018 CSRA acquisition since the acquisition was not contemplated at the time the target ROIC was set in 2016. Additionally, the calculation of 2016 ROIC for purposes of the PSU performance evaluation reflects ROIC as reported in the company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, as filed with the SEC on February 6, 2017, which did not include the effects of the company's adoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Accordingly, the following table shows the calculation of ROIC as used by the Compensation Committee in determining the appropriate ROIC performance over the three-year 2016 – 2018 period.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.2  If after applying the provisions of Rule 3.1(i) to (iii) inclusive the value of Common Stock available is still  insufficient to enable an Option based on monthly savings contributions of £5 to be granted to each Eligible Employee who made a valid Application the Committee may, as an alternative to selecting by lot as in (iv) above, determine in its  absolute discretion that no Options shall be granted.  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.1  Within 30 days of the first day by reference to which the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is determined (or  within 42 days of that day when Rule 3 applies and Options cannot be granted within the 30 day period), the Committee shall grant to each applicant who is still an Eligible Employee an Option over such number of shares of Common Stock as can be  purchased on the date of exercise of that Option with the repayment under the relevant Savings Contract.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.2  If the Company is prevented by statute, order, regulation or government directive from granting Options within any  such periods, then the Committee may grant Options within twenty one days of the lifting of such restrictions providing the grant takes place not more than 30 days following the date on which Fair Market Value was determined for the purposes of the  Option grant in question or not later than 42 days following the date Fair Market Value was determined if Applications have been scaled down pursuant to Rule 3.1.

[BEGIN TABLE]
4.4  No Option may be transferred, assigned or charged and any purported transfer, assignment or charge shall be void ab  initio. Each Option Certificate shall carry a statement to this effect.

  (i)  a general offer to acquire the whole of the issued share capital of the Company (other than that which is already  owned by him) which is unconditional or which is made on a condition such that if it is satisfied the person making the offer will have Control of the Company; or

[BEGIN TABLE]
7.2  If under Section 900 of the Companies Act 2006 it is proposed that the Court sanctions a compromise or  arrangement applicable to or affecting (i) all of the ordinary share capital of the Company or all of the shares in the Company which are of the same class as Common Stock which may be acquired by exercise of Options, or (ii) all the  shares, or all the shares of the same class which are held by a class of shareholders identified otherwise than by reference to their employment or directorships or their participation in a Schedule 3 SAYE Option Scheme, then the Company shall give  notice thereof to all Participants at the same time as it sends notices to members of the Company calling the meeting to consider such a compromise or arrangement. Any Subsisting Option may be exercised by a Participant subject to the terms of this  Rule before the expiry of six months from the date on which the Court sanctions such compromise or arrangement. Subject to Rule 7.6, at the end of the relevant period an unexercised Option shall lapse. If any person obtains Control of the Company as  a result of a Non-UK Company Reorganisation Arrangement which becomes binding on the shareholders covered by it any Subsisting Options may be exercised before the expiry of six months from the date on which  such Non-UK Company Reorganisation Arrangement becomes binding. For the purposes of this Rule 7.2, the reference to the ordinary share capital of the Company does not include any capital already held by the  person making the offer or a person connected with that person, and the reference to the shares does not include any shares already held by the person making the offer or a person connected with that person.

A New Option issued in  consideration of the release of an Option shall be evidenced by an Option Certificate which shall import the relevant provisions of these Rules. A New Option shall, for all other purposes of this Plan, be treated as having been acquired at the same  time as the corresponding released Option. An exchange of Options pursuant to this Rule 7.4 shall not alter the fact that this Plan remains that of the Company as the original scheme organiser.

7.5  If a resolution is passed at a general meeting for the voluntary winding-up of  the Company, an Option shall notwithstanding Rule 6.1(i) be exercisable in whole or in part for a period of six months after which the Option shall to the extent unexercised thereupon lapse.

Where prior to the date an Option lapses there occurs one or more further events specified in Rules 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 or 7.5 an Option shall lapse on the earlier of the date determined by the preceding part of this Rule 7.6 and the date of lapse  relevant to the further event or events.
