TSR is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company and assuming the dividends and share distributions received from any spins are reinvested in the applicable company at the time they are paid. 
In 2018, we continued to stay the course and executed on our commitments to shareowners. We made substantial progress in advancing our strategic initiatives, transformed the Honeywell portfolio through two spins, gave back to the community, and upgraded the working experience for our employees. While our work in the community, for our customers, for our employees, and for our shareowners is not over, we are proud of the outstanding achievements we accomplished throughout the year.

No Excessive Perks. We do not  provide perquisites except in cases where there is a compelling business or security reason, nor do we provide gross-ups, except in limited cases for relocation.

PROPOSAL 1: 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth a clear vision statement for the composition of Honeywell's Board: 
"The composition of Honeywell's Board, as well as the perspective and skills of its individual members, needs to effectively support Honeywell's growth and commercial strategy. Collectively, the Board must also be capable of overseeing risk management, capital allocation, and leadership succession. Board composition and the members' perspective and skills should evolve at an appropriate pace to meet the challenges of Honeywell's changing commercial and strategic goals." 
Consistent with this vision, the Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee (CGRC) has responsibility for identifying a slate of director nominees who collectively have the complementary experience, qualifications, skills, and attributes to guide the Company and function effectively as a Board. 
The CGRC believes that each of the nominees presented in this proxy has key personal attributes that are important to an effective board: integrity, candor, analytical skills, willingness to engage management and each other in a constructive and collaborative fashion, and ability and commitment to devote significant time and energy to service on the Board and its committees. The CGRC also considered the following specific experiences, qualifications, and skills, which Honeywell believes are critical in light of our strategic priorities, and business objectives, operations, and structure. 
DIRECTOR SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS 
I  STRATEGIC SKILLS 
Global Experience. Growing revenue outside of the United States, particularly in what we call "high growth regions" or "HGRs" such as China, India, Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is a central part of our long-term strategy for growth. Hence, exposure to markets and economies outside of the United States is an important qualification for our Board. This exposure can take many forms including government affairs, regulatory, managerial, or commercial. 
Regulated Industries/Government Experience. Honeywell is subject to a broad array of government regulations, and demand for its products and services can be impacted by changes in law or regulation in areas such as aviation safety, security, and energy efficiency. Several of our directors have experience in regulated industries, providing them with insight and perspective in working constructively and proactively with governments and agencies globally. 
Innovation and Technology. With Honeywell's transformation to a software-industrial company in the digital age, expertise in combining software programming capabilities with leading-edge physical products and domain knowledge is critical to opening and securing new growth paths for all of Honeywell's businesses. 
Marketing. Developing new markets for our products and services is critical for driving growth. Our directors who have that expertise provide a much desired perspective on how to better market and brand our products and services. 
Industries, End Markets, and Growth Areas. Experience in industries, end markets, and growth areas that Honeywell serves – Commercial Aerospace, Industrial Productivity, Non-Residential, Oil and Gas / Petrochemical, Defense and Space, and Specialty Chemicals – enables a better understanding of the issues facing our businesses. 
I  CORE COMPETENCIES 
Senior Leadership Experience. Experience serving as CEO or a senior executive as well as hands-on leadership experience in core management areas, such as strategic and operational planning, financial reporting, compliance, risk management, and leadership development, provide a practical understanding of complex organizations like Honeywell. 
Public Company Board Experience. Service on the boards and board committees of other public companies provides an understanding of corporate governance practices and trends and insights into board management, relations between the board, the CEO and senior management, agenda setting, and succession planning. 
Risk Management. In light of the Board's role in risk oversight and our robust Enterprise Risk Management program, we seek directors who can help identify, manage, and mitigate key risks, including cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, competition, financial, brand integrity, human capital, and intellectual property. 
Financial Expertise. We believe that an understanding of finance and financial reporting processes is important for our directors to enable them to monitor and assess the Company's operating and strategic performance and to ensure accurate financial reporting and robust controls. We seek directors with background and experience in capital markets, corporate finance, accounting, and financial reporting as well as directors with "accounting or related financial management expertise" as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.

BOARD SKILLSET MATRIX 
In 2018, we adopted a Board skills and experience matrix to facilitate the comparison of our directors' skills versus those skills deemed necessary to oversee our current strategy. We continue to refresh the matrix, and the skills included in the matrix are evaluated against our articulated strategy so that it can serve as an effective tool for identifying director nominees who collectively have the complementary experience, qualifications, skills, and attributes to guide our Company. Our 2019 Board skillset matrix is set forth below.

COMMITMENT TO BOARD INTEGRITY, 
DIVERSITY, AND INDEPENDENCE 
In addition to ensuring that our director nominees possess the requisite skills and qualifications, the CGRC places an emphasis on ensuring that the nominees demonstrate the right leadership traits, personality, work ethic, independence, and diversity of background to align with our performance culture and our long-term strategic vision. Specifically, these criteria include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Exemplification of the highest standards of personal and professional integrity  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Potential contribution to the diversity and culture of the Board, including by virtue of age, educational background, global  perspective, gender, ethnicity, and nationality  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Independence from management under applicable securities law, listing regulations, and Honeywell's Corporate Governance  Guidelines  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Willingness to constructively challenge management through active participation in Board and committee meetings   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ability to devote sufficient time to performing their Board and committee duties  
[END TABLE]
While Honeywell's Corporate Governance Guidelines do not prescribe a diversity policy or standards, as a matter of practice, we are committed to enhancing both the diversity of the Board itself and the perspectives and values that are discussed in Board and committee meetings. Our current Board composition reflects this approach and the Board's commitment to diversity. 
The CGRC also believes that, in addition to diversity of personal characteristics, and experiences, diversity of service tenures on the Honeywell Board also facilitates effective Board oversight. Directors with many years of service to Honeywell provide the Board with a deep knowledge of our Company, while newer directors lend fresh perspectives. Hence, careful consideration is made to achieve the appropriate balance. 
NOMINATION AND ELECTION PROCESS 
Honeywell's directors are elected at each Annual Meeting of Shareowners and hold office for one-year terms or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. Honeywell's By-laws provide that in any uncontested election of directors (an election in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), any nominee who receives a greater number of votes cast "FOR" his or her election than votes cast "AGAINST" his or her election will be elected to the Board of Directors. 
The Board has nominated 12 candidates for election as directors. If any nominee should become unavailable to serve prior to the Annual Meeting, the shares represented by a properly signed and returned proxy card or voted by telephone, via the Internet or by scanning the QR code will be voted for the election of such other person as may be designated by the Board. The Board may also determine to leave the vacancy temporarily unfilled or reduce the authorized number of directors in accordance with the By-laws.

    THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE  DIRECTOR NOMINEES.

SHAREOWNER OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT 
Understanding the issues that are important to our shareowners is critical in ensuring that we address their interests in a meaningful and effective manner. It is also foundational to good corporate governance. In that light, we engage with our shareowners on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss a range of topics, including our performance, strategy, risk management, executive compensation, and corporate governance. We recognize the value of taking our shareowners' views into account. Dialogue and engagement with our shareowners help set goals and expectations for our performance, and facilitate identification of emerging issues that may affect our strategies, corporate governance, compensation practices, and other aspects of our operations. 
Our shareowner and investor outreach and engagement take many forms. We participate in numerous investor conferences and analyst meetings, hold our own investor events, some of which focus on individual businesses held at our facilities, and meet one-on-one with our shareowners in a variety of contexts and forums. As part of our governance-focused shareowner engagement program, members of our Board, including our Lead Director, participate in many of these meetings to discuss a range of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters, including executive compensation, corporate governance, and sustainability. In addition, our Chairman and CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Investor Relations, and other senior management engage with our shareowners on a frequent basis, year-round, to discuss Honeywell's strategy and our financial and business performance and to provide updates on key developments. 
Shareowner engagement during 2018 was robust given the implementation of significant portfolio actions that were announced in 2017 and our CFO transition. We held 24 one-on-one meetings with shareowners during the course of 2018 (representing approximately 29% of outstanding shares) to discuss a wide range of business performance, governance, sustainability and compensation topics. In addition, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other executive officers hosted 56 one-on-one or small group shareowner meetings to discuss business performance and seek feedback. 
I  GOVERNANCE-FOCUSED SHAREOWNER ENGAGEMENT PROGRAM 
SPRING Our Annual Report and Proxy Statement are distributed to our shareowners. We then extend invitations to our largest shareowners to discuss matters to be voted on at our upcoming Annual Meeting. SUMMER Management reports to the Board of Directors on the just-ended proxy season, including a discussion on the voting results and shareowner feedback. This discussion sets the agenda for our Summer/Fall shareowner engagement. ANNUAL SHAREOWNER ENGAGEMENT WINTER The Board implements governance changes, if appropriate, based on its independent judgment and the Summer/Fall shareowner feedback. SUMMER/FALL Management determines topics for upcoming shareowner discussions based on its review of new governance trends, regulatory developments, and the results of the recently concluded Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Management begins shareowner engagement with our largest shareowners. 54 shareowners received invitations to participate in one-on-one dialogue focused on ESG matters, representing 50% of our outstanding shares 24 one-on-one meetings with shareowners to discuss ESG matters, representing 29% of our outstanding shares 12 one-on-one shareowner meetings hosted by our independent Lead Director or an executive ofcer to discuss ESG matters, representing 24% of our outstanding shares

• Appreciation for the level of transparency and the speed with which we executed the Garrett and Resideo spins   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
I  CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD 
Our CEO, Darius Adamczyk, became the Chairman of the Board at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareowners following the retirement of our former Chairman, David M. Cote. The decision to appoint Mr. Adamczyk as Chairman and recombine the Chairman and CEO roles followed careful consideration by the Board and extensive engagement with our shareowners. Understanding the importance of this leadership decision to the Company and its shareowners, the Board thoroughly explored the benefits and challenges of this appointment through an open-minded and unbiased decision-making process. 
In reaching its decision to recombine the roles of Chairman and CEO under Mr. Adamczyk, the Board considered a wide range of factors as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The benefits of a unified leadership structure during a period when Honeywell is in the process of a major portfolio  realignment and a strategic shift designed to focus resources and management's attention on high-growth businesses in six attractive industrial end markets where we can deploy our core technological strengths related to software, data  analytics, and the industrial internet of things  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An evaluation of the strength of Mr. Adamczyk's character, the quality of his leadership, and the likelihood that  Mr. Adamczyk's service as both Chairman and CEO would enhance Company performance – the Board continues to believe that an independent Chairman would not enhance Company performance or improve governance effectiveness under  Mr. Adamczyk's leadership  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our longstanding track record of outperformance under a unified leadership structure in which the roles of Chairman and CEO  were combined  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The highly independent nature of our Board where there is only one non-independent director  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Steps taken by Honeywell's Board to strengthen the role of the independent Lead Director and the demonstrated ability  of our Lead Director to effectively lead the Board  
[END TABLE]
The Board carefully weighed the views of its shareowners as part of its deliberations leading up to our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareowners and continued to engage with shareowners on this topic during the summer/fall shareowner engagement meetings thereafter. We heard a range of views during those meetings, with most of our shareowners expressing confidence that the Honeywell Board understands the importance of good corporate governance and has the ability to make the right decision regarding its ongoing leadership structure, specifically the determination of whether and when to separate and combine the roles of Chairman and CEO. 
I  INDEPENDENT LEAD DIRECTOR 
Honeywell's independent Lead Director plays an important role in our governance structure, serving as the de facto leader of the independent directors, the single focal point charged with ensuring that the Board as a whole is providing appropriate independent oversight of management, and an ex officio member of each Board committee on which he or she does not otherwise serve. Over the past several years, the Board has continually taken action to strengthen the role of Lead Director, including amendments to our Corporate Governance Guidelines to formalize the role of the Lead Director in the recruitment and selection of new Board members and in the annual self-evaluation process. 
The roles and responsibilities of the Lead Director are described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which the Board further amended to formalize the equivalency of independent Lead Director and independent Chairman roles and responsibilities. The guidelines now explicitly acknowledge that, in the absence of an independent Chairman, the Lead Director would assume the same roles and responsibilities. These roles and responsibilities include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As and when the Board considers adding new members, work with the CEO, the CGRC and the full Board to help identify and  prioritize the specific skill sets, experience, and knowledge that candidates for election to the Board must possess  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review, and when appropriate, make changes to Board meeting agendas and Board meeting schedules to ensure there is  sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review, and when appropriate, make changes to presentation material and other written information provided to directors for  Board meetings  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Preside at all meetings at which the Chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors, and  apprise the Chairman of the issues considered  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serve as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Be available for consultation and direct communication with the Company's shareowners  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Call meetings of the independent directors when necessary and appropriate

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serve as an ex officio member of each committee on which he does not otherwise serve  
[END TABLE]
The Lead Director is selected biennially by Honeywell's independent directors, taking into account the Lead Director Selection Criteria memorialized in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These criteria include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Qualifies as independent, in accordance with relevant listing standards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ability to commit the time and level of engagement required to fulfill the substantial responsibilities of the role   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Effective communication skills to facilitate discussions among Board members, including between the independent directors  and the Chairman and CEO, and to engage with shareowners and other key stakeholders  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong rapport with other members of the Board  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• High personal integrity and ethical character  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Skills and experience broadly in line with Honeywell's corporate strategy, including, as relevant, leadership  experience within a large, complex organization, international experience, exposure to a variety of markets, and expertise aligned with key growth initiatives  
[END TABLE]
Our current Lead Director, Mr. Jaime Chico Pardo, was re-elected by our independent directors in 2017 to serve a second two-year term which will expire in 2020. In addition to satisfying each of the criteria listed above, Mr. Chico Pardo has worked tirelessly on behalf of Honeywell including assisting Honeywell in its efforts to increase organic sales growth in Mexico and across Latin America, meeting with shareowners, and participating in various external governance and lead director programs to stay current on best practices and investor concerns. Mr. Chico Pardo is extremely well regarded by his fellow Board members for, among other things, his encyclopedic knowledge of Honeywell, listening and communication skills, excellent judgment, and ability to build consensus for informed decision making. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the, "Board intends that, at all times, a substantial majority of its directors will be considered independent under relevant NYSE and SEC guidelines." 
I  AFFIRMATIVE DETERMINATION OF INDEPENDENCE 
To fulfill this intent, the Board regularly reviews the independence of each non-employee director to make an affirmative determination of independence. Specifically, the CGRC conducts an annual review of the independence of the directors and reports its findings to the full Board. This year, based on the report and recommendation of the CGRC, the Board has determined that each of the non-employee nominees standing for election to the Board at the Annual Meeting—Messrs. Angove, Ayer, Burke, Chico Pardo, Davis, Gregg, Hollick, and Paz and Mses. Deily, Lieblein, and Washington—satisfies the independence criteria in the applicable NYSE listing standards and SEC rules (including, where applicable, the enhanced criteria with respect to members of the Audit Committee and the MDCC). Each Board committee member qualifies as a non-employee director within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). 
I  CRITERIA FOR DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
For a director to be considered independent, the Board must determine that the director does not have any material relationships with Honeywell, either directly as a partner, shareowner, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Honeywell, other than as a director and shareowner. Material relationships can include vendor, supplier, consulting, legal, banking, accounting, charitable, and family relationships, among others. The Board considered all relevant facts and circumstances in making its determinations, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No non-employee director or nominee receives any direct compensation from Honeywell other than under the director  compensation program described in this Proxy Statement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No immediate family member (within the meaning of the NYSE listing standards) of any non-employee director or nominee  receives direct compensation from Honeywell other than compensation received for service as a non-executive employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No non-employee director or nominee is affiliated with Honeywell or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No non-employee director or nominee is an employee of Honeywell's independent accountants and no non-employee director  or nominee (or any of their respective immediate family members) is a current partner of Honeywell's independent accountants, or was within the last three years, a partner or employee of Honeywell's independent accountants and personally  worked on Honeywell's audit.

• No non-employee director or nominee is a member, partner, or principal of any law firm, accounting firm, or investment  banking firm that receives any consulting, advisory, or other fees from Honeywell.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No Honeywell executive officer is on the compensation committee of the board of directors of a company that employs any of  our non-employee directors or nominees (or any of their respective immediate family members) as an executive officer.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No non-employee director or nominee (or any of their respective immediate family members) is indebted to Honeywell, nor is  Honeywell indebted to any non-employee director or nominee (or any of their respective immediate family members).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No non-employee director or nominee is an executive officer of a charitable or other tax-exempt organization that received  contributions from Honeywell.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Honeywell has commercial relationships (purchase and/or sale of products and services) with companies at which our directors  serve or have served as officers within the past three years (Mr. Angove—Infor, Ms. Lieblein—General Motors, Mr. Paz—Express Scripts, and Ms. Washington—Gilead Sciences). In each case:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      —  The relevant products and services were provided on terms and conditions determined on an arm's-length basis and  consistent with those provided by or to similarly situated customers and suppliers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      —  The relevant director did not initiate or negotiate the relevant transaction, each of which was in the ordinary course of  business of both companies; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      —  The combined amount of such purchases and sales was less than 0.05% of the consolidated gross revenue of each of Honeywell  and the other company in each of the last three completed fiscal years. This level is significantly below the requirements of the NYSE listing standards for director independence, which uses a 2% of consolidated gross revenue threshold and applies  it to each of purchases and sales rather than the combination of the two.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• While a non-employee director's or nominee's service as an outside director of another company with which  Honeywell does business would generally not be expected to raise independence issues, the Board also considered those relationships and confirmed the absence of any material commercial relationships with any such company. Specifically, those  commercial relationships were in the ordinary course of business for Honeywell and the other companies involved and were on terms and conditions available to similarly situated customers and suppliers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The above information was derived from Honeywell's books and records and responses to questionnaires completed by the  director nominees in connection with the preparation of this Proxy Statement.

The Board uses the ERM program as a key tool for understanding the inherent risks facing Honeywell as well as assessing whether management's processes, procedures, and practices for mitigating those risks are effective. The ERM assessment deployed by management is robust, based on both an enterprise-wide "top down" and "bottom up" view of commercial, strategic, legal, compliance, cyber, and reputational risks and strategies for mitigating those risks. In 2018, the ERM program included interviews with each director, each executive officer, and 57 risk owners across all businesses and functions.

02  |       CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
02  |       CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
Both the Audit Committee and the full Board review the results of the annual ERM assessment. During the reviews, Honeywell's CFO and General Counsel jointly present the results of the ERM assessment in a manner designed to provide full visibility into the risks facing Honeywell and how management is mitigating those risks, thereby enabling the Board to effectively exercise its oversight function. To facilitate continued monitoring and oversight by the Board, key risk areas identified during the ERM process and management's associated mitigation activities become part of Board and/or committee meeting agendas for the following year. 
Every three years, the ERM process includes one-on-one meetings with each Board member to discuss each director's "top down" view of risks facing the enterprise, to solicit the director's recommendations for improving the ERM process, and to ensure that the universe of risks and the metrics for identifying key risks, in terms of likelihood of occurrence and potential financial impact, is both realistic and appropriate. Feedback from the one-on-one interviews with the individual Board members is presented to the full Board and incorporated in our ERM program and risk mitigation efforts. 
I  OVERSIGHT OF STRATEGY 
One of the Board's primary responsibilities is overseeing management's establishment and execution of the Company's strategy and the associated risks. The full Board oversees strategy and strategic risk through robust and constructive engagement with management, taking into consideration our key priorities, global trends impacting our business, regulatory developments, and disruptors in our industries. The Board's oversight of our strategy primarily occurs through deep-dive annual reviews of the long-term strategic plans and annual operating plans of each of our businesses. During these reviews, management provides the Board with its view of the key commercial and strategic risks faced by each business unit, and the Board provides management with robust feedback on whether management has identified the key risks and is taking appropriate actions to mitigate risk. In addition to the review of each business' strategic and annual plans, specific areas of risk and opportunity are tabled for further Board and/or committee discussion as specific risks arise or as requested by management or individual Board members to ensure additional Board engagement on the areas of risk that are most impactful to Honeywell's strategic direction. 
The Board's oversight of strategy was prominent during the portfolio review process that ultimately led to the Garrett and Resideo spins. With the ultimate goal of achieving an outcome that would promote long-term shareowner value, the Board engaged in a rigorous, thorough, and unbiased review of our portfolio, devoting a substantial amount of time and resources to reviewing and pressure testing the financial and strategic analyses prepared by management and external advisors. The Board then monitored management's execution of the spin transactions to ensure world-class execution. 
I  OVERSIGHT OF HUMAN CAPITAL AND CULTURE 
The Board and the MDCC provide oversight over human capital, with particular focus on culture, talent development and assessment as well as succession planning. Honeywell fosters a performance culture where all directors, officers, and employees are expected to uphold our foundational principles of Integrity and Ethics, Supporting Diversity, and Workplace Respect, and build meaningful careers based on our 8 Behaviors: Have a Passion for Winning, Be A Zealot for Growth, Think Big … Then Make It Happen, Act With Urgency, Be Courageous, Go Beyond, Inspire Greatness, and Become Your Best. The strength of our culture is essential to fulfilling our strategic vision, and the Board and the MDCC work with management to monitor compliance with the foundational principles and measure progress against the 8 Behaviors. 
The Board also is closely engaged in the development and management of human capital. The Board's involvement in leadership development and succession planning is systematic and ongoing, and the Board provides input on important decisions in each of these areas. The Board has primary responsibility for succession planning for the CEO and oversight over succession planning for other executive officer positions. The MDCC oversees the development of the process and protocols regarding succession plans for our executive officers, and annually reviews and updates these protocols to reflect input from Board members. To assist the Board, the CEO annually provides an assessment of senior managers and their potential to succeed to the position of CEO. In addition, the Board meets regularly with high-potential executives, both in small group and one-on-one settings. 
BOARD PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES 
I  BOARD AND COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Agenda. The Board and its committees perform an annual review of the agenda items to be considered for each meeting.  During that review, each Board and committee member is free to raise topics that are not on the agenda at any meeting and to suggest items for inclusion on future agendas.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Number of Meetings and Attendance. In 2018, the Board held seven meetings and the committees of the Board  collectively held 24 meetings. The Board had 100% meeting attendance, and the directors' average attendance rate at meetings of the committees on which they have been appointed was 98%. Each of the directors participated in at least 75% of the  aggregate of the total number of Board meetings held during the period for which he or she was a director, and the total number of meetings held by all Board committees on which he or she served (during the period that he or she served).

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Special Meetings. The Chairman, the Lead Director, the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Responsibility  Committee, and at the request of two independent directors, the Corporate Secretary, are permanently empowered and authorized to call special meetings of the Board at any time and for any reason.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Board Meeting Materials. Each director is provided in advance with written material to be considered at every meeting  of the Board and of the committees on which he or she is a member and has the opportunity to provide comments and suggestions.  
[END TABLE]
I   SELF-EVALUATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Objective. The Board and each of its committees conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness throughout  the year. Committee members have the opportunity to provide input directly to the Lead Director, committee chairs, or to management. A more formal self-evaluation is launched in January of each year and the feedback gleaned from the evaluation is  utilized to facilitate and enable adequate Board refreshment and an appropriate evolution of Board skills, experiences, and perspectives specifically with a view toward eliciting feedback on whether our directors' skills are matched to  Honeywell's strategic needs and its risk profile.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Process. The Lead Director, together with the Chair of the CGRC, are jointly responsible for leading the  self-evaluation process – a process that includes the development and approval of the evaluation by the CGRC, its administration through a third party, summarization of the results, and its report out to the full Board on an anonymous basis.   
[END TABLE]
I   OTHER BEST PRACTICE BOARD PROCEDURES 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Shareowner Meeting Attendance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines encourage all directors to attend our  Annual Meeting of Shareowners. Generally, Board and committee meetings are held immediately preceding and following the Annual Meeting, with directors attending the Annual Meeting. All of our directors attended last year's Annual Meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Engagement with Management. The Board and its committees provide feedback to management, and management is required  to answer questions raised by the directors during Board and committee meetings. Our senior management meets regularly with the Board, including yearly reviews of each business' long-term strategic plan and annual operating plan.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Education. Our Board believes that director education is vital to the ability of directors to fulfill their  roles and supports Board members in their continuous learning. Directors may enroll in continuing education programs at Honeywell's expense on corporate governance and critical issues associated with a director's service on a public  company board. Our Board also hears regularly from management on numerous subjects, including investor sentiments, shareowner activism, regulatory developments, data privacy, and cybersecurity. In addition, the Board periodically participates in  site visits to Honeywell's facilities. For example, in 2018, Board members visited Honeywell's new software center in Atlanta, Georgia, and attended its annual Technology Symposium.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Director Orientation. All new directors participate in our director orientation program during the first year on our  Board. New directors receive an extensive suite of onboarding materials covering director responsibilities, corporate governance practices and policies, business strategies, leadership structure, and long-term plans. They then participate in a  series of meetings over time with management representatives from all of our businesses and functional areas to review and discuss information about Honeywell's strategic plans, financial statements, and key issues, policies, and practices.  Based on feedback from our directors, we believe this graduated onboarding approach over the first year of Board service, coupled with participation in regular Board and committee meetings, provides new directors with a strong foundation for  understanding our businesses, connects directors with members of management with whom they will interact, and accelerates their effectiveness to engage fully in Board deliberations. Directors have access to additional orientation and educational  opportunities upon acceptance of new or additional responsibilities on the Board and in committees.

  Audit committee oversight of independent accountants 
The Audit Committee seeks to ensure the exercise of appropriate professional skepticism by the independent accountants by reviewing and discussing, among other things, management and auditor reports regarding significant estimates and judgments and the results of peer quality review and Public Company Accounting Oversight Board inspections of the independent accountants. The Audit Committee also reviews and pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided to Honeywell by the independent accountants in order to determine that such services would not adversely impact auditor independence and objectivity. The Audit Committee also holds separate executive sessions at each in-person meeting with representatives of our independent accountants, and with Honeywell's Chief Financial Officer and Vice President-Corporate Audit.

Primary responsibility for identifying and evaluating director candidates and for recommending re-nomination of incumbent directors resides with the CGRC, which consists entirely of independent directors under applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. Our independent Lead Director also is formally charged with responsibility for new director recruitment, including the responsibility of working with the Chairman and CEO, CGRC, and the full Board to help identify and prioritize the specific skill sets, experience, and knowledge that director candidates must possess. The CGRC and Lead Director then establish criteria for director nominees based on these inputs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Nomination of New Candidates. Potential director candidates meeting the criteria established by the CGRC and Lead  Director are then identified either by reputation, existing Board members, or shareowners. The CGRC is also authorized, at the expense of Honeywell, to retain search firms to identify potential director candidates, as well as other external  advisors, including for purposes of performing background reviews of potential candidates. Search firms retained by the CGRC shall be provided guidance as to the particular experience, skills, or other characteristics that the Board is then seeking.  The CGRC may delegate responsibility for day-to-day management and oversight of a search firm engagement to the Chairman of the Board and/or the Senior Vice President, Human Resources, Security and Communications.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Re-nomination of Incumbents. To ensure that the Board continues to evolve and be refreshed in a manner that serves  the changing business and strategic needs of Honeywell, before recommending for re-nomination a slate of incumbent directors for an additional term, the CGRC also evaluates whether incumbent directors possess the requisite skills and perspective,  both individually and collectively. This evaluation is based primarily on the results of the annual review it performs with the Board of the requisite skills and characteristics of Board members, as well as the composition of the Board as a whole,  and the results of the Board's annual self-evaluation.

During fiscal year 2018, all of the members of the MDCC were independent directors, and no member was an employee or former employee of Honeywell. No MDCC member had any relationship requiring disclosure under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" on page 92 of this Proxy Statement. During fiscal year 2018, none of our executive officers served on the compensation committee (or its equivalent) or board of directors of another entity whose executive officer served on the MDCC. 
  Administration of Executive Compensation Program 
The MDCC administers the Executive Compensation Program, including determination of the elements of the program and their relative weighting, incentive compensation plan targets, and award amounts. When administering the program, the MDCC takes into account recommendations from senior management with regard to the overall executive compensation program and the individual compensation of the executive officers. As part of Honeywell's annual planning process, the CEO, CFO, and Senior Vice President, Human Resources, Security and Communications develop targets for Honeywell's incentive compensation programs and present them to the MDCC. These targets are reviewed by the MDCC to ensure alignment with our strategic and annual operating plans, taking into account the targeted year-over-year and multi-year improvements as well as identified opportunities and risks. The CEO recommends base salary adjustments and cash and equity incentive award levels for Honeywell's other executive officers. These recommendations are based on performance appraisals (including an assessment of the achievement of pre-established financial and non-financial management objectives) together with a review of supplemental performance measures and prior compensation levels relative to performance. 
  Retention of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The MDCC has sole authority to retain a compensation consultant to assist the MDCC in the evaluation of director, CEO, or senior executive compensation, but only after considering all factors relevant to the consultant's independence from management. In addition, the MDCC is directly responsible for approving the consultant's compensation, evaluating its performance, and terminating its engagement. Under the MDCC's established policy, its consultant cannot provide any other services to Honeywell without the MDCC's approval, as delegated to the MDCC Chair. Since October 2009, the MDCC has retained Pearl Meyer (PM) as its independent compensation consultant. 
The MDCC regularly reviews the services provided by its outside consultants and performs an annual assessment of the independence of its compensation consultant to determine whether the compensation consultant is independent. The MDCC conducted a specific review of its relationship with PM in 2019, and determined that PM is independent in providing Honeywell with executive compensation consulting and limited other employee benchmarking services, and that PM's work for the MDCC did not raise any conflicts of interest, consistent with SEC rules and NYSE listing standards.

In making this determination, the MDCC reviewed information provided by PM on the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any other services provided to Honeywell by PM;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Fees received by PM from Honeywell as a percentage of PM's total revenue;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any Honeywell stock owned by PM or the individual PM consultants assigned to the Honeywell relationship.   
[END TABLE]
In particular, the MDCC noted that PM did not provide any services to the Company or its management other than service to the MDCC and limited other employee benchmarking services. Unless approved by the MDCC Chair, it does not provide, directly or indirectly through affiliates, any non-executive compensation services, including, but not limited to, pension consulting or human resources outsourcing. The MDCC will continue to monitor the independence of its compensation consultant on a periodic basis. 
PM compiles information and provides advice regarding the components and mix (short-term/long-term; fixed/variable; cash/equity) of the executive compensation programs of Honeywell and its Compensation Peer Group (see pages 43-44 of this Proxy Statement for further detail regarding the Compensation Peer Group) and analyzes the relative performance of Honeywell and the Compensation Peer Group with respect to stock performance and the financial metrics generally used in the programs. PM also provides the MDCC with information regarding emerging trends and best practices in executive compensation, as well as a specialized survey related to executive aircraft operations. In addition to information compiled by PM, the MDCC also reviews general survey data compiled and published by third parties. Neither the MDCC nor Honeywell has any input into the scope of or the companies included in these third-party surveys. 
While the MDCC reviews information provided by PM regarding compensation paid by the Compensation Peer Group, as well as third-party survey data, as a general indicator of relevant market conditions, the MDCC does not target a specific competitive position relative to the market in making its compensation determination. 
PM reports to the MDCC Chair, has direct access to MDCC members, attends MDCC meetings either in person or by telephone, and meets with the MDCC in executive session without management present.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY 
Honeywell takes seriously its commitment to corporate social responsibility, protection of our environment, and creation of sustainable opportunity everywhere it operates. This unwavering commitment underlies the principle that good business, economic growth, and social responsibility go hand-in-hand. Honeywell's Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are aligned with the Company's long-term strategy, both informing and supporting Honeywell's strategic plans. This alignment emerges from the inclusion of Environmental and Social (E&S) considerations in scenario planning and other strategic planning processes where E&S-related business risks and opportunities are identified and addressed. 
The Board's well-informed and proactive oversight extends to E&S initiatives in three principle ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee (CGRC) has primary jurisdiction for managing risks and opportunities  associated with E&S, meeting at least once a year with the Corporate Vice President for Health, Safety, Environment, Product Stewardship and Sustainability (HSEPS), the Senior Vice President for Government Relations, the Senior Vice President  for Human Resources, Security and Communications, and other leaders with responsibility for E&S to present and discuss various E&S topics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Direct Audit Committee and Board engagement with E&S risk areas through a robust and comprehensive Enterprise Risk  Management program.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Direct Board engagement on select E&S topics. In the past 12 months, management has presented to the Board on a variety  of E&S initiatives such as employee diversity, sexual harassment compliance, safety, business continuity, and environmental matters.  
[END TABLE]
PERFORMANCE CULTURE 
Honeywell's performance culture is defined by a set of 8 Behaviors. At their foundation is a commitment to Integrity and Ethics, Supporting Diversity, and Workplace Respect, fundamental values that underlie everything Honeywell does.

03  |       CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY 
03  |       CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY 
[END TABLE]
Honeywell's foundational principles reflect our vision and values and help our employees, representatives, contractors, consultants, and suppliers comply with a high standard of conduct globally. At their core is the Company's Code of Business Conduct (the Code) that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees across the Company in all businesses and in all countries. The Code is a baseline set of requirements that enables employees to recognize and be aware of how to report integrity, compliance, and legal issues. In addition, the Code outlines our pledge to recognize the dignity of each individual, respect each employee, provide compensation and benefits that are competitive, promote self-development through training that broadens work-related skills, and value diversity of perspectives and ideas. 
All employees are required to complete Code of Business Conduct training and certify each year that they will comply with the Code. 
I  INTEGRITY AND ETHICS 
The Code provides guidance and outlines expectations in a number of key integrity and compliance areas, including how employees should treat each other, conflicts of interest, Health, Safety, Environment, Product Stewardship and Sustainability (HSEPS), books and records, anti-corruption and proper business practices, trade compliance, insider trading, data privacy, respect for human rights, and the appropriate use of information technology and social media. In addition to the Code, Honeywell provides comprehensive training on key compliance topics, develops training scenarios, provides mechanisms for employees and third parties to report concerns (including anonymously), and ensures timely and fair reviews of integrity and compliance concerns through a best-in-class process to report and investigate allegations. Honeywell responds to 100% of reported allegations. 
Moreover, the integrity and compliance program includes, among other elements, a Supplier Code of Conduct that flows down to Honeywell's global supply chain to reinforce Honeywell's expectation that its suppliers also will abide by our high standards of integrity and compliance, including our Conflict Minerals, Anti-Human Trafficking, Business Integrity, and Health, Safety, and Environmental policies. Suppliers are monitored via quality, ethics, and good manufacturing practices. When a supplier is found to be in violation of any Honeywell standard, they are either replaced or issued a corrective action plan. If the violation is related to unethical or illegal activities, the supplier is removed as a viable supply source. 
Honeywell's Code of Business Conduct applies to all directors, officers (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Controller) and employees. Amendments to or waivers of the Code of Business Conduct applicable or granted to any of Honeywell's directors or executive officers will be published on our website. We foster a culture of integrity, ethics, and workplace respect by setting the tone at the top and by unambiguously and repeatedly reinforcing our expectations. 
I  SUPPORTING DIVERSITY 
The Board believes that its diversity (three women, three Hispanics, one African-American and two non-U.S.) and the diversity of Honeywell's executive leadership (over 50% diverse by gender or ethnicity) supports our evolving business strategy. The Company's commitment to inclusion and diversity enables better decision making, helps build competitive advantages, and furthers long-term success. 
Honeywell has many inclusion and diversity councils and is involved in several professional organizations including the Society of Women Engineers, the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Hispanic Engineers, Anita Borg Institute, the Leadership Council on Legal Diversity, and NJ LEEP, a college access and success program serving students in the greater Newark, New Jersey, area. Honeywell leaders have won several prestigious diversity awards from the Society of Women Engineers, Diversity Journal, and NJ LEEP, as well as many others. The Company also introduced a new company-wide diversity program this January at our annual senior leadership meeting that focuses on the development and advancement of women leaders at Honeywell. 
I  WORKPLACE RESPECT 
Fostering a respectful workplace environment is a key priority for Honeywell. While the Company's Code of Business Conduct and other policies have long prohibited harassment, in 2018, the Company issued a revised global harassment policy to reaffirm our commitment to maintain a respectful workplace for all. This new policy provides more explicit guidance on the expectations for each employee and makes clear that all employees who experience or witness harassment are expected to report such conduct. Our Chairman and CEO and our General Counsel communicated the launch of this updated policy in a video distributed to all employees, as well as through town hall meetings. The message continues to be reinforced through training programs, such as a sexual harassment training program that was developed in tandem with the revised policy and is being deployed globally.

Honeywell's Sustainable Opportunity policy is based on the principle that by integrating health, safety, and environmental considerations into all aspects of its business, Honeywell: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Protects its people and the environment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Drives compliance with all applicable regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achieves sustainable growth and accelerated productivity; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Develops technologies that expand the sustainable capacity of our world.  
[END TABLE]
Honeywell invents and manufactures technologies that address some of the world's most critical challenges around energy, safety, security, productivity, and global urbanization. 
The Honeywell Operating System (HOS), which drives sustainable improvements and the elimination of waste in manufacturing operations to generate exceptional performance, is a critical component in how the Company thinks about sustainability. HOS is a lean-based system with roles and ownership for all employees from the plant floor to the Board room to engage in careful planning and analysis, continuous employee engagement and improvement, and thorough follow through. Honeywell has built sustainability directly into HOS so the tools, personnel, activities, and culture are used to drive sustainability with the same focus used to drive other critical operational objectives, like quality, delivery, inventory, and cost. This ensures that sustainability is an integral part of the Honeywell work experience every day. 
In addition, progress on our sustainability program is considered, along with other factors, in determining annual incentive compensation for senior leadership. 
I  HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT, PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP, AND SUSTAINABILITY (HSEPS) 
Honeywell's HSEPS matters are managed by a global team of trained professionals with extensive knowledge and hundreds of years of collective experience in occupational health, chemistry, hydrology, geology, engineering, safety, industrial hygiene, materials management, and energy efficiency. 
Honeywell's Vice President of HSEPS reports to the Company's Senior Vice President and General Counsel and has overall responsibility for HSEPS programs. A Corporate Energy and Sustainability Team, led by the Vice President of HSEPS, the Vice President of Global Real Estate, and the Director of Sustainability, helps drive the Company's sustainability goals. Progress on these goals is reported to Honeywell's CEO on a quarterly basis and is reviewed with the Board's Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee at least annually. 
The Company utilizes a comprehensive HSEPS Management System based on recognized third-party-certified standards, including ISO 14001 and ISO 45001, and industry best practices. The system is fully integrated into HOS, the Company's blueprint for continuous, sustainable operational improvement. Compliance with standards and regulatory requirements is monitored through a company-wide, HSEPS-led audit process. The timely development and implementation of process improvement and corrective action plans are closely monitored.

I  HIGHLIGHTS OF OUR ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Energy Efficiency. Honeywell reports on its global greenhouse gas emissions publicly through CDP, various regulatory agencies, and its website, www.honeywell.com/citizenship/sustainability. A qualified third party has provided limited assurance per ISO 14064-3 of Honeywell's 2011-2017 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions inventories. Overall, our sustainability program has reduced our greenhouse gas intensity by more than 90%. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Honeywell exceeded its first public goal to reduce global greenhouse gases by more than 30% and improve energy efficiency  by more than 20% between 2004 and 2011.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    A second five-year goal, set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 15% per dollar of revenue from 2011  levels, was met three years early.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Honeywell exceeded its third goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions per dollar of revenue from 2013 levels by an  additional 10% by end of 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Water and Waste. Honeywell has developed a global inventory of water usage in its manufacturing operations and implements water conservation projects in areas experiencing "water stress." Since 2013, the Company has implemented 150 water conservation projects in "water stressed" areas, saving more than 127 million gallons. Each of our businesses is required to establish annual waste targets for reducing hazardous waste, as normalized by revenue, and diverting non-hazardous waste from landfills. 
Safety. The safety of our employees, contractors and partners is a top priority, and we use our HOS-based approach to maintain our safety record. Our global TCIR (the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees) was 0.42 at the end of 2018. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the weighted average TCIR of the industries in which Honeywell operates is over 2.0. In other words, our safety record is four times better than the average of the industries in which we operate. Honeywell has received worker safety awards from governments and organizations around the world. 
New Uses from Legacy Properties. Honeywell has legacy manufacturing operations dating back to the 19th century, like other companies with long, successful histories. The Company's dedicated, cross-functional team resolves our cleanup responsibilities while at the same time creating shared value with our communities. Technical excellence, scientific rigor, and community engagement drive our work. We integrate site re-use with remediation to create solutions that are both protective and marketable. Over the last decade, we have made tremendous progress cleaning up and then helping to create reuse opportunities. At Honeywell, we do not believe that our cleanup is complete until the legacy property has been transformed into a valuable asset for the surrounding community. For example: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Baltimore, Maryland. Former chemical plant was remediated and has become a new downtown community, Harbor Point.  Harbor Point is now home to Exelon, a leading energy provider, Morgan Stanley, and Johns Hopkins Medicine.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Syracuse, New York. Allied Chemical, Honeywell's predecessor, operated on the shores of Onondaga Lake for  about 100 years. At one point the lake was considered the "Most Polluted Lake" in North America. Honeywell completed the cleanup in 2017, and in 2015 was presented with an Audubon New York award for its "leadership in one of the most  ambitious environmental reclamation projects in the United States." About 1,800 acres of wetlands have already been restored and preserved and ~1.1 million native plants are being planted. More than 250 wildlife species are now calling these  areas home, and more than 120 unique bird species have been identified in and around Onondaga Lake.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Jersey City, New Jersey. Former 95-acre waste site in Jersey City has been cleaned up; in January 2019, the site  was purchased by the City of Jersey City for Bayfront, a live-work-play development with waterfront access and 20+ acres of open space.

POLITICAL ENGAGEMENT AND CONTRIBUTIONS 
Engagement in the political process is critical to our success. Our future growth depends on forward-thinking legislation and regulation that makes society safer and more energy efficient and improves public infrastructure. We strive always to engage responsibly in the political process and to ensure that our participation is fully consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, our principles of good governance, and our high standards of ethical conduct. 
We have developed a strong team of government relations professionals based in Washington, D.C. who drive our lobbying programs and initiatives. Our government relations organization is led by the Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations. Members of the government relations organization work from a global network of offices. 
I  MANAGEMENT AND BOARD OVERSIGHT 
The law department oversees our political engagement. The Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations reports to the Company's Senior Vice President and General Counsel (General Counsel) and also works closely with the Vice President, Global Compliance whose organization ensures compliance with our political spending policy. The General Counsel, Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations and Vice President, Global Compliance, meet regularly with the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and his leadership team about legislative, regulatory, and political developments. 
With respect to Board oversight, our public policy efforts, including all lobbying activities, political contributions and payments to trade associations and other tax-exempt organizations, are the responsibility of the CGRC, which consists entirely of independent, non-employee directors. Each year, the CGRC receives an annual report on the Company's policies and practices regarding political contributions. The CGRC's oversight of our political activities ensures compliance with applicable law and our Code of Business Conduct as well as alignment with our policies. In addition, each year the Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations reports to the CGRC on trade association political spending and to the full Board of Directors on our global lobbying and government relations program. 
I  POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS 
We have not made any political contributions using corporate funds since at least 2009 and have no present intention of making such political contributions in the future. Even before 2009, any such contributions were extremely rare and for minimal amounts of less than $5,000. Any use of corporate funds for political contributions require the prior approval of the Company's General Counsel. In addition, membership in any 501(c)(6) trade association that receives more than $50,000 in membership dues from Honeywell in any fiscal year is subject to prior approval of the Company's General Counsel and its Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations, and these trade associations are instructed not to use our funds for political contributions at the federal, state or local levels. 
In 2013 and again in 2019, we revised and expanded our disclosure on our policy and procedures for political activity and contributions as well as for trade association membership. This disclosure is available on Honeywell's website at www.honeywell.com (see "Investors/Corporate Governance/Political Contributions"). 
In 2018, the Center for Political Accountability (CPA), a non-profit, non-partisan organization, assessed our disclosure for its annual CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability (CPA-Zicklin Index). The CPA-Zicklin Index measures the transparency, policies, and practices of the S&P 500. Our enhanced disclosure on political lobbying and contributions ranked us in the "First Tier" of the 2018 CPA-Zicklin Index for the fifth year in a row. Our enhanced disclosure was also influenced by feedback received from our largest shareowners during our shareowner outreach initiative in which we met with shareowners to discuss their views on several topics, including Honeywell's disclosure on lobbying and political contributions. 
For additional detail on Honeywell's policies and processes on political contributions and lobbying, please see our response to shareowner proposal number 5 on page 90.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
The Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee (CGRC) reviews and makes recommendations to the Board regarding the form and amount of compensation for non-employee directors. Directors who are employees of Honeywell receive no compensation for service on the Board. Honeywell's director compensation program is designed to enable continued attraction and retention of highly qualified directors and to address the time, effort, expertise, and accountability required of active Board membership. 
ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION 
In general, the CGRC and the Board believe that annual compensation for non-employee directors should consist of both a cash component, designed to compensate members for their service on the Board and its committees, and an equity component, designed to align the interests of directors and shareowners.

[END TABLE]
A non-employee director may elect to defer all or any portion of his or her annual cash retainers and fees, until a specified calendar year or termination of Board service. Compensation is credited to their account in the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors. Amounts credited either accrue interest (3.38% for 2018) or are valued as if invested in a Honeywell Common Stock fund or one of the other funds available to participants in our employee savings plan as elected by the participant. The unit price of the Honeywell Common Stock fund is increased to take dividends into account. In addition to payments at the termination of Board service, upon a change of control, as defined in the Non-Employee Director Plan, a director may receive, pursuant to a prior election, a lump-sum payment for amounts deferred before 2006. 
Mr. Chico Pardo participates in the legacy Honeywell Inc. Non-Employee Directors Fee and Stock Unit Plan. The last fee deferral under this plan occurred on December 1, 1999. Since that date, deferred amounts are increased only by dividend equivalents. Payment will be made to the participating director in whole shares of Common Stock following the earlier of a change in control or the director's termination of Board service for any reason, in one payment or annual installments, as elected by the director.

I  RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT UPON ELECTION TO BOARD 
Upon their election to the Board, new non-employee directors receive a one-time grant of 3,000 RSUs that vest on the earliest of the fifth anniversary of continuous Board service, death, disability, or change in control. During this period, the director will receive dividend equivalents that will be automatically reinvested into additional RSUs which vest according to the same schedule as the underlying RSUs to which they relate. The director may defer the receipt of the RSUs on substantially the same terms and conditions as Honeywell officers with respect to new grants of RSUs. 
I  CHARITABLE MATCH 
Honeywell also matches, dollar for dollar, any charitable contribution made by a director to any qualified charity, up to an aggregate maximum of $25,000 per director, per calendar year. For 2018, matching charitable contributions were made by Honeywell in the amounts of $25,000 for each of Messrs. Ayer, Burke, Chico Pardo, Gregg, Hollick and Paz and Ms. Deily and in the amount of $15,223 for Ms. Lieblein. 
I  OTHER BENEFITS 
Directors may utilize available Company aircraft for travel to and from Board and committee meetings, and non-employee directors are provided with $350,000 in business travel accident insurance. In addition, they are also eligible to elect to receive $100,000 in term life insurance. Directors elected to the Board after September 2008 are responsible for paying premiums for term life insurance which they elect to receive. Mr. Hollick is also eligible to participate in a Company-provided medical plan in the UK under a legacy arrangement not available to other directors.

(3)  The amounts set forth in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards computed in  accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of each stock award is estimated on the date of grant by averaging the high and low of the Company's stock price on the day of grant. Stock awards of 335 shares were made to non-employee  directors in April 2018 with a value of $149.60 per share.  
(4)  The amounts set forth in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of option awards computed in  accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Option awards of 2,200 shares were made to non-employee directors in April 2018 with a  Black-Scholes value of $22.87 per share. A more detailed discussion of the assumptions used in the valuation of option awards made in fiscal year 2018 may be found in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in the Company's Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2018.  
(5)  Amounts included in this column reflect above-market earnings on deferred compensation from pre-2006 deferrals.  Amounts invested in cash under the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors are credited with the same rate of interest that applies to executives under the Honeywell Salary and Incentive Award Deferral Plan for Selected Employees.  Deferrals for the 2006 plan year and later earn a rate of interest, compounded daily, based on the Company's 15-year cost of borrowing. This rate is subject to change annually and was 3.38% for 2018. Deferrals for the 2005 plan year earn a rate  of interest, compounded daily, which was set at an above-market rate before the beginning of the plan year and is subject to change annually. Deferrals for the 2004 plan year and prior plan years earn a rate of interest, compounded daily, that was  set at an above-market rate before the beginning of each plan year. This rate is fixed until the deferral is distributed.  
(6)  Includes amounts described in "Charitable Match" and "Other Benefits" above.   
(7)  Dr. Sheares retired from the Board on April 23, 2018.

STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director stock ownership guidelines have been adopted under which each  non-employee director, while serving as a director of Honeywell, must hold Common Stock (including shares held personally, RSUs, and/or Common Stock equivalents) with a market value of at least five times the annual cash retainer (or $500,000).  Directors have five years from election to the Board to attain the prescribed ownership threshold. All current directors (other than Mr. Angove who joined the Board in February 2018) have attained the prescribed ownership threshold.   In addition, directors must hold net gain shares from option exercises for one year. "Net gain  shares" means the number of shares obtained by exercising the option, less the number of shares the director sells to cover the exercise price of the options and pay applicable taxes.           On average, Honeywell non-employee directors held, as of December 31, 2018,  Common Stock with a market value of 29x the annual cash retainer, reflecting their deep commitment to shareowner value creation

PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Honeywell seeks a non-binding advisory vote from its shareowners to approve the compensation of its Named Executive Officers (NEOs) as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 38 and the Executive Compensation Tables section beginning on page 64. This vote is commonly known as "Say-on-Pay," and the Board has adopted a policy of providing for an annual Say-on-Pay vote. 
We encourage you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and Executive Compensation Tables section to learn more about our executive compensation programs and policies that reflect changes made over the past two years in response to shareowner feedback. The Board believes that its 2018 compensation decisions and our executive compensation programs align the interests of shareowners and executives by emphasizing variable, at-risk compensation largely tied to measurable performance goals utilizing an appropriate balance of near-term and long-term objectives. 
This vote is not intended to address a specific item of compensation, but rather our overall compensation policies and procedures related to the NEOs. Because the Say-on-Pay vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Board. However, the Board will take into account the outcome of the vote and feedback from discussions with shareowners when considering future executive compensation arrangements. 
The Board recommends that shareowners vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareowners approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners pursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
This Proxy Statement, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, contains financial measures presented on a non-GAAP basis. Honeywell's non-GAAP financial measures used in this document are as follows: segment profit, on an overall Honeywell basis, a measure by which we assess operating performance, which we define as operating income adjusted for certain items as presented in Appendix A; segment margin, on an overall Honeywell basis, which we define as segment profit divided by sales; organic sales growth, which we define as sales growth less the impacts from foreign currency translation, acquisitions and divestitures for the first 12 months following transaction date, and impacts from adoption of the new accounting guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that arise solely due to non-comparable accounting treatment of contracts existing in the prior period; adjusted free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and which we adjust to exclude the impact of separation costs related to the Garrett and Resideo spins, if and as noted in the document; adjusted free cash flow conversion, which we define as adjusted free cash flow divided by net income attributable to Honeywell, excluding pension mark-to-market expenses, debt refinancing expenses, separation costs related to the spins, the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, and adjustments to such charge, if and as noted in Appendix A; and adjusted earnings per share, which we adjust to exclude pension mark-to-market expenses, as well as for other components, such as debt refinancing expense, separation costs related to the spins, the 4Q17 U.S. tax legislation charge, adjustments to such charge, and after-tax segment profit contribution from Garrett and Resideo in the periods noted in Appendix A, net of spin indemnification impacts assuming both indemnification agreements were effective in such periods, if and as noted in Appendix A. Other than references to reported earnings per share, all references to earnings per share in this document are so adjusted. The respective tax rates applied when adjusting earnings per share for these items are identified in the reconciliations presented in Appendix A. Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These metrics should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Refer to Appendix A for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.

  DELIVERED STRONG OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN 2018 WHILE EXECUTING TWO COMPLEX SPINS 
In 2018, Honeywell delivered on our commitments and grew sales, segment margin, adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and adjusted free cash flow (FCF) year over year, while executing two complex spins that refocused the portfolio. We continued to build on our track record of performance as evidenced by our results versus the key metrics we use as the basis for our executive compensation programs. In 2018, we delivered: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Organic sales growth of 6%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted earnings per share growth of 12%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 60 basis points of segment margin expansion  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 100% adjusted free cash flow conversion; 22% adjusted free cash flow growth  
[END TABLE]
The table below showcases our success on these metrics over the past three years (2016-2018):

As laid out during our 2017 Investor Conference, below are our long-term financial commitments. Since then, we've continued to foster a culture within Honeywell of doing what we say we will do, or as we call it, the "say/do ratio." In 2018, we over-delivered on these financial commitments to shareowners and continued to make investments in the businesses through research and development, capital expenditures, and M&A.

OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
I  PHILOSOPHY AND APPROACH 
Our executive compensation program creates long-term shareowner value through four key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Attract and Retain World-Class Leadership Talent with the skills and experience necessary to develop and execute business  strategies, drive superior financial results, and nimbly adapt and react to constantly evolving end market conditions in an enterprise with our scale, breadth, complexity, and global footprint;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Emphasize Variable, At-Risk Compensation with an appropriate balance of near-term and long-term objectives that  align executive and shareowner interests;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Pay for Superior Results and Sustainable Growth by rewarding and differentiating among executives based on the  achievement of enterprise, business unit, and individual objectives as well as efforts to advance Honeywell's long-term growth initiatives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Manage Risk Through Oversight and Compensation Program Design Features and Practices that balance short-term  and long-term incentives, are not overly leveraged, and cap maximum payments.  
[END TABLE]
The key factors that shape the MDCC's overall assessment of performance and appropriate levels of compensation include (in no particular order): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operational and financial performance — for the entire corporation and the relevant business group;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aggressiveness of each executive's financial goals and targets compared to peers as well as the business/macroeconomic  conditions in which our businesses operate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each executive's long-term leadership potential and associated retention risk;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Execution against strategic initiatives and the impact of investments that will benefit financial performance in future  years;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The senior executive succession plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock price performance and total shareowner return;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Trends and best practices in executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Peer group comparisons, including performance, pay levels, and related practices.  
[END TABLE]
The MDCC reviews these factors over various time frames during the year to ensure a strong linkage between pay and performance. In addition, the MDCC reviews each NEO's four-year compensation history in total and each element of total annual direct compensation. The MDCC also reviews projected benefit payments under Honeywell's retirement and deferred compensation plans, and any previously granted awards or grants. This enables the MDCC to understand how each element of compensation interacts with the other elements and to see how current compensation decisions may affect future wealth accumulation and executive retention. 
Honeywell's senior executives are recognized as industry leaders with backgrounds, depth of experience, and management skills that are highly attractive to competitors. The MDCC prefers to address critical retention and succession risks through the existing compensation program. It reserves the right, if deemed necessary, to take appropriate compensation actions that it believes are in the best interest of the Company and its shareowners to strengthen the succession plan and guard against the loss of key talent, especially during critical transition periods.

I  PROGRAM DESIGN AND LINK TO BUSINESS STRATEGY AND PERFORMANCE 
In 2018, the evolutionary changes in our compensation program, which began in 2016, were fully implemented. The following table provides an overview of our executive compensation program and demonstrates the strong link between each of our direct compensation elements and our business strategy and performance.

I  HOW COMPENSATION DECISIONS ARE MADE 
Decision making over executive compensation rests with the MDCC, which holds six regularly scheduled meetings each year. Each meeting includes an executive session comprised solely of independent directors, and those meetings are attended by the MDCC's independent compensation consultant. Meeting agendas contain items proposed by either management or the MDCC members. 
In carrying out its responsibilities, the MDCC balances a number of important considerations, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The importance of aligning pay with Company and individual performance;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The need to attract, retain, and reward executives with a proven track record of delivering consistent financial results and  driving "seed-planting" initiatives that will create sustainable long-term shareowner value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The complex multi-industry and global nature of our businesses and the importance of growth outside of the United States for  future success;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The positioning of pay relative to the competitive market; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The importance of maintaining and executing on a thorough and rigorous succession planning process.  
[END TABLE]
To create long-term shareowner value, the MDCC believes that Honeywell's compensation programs must be financially competitive and structured to drive sustained performance against our strategic and financial goals and objectives. The MDCC is focused on maintaining a compensation program for Honeywell that emphasizes variable, at-risk compensation and has an appropriate balance of near-term and long-term objectives.

I  ENGAGEMENT WITH SHAREOWNERS ON COMPENSATION 
The MDCC also considers shareowner feedback and the results of the annual advisory vote on executive compensation in making determinations about the structure of Honeywell's pay program, or whether any changes to the program should be considered. We routinely engage with our shareowners to better understand their views on our governance and compensation practices. Our Lead Director and MDCC Chair often participate in these engagements. The feedback we received from shareowners enabled the Board to better understand shareowners' perspectives on our executive compensation programs, which resulted in significant changes to our programs that have been phased in over the last two years and fully implemented in 2018. These changes led to over 92% of our shareowners voting in favor of 'Say on Pay' in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, we extended meeting invitations to 54 of our shareowners to discuss Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) matters, including our executive compensation program, representing 50% of our common shares outstanding. Our invitation was accepted by 18 different shareowners (representing 29% of our common shares outstanding), and 24 separate meetings were held, many of which included the participation of our Lead Director. No additional executive compensation program modifications were made in 2018 as a result of these meetings. 
I  COMPENSATION PEER GROUP 
To ensure appropriate levels of executive officer compensation, and the alignment of pay and performance, the MDCC believes it is important to understand how Honeywell compares to other relevant companies. As such, the MDCC reviews executive officer compensation, and assesses Honeywell's financial performance, against two sets of peer data: 1) a group of 16 companies that we call our "Compensation Peer Group," and 2) a smaller subset of the Compensation Peer Group that we call our "Multi-Industry Peer Group." 
Multi-Industry Peer Group. This peer group is made up of Emerson Electric Co. (EMR), General Electric Company (GE), 3M Company (MMM), and United Technologies Corporation (UTX), companies against whom we frequently compete for investor dollars. Each of these four companies is a multi-industrial company that has broadly overlapping institutional ownership, is covered by the same set of Wall Street research analysts that cover Honeywell, and operate in a similarly diverse set of end markets on a global basis. 
Compensation Peer Group. The companies included in the broader Compensation Peer Group are reviewed by the MDCC on an annual basis with a focus on companies that have one or more of the following attributes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business operations in the industries and markets in which Honeywell participates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Similar revenue and/or market capitalization;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Similar breadth of portfolio and complexity;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Global scope of operations and/or diversified product lines; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Demonstrated competitor for executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
No changes were made to the Multi-Industry Peer Group or to the Compensation Peer Group companies in 2018.

I  PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO PEERS 
2018 Performance 
The following graphs show our performance versus the median of each of the Compensation Peer Group and the Multi-Industry Peer Group for three key metrics in 2018. Specifically, we've selected adjusted earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow growth because those are the primary measures used in our annual incentive plan (ICP). Adjusted earnings per share growth for the Compensation Peer Group was higher than Honeywell's in 2018 predominately due to performance in the Aerospace, Defense, and Machinery sectors. Honeywell's adjusted EPS growth in 2018 also was impacted by dilution from the spins of Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett) and Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) in September and October of 2018, respectively. Excluding the after-tax segment profit contribution from Garrett in the fourth quarter of 2017 and Resideo in November and December 2017, net of spin indemnification impacts, Honeywell's adjusted EPS growth would have been approximately 15.1% in 2018. 
Source: S&P Capital IQ 
15.1% adjusted EPS V% is calculated by comparing our 2018 adjusted earnings per share against our adjusted 2017 earnings per share after removing the spin segment profit contribution from Garrett in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the Resideo segment profit contribution in November and December 2017, net of spin indemnification impacts, at a tax rate of 17.2% and ending weighted average share count for 2017 of 772 million (impact of $0.19). 
Three-Year Cumulative Growth (2016 – 2018) 
The MDCC also reviews Honeywell's performance relative to the Compensation Peer Group and Multi-Industry Peer Group over multi-year time periods. The following graphs show our performance versus the median of each of the Compensation Peer Group and the Multi-Industry Peer Group for three key metrics over the three-year period ending in 2018 that the MDCC reviewed. Three-year reported sales growth and adjusted EPS growth for the Compensation Peer Group was high driven by 2018 performance of companies focused primarily in the Aerospace, Defense, and Machinery sectors. Likewise, Honeywell's Aerospace segment grew sales 9% organically in 2018, with our Defense and Space sales growing 15%.

TSR is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company and assuming the dividends and share distributions received from any spins are reinvested in the applicable company at the time they are paid.

Three-Year Average Return (2016 – 2018) 
The MDCC also carefully considers several different ratios that are important measures of Honeywell's earnings performance compared to both the Compensation Peer Group Median and the Multi-Industry Peer Group Median. Shareowners have told us that they regard ROIC as a particularly important metric because it shows how well management is balancing delivery of short-term results against long-term sustainable growth. Honeywell's three-year average ROIC was 17.2%, which significantly outperformed both the Multi-Industry Peer Group Median and the Compensation Peer Group Median.

I  CFO SUCCESSION 
On August 3, 2018, Mr. Gregory P. Lewis succeeded Mr. Thomas A. Szlosek as the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). In connection with this promotion, the MDCC approved a compensation arrangement for Mr. Lewis with an initial base salary of $700,000 and target annual incentive compensation opportunity of 100% of base salary. No additional LTI was awarded at the time of his promotion beyond the regular annual executive LTI grants made to him as a non-officer executive employee in February 2018. Mr. Lewis did not enter into a formal employment contract in connection with his promotion to CFO. 
Concurrent with Mr. Lewis' promotion on August 3, 2018, Mr. Szlosek entered into a retirement agreement after 14 years of service with the Company. Under the terms of this agreement, Mr. Szlosek agreed to provide transitional services through the end of 2018 and extend the duration of his post-employment non-compete and non-solicitation agreements from one to three years. While providing transition services during this period, Mr. Szlosek agreed not to accept an outside position with another company without Honeywell's written consent and to make himself available to Honeywell's CEO and CFO as needed. In consideration of the expanded restrictive covenants and transitional services, Mr. Szlosek was permitted to retain restricted stock unit awards previously granted to him, which would vest in the future on their original vesting dates subject to any applicable Company performance conditions. No regular compensation or consulting fees were paid during the transition period, and all other unvested LTI awards held by Mr. Szlosek as of his retirement date were forfeited, including PSUs and stock options awarded to him in February 2018. 
2018  ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN DECISIONS 
For 2018, 80% of the ICP awards earned by the NEOs were determined formulaically based on financial targets established by the MDCC. 20% of the awards were determined based on the MDCC's qualitative assessment of individual performance against objectives for 2018 and the significant accomplishments listed on pages 52-55. The attainment percentage for both the formulaic and individual qualitative portions of the award can range from 0% to 200%. 
Individual 2018 ICP Target Amounts for the NEOs were determined by multiplying their 2018 calendar year base salary by their individual ICP target award percentage. Individual ICP target percentages for 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Adamczyk: 175%

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Mahoney: 115%  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other NEOs: 100%

I  ICP FORMULAIC PORTION (80% OF TARGET AWARD) 
The following table describes each of the financial ICP metrics and the relative weighting percentage for each metric that is included in the formulaic portion of the ICP payout (i.e., 80%) for each NEO. 
For Messrs. Adamczyk, Lewis, Mikkilineni and James (the Corporate NEOs), the formulaic portion of their ICP award was based on Company-wide (Total Honeywell) adjusted EPS and adjusted FCF. For Mr. Mahoney (the Aerospace NEO), in addition to Total Honeywell adjusted EPS and adjusted FCF, the MDCC also established financial targets for Aerospace net income and adjusted FCF which were given equal weighting. Mr. Szlosek was not considered for a 2018 ICP award as a result of his retirement.

[END TABLE]
The MDCC then reviewed and considered the key 2018 activities and accomplishments for Mr. Adamczyk and each of the other NEOs at year end, some of which are summarized below: 
Mr. Adamczyk, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) – Qualitative Considerations 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Successfully executed the portfolio review announced in October 2017, culminating with the spins of Honeywell's  Transportation Systems business and its Homes product portfolio and ADI global distribution business into two standalone, publicly-traded companies. The portfolio enhancement required a substantial operational effort across the globe, led by a team  of 100+ dedicated professionals, provided a dividend back to Honeywell of $2.8 billion, and provided indemnity protection to Honeywell for environmental and asbestos liability payments. This was all achieved with minimal business and customer  disruption on an expedited timeline and ahead of investors' expectations.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Led Honeywell through an outstanding year of financial outperformance even when considering the dilution from the two spins.  Honeywell delivered adjusted EPS growth of 12% which was $0.21 above the high end of its original guidance; organic sales growth of 6% which was 2 points above the high end of its original guidance and the Company's highest organic sales  growth since 2011; margin expansion of 60 basis points which was 10 basis points above the high end of original guidance; and adjusted free cash flow of $6 billion, or $100 million above the high end of its original guidance, representing growth of  22% and conversion of 100%. On a comparable basis, the Company has not achieved 100% adjusted FCF conversion since 2012 and exceeded the prior five-year average by ~11%. Working capital initiatives drove 0.6x turns improvement which accounted for  approximately $150 million of improvement in free cash flow.

2018 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS 
Grants of LTI awards to the CEO and other NEOs in February 2018 reflected the evolution of our LTI program, which was fully implemented in 2018, with the mix of annual LTI being 50% in performance stock units, 25% in stock options, and 25% in restricted stock units. 
As Mr. Lewis became an NEO after annual grants were made in February, his 2018 LTI awards differed from the NEO Target Mix. His 2018 LTI mix was 31% in Performance Plan cash units, 35% stock options, and 33% RSUs. 
I  TOTAL LTI VALUE 
For 2018 LTI awards to the NEOs, the MDCC (or, in the case of Mr. Adamczyk, the independent members of the full Board) determined a total annual LTI value to be awarded and then allocated the award between PSUs, RSUs and stock options based on the mix proportions described above. Each of the three elements and the respective values awarded to each NEO are described in detail below. 
In determining the Total LTI value to be awarded to each NEO, factors that were considered included:

2018-2020 Performance Plan 
The Performance Plan is a share-based, long-term incentive plan introduced in 2017. Under the 2018-2020 Performance Plan, a target number of PSUs were issued to each executive officer of the Company in February 2018, for the performance period January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2020. The actual number of PSUs earned by each NEO will be determined at the end of the three-year period based on Company performance as measured by the following four equally-weighted performance metrics:

In February 2018, the MDCC established the actual performance goals for the 2018-2020 performance period assuming no portfolio changes. In keeping with the design of the Performance Plan, these goals were adjusted in the fourth quarter of 2018 to take into consideration the impact of the two spins on the full performance period goals. Goals were set for the total Company (Total Company) and separately for each of our businesses. For Corporate NEOs, including the CEO, awards are earned based on performance against the performance metrics stated above. For the Aerospace NEO, the financial goals portion of the award (75% at target) is based 50% on performance against goals set for Aerospace and 50% against the Total Company goals. 
The table below sets out each metric at the Total Company level, their respective goals for the 2018-2020 period, and the number of PSUs that would be earned at each specified level of performance. No PSUs will be earned for a metric if performance falls below the noted threshold. If the Company's performance for any of the performance metrics falls between the percentages listed on the table, the percentage of PSUs earned shall be determined by linear interpolation. The total number of PSUs that may be earned can range from 0% to 200% of the target number of PSUs originally awarded.

2017-2019 Performance Plan Goals 
In keeping with the design of the Performance Plan, upon the spins of Garrett and Resideo in 2018, the MDCC approved a restatement of the goals originally set-out in 2017 for the 2017-2019 performance period to adjust for the impact of the two spins. The approach used was to include Garrett and Resideo in the goals for the portion of the performance period that they were part of Honeywell and exclude them for the portion of the period they were not. The impact was that the three-year cumulative revenue target decreased by excluding Garrett and Resideo revenue from their respective spin dates in Q4 2018 through 2019. The three-year average segment margin rate and average ROI goals both increased as a result of applying the same adjustment approach to those metrics. Changes to threshold and maximum levels were scaled consistent with the original targets. There was no change or impact on the relative TSR targets. 
The following table describes the 2017-2019 Performance Plan goals as restated for impact of the 2018 spins:

I  RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS 
In the past, restricted stock units (RSUs) were issued to NEOs on a biennial basis, with grants made off-cycle from the annual LTI grant. In response to shareowner feedback received in 2016, the last biennial RSU grants to NEOs were made in 2016 and no RSUs were granted in 2017. Beginning in 2018, regular RSUs will now be issued to NEOs on an annual basis with grants made at the same time as other LTI awards; representing the last change in the LTI program transition. RSUs granted to the NEOs in February 2018 represented 25% of the total target LTI value and mix and vest over an extended period. 
The following table presents the number of RSUs granted to the NEOs in 2018 along with their respective grant date values.

 Mr. Adamczyk          20,500             $3,185,495          33% in 2 years; 33% in 4 years; 34% in 6 years 
 Mr. Lewis          3,570             $   554,742          100% in 3 years 
 Mr. Mahoney          9,800             $1,522,822          33% in 2 years; 33% in 4 years; 34% in 6 years 
 Mr. Mikkilineni          8,400             $1,305,276          33% in 2 years; 33% in 4 years; 34% in 6 years 
 Mr. James          7,500             $1,165,425          33% in 2 years; 33% in 4 years; 34% in 6 years 
 Mr. Szlosek          8,600             $1,336,354          33% in 2 years; 33% in 4 years; 34% in 6 years 
(2)  The grant date value was determined using a FMV of Honeywell stock of $155.39 as of the grant date.   
(3)  The extended vesting period associated with RSUs is designed to strengthen retention. During the vesting period,  dividend equivalents will be earned in the form of additional RSU shares based on regular dividends paid by Honeywell, with such additional dividends vesting on the same timing as the underlying RSUs to which they relate. In addition, upon vesting,  the NEO must hold the resulting net gain shares for a least one year before being eligible to sell the shares.

OTHER COMPENSATION AND BENEFIT PROGRAMS 
I  RETIREMENT PLANS 
We offer various retirement benefits to our NEOs. Specifically, depending upon when and where they joined the Company, some NEOs may participate in broad-based plans, including a defined benefit pension plan and a 401(k) savings plan that provides matching Company contributions. We also maintain an unfunded supplemental retirement plan to replace the portion of an executive's pension benefit that cannot be paid under the broad-based plans because of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limitations. More information on retirement benefits can be found beginning on page 70. 
I  NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS 
Executive officers (including the NEOs) may choose to participate in certain nonqualified deferred compensation plans to permit retirement savings in a tax-efficient manner. Executive officers can elect to defer up to 100% of their annual ICP awards. In addition, executive officers may also participate in the Honeywell Supplemental Savings Plan to defer base salary that cannot be contributed to the Company's 401(k) savings plan due to IRS limitations. These amounts are matched by the Company only to the extent required to make up for a shortfall in the available match under the 401(k) savings plan due to IRS limitations. Deferred compensation balances earn interest at a fixed rate based on the Company's 15-year cost of borrowing, which is subject to change on an annual basis. Consistent with the long-term focus of the executive compensation program, matching contributions are treated as if invested in Company Common Stock. These plans are explained in detail beginning on page 74. 
I  BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES 
Our NEOs are entitled to participate in Honeywell-wide benefits such as life, medical, dental, and accidental death and disability insurance that are competitive with other similarly-sized companies. The NEOs participate in these programs on the same basis as the rest of our salaried employees. We maintain excess liability coverage for executive-level personnel, including the NEOs. Our security policy requires that our Chairman and CEO use Honeywell aircraft for all air travel (business or personal) to ensure the personal security and protect the confidentiality of our business. The security plan for the Chairman and CEO also provides for home security and related monitoring. From time to time, we also permit other executive officers to use Honeywell aircraft for personal or business use.

          Pay for Performance. We closely align pay and performance, as a significant portion of target total direct compensation is at-risk. The MDCC validates this alignment annually and ensures performance-based compensation comprises a significant portion of executive compensation.                 No Excessive Perks. We do not provide perquisites except in cases where there is a compelling business or security reason, nor do we provide gross-ups for officers, except in limited cases for relocation.

We use different sets of operational metrics for ICP and performance-based LTI to drive top and bottom-line growth over multiple time frames, aligned with our goal of sustained long-term performance.                 No Guaranteed Annual Salary Increases or Bonuses. Annual salary increases are based on evaluations of individual performance and the competitive market. In addition, we do not provide guarantees on bonus payouts.

         Double Trigger in the Event of a Change-in-Control (CIC). We have double trigger vesting on equity and severance for CIC; executives will not receive cash severance nor will equity vest in the event of a CIC unless  accompanied by qualifying termination of employment.                No New Excise Tax Gross-Ups and No Accelerated Bonus Payments Upon CIC. We eliminated gross-ups for excise taxes upon a CIC for any new officers  since 2009. Plans provide that ICP awards earned in the year of a CIC would be paid at the time they would typically be paid based on business performance rather than target.

No Options Repricing. We prohibit repricing (reduction in exercise price or exchange for cash or other consideration) or reloading of stock options.

RISK OVERSIGHT CONSIDERATIONS 
The MDCC believes that balancing the various elements of Honeywell's executive compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Supports the achievement of competitive revenue, earnings, and cash performance in variable economic and industry conditions  without undue risk; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mitigates the potential to reward risk-taking that may produce short-term results that appear in isolation to be favorable,  but that may undermine the successful execution of the Company's long-term business strategy and destroy shareowner value.  
[END TABLE]
The following compensation design features guard against unnecessary or excessive risk-taking: 
RISK OVERSIGHT AND COMPENSATION DESIGN FEATURES 
Robust processes for developing strategic and annual operating plans, approval of capital investments, and internal controls over financial reporting and other financial, operational, and compliance policies and practices. 
Diversity of the Company's overall portfolio of businesses with respect to industries and markets served (types, long-cycle / short-cycle), products and services sold, and geographic footprint. 
MDCC review and approval of corporate, business and individual executive officer objectives to ensure that these goals are aligned with the Company's annual operating and strategic plans, achieve the proper risk /reward balance, and do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. 
Executive Compensation features that guard against unnecessary or excessive risk-taking include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay mix between fixed and variable, annual and long-term, and cash and equity compensation is designed to encourage  strategies and actions that are in the Company's long-term best interests;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salaries are positioned to be consistent with executives' responsibilities so they are not motivated to take  excessive risks to achieve financial security;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive awards are determined based on a review of a variety of performance indicators, thus diversifying the risk  associated with any single performance indicator;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Design of long-term compensation program rewards executives for driving sustainable, profitable, growth for shareowners;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting periods for equity compensation awards encourage executives to focus on sustained stock price appreciation; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Incentive plans are not overly leveraged with maximum payout caps and have design features that are intended to balance pay  for performance with an appropriate level of risk-taking. The MDCC also has some discretionary authority (e.g., 20% of awards) to adjust the annual ICP payments, which further reduces the potential for negative business risk associated with such  plans.  
[END TABLE]
Adoption of clawback policies, which provide for the recoupment of incentive compensation paid to senior executives if there is a significant restatement of Company financial results. Clawback provisions in the Company's current stock plan also allow the Company to cancel shares or recover gains realized by an executive if non-competition or non-solicitation provisions are violated. 
Prohibition on hedging and pledging of shares by our executive officers and directors. 
Ownership thresholds in the Company's stock ownership guidelines for officers that require NEOs to hold shares of Common Stock equal to four times their current annual base salary (six times for the CEO), as detailed in the Stock Ownership Guidelines. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Officers must also hold 100% of the net shares from vesting of RSUs, the net shares issued from PSUs, and the net gain  shares from option exercises for at least one year.  
[END TABLE]
Based upon the MDCC's risk oversight and compensation policies, the risks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Honeywell's operations or results. A full discussion of the role of the Board in the risk oversight process begins on page 22 of this Proxy Statement.

I  STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES 
The MDCC believes that our executives more effectively pursue our shareowners' long-term interests if our executives hold substantial amounts of stock. Accordingly, the MDCC maintains minimum stock ownership guidelines for all executive officers. 
Under these guidelines, the Chairman and CEO must hold shares of Common Stock equal in value to six times his current annual base salary. Other executive officers are required to own shares equal in value to four times their current base salary. Shares used in determining whether these guidelines are met include shares held personally, equivalent shares held in qualified and nonqualified retirement accounts, outstanding RSUs, and 50% of outstanding Performance Plan stock units. All NEOs maintain ownership levels well above these minimum requirements, as shown in the following table. 
Named Executive Officers' Stock Ownership 
Represents stock ownership as of March 1, 2019. Other NEOs (Average) excludes Mr. Szlosek due to his retirement in 2018. 
In addition, the stock ownership guidelines require officers to hold for at least one year 100% of the "net shares" obtained from RSUs that vest, the "net shares" issued from PSUs, and the "net gain shares" obtained from the exercise of stock options. "Net shares" means the number of shares issued when RSUs vest or PSUs are earned, less the number of shares withheld or sold to pay applicable taxes. "Net gain shares" means the number of shares obtained from exercising stock options, less the number of shares needed to cover the option exercise price and applicable taxes. 
After the one-year holding period, officers may sell net shares or net gain shares; however, after the sale, they must continue to meet the prescribed minimum stock ownership guideline level. 
I  RECOUPMENT/CLAWBACK 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for the recoupment (or clawback) of incentive compensation paid to senior executives if there is a significant restatement of financial results (a Restatement). Under the guidelines, the Board can seek recoupment if and to the extent that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of incentive compensation was calculated based upon the achievement of financial results that were subsequently  reduced due to a Restatement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The senior executive engaged in misconduct; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amount of incentive compensation that would have been awarded to the senior executive had the financial results been  properly reported would have been lower than the amount actually awarded.  
[END TABLE]
The complete text of the Corporate Governance Guidelines is posted on our website at www.honeywell.com (see "Investors/Corporate Governance/Guidelines"). 
In addition, if during the two-year period following an executive officer's termination of employment with Honeywell (or one-year period for Mr. James), he or she commences employment with, or otherwise provides services to a Honeywell competitor, without the MDCC's prior approval, or violates non-solicitation commitments, then the Company reserves the right, for awards issued under the 2006, 2011, and 2016 Stock Incentive Plans, to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cancel all unexercised options; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recover any gains attributable to options that were exercised, and any value attributable to RSUs and Performance Plan  awards (including the former Growth Plan) that were paid, during the period beginning 12 months before and ending two years after the executive officer's termination of employment.

[END TABLE]
We have entered into non-competition agreements with our executive officers that preclude them from going to work for a competitor for up to two years after termination of employment. The list of competitors and the duration of the non-competition covenant has been tailored, in each case, to the executive officer's position and the competitive threat this represents. Because money damages cannot adequately compensate Honeywell for violations of these non-competition covenants, we have a full range of equitable remedies at our disposal to enforce these agreements, including the ability to seek injunctive relief. 
I  TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Beginning in 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limits the federal income tax deduction for annual individual compensation to $1 million for the NEOs, subject to a transition rule for written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified after that date. In the past, Section 162(m)'s deduction limit included an exception for "performance-based" compensation. The Company's compensation programs were generally designed to qualify for this performance-based exception. To accomplish this, the Company previously asked shareowners to approve equity and incentive compensation plans that included limitations and provisions required to be included under Section 162(m). Now that the performance-based compensation exception is no longer available, the Company will no longer include Section 162(m)-related limitations or provisions or request shareowner approval for this purpose, and may not generally attempt to meet the requirements previously included in our plans related to the exception; however, the Company intends to comply with the transition rule for written binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017 as long as the MDCC determines that to be in the Company's best interest. 
I  PLEDGING AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS IN COMPANY SECURITIES 
Executive officers, directors and any of their designees are prohibited from pledging Honeywell's securities or using Honeywell's securities to support margin debt. All other employees must exercise extreme caution in pledging Honeywell's securities or using Honeywell's securities to support margin debt. 
Hedging by directors, executive officers, employees on our restricted trading list, any employee in possession of material non-public information, or any of their designees is prohibited, and it is strongly discouraged for all other employees. For this purpose, hedging means purchasing financial instruments (including prepaid variable forward sale contracts, equity swaps, collars, and interests in exchange funds) or otherwise engaging in transactions that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Company stock held, directly or indirectly by them, whether the stock was acquired as part of a compensation arrangement or otherwise. 
All employees, directors and any of their designees are prohibited from engaging in short sales of Honeywell securities. Selling or purchasing puts or calls or otherwise trading in or writing options on Honeywell's securities by employees, officers and directors is also prohibited. 
MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The MDCC reviewed and discussed Honeywell's Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on this review and discussion, the MDCC recommended that the Board of Directors include the Compensation Discussion and Analysis in this Proxy Statement and the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Description of Plan-Based Awards 
All NQSO, PSU, PCU and RSU awards granted to the Named Executive Officers in fiscal year 2018 were granted under the Company's 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and are governed by and subject to the terms and conditions of the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the relevant award agreements. A detailed discussion of these long-term incentive awards can be found beginning on page 56 of this Proxy Statement. 
Impact of 2018 Spins On Outstanding Equity Awards 
Effective October 1, 2018, Honeywell completed the spin of its wholly owned subsidiary, Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett) to holders of record of Honeywell common stock as of 5:00 p.m. EDT on September 18, 2018. In accordance with the terms of the underlying Stock Incentive Plans, outstanding NQSOs (Option Awards) and unvested and deferred RSUs and PSUs (Stock Awards) that were outstanding as of the October 1, 2018 distribution date were adjusted to preserve their pre–spin economic value. Each outstanding Option Award and Stock Award was adjusted upward by multiplying the number outstanding before the spin by an adjustment ratio of 1.011243. Outstanding Option Award exercise prices were adjusted downward on a grant-by-grant basis, by dividing the exercise price before the spin by an adjustment ratio of 1.011243. 
Similarly, effective October 29, 2018, Honeywell completed the spin of its wholly owned subsidiary, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) to holders of record of Honeywell common stock as of 5:00 p.m. EDT on October 16, 2018. In accordance with the terms of the underlying Stock Incentive Plans, outstanding NQSOs (Option Awards) and unvested and deferred RSUs and PSUs (Stock Awards) that were outstanding as of the October 29, 2018 distribution date were adjusted to preserve their pre-spin economic value. Each outstanding Option Award and Stock Award was adjusted upward by multiplying the number outstanding before the spin by an adjustment ratio of 1.032827. Outstanding Option Award exercise prices were adjusted downward on a grant-by-grant basis, by dividing the exercise price before the spin by an adjustment ratio of 1.032827. 
The number of securities, shares or units underlying unexercised Option Awards and Stock Awards that have not vested, as well as the Option Award exercise prices, listed on the following Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End table, includes the impact of the adjustments made in the fourth quarter of 2018 for both the Garrett and Resideo spins.

I  PENSION BENEFITS 
The following table provides summary information about the pension benefits that have been earned by our Named Executive Officers under two pension plans, the Honeywell International Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) and the Honeywell International Inc. Retirement Earnings Plan (REP).

(1)  The present value of the accumulated retirement benefit for each Named Executive Officer is calculated using a  4.35% discount rate, the projected RP-2014 post-retirement mortality table using scale MP-2018 and an immediate retirement age for Mr. Mahoney, age 62 for Messrs. Mikkilineni and James, and age 65 for the other Named Executive Officers, the  earliest ages at which the Named Executive Officer can retire without an early retirement benefit reduction. Mr. Szlosek will receive a distribution of his SERP benefit in 2019 due to his retirement.

The SERP and REP benefits depend on the length of each Named Executive Officer's employment with Honeywell (and companies that have been acquired by Honeywell). This information is provided in the table above under the column entitled "Number of Years of Credited Service." The column in the table above entitled "Present Value of Accumulated Benefits" represents a financial calculation that estimates the cash value today of the full pension benefit that has been earned by each Named Executive Officer. It is based on various assumptions, including assumptions about how long each Named Executive Officer will live and future interest rates. Additional details about the pension benefits for each Named Executive Officer include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The REP is a tax-qualified pension plan in which a significant portion of our U.S. employees participate.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The REP complies with tax requirements applicable to broad-based pension plans, which impose dollar limits on the amount of  benefits that can be provided. As a result, the pensions that can be paid under the REP for higher-paid employees represent a much smaller fraction of current income than the pensions that can be paid to less highly paid employees. We make up for  this difference, in part, by providing supplemental pensions through the SERP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All SERP benefits will be paid on the first day of the first month that begins following the 105th day after the later of  the officer's separation from service (as that term is defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 409A) or his earliest retirement date.  
[END TABLE]
Pension Benefit Calculation Formulas 
Within the REP and the SERP, a variety of formulas are used to determine pension benefits. Different benefit formulas apply for different groups of employees for historical reasons. Generally, as we have grown through acquisitions, we have in many cases retained the benefit formulas under pension plans that were maintained by the companies that we acquired, in order to provide continuity for employees. The differences in the benefit formulas for our Named Executive Officers reflect this history. The explanation below describes the formulas that are used to determine the amount of pension benefits for each of our Named Executive Officers under the REP and the SERP.

[END TABLE]
For each pension benefit calculation formula listed in the chart above, compensation includes base pay, short-term incentive compensation, payroll-based rewards and recognition and lump sum incentives. Calculations for pension formulas other than the REP and HRBP formulas include the annual incentive compensation in the year earned. The REP and HRBP formulas include annual incentive compensation in the year paid. The amount of compensation taken into account under the REP is limited by tax rules. The amount of compensation taken into account under the SERP is not. Except with respect to Messrs. Mikkilineni and James, the compensation changes described above for the Allied Salaried, Bendix, HRBP, and Signal formulas also apply to the compensation taken into account under the SERP. 
The benefit formulas above describe the pension benefits in terms of a lump sum cash payment (for the REP formula) or a single life annuity (for the other formulas). Participants are entitled to receive their benefits in other payment forms, including, for example joint and survivor annuities, period certain annuities and level income payments. However, the value of each available payment form is the same. Based on prior elections and SERP terms, Mr. Mikkilineni will receive his SERP benefits in the form of a lump sum, and Messrs. Mahoney and James will receive their SERP benefits in the form of an annuity. 
The Allied Salaried formula also provides for early retirement benefits. A participant is eligible for early retirement if the participant's age and years of service equal or exceed 60 and the participant has attained age 50 with at least five years of service or if the participant's age and years of service equal or exceed 80 regardless of the participant's age. If the participant retires early, the participant's benefit at normal retirement age is reduced by 1/4 of 1% for each month payments begin before age 62 (3% per year). In addition, the Social Security benefit reduction portion of the formula is reduced by 1/180 for each month benefits are paid between ages 60 and 65, and 1/360 for each month benefits are paid before the participant's 60th birthday.

[END TABLE]
The Bendix formula also provides for early retirement benefits. A participant is eligible for early retirement if the participant has attained age 55 with at least five years of vesting service or he retires after the sum of his age and years of vesting service equal or exceed 80. If the participant retires early, the participant's early retirement benefit shall be the greater of (1) or (2), where (1) is (A) minus (B), where (A) is the amount determined under the basic formula for up to 25 years of credited service reduced by 1/6 of 1% for each of the first 60 months by which the early retirement date precedes the participant's 65th birthday and 1/3 of 1% for months that exceed 60, and (B) is the monthly offset determined under the Social Security benefit portion of the basic formula reduced by the factors used to reduce Social Security benefits for early commencement (but only for payments made after the participant's 62nd birthday, and based on the reduction factors as of the later of age 62 or the participant's early retirement date); and (2) is the monthly amount determined under the minimum formula reduced by 6/10 of 1% for each of the first 60 months by which the participant's early retirement date precedes his 65th birthday and by 4/10 of 1% for months that exceed 60. The participant's benefit shall be the greater of the pre-age 62 and post-age 62 amounts calculated under (1) and (2) above. If a participant retires after he has 80 points, the early retirement benefit shall be determined as above except the total reduction under (1)(A) shall not exceed 25%, and the amount determined under (2), prior to determining the greater pre-age 62 and post-age 62 amounts, shall be increased by $385 per month, payable through the participant's 62nd birthday with no reduction for commencement before age 65. 
The HRBP formula also provides for early retirement benefits. A participant is eligible for early retirement if the participant has attained age 55 with at least ten years of vesting service or he retires after his 65th birthday. If the participant retires early, his age and years of vesting service equal or exceed 85, his unreduced Social Security retirement age is 67 under the formula, and he was born between 1958 and 1960, the participant's benefit at age 67 is reduced by 0.35% for each full month benefits are paid before the first of the month following the participant's 66th birthday. 
The Signal formula also provides for early retirement benefits. A participant is eligible for early retirement if the participant has attained age 50 with at least ten years of vesting service. If the participant retires early, his accrued benefit (other than the Social Security offset portion) is reduced by 0.33% for each month benefits are paid before the participant's 60th birthday (4% per year). 
As stated above, the pension formula used to determine the amount of pension benefits under each of the plans for our Named Executive Officers differs for historical reasons. Also, additional contractual pension benefits have been provided to certain Named Executive Officers as deemed necessary and appropriate at the time of their recruitment to the Company or to retain the executive. The table below describes which formulas are applicable to each of our Named Executive Officers.

I  NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION—FISCAL YEAR 2018 
Since 2005, Honeywell has taken steps to limit deferred compensation amounts owed to executives by reducing the overall interest rate earned on new deferrals and accelerating the payout of deferred amounts, thereby limiting the period over which interest is earned. These include changing the interest rate accruing on new deferrals under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Honeywell Supplemental Savings Plan (the SS Plan) and the Honeywell Deferred Incentive Plan (the DIC Plan) from a fixed above-market rate to a rate that changes annually based on the Company's 15-year cost of borrowing; and requiring payment of the SS Plan or DIC Plan deferrals to begin shortly after termination of employment in a lump sum unless the participant leaves the Company after reaching retirement (age 55 with ten years of service). In addition, cash dividend equivalents on vested deferred RSUs cannot be deferred and dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs are reinvested in additional RSUs and subject to the same vesting schedule as the underlying RSUs.

(1)  For SS Plan deferrals contributed on or after April 6, 2018, the Company matching contributions are credited  annually no later than the following January 31st if the Named Executive Officer was actively employed or on a disability leave of absence as of December 15th. The value of registrant contributions in the last fiscal year for the SS Plan  includes annual matching contributions that will be credited to the Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Szlosek for the April 6, 2018 to December 31, 2018 period.  
(2)  The value of executive contributions in the last fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the number of deferred  RSUs that vested in 2018 by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the vesting date (or the next business day following the vesting date). The value of the aggregate balance at the last fiscal year is calculated by multiplying the total  number of vested, deferred RSUs on December 31, 2018 by the closing price of a share of Common Stock on December 31, 2018 ($132.12). Unpaid deferred units were adjusted to take into account the two spins that occurred in 2018. This column  reflects the following: 75,491.1661 units for Mr. Mahoney and 47,491.1614 units for Mr. Szlosek.

(4)  The Growth Plan amounts represent 50% of the Growth Plan award included in the Summary Compensation Table for the  calendar year ended December 31, 2017. This portion of the Growth Plan amount will be paid in cash no later than March 15, 2019. Generally, to receive a Growth Plan payment, the Named Executive Officer must be actively employed on the  payment date. Mr. Szlosek will not receive this payment due to his retirement before the payment date.

Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Honeywell Supplemental Savings Plan 
The Supplemental Savings Plan allows Honeywell executives, including the Named Executive Officers, to defer the portion of their annual base salary that cannot be contributed to the Company's tax-qualified 401(k) plan due to the annual deferral and compensation limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code and/or up to an additional 25% of base annual salary for the plan year. 
To the extent amounts have not already been matched on a similar basis under the Company's 401(k) plan, Honeywell matched deferrals posted to the SS Plan at the rate of 87.5% on the first 8% of eligible pay deferred on and after April 6, 2018 (75% on the first 8% deferred before April 6, 2018). Matching contributions are always vested and are credited on an annual basis for deferrals on and after April 6, 2018 if the participant was actively employed or on a disability leave of absence as of December 15, 2018 (on a periodic basis for deferrals before April 6, 2018). 
Interest Rate. Participant deferrals for the 2005 plan year and later are credited with a rate of interest, compounded daily, based on the Company's 15-year cost of borrowing. The rate is subject to change annually, and for 2018, this rate was 3.38%. Participant deferrals for the 2004 plan year and earlier are credited with a rate of interest, compounded daily, that was set by the Management Development and Compensation Committee (MDCC) before the beginning of each plan year and is fixed until the deferral is distributed. Prior to the 2005 plan year, the MDCC would set the rate at an above-market rate to retain executives. Above-market interest credited on SS Plan deferrals and reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 64 includes the difference between market interest rates determined by SEC rules and the interest credited under the SS Plan. Matching contributions are treated as invested in Common Stock. Dividends are treated as reinvested in additional shares of Common Stock. 
Distribution. Amounts deferred for the 2005 plan year and later will be distributed in a lump sum in January of the year following the termination of the participant's active employment. For the 2006 plan year and later, a participant can elect to receive up to ten installments in lieu of the lump sum payment, which election will take effect only if the participant terminates employment after reaching age 55 with ten years of service. 
Except in hardship circumstances, amounts deferred for the 2004 plan year and earlier will be distributed either in January of any subsequent year or in January of the year following termination of employment, as elected by the participant. The participant can elect to receive distributions in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments. 
Participant deferrals to the SS Plan are distributed in cash only. Matching contributions are distributed in shares of Common Stock. 
Amounts deferred for the 2005 plan year and later cannot be withdrawn before the distribution date for any reason. Amounts deferred for the 2004 plan year and earlier may be withdrawn before the distribution date if a hardship exists or the participant requests an immediate withdrawal subject to a penalty of 6%.

Interest Rate. Beginning in 2005, deferrals are credited with a rate of interest, based on Honeywell's 15-year borrowing rate which is set annually at the beginning of the year (3.38% for 2018). Amounts deferred for the 2004 plan year and earlier are credited with a rate of interest, compounded daily, that was set by the MDCC before the beginning of each plan year and is fixed until the deferral is distributed. Prior to the 2005 plan year, the MDCC would set the total rate at an above-market rate to retain executives. Above-market interest credited on DIC Plan deferrals and reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 64 includes the difference between market interest rates determined by SEC rules and the interest credited under the DIC Plan. 
Distribution. Amounts deferred for the 2006 plan year and later will be distributed in a lump sum in January of the year following the termination of the participant's active employment. A participant can elect to receive up to ten installments in lieu of the lump sum payment, which election will take effect only if the participant terminates employment after reaching age 55 with ten years of service. 
Except in hardship circumstances (if permitted), amounts deferred for the 2005 plan year and earlier will be distributed either in January of any year three years after the compensation was earned or in January of the year following termination of the participant's employment, as elected by the participant. The participant could elect to receive non-hardship distributions in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments. 
Amounts deferred for the 2002 plan year and later cannot be withdrawn before the distribution date for any reason. Amounts deferred for the 2001 plan year and earlier may be withdrawn before the distribution date if a hardship exists or the participant requests an immediate withdrawal subject to a penalty that ranges from 0% to 6% and that is based on the ten-year Treasury bond rate at the beginning of the calendar quarter. 
Deferral of RSUs 
The Named Executive Officers may defer the receipt of up to 100% of their RSUs upon vesting based on an election made at the time of grant. The executive may defer payment to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A specific year after the vesting year; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The year following the executive's termination of active employment.  
[END TABLE]
The executive can also choose to receive payment in a lump sum or up to 15 annual installments and can also elect at the time of grant to accelerate the form and timing of payment following a change in control to a lump sum paid no later than 90 days following the change in control. Cash dividend equivalents on deferred RSUs (determined at the same rate as a regular share of Common Stock) are converted to additional deferred RSUs as of the dividend payment date and are subject to the same payment schedule and restrictions as the underlying deferred RSUs. 
Unvested Dividend Equivalents 
Cash dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs (determined at the same rate as a regular share of Common Stock) are converted to additional unvested RSUs as of the dividend payment date and are subject to the same vesting schedule and restrictions as the underlying RSUs. 
The terms of the SERP Plan, the SS Plan, the DIC Plan, the deferred RSUs and the unvested dividend equivalents are subject to the requirements of, and regulations and guidance published by, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

I   POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
This section describes the benefits payable to our Named Executive Officers in two circumstances: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Termination of Employment  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Change in Control  
[END TABLE]
Senior Severance Plan 
These benefits are determined primarily under a plan that we refer to as our Senior Severance Plan. In addition to the Senior Severance Plan, other of our benefits plans, such as our annual incentive compensation plan, also have provisions that impact these benefits. 
These benefits ensure that our executives are motivated primarily by the needs of the businesses for which they are responsible, rather than circumstances that are outside the ordinary course of business, i.e., circumstances that might lead to the termination of an executive's employment or that might lead to a Change in Control of the Company. Generally, this is achieved by assuring our Named Executive Officers that they will receive a level of continued compensation if their employment is adversely affected in these circumstances, subject to certain conditions. We believe that these benefits help ensure that affected executives act in the best interests of our shareowners, even if such actions are otherwise contrary to their personal interests. This is critical because these are circumstances in which the actions of our Named Executive Officers may have a material impact upon our shareowners. Accordingly, we set the level and terms of these benefits in a way that we believe is necessary to obtain the desired results. The level of benefit and the rights to benefits are determined by the type of termination event, as described below. We believe that these benefits are generally in line with current market practices and are particularly important as we do not maintain employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers. 
Benefits provided under the Senior Severance Plan are conditioned on the executive executing a full release of claims and certain non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in favor of the Company. The right to continued severance benefits under the plan ceases in the event of a violation of such covenants. In addition, we would seek to recover severance benefits already paid to any executive who violates such restrictive covenants. 
In the case of a Change in Control, severance benefits are payable only if both parts of the "double trigger" are satisfied. That is, (i) there must be a Change in Control of our Company, and (ii)(A) the Named Executive Officer must be involuntarily terminated other than for cause, or (ii)(B) the Named Executive Officer must initiate the termination of his own employment for good reason. Similarly, in response to shareowner feedback, the Company also amended its stock incentive plan in 2014 to eliminate automatic single-trigger vesting of equity, Growth Plan, and Performance Plan Unit awards that are rolled-over upon a Change in Control.

Summary of Benefits—Termination Events 
The following table summarizes the termination of employment and Change in Control benefits payable to our Named Executive Officers. None of these termination benefits are payable to Named Executive Officers who voluntarily quit (other than voluntary resignations for good reason after a Change in Control) or whose employment is terminated by us for cause. The information in the table below is based on the assumption, in each case, that termination of employment occurred on December 31, 2018. Pension and nonqualified deferred compensation benefits, which are described elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, are not included in the table below in accordance with the applicable Proxy Statement disclosure requirements, even though they may become payable at the times specified in the table. The effect of a termination of employment or Change in Control on outstanding stock options and RSUs is described in the section below entitled "Impact on Equity-Based Awards."

Excise Tax Reimbursement 
U.S. tax laws may impose an excise tax on employees who receive benefits in connection with a Change in Control in certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions. In 2009, the Company amended the Senior Severance Plan to eliminate excise tax gross-ups for officers not already eligible for such treatment prior to January 1, 2010. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Mahoney and James were the only NEOs grandfathered under this provision. Based on the Company's expectation about how the excise tax would be calculated in the event of an actual Change in Control transaction, no NEO would have been subject to excise tax if a Change in Control had occurred on December 31, 2018. 
Impact On Equity-Based Awards 
This section describes the impact of a termination of employment or a Change in Control on outstanding stock options and RSUs held by our Named Executive Officers. Additional information about these awards is included in the Outstanding Equity Awards Table on page 68 of this Proxy Statement.

The table below shows the in-the-money value of outstanding unvested stock options as well as RSUs and PSUs (Full Value Equity Awards) held by our Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2018, based on the closing price of a share of Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on December 31, 2018 ($132.12). 
These awards are scheduled to vest and to expire on various dates in the future. As described below, the vesting of these awards will be accelerated in certain termination of employment circumstances and upon a Change in Control (other than the equity awards granted after April 28, 2014, which will remain outstanding to the extent assumed by the successor upon a Change in Control). In addition, stock options will remain outstanding for different periods depending on the circumstances. The value to a Named Executive Officer of these provisions depends on the vesting period and remaining terms of the awards. For example, the value to a Named Executive Officer of accelerating the vesting of an option by one month is very different from the value of accelerating the vesting of an option by three years. The table below does not distinguish between acceleration of vesting in these two different circumstances, or assign a value to the other provisions. Rather, it only indicates the aggregate amount of the awards to which these provisions would apply at December 31, 2018.

CEO PAY RATIO 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of the individual identified as our median paid employee and the annual total compensation of Mr. Darius Adamczyk, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the CEO): 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the employee identified at median of our company (other than our CEO) was $66,749; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of the CEO for purposes of determining the CEO Pay Ratio was $19,246,604.   
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Adamczyk, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was estimated to be 288 to 1. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described below. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
As a result of a material decline in the number of Company employees in 2018 due to the Garrett. and Resideo spins (approximately 20,000), the Company chose to re-identify its median employee for 2018 after the spin populations were excluded. 
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee," the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates we used were as follows: 
To identify our median employee for 2018, we considered our global population as of November 1, 2018, which was (i) after the spins were concluded, and (ii) within the last three months of 2018. 
Our total employee population, before applying the "De Minimis Exemption" adjustment permitted under SEC rules (described below), consisted of approximately 123,408 individuals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Total U.S. Employees        53,815          
 Total non-U.S. Employees        69,593           (no exemptions)                            
 Total Global Workforce        123,408          
[END TABLE]
We applied the De Minimis Exemption adjustment to exclude a total of 6,098 employees located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The countries and approximate number of Honeywell employees excluded (less than 5% of our Total Global Workforce) were: Algeria (54), Angola (6), Argentina (267), Azerbaijan (3), Belarus (1), Brazil (768), Bulgaria (229), Colombia (124), Croatia (8), Ecuador (1), Egypt (31), Greece (4), Hungary (214), Indonesia (524), Iraq (10), Israel (30), Jordan (17), Kazakhstan (72), Kenya (13), Kuwait (188), Morocco (131), Pakistan (7), Peru (39), Philippines (135), Portugal (45), Russian Federation (866), Slovakia (1,310), Thailand (561), Tunisia (136), Turkey (242), Ukraine (34), Uzbekistan (4), Venezuela (20), and Vietnam (4). 
Total Workforce for Determination of Median Employee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Total U.S. Employees        53,815          
 Adjusted Total non-U.S. Employees        63,495           (excluding 6,098 employees)    
 Total Global Workforce        117,310          
[END TABLE]
To identify the "median employee" from this employee population, we collected actual base salary, incentive awards paid, and any overtime paid during the 12-month period ending November 1, 2018. As permitted under SEC rules, we annualized the compensation of all newly hired permanent employees during this period. 
Once identified, we determined the median employee's total compensation by applying the same rules used to report NEO compensation on the Summary Compensation Table.

PROPOSAL 3: APPROVAL OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS 
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent directors, is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee is recommending approval of its appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte) as independent accountants for Honeywell to audit its consolidated financial statements for 2019 and to perform audit-related services. These services include reviewing our quarterly interim financial information and periodic reports and registration statements filed with the SEC and consultation in connection with various accounting and financial reporting matters. If shareowners do not approve, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. 
The Audit Committee and Honeywell's Board of Directors believe that the continued retention of Deloitte as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is in the best interests of the Company and its shareowners. Honeywell has been advised by Deloitte that it will have a representative present at the Annual Meeting who will be available to respond to appropriate questions. The representative will also have the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and be available to respond to appropriate questions.

NON-AUDIT SERVICES 
The Audit Committee reviews non-audit services proposed to be provided by Deloitte to determine whether they would be compatible with maintaining Deloitte's independence. The Audit Committee has established policies and procedures for the engagement of Deloitte to provide non-audit services. Specifically: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee reviews and pre-approves an annual budget for specific categories of non-audit services (that are  detailed as to the particular services) which Deloitte is to be permitted to provide (those categories do not include any of the prohibited services in the auditor independence provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). This review includes an  evaluation of the possible impact of the provision of such services by Deloitte on the firm's independence in performing its audit and audit-related services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee reviews the non-audit services performed by, and amount of fees paid to, Deloitte, by category in  comparison to the pre-approved budget.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The engagement of Deloitte to provide non-audit services that do not fall within a specific category of pre-approved  services, or that would result in the total fees payable to Deloitte in any category to exceed the pre-approved amount, requires the prior approval of the Audit Committee. Between regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee, the Chair of the  Audit Committee may represent the entire committee for purposes of review and approval of any such engagement, and the Chair is required to report on all such interim reviews at the committee's next regularly scheduled meeting.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee consists of the seven directors named below, including Jaime Chico Pardo who is an ex officio member. Each member of the Audit Committee is an independent director as defined by applicable SEC rules and NYSE listing standards. In addition, the Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Paz, Mr. Davis, and Ms. Washington are "audit committee financial experts" as defined by applicable SEC rules and that Mr. Paz, Mr. Burke, Mr. Chico Pardo, Mr. Davis, Ms. Deily, and Ms. Washington satisfy the "accounting or related financial management expertise" criteria established by the NYSE. 
Management is responsible for Honeywell's internal controls and preparing the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company's independent accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and issuing a report thereon. The Committee is responsible for overseeing the conduct of these activities and, subject to shareowner ratification, appointing the Company's independent accountants. As stated above and in the Committee's charter, the Committee's responsibility is one of oversight. The Committee does not provide any expert or special assurance as to Honeywell's financial statements concerning compliance with laws, regulations or generally accepted accounting principles. In performing its oversight function, the Committee relies, without independent verification, on the information provided to it and on representations made by management and the independent accountants. 
The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed Honeywell's consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the independent accountants for 2018, Deloitte & Touche LLP (Deloitte). Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Audit Committee discussed with Deloitte matters required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. The Committee also reviewed, and discussed with management and Deloitte, management's report and Deloitte's report on internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 
Honeywell's independent accountants provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed with the independent accountants their independence. The Audit Committee concluded that Deloitte's provision of non-audit services, as detailed in the table on page 84, to the Company and its affiliates is compatible with Deloitte's independence. 
Based on the Audit Committee's discussion with management and the independent accountants and the Audit Committee's review of the representations of management and the report of the independent accountants, the Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 filed with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 4: SHAREOWNER PROPOSAL-RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT 
This proposal has been submitted by John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205 Redondo Beach, CA 90278 (the beneficial owner of 100 shares of Common Stock): 
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any topic for written consent consistent with applicable law. 
Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. Taking action by written consent in place of a meeting is a means shareholders can use to raise important matters outside the normal annual meeting cycle. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic might have received a still higher vote than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if small shareholders had the same access to independent corporate governance data as large shareholders. 
Shareholders can act by written consent to elect a new director to help deal with concerns like these and to avoid similar reoccurrences:

Please vote yes:   Right to Act by Written Consent—Proposal 4 
BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Honeywell Board recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Shareowners holding 15% of our outstanding shares already have the right to call a special meeting at any time. The  Board believes that adoption of this proposal about shareowner action by written consent is unnecessary in light of the ability of shareowners to call special meetings based on the written request of 15% of outstanding shares. Allowing any  shareowner, regardless of ownership interest, to initiate a potentially unlimited number of consent solicitations on any topic at any time could enable a single shareowner to advance its own narrow, parochial interests to the detriment of the  majority of shareowners. The 15% threshold required to call a special meeting of shareowners guards against the exertion of undue influence by individual shareowners in pursuit of special interests that may be inconsistent with our shareowners'  long-term best interests. The Board believes this approach strikes the right balance between the rights of shareowners to have a voice in how Honeywell is governed, on the one hand, and protecting against abusive actions that may disrupt the  effective management of our Company and be detrimental to shareowner interests, on the other. Conversely, the written consent procedure may not provide all shareowners with the same rights or adequate procedural protections, particularly with  respect to having sufficient time to review or vote upon a proposed action.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Majority of shareowners with whom we spoke believe that the right to act by written consent is not warranted where  shareowners already have the right to call a special meeting. We have received this shareowner proposal six times in the past nine years. As part of our regular shareowner outreach program throughout this period, we have discussed this proposal  with our largest shareowners. The overwhelming majority of the shareowners with whom we spoke believe that the right to act by written consent is not warranted where shareowners already have the right to call a special meeting.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Action by written consent is an undemocratic means for shareowners to express their views. Shareowner meetings are  the most democratic way for shareowners to express their views on important financial, governance, or strategic questions related to Honeywell. In a shareowner meeting—whether a regular, annual meeting, or a special meeting called by  shareowners holding 15% or more of our shares—voting occurs on a specified date that is publicly announced well in advance of the meeting. All interested parties have an opportunity to express their views and solicit proxies from shareowners.  By contrast, action by written consent does not require notice to all shareowners about a proposed action nor does it permit differing views on a particular action or issue to be fully aired and debated. The Board does not believe that it is  appropriate for some shareowners to take action affecting all shareowners without first informing all shareowners of the proposed action and allowing all shareowners to voice their views and vote on the proposed action.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      The lack of transparency of the voting process when shareowners are able to act by written consent is of particular  importance in light of the potential abilities of activist investors who may have a special agenda that may not be in the best interests of all shareowners. The right to act by written consent would make it possible for a group of shareowners to  accumulate a short-term voting position by borrowing shares from shareowners and then taking action without those shareowners knowing that their voting rights were being used to take such action. Temporary borrowings of shares by an investor could  distort an investor's true ownership interest, simply for the purpose of trying to cause an action to be effected by written consent outside of a shareowner meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    In a Change in Control situation, action by written consent can undermine the Board's ability to obtain the  highest value for shareowners. The prohibition against shareowner action by written consent also serves a critically important function, since it is designed to encourage a party making an unsolicited bid for Honeywell to negotiate with the  Board to reach terms that are fair and in the best interests of all shareowners. The Board weighs diligently and thoroughly the merits of takeover offers and is best positioned to evaluate those offers, to negotiate on behalf of all shareowners, and  to protect shareowners from abusive takeover tactics. The ability of shareowners to approve the sale of the Company via written consent could result in shareowners receiving less value than they might otherwise receive as the Board may not have an  opportunity to assess proposed actions or seek higher-value alternatives. Shareowners could also use a consent solicitation to remove and replace directors and effectively assume control without having to pay a control premium to shareowners. The  significant ownership of Honeywell stock required of both the Board and management ensures alignment between shareowners, Board members, and management in the event of a Change in Control opportunity.

    Related Honeywell Corporate Governance Best Practices. In addition to providing for shareowners' right to call  special meetings, Honeywell has enhanced our governance practices over the past several years to facilitate broad shareowner representation. The Board believes the need for adoption of this proposal should be evaluated in the context of our  governance best practices, such as:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 15% threshold for shareowner right to call a special meeting of shareowners (reduced from 20% in 2018 in response to  shareowner sentiment);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The adoption of a proxy access By-laws amendment (instituted in 2015 in response to shareowner sentiment);   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ability of shareowners to submit proposals for presentation at an annual meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The establishment of an independent Lead Director role and designation of the Lead Director as a point of contact for  shareowner communications (instituted in 2014 in response to shareowner feedback). See "Communicating With the Board" on page 97;  
[END TABLE]

• The annual election of directors and majority voting in uncontested director elections;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Robust shareowner outreach and engagement practices. See "Shareowner Outreach and Engagement" beginning on page 17  for a description of our shareowner engagement activities.  
[END TABLE]
Given the actions that Honeywell has taken to protect shareowner value, increase shareowner rights, and ensure director accountability, the Board believes that adoption of this proposal would not add significant value to the Company's growth or performance or to shareowners' interests and instead would have the detrimental effect of providing the means for short-term or individual shareowners to act in their own self-interest by advocating proposals that neither enhance shareowner value nor advance the interests of shareowners as a whole.

PROPOSAL 5: SHAREOWNER PROPOSAL-REPORT ON LOBBYING PAYMENTS AND POLICY 
This proposal has been submitted by Azzad Asset Management (co-sponsored with Mercy Investment Services, Inc.), 3141 Fairview Park Drive, Suite 355, Falls Church, VA 22042 (the beneficial owner of 27 shares of Common Stock): 
Whereas, we believe in full disclosure of our company's direct and indirect lobbying activities and expenditures to assess whether Honeywell's lobbying is consistent with Honeywell's expressed goals and in the best interests of shareowners. 
Resolved, the shareowners of Honeywell International Inc. ("Honeywell") request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.  Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Payments by Honeywell used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in  each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
3.  Honeywell's membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
4.  Description of management's and the Board's decision making process and oversight for making payments described  in sections 2 and 3 above.  
[END TABLE]
For purposes of this proposal, a "grassroots lobbying communication" is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. "Indirect lobbying" is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Honeywell is a member. 
Both "direct and indirect lobbying" and "grassroots lobbying communications" include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. 
The report shall be presented to the Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee and posted on Honeywell's website. 
Supporting Statement 
As shareowners, we encourage transparency and accountability in our company's use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation. Honeywell spent $47.63 million from 2010-2017 on federal lobbying. These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Honeywell also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, Honeywell spent $5.15 million on lobbying in New Jersey for 2010-2017. Honeywell's lobbying on hydrofluorocarbons has attracted media scrutiny ("U.S. Industries Ask Trump Administration to Endorse Global Hyrdrofluorocarbon Deal," Chemical and Engineering News, June 4, 2018). 
Honeywell is a member of the Business Roundtable, which spent over $43 million on lobbying for 2016 and 2017 and is lobbying against the right of shareholders to file resolutions, and sits on the board of the Chamber of Commerce, which has spent over $1.4 billion on lobbying since 1998. Honeywell does not disclose its memberships in, or payments to, trade associations, or the amounts used for lobbying. 
And Honeywell does not disclose its membership in or contributions to tax-exempt organizations that write and endorse model legislation, such as belonging to the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). Over 100 companies have publicly left ALEC, including 3M, Deere, GE and Merck. 
We are concerned that Honeywell's lack of lobbying disclosure presents reputational risks. For example, Honeywell signed an agreement to work with United Nations Environment to combat and raise awareness around climate change, yet the Chamber undermined the Paris climate accord. We urge Honeywell to expand its public disclosure of lobbying.

BOARD RECOMMENDATION 
The Honeywell Board recommends that shareowners vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Our disclosure on political lobbying and contributions is robust. We believe that our disclosure on political  lobbying and contributions already provides investors with more than sufficient information to assess whether Honeywell's participation in the political process poses any investment risk whatsoever, including by providing transparency regarding  potential reputational risk and accountability for positions of political interest that are promoted by the Company. Our disclosure is available on our website at www.honeywell.com (see "Investors/Corporate Governance/Political  Contributions"). In considering what to include in our disclosure, we made every effort to be both accurate, comprehensive, and detailed, including coverage of the following aspects of our political lobbying and contributions:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A list of our top legislative and regulatory priorities, most of which relate to key elements of our brand promise of making  society safer and more energy efficient and improving public infrastructure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disclosure on our government relations organization;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Details on management and Board oversight of our lobbying activities; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Disclosure on the use of corporate funds for political contributions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Our disclosure on political lobbying and contributions was ranked in the first tier by the 2018 CPA-Zicklin Index of  Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability. Our disclosure was assessed in 2018 by the Center for Political Accountability (CPA) which publishes annually the CPA-Zicklin Index of Corporate Political Disclosure and Accountability  (CPA-Zicklin Index). CPA is a non-profit, non-partisan organization working to bring transparency and accountability to corporate political spending. The CPA-Zicklin Index measures the transparency, policies, and practices of the S&P 500.  According to the 2018 CPA-Zicklin Index, our disclosure on political lobbying and contributions is in the "First Tier" for the fifth consecutive year with a score of 83%. Our score in 2018 puts us in the top 20% of the 500 companies  assessed by CPA.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    As part of our regular shareowner outreach program, we have discussed this shareowner proposal on multiple occasions  with our largest shareowners who told us that our lobbying activities and membership in trade associations were not a source of concern or investment risk. We have received this shareowner proposal six times in the past seven years and on each  occasion, the proposal has received support from 40% or fewer of our shareowners. Each time we received this proposal, we have discussed it with our largest shareowners during our regular engagement and outreach activities concerning governance and  compensation matters. These shareowners have consistently told us that our lobbying activities and membership in trade associations is not viewed by them as a source of concern or investment risk. Moreover, the vast majority of our largest  shareowners have told us that they are satisfied with our disclosure on lobbying, membership in trade associations, and political contributions, and find that our Board is providing appropriate oversight of our lobbying activities.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    We have not made any political contributions using corporate funds since at least 2009 and have no intention of making  such political contributions in the future. We have not made any political contributions using corporate funds since at least 2009 and have no present intention of making such political contributions. Honeywell uses the term "political  contributions" to mean contributions to candidates, political parties, "527 groups" or "527 organizations" such as governors associations and super PACs, and grass root campaigns intended to directly or indirectly influence  the outcome of any ballot measures.  
[END TABLE]
Even before 2009, any such contributions were extremely rare and for minimal amounts of less than $5,000. Similarly, we have not used corporate funds to directly or indirectly influence the outcome of any ballot measures and have no intention of doing so. Any use of corporate funds for political expenditures or ballot measures would require the prior approval of our Senior Vice President and General Counsel. These policies on political contributions are imbedded in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct. 
With respect to tax-exempt organizations, such as 501(c)(4)s, where funds may be used for political purposes, we have made only two corporate contributions since 2009. Both contributions were disclosed on our website, and we also included these payments in the overall lobbying payments included in the publicly available filings required under the Lobbying Disclosure Act. The decision to contribute funds to these organizations was discussed with the Company's Board of Directors. 
We participate in the U.S. political process primarily through the non-partisan Honeywell International Political Action Committee (HIPAC), which is funded exclusively through voluntary contributions from eligible U.S.-based employees. HIPAC contributions can be viewed on the Federal Election Commission (FEC) website at www.fec.gov. These HIPAC contributions have from time to time included those made to 501(c)(4) organizations which are publicly disclosed to the FEC. Employees are not reimbursed, directly or indirectly, for political donations or expenses. The above information is available to shareowners on the Company's website at www.honeywell.com (see "Investors/Corporate Governance/Political Contributions").

    We have robust oversight of trade association memberships, and we instruct trade associations to which we pay non  de minimus membership dues not to use funds received from us for election-related activity. In 2019, we amended our Corporate Governance Guidelines to bolster our oversight of trade association memberships. Specifically, all  501(c)(6) trade associations to which Honeywell pays membership dues of more than $50,000 in any fiscal year must be approved by our General Counsel and our Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations. In addition, these organizations are  instructed not to use funds received from Honeywell for any election-related activity; more specifically, we instruct these organizations not to use funds from Honeywell for political contributions at the federal, state or local levels, including  contributions or expenditures in support of, or opposition to, candidates for any office, political parties, committees, "527 groups" or "527 organizations" such as governors associations and super PACs, or grass root campaigns  intended to directly or indirectly influence the outcome of any ballot measures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    We maintain a rigorous compliance process to ensure that the Company's political activities are lawful, properly  disclosed, and aligned with our Code of Business Conduct. We strive always to engage responsibly in the political process and to ensure that our participation is consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, our principles of good  governance, and our high standards of ethical conduct. Honeywell's law department oversees our lobbying activities. Our Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations reports to our General Counsel and also works closely with our Vice  President, Global Compliance whose organization ensures compliance with our political spending policy. The General Counsel, Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations, and Vice President, Global Compliance meet regularly with our Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer and his leadership team about legislative, regulatory, and political developments.  
[END TABLE]
Each year our Senior Vice President, Global Government Relations reports to the full Board of Directors on our global lobbying and government relations program. In addition, each year the Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee (CGRC) receives a report on Honeywell's policies and practices regarding political contributions and contributions to trade associations. The CGRC's oversight of our political activities ensures compliance with applicable law and alignment with our policies and our Code of Business Conduct. As stated above, we do not make political contributions using corporate funds. A description of our policy and procedures governing lobbying can be found on our website at www.honeywell.com (see "Investors/Corporate Governance/Political Contributions"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    We submit public quarterly lobbying disclosures in accordance with federal law which provide timely and detailed  information on lobbying expenditures. Each quarter, we file a publicly available federal Lobbying Disclosure Act report. The report provides specific information on all Honeywell activities associated with influencing legislation through  communications with any member or employee of a legislative body or with any covered executive branch office. The report also quantifies our expenditures for the quarter, describes the specific pieces of legislation that were the subject of our  lobbying efforts and identifies the individuals who lobbied on behalf of our Company. Outside consultants who lobby on our behalf also file reports detailing their efforts on Honeywell's behalf. All of these reports are available on the  websites of the Secretary of the United States Senate and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
I  APPLICABLE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
Honeywell has written policies and procedures for approval or ratification of related person transactions. Article eight of Honeywell's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a related or interested party transaction shall not be void or voidable if such transaction is duly authorized or ratified by a majority of the disinterested members of the Board. Consistent with SEC rules, a related or interested party transaction includes a transaction between the Company and a director, director nominee or executive officer of the Company or a beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock or any of their respective immediate family members. Furthermore, the Honeywell Code of Business Conduct requires that each director and executive officer report to the Board of Directors on an ongoing basis any relationship or transaction that may create or appear to create a conflict between the personal interests of those individuals (or their immediate family members) and the interests of the Company. A conflict, or appearance of a conflict, might arise, for example, by accepting gifts or loans from a current or potential customer, supplier or competitor, owning a financial interest in, or serving in a business capacity with, an outside enterprise that competes with or does or wishes to do business with the Company, serving as an intermediary for the benefit of a third party in transactions involving the Company, or using confidential Company information or other corporate assets for personal profit. 
If a conflict of interest or related party transaction is of a type or a nature that falls within the scope of oversight of a particular Board committee, it is referred to that committee for review. The Board or the responsible committee must review any potential conflict and determine whether any action is required. This includes whether to authorize, ratify or direct the unwinding of the relationship or transaction under consideration, as well as ensure that appropriate controls are in place to protect Honeywell and its shareowners. In making that determination, the Board or responsible committee considers all relevant facts and circumstances, such as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The benefits of the transaction to Honeywell;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The terms of the transaction and whether they are arm's-length and in the ordinary course of the Company's  business;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The direct or indirect nature of the related person's interest in the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The size and expected term of the transaction; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other facts and circumstances that bear on the materiality of the related person transaction under applicable law and  listing standards.  
[END TABLE]
Each director and officer also completes and signs a questionnaire at the end of each fiscal year to confirm that there are no material relationships or related person transactions between such individuals and the Company other than those previously disclosed to Honeywell. This ensures that all material relationships and related person transactions are identified, reviewed and disclosed in accordance with applicable policies, procedures and regulations. 
I  RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Mr. John Cote, the son of Mr. David Cote, our former Chairman, is the founder, majority owner and chief executive officer of Industrial Inspection and Analysis, Inc. (IIA). IIA acquired QC Group, LLC in November 2015. QC Group provides metrology/dimensional inspection services to one of Honeywell's businesses and to a facility managed by Honeywell under contract with the U.S. government as part of their quality control processes. The services are provided on arm's length terms and conditions. QC Group received approximately $1.7 million from Honeywell in 2018 for payment of services. QC Group and Honeywell entered into the services arrangement prior to IIA's acquisition of QC Group.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than 10% of our Common Stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership of our Common Stock with the SEC. Based on the information available to us during fiscal year 2018, we believe that all applicable Section 16(a) reports, except one, were timely filed. One Form 4 filed on behalf of Vimal Kapur to reflect vesting of restricted stock units was filed late due to an administrative error. 
NOTICE AND ACCESS 
The SEC's "Notice and Access" rule allows companies to deliver a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (Notice of Internet Availability) to shareowners in lieu of a paper copy of the Proxy Statement and related materials and the Company's Annual Report to Shareowners (Proxy Materials). The Notice of Internet Availability provides instructions as to how shareowners can access the Proxy Materials online, contains a listing of matters to be considered at the meeting, and sets forth instructions as to how shares can be voted. Instructions for requesting a paper copy of the Proxy Materials are set forth on the Notice of Internet Availability. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Proxy Materials are Available at www.proxyvote.com. You will need to enter the 16-digit control number located on  the Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
VOTING PROCEDURES 
I  METHODS OF VOTING 
Shareowners of Record.  If your shares are registered directly in your name with Honeywell's transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, you are considered the shareowner of record of those shares. Shareowners of record can vote via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, by scanning the QR code with a mobile device, by calling +1 (800) 690-6903 or by signing and returning a proxy card. Votes submitted by Internet, mobile device or telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 28, 2019. 
Beneficial Owners.  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, by a bank, broker, trustee, or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name and these Proxy Materials are being forwarded to you by your bank, broker, trustee or nominee who is considered the shareowner of record of those shares. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your bank, broker, trustee or nominee on how to vote via the Internet or by telephone or mobile device if the bank, broker, trustee or nominee offers these options or by signing and returning a proxy card. Your bank, broker, trustee or nominee will send you instructions for voting your shares. NYSE rules prohibit brokers from voting on Proposal Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 5 without receiving instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. In the absence of instructions, shares subject to such broker non-votes will not be counted as voted or as present or represented on those proposals and so will have no effect on the vote. 
Brokers may not vote your shares on the election of directors in the absence of your specific instructions as to how to vote so we encourage you to provide instructions to your broker regarding the voting of your shares. Votes directed by Internet, mobile device or telephone through such a bank, broker, trustee or nominee must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 28, 2019. 
Participants in Honeywell Savings Plans.  Participants in the Honeywell stock funds within Honeywell savings plans are considered the beneficial owners of the shares held by the savings plans. The trustee of each savings plan is the shareowner of record for shares held by Honeywell stock funds within that plan. Participants in Honeywell stock funds within Honeywell savings plans can direct the trustee of the relevant plan to vote their shares via the Internet at www.proxyvote.com, by scanning the QR Code with a mobile device, by calling (800) 690-6903 or by signing and returning a proxy card. 
The trustee will vote shares as to which no directions are received in the same ratio as shares with respect to which directions have been received from other participants in the relevant plan, unless contrary to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). So we encourage you to provide instructions to the trustee regarding the voting of your shares. Directions provided by Internet, mobile device or telephone must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on April 25, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Your Vote is Very Important to us. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please take the time to vote your  shares as soon as possible.

I  REVOKING YOUR PROXY 
Whether you vote or direct your vote by mail, telephone, mobile device, or via the Internet, if you are a shareowner of record or a participant in Honeywell stock funds within Honeywell savings plans, unless otherwise noted, you may later revoke your proxy by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sending a written statement to that effect to the Corporate Secretary of Honeywell;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Submitting a properly signed proxy with a later date;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting by telephone, mobile device or via the Internet at a later time (if initially able to vote in that manner) so long as  such vote or voting direction is received by the applicable date and time set forth above for shareowners of record and participants in Honeywell savings plans; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Voting in person at the Annual Meeting (except for shares held in the savings plans).  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares through a bank, broker, trustee, or nominee and you have instructed the bank, broker, trustee, or nominee to vote your shares, you must follow the directions received from your bank, broker, trustee or nominee to change those instructions. 
I  QUORUM; VOTE REQUIRED; ABSTENTIONS AND BROKER NON-VOTES 
The required quorum for the transaction of business at the meeting is a majority of the total outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the meeting, either present in person or represented by proxy. 
Regarding Proposal No. 1, Honeywell's By-laws provide that in any uncontested election of directors (an election in which the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected), any nominee who receives a greater number of votes cast "FOR" his or her election than votes cast "AGAINST" his or her election will be elected to the Board of Directors. Shares not represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the election of directors. The By-laws also provide that any incumbent nominee who does not receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election is expected to promptly tender his or her resignation to the Chairman of the Board following the certification of the shareowner vote. This resignation will be promptly considered through a process managed by the Corporate Governance and Responsibility Committee, excluding any director nominees who did not receive a majority of votes cast to elect him or her to the Board. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of shares present or represented and entitled to vote on each of Proposal Nos. 2 through 5 is required for approval of these proposals. Abstentions will be counted toward the tabulation of votes present or represented on these proposals and will have the same effect as votes against these proposals. Shares not represented in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting and broker non-votes will have no effect on the vote outcome of these proposals. While the votes on Proposal No. 2 is advisory and not binding on the Board or the Company, the Board will take into consideration the outcome of the votes when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
I  CONFIDENTIAL VOTING POLICY 
It is our policy that any proxy, ballot or other voting material that identifies the particular vote of a shareowner and contains the shareowner's request for confidential treatment will be kept confidential, except in the event of a contested proxy solicitation or as may be required by law. We may be informed whether or not a particular shareowner has voted and will have access to any comment written on a proxy, ballot or other material and to the identity of the commenting shareowner. Under the policy, the inspectors of election at any shareowner meeting will be independent parties unaffiliated with Honeywell. 
I  RESULTS OF THE VOTE 
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish them on our website www.honeywell.com. Voting results will also be disclosed on a Form 8-K filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting, which will be available on our website. 
I  SHARES OUTSTANDING 
At the close of business on March 1, 2019, there were 728,369,863 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Each share outstanding as of the March 1, 2019 record date is entitled to one vote at the Annual Meeting on each matter properly brought before the meeting. 
I  ELIMINATING DUPLICATE MAILINGS 
Beneficial owners of Common Stock who share a single address may receive only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or the Proxy Materials, as the case may be, unless their broker, bank, trustee or nominee has received contrary instructions from any beneficial owner at that address. This practice, known as "householding," is designed to reduce printing and mailing costs. If any beneficial shareowner(s) sharing a single address wish to discontinue householding and receive a separate copy of the Notice of Internet Availability or the Proxy Materials, as the case may be, they may contact Broadridge, either by calling (866) 540-7095, or by writing to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, New York, 11717.

[BEGIN TABLE]
    Please Bring Identification. All shareowners attending the meeting will be asked to provide proof of  identification.  
[END TABLE]

If you are not a shareowner, you will be admitted only if you have a valid legal proxy and form of photo identification. If you are receiving a legal proxy from a shareowner of record, you must bring a form of photo identification and a legal proxy from the record holder to you. If you are receiving a legal proxy from a street name shareowner, you must bring a form of photo identification, a legal proxy from the record holder (i.e., the bank, broker or other holder of record) to the street name holder that is assignable, and a legal proxy from the street name holder to you. We reserve the right to limit the number of representatives for any shareowner who may attend the meeting. 
SHAREOWNER PROPOSALS AND BOARD NOMINEES 
I  SHAREOWNER PROPOSALS FOR 2020 ANNUAL MEETING

Proposals submitted thereafter will be opposed as not timely filed. 
If a shareowner intends to present a proposal for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners pursuant to the procedures contemplated in Honeywell's By-laws, outside the processes of SEC Rule 14a-8 or the proxy access provisions in Honeywell's By-laws, Honeywell must receive notice of such proposal not earlier than December 30, 2019 and not later than January 29, 2020.

If this information is not supplied as provided in Honeywell's By-laws, the proposal will not be considered at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareowners. In addition, Honeywell's proxies will have discretionary voting authority on any vote with respect to such proposal, if presented at the meeting, without including information regarding the proposal in its Proxy Materials. 
Any shareowner wishing to submit a shareowner proposal should send notice to: Corporate Secretary, Honeywell, 115 Tabor Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey 07950.

We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment. 
We believe that this metric is useful to investors and management as a measure of cash generated by business operations that will be used to repay scheduled debt maturities and can be used to invest in future growth through new business development activities or acquisitions, pay dividends, repurchase stock or repay debt obligations prior to their maturities. This metric can also be used to evaluate our ability to generate cash flow from business operations and the impact that this cash flow has on our liquidity.
