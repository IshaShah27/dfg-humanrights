Proxy Statement for the 
Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
To Be Held on Tuesday, February 12, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with a solicitation of proxies by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of Credit Suisse High Yield Bond Fund (the "Fund") for use at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Fund to be held at the offices of Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC ("Credit Suisse"), Eleven Madison Avenue, Floor 2B, New York, New York 10010 on Tuesday, February 12, 2019 (commencing at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time) and at any adjournments thereof (the "Meeting"). A Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders and a proxy card (the "Proxy") accompany this Proxy Statement. 
Proxy solicitations will be made primarily by mail, but solicitations may also be made by telephone or personal interviews conducted by officers or employees of the Fund; Credit Suisse, the investment adviser to the Fund; State Street Bank and Trust Company, the administrator of the Fund (the "Administrator"); or AST Fund Solutions, LLC ("AST"), a professional proxy solicitation firm that has been retained by the Fund for a fee not to exceed $1,500 plus all reasonable out of pocket expenses (e.g., shareholder telephone calls) incurred on behalf of the Fund. All costs of solicitation, including (a) printing and mailing of this Proxy Statement and accompanying material, (b) the reimbursement of brokerage firms and others for their expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of the Fund's shares, (c) payment to AST for its services in soliciting Proxies and (d) supplementary solicitations to submit Proxies, will be borne by the Fund. This Proxy Statement and accompanying Proxy are expected to be mailed to shareholders on or about December 28, 2018. 
The principal executive office of the Fund and Credit Suisse is Eleven Madison Avenue, 9th Floor, New York, New York 10010. The principal executive office of the Administrator is One Lincoln Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02111. 
The Fund's Annual Report containing audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 is being furnished to all shareholders of the Fund along with this Proxy Statement in a combined mailing. The Fund's Annual Report is not to be regarded as proxy-soliciting material. 
Only shareholders can attend the Meeting and any adjournment or postponement thereof. To gain admittance, if you are a shareholder of record, you must bring a form of personal identification to the Meeting, where your name will be verified against our shareholder list. If a broker or other nominee holds your   shares and you plan to attend the Meeting, you should bring a recent brokerage statement showing your ownership of the shares, as well as a form of personal identification. Shareholders who wish to vote in person at the Meeting must comply with all applicable conditions. 
If the enclosed Proxy is properly executed and returned in time to be voted at the Meeting, the shares represented thereby will be voted in accordance with the instructions marked on the Proxy. Any shareholder giving a Proxy has the right to attend the Meeting to vote his or her shares in person (thereby revoking any prior Proxy) and also the right to revoke the Proxy at any time by written notice received by the Fund prior to the time it is voted. 
The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to be cast shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. In the event that a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy will have the power to adjourn the Meeting, without notice other than an announcement at the Meeting, until the requisite number of shares entitled to vote at the Meeting is present. In the event that a quorum is present at the Meeting but sufficient votes to approve the proposal are not received, the persons named as proxies may propose one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of Proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of a majority of those shares represented at the Meeting in person or by proxy, and the persons named as proxies will vote those Proxies that they are entitled to vote "FOR" any proposal in favor of such adjournment and will vote those Proxies required to be voted "AGAINST" any proposal against any such adjournment. Absent the establishment of a subsequent record date and the giving of notice to the holders of record thereon, the adjourned Meeting must take place not more than 130 days after the record date. At such adjourned Meeting, any business may be transacted which could have been transacted at the original Meeting. 
A Proxy that is properly executed and returned accompanied by instructions to withhold authority to vote (an abstention) or that represents a broker "non-vote" (that is, a Proxy from a broker or nominee indicating that such person has not received instructions from the beneficial owner or other person entitled to vote shares on a particular matter with respect to which the broker or nominee does not have discretionary power) will be treated as shares that are present, but that have not voted, for the purpose of determining a quorum for the transacting of business. Under Delaware law, abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute a vote "FOR" or "AGAINST" a matter. The election of a Trustee requires that the successful candidate receive a plurality of votes cast at the Meeting in person or by proxy; therefore, abstentions and broker non-votes will be disregarded. 
Credit Suisse and its affiliates have advised the Fund that they intend to vote the shares over which they have voting power at the Meeting, including shares that are held directly or on behalf of employees, in the manner instructed by the customers or employees for which such shares are held.  The Fund has one class of shares of beneficial interest of capital stock (the "Shares"). On the record date, December 14, 2018, there were 103,477,771 Shares outstanding. Each Share is entitled to one vote at the Meeting, and fractional Shares are entitled to a proportionate share of one vote. In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Fund is advising its shareholders of the availability on the Internet of the proxy materials relating to the Meeting. These rules allow companies to provide access to proxy materials in one of two ways. Because the Fund has elected to utilize the "full set delivery" option, the Fund is delivering to all shareholders paper copies of all of the proxy materials, as well as providing access to those proxy materials on a publicly accessible website. 
In order that your Shares may be represented at the Meeting, you are requested to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  —  indicate your instructions on the Proxy;  
  —  date and sign the Proxy;  
  —  mail the Proxy promptly in the enclosed envelope; and  
  —  allow sufficient time for the Proxy to be received and processed on or before 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time on  February 12, 2019.

 Qualification of Board of Trustees/Nominees 
The Board believes that each Trustee's and nominee's experience, qualifications, attributes or skills on an individual basis and in combination with those of the other Trustees and nominees lead to the conclusion that each Trustee and nominee should serve as a Trustee. Among the attributes common to all Trustees and nominees are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them, to interact effectively with the other Trustees, Credit Suisse, other service providers, counsel and the independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, each Non-Interested Trustee received an annual fee of $20,000 and $2,000 for each meeting of the Board attended by him or her and was reimbursed for expenses incurred in connection with his or her attendance at the Fund's Board meetings. The total remuneration paid by the Fund during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 to all such Non-Interested Trustees was $125,419. The Chairman of the Board receives an additional annual fee of $5,000 and the Audit Committee Chairman receives an additional annual fee of $2,000. 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018, the Board convened nine times. Each Trustee attended at least seventy-five percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and any committees on which he or she served during the period for which he or she was a Trustee. 
Leadership Structure and Oversight Responsibilities 
Overall responsibility for oversight of the Fund rests with the Board. The Fund has engaged Credit Suisse to manage the Fund on a day-to-day basis. The Board is responsible for overseeing Credit Suisse and other service providers in the operations of the Fund in accordance with the provisions of the 1940 Act, applicable provisions of state and other laws and the Fund's charter. The Board is currently composed of five members, each of whom, other than Mr. Popp, is a Non-Interested Trustee. The Board meets in-person at regularly scheduled quarterly meetings each year. In addition, the Board may hold special in-person or telephonic meetings or informal conference calls to discuss specific matters that may arise or require action between regular meetings. As described below, the Board has established a Nominating Committee and an Audit Committee, and may establish ad hoc committees or working groups from time to time, to assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities. The Non-Interested Trustees have also engaged independent legal counsel to assist them in performing their oversight responsibilities. 
The Board has appointed Steven Rappaport, a Non-Interested Trustee, to serve in the role of Chairman. The Chairman's role is to preside at all meetings of the Board and to act as a liaison with Credit Suisse, counsel and other Trustees generally between meetings. The Chairman serves as a key point person for dealings between management and the Trustees. The Chairman may also perform such   other functions as may be delegated by the Board from time to time. The Board reviews matters related to its leadership structure annually. The Board has determined that the Board's leadership structure is appropriate because it allows the Board to exercise informed and independent judgment over the matters under its purview and it allocates areas of responsibility among committees of Trustees and the full Board in a manner that enhances effective oversight. 
The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and valuation risks, among others. Risk oversight forms part of the Board's general oversight of the Fund and is addressed as part of various Board and committee activities. Day-to-day risk management functions are subsumed within the responsibilities of Credit Suisse and other service providers (depending on the nature of the risk), which carry out the Fund's investment management and business affairs. Credit Suisse and other service providers employ a variety of processes, procedures and controls to identify various events or circumstances that give rise to risks, to lessen the probability of their occurrence and/or to mitigate the effects of such events or circumstances if they do occur. Each of Credit Suisse and other service providers has their own independent interest in risk management, and their policies and methods of risk management will depend on their functions and business models. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that may affect the Fund or to develop processes and controls to eliminate or mitigate their occurrence or effects. As part of its regular oversight of the Fund, the Board interacts with and reviews reports from, among others, Credit Suisse, the Fund's Chief Compliance Officer, the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and counsel, as appropriate, regarding risks faced by the Fund and applicable risk controls. The Board may, at any time and in its discretion, change the manner in which it conducts risk oversight. 
All of the Trustees, except for John Popp, constitute the Fund's Audit Committee, which is composed of Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund and who are independent (as such term is defined by the listing standards of the NYSE American, LLC, formerly known as NYSE MKT (the "NYSE American")). The Audit Committee convened four times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing and financial matters affecting the Fund. 
All of the Trustees, except for John Popp, constitute the Fund's Nominating Committee, which is composed of Trustees who are not interested persons of the Fund and who are independent (as such term is defined by the listing standards of NYSE American). The Nominating Committee met four times during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. At a meeting of the Nominating Committee held on November 12, 2018, the Nominating Committee nominated each of Mahendra R. Gupta and John G. Popp for a three-year term, Jeffrey E. Garten for a one-year term and Laura A. DeFelice for a two-year term. The Nominating Committee selects and nominates new Trustees. The Board has adopted a Nominating Committee Charter (a copy of which was included as Appendix A to the Fund's   proxy statement dated December 29, 2017). In nominating candidates, the Nominating Committee will take into consideration such factors as it deems appropriate. These factors may include judgment, skill, diversity, experience with investment companies and other organizations of comparable purpose, complexity, size and subject to similar legal restrictions and oversight, the interplay of the candidate's experience with the experience of other Board members, and the extent to which the candidate would be a desirable addition to the Board and any committees thereof. With respect to diversity, the Nominating Committee considers whether a candidate's background, experience and skills will contribute to the diversity of the Board. 
The Nominating Committee will consider candidates submitted by shareholders or from other sources it deems appropriate. Any recommendation should be submitted to the Secretary of the Fund, c/o Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC, Eleven Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10010. Shareholders or shareholder groups submitting proposed candidates must substantiate compliance with the requirements in the Fund's By-laws at the time of submitting their proposed candidate. Any submission should include, at a minimum, the following information: As to each individual proposed for election or re-election as trustee, the name, age, business address, residence address and principal occupation or employment of such individual, the class, series and number of shares of stock of the Fund that are beneficially owned by such individual, the date such shares were acquired and the investment intent of such acquisition, whether such stockholder believes such individual is, or is not, an "interested person" of the Fund (as defined in the 1940 Act), and information regarding such individual that is sufficient, in the discretion of the Nominating Committee, to make such determination, and all other information relating to such individual that is required to be disclosed in solicitation of proxies for election of directors in an election contest (even if an election contest is not involved) or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A (or any successor provision) under the 1934 Act, and the rules thereunder (including such individual's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a trustee (if elected)). To be considered for inclusion in the Fund's proxy statement, the submission must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the Fund not later than 120 days, nor earlier than 150 days, before the first anniversary of the date on which the Fund first mailed its proxy materials for the annual meeting held in the prior year; provided, however, that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced or delayed by more than 30 days from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice by such stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than 150 days prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice or public announcement of the date of such meeting was given or made. Any such submission must also be submitted by such date and contain such information as may be specified in the Fund's By-laws, or as required by any relevant stock exchange listing standards.  The Fund does not have a Compensation Committee. 
OTHER BOARD-RELATED MATTERS 
Shareholders who wish to send communications to the Board should send them to the address of the Fund and to the attention of the Board c/o the Secretary of the Fund. All such communications will be directed to the Board's attention. 
The Fund does not have a formal policy regarding Board member attendance at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE 
Pursuant to the Audit Committee Charter adopted by the Board (a copy of which was included as Appendix B to the Fund's proxy statement dated December 29, 2017), the Audit Committee is responsible for conferring with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, reviewing annual financial statements, approving the selection of the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm and overseeing the Fund's internal controls. The Fund's Audit Committee Charter also contains provisions relating to the pre-approval by the Audit Committee of certain non-audit services to be provided by KPMG LLP ("KPMG") to the Fund and to Credit Suisse and certain of its affiliates. The Audit Committee advises the full Board with respect to accounting, auditing and financial matters affecting the Fund. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out audits in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
The Audit Committee has met with the Fund's management to discuss, among other things, the Fund's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has also met with the Fund's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG, and discussed with them certain matters required by Statement of Auditing Standards No. 114, The Auditor's Communication with those Charged with Governance, as currently modified or supplemented, including, but not limited to, the scope of the Fund's audit, the Fund's financial statements and the Fund's accounting controls. The Audit Committee has received from KPMG the letter required by the SEC's independence rules describing any relationships between it and the Fund, Credit Suisse and its affiliates that may be thought to bear upon the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG its independence and has considered whether the provision of services by KPMG to the Fund, Credit Suisse and its affiliates was compatible with maintaining KPMG's independence. 
The members of the Audit Committee are not professionally engaged in the practice of auditing or accounting and are not employed by the Fund for accounting, financial management or internal control. Moreover, the Audit Committee relies on and makes no independent verification of the facts presented to it or representations made by management or the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's oversight does not provide an independent basis to   determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies, or internal controls and procedures, designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not provide assurance that the audit of the Fund's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards or that the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Based upon these reviews and discussions, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Fund's audited financial statements be included in the Fund's 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 and be mailed to shareholders and filed with the SEC.

The Audit Committee is responsible for pre-approving (i) all audit and permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to the Fund and (ii) all permissible non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to Credit Suisse and any service provider to the Fund controlling, controlled by or under common control with Credit Suisse that provided ongoing services to the Fund ("Covered Services Provider"), if the engagement relates directly to the operations and financial reporting of the Fund.
