   Compensation Matters—Executive Summary(page 32)    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A") provides information about our executive compensation philosophy and objectives and the process governing our named executive officers, ("NEOs") 2018 total compensation. The Company's compensation disclosures in this Proxy Statement include the following NEOs (the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") and the three highest paid other executive officers). 
We assess executive officer performance by analyzing specific, achieved Company financial goals. The Company's executive compensation program balances short and long-term Company performance with stockholder value creation. We align executive compensation to the success of the Company and the interests of our stockholders by making annual cash incentive bonus payments to executive officers based on Company achievement of pre-established performance measures that are directly tied to Company performance. Executive officers are only entitled to target or above-target annual cash incentive bonus payments if the Company delivers target or above-target performance with respect to these performance measures. 
In addition, the Company's long-term incentive compensation plan ties a meaningful portion of executive officer compensation to Company performance. Specifically, 50% of an executive officer's long-term incentive compensation is granted in the form of performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs") that vest only upon the attainment of key Company financial performance metrics measured over a three-year period. The other 50% of an executive officer's long-term incentive compensation is time-based restricted stock awards ("TRSAs") that vest ratably over four years. The Company believes this long-term incentive compensation grant structure appropriately aligns Company performance with stockholder interests. 
Details of our executive compensation philosophy, objectives, process and decisions can be found under the CD&A section of this Proxy Statement.

[END TABLE]
In 2018, one of our directors did not receive a majority of votes cast at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2018 Annual Meeting"), and she tendered her resignation to the Board for consideration. As more fully described on page 20, the Board ultimately rejected the director's resignation and reaffirmed the appointment of the director to the Board. In response to the vote, the Board took action to ensure attendance by Board members of at least 75% of all Board and committee meetings, including ensuring that the Board's calendar accommodated the schedules of all Board members. In addition, the General Counsel reviewed Board attendance throughout the year to ensure attendance compliance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Stockholder Engagement    
[END TABLE]
Throughout 2018, we solicited stockholder input on a number of Company matters, including corporate strategy, and operational, financial, corporate governance and executive compensation matters to ensure that our actions are informed by the viewpoints of our stockholders. 
As a result of these conversations, we made certain governance enhancements to address feedback we received, including the following:
In addition, we regularly review and improve our pay practices to ensure they are aligned with stockholder interests. Our 2018 "say-on-pay" 96% approval vote confirmed that our stockholders concur with our compensation principles and process. 
Stockholders are urged to read the CD&A section and other information in this Proxy Statement to better understand how the Company's executive compensation program engages and aligns with the  Table of Contents
Company's short- and long-term performance and creates long-term stockholder value. In addition, the compensation program provides incentives needed to attract, reward, motivate and retain key executives who are critical to executing the Company's strategy for long-term success.

   Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting(page 6)    
[END TABLE]
Please see the Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting section beginning on page 6 for important information about the Annual Meeting. The deadlines to submit stockholder proposals for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders can be found in the "Other Business" section on page 70.  Table of Contents 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors to be used at our Annual Meeting and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. 
1.  Who is entitled to vote? How many votes am I entitled to?
Only stockholders of record as of the Record Date may vote at the Annual Meeting. According to our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, as of the Record Date, there were 119,849,670 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 1,772 stockholders, excluding 1,288,190 shares of unvested, time-based restricted stock. 
Each holder of the Company's common stock is entitled to one vote for each share recorded in his or her name on the books of the Company as of the close of business on the Record Date on any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote, except that stockholders may vote their shares cumulatively for the election of director nominees if certain conditions are met at the Annual Meeting. Cumulative voting may only be exercised at the Annual Meeting if: (i) the name of the candidate or candidates is placed in nomination prior to voting and (ii) at least one stockholder has given advance notice of his or her intention to cumulate his or her votes. 
Cumulative voting provides each stockholder with a number of votes equal to the number of directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares held by such stockholder, which such stockholder can then vote in favor of one or more director nominees. For example, if you held 100 shares as of the Record Date, you would be entitled to 1,200 votes which you could then distribute among one or more director nominees since there are twelve (12) directors to be elected. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we have not received written notice from any stockholder that he or she intends to vote his or her shares cumulatively. 
2.  What different methods can I use to vote?
 By Telephone or the Internet—Stockholders can vote their shares via telephone or the internet as instructed in the Notice. The telephone and internet procedures are designed to authenticate a stockholder's identity, to allow stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm a stockholder's instructions have been properly recorded. The telephone and internet voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 12, 2019. 
 By Mail—Stockholders that receive a paper proxy card may vote by completing, signing and dating the proxy card and mailing it in the pre-addressed envelope that accompanies the delivery of the proxy card. Proxy cards submitted by mail must be received by us prior to the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in "street name", you should check with your bank, broker or other agent and follow the voting procedures required by your bank, broker or other agent to vote your shares. 
 In Person—Shares held in your name as the stockholder of record may be voted by you in person at the Annual Meeting. Each stockholder who attends the Annual Meeting may be asked to present valid picture identification such as a driver's license or passport. Stockholders holding stock in brokerage accounts ("street name" holders) will also need to bring a copy of a brokerage account statement reflecting stock ownership as of the Record Date.  Table of Contents
3.  How many shares must be represented at the Annual Meeting to constitute a "quorum"?
A majority of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock must be present at the Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum, and there must be a quorum for the Annual Meeting to be held. If you return a signed proxy card, you will be counted as being present even if you abstain from voting. Broker non-votes (i.e., proxies from banks, brokers or other nominees indicating that such entities have not received instructions from the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote as to a matter which such bank, broker, or other nominee does not have discretionary power to vote) will also be counted as being present for purposes of determining a quorum. 
4.  What is the vote necessary to approve each of the proposals being considered at the Annual Meeting?
The election of director nominees proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director in an uncontested election (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee). As of the date of this Proxy Statement, none of the director nominees is being contested, but in a contested election (where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of director nominees to be elected) the standard for election of director nominees is a plurality of the votes cast such that the 12 director nominees receiving the greatest numbers of votes "for" would be elected as directors without regard to the number of shares voted against such director nominees. The director nominee proposal and the other proposals being considered at the Annual Meeting are set forth below. 
Broker non-votes will not have an impact on the vote on any proposal. 
5.  If I hold shares of PacWest common stock pursuant to the PacWest 401(k) Plan, will I be able to vote?
Yes. You will receive a proxy card for the shares held in your 401(k) plan account that you should return as instructed on the proxy card. 
6.  Why did I receive a Notice Regarding the Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting instead of paper copies of the proxy materials?
We sent our stockholders by mail or email a Notice containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the internet and vote online. This Notice is not a proxy card and cannot be used to vote your shares. If you received a Notice, you will not receive paper copies of the proxy  Table of Contents materials unless you request the materials by following the instructions on the Notice or on the website referred to in the Notice. 
We provided some of our stockholders with paper copies of the proxy materials instead of the Notice. If you received paper copies of the Notice or proxy materials, we encourage you to help us save money and the environment by signing up to receive all future proxy materials electronically as described below under "How can I receive my proxy materials electronically in the future?". 
7.  What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name"?
 Stockholder of Record.    If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares and the Notice is sent directly by the Company to you. If you requested printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will also receive a proxy card. 
 Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name.    If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization, then you are a beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and the Notice will be forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization how to vote the shares held in your account. 
8.  Why did I receive more than one Notice or multiple proxy cards?
You may receive more than one Notice or multiple proxy cards if you hold your shares in different ways (i.e., joint tenancy, in trust, or in custodial accounts). You should vote each proxy that you receive. 
9.  How can I receive my proxy materials electronically in the future?
To receive proxy materials electronically by email, follow the instructions described below or in the Notice. 
If you received proxy materials by mail and you would like to sign up to receive future materials electronically, please have your proxy card available and register by going to: (i) www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions for requesting meeting materials, (ii) call 1-800-579-1639, or (iii) contact your brokerage firm, bank, or other similar organization that holds your shares.

11.  May I revoke or change my vote?
You may change or revoke your vote at any time before it is counted at the Annual Meeting by:
Attending the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your prior proxy. You must comply with one of the methods indicated above in order to revoke your proxy. 
If you hold your shares in "street name", you should receive a proxy card from your bank or brokerage firm asking you how you want to vote your shares. If you do not receive a proxy card, then you should contact the bank or brokerage firm in whose name your shares are registered and obtain a proxy card from them. Please refer to the information in the materials provided by your bank or brokerage firm for an explanation of: (i) how to vote, (ii) how to change or revoke your vote and (iii) the effect of not indicating a vote. 
12.  How will voting on any other business be conducted?
Although we do not know of any business to be considered at the Annual Meeting other than the proposals listed in this Proxy Statement, if any other business is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, a submitted proxy gives authority to any of the persons named on the proxy card as your designated proxies, and each of them, to vote on such matters in his or her discretion. 
13.  Who pays the cost of soliciting proxies on behalf of the Company?
The Company pays the cost of preparing, assembling and mailing the proxy materials and soliciting proxies for the Annual Meeting. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, solicitation may be made by certain directors, officers and employees of the Company or its subsidiaries telephonically, electronically, or by other means of communication. These directors, officers and employees receive no additional compensation for their services. We will reimburse brokers and other nominees for costs incurred by them in mailing proxy materials in accordance with applicable laws. 
14.  How do I get more information about the Company?

15.  What is "householding" and how does it affect me?
Stockholders of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of the Notice unless we are notified that one or more of these stockholders wishes to receive individual copies.

      Governance Framework         
The Company is committed to a robust governance framework and we have adopted the following corporate governance best practices:
      Board Leadership Structure         
Each year, the Board evaluates the Company's board leadership structure to ensure that it remains an appropriate structure for our Company and stockholders. Our current structure provides for separate roles of the Chairman of the Board ("Chairman") and CEO, a lead independent director ("Lead Independent Director") and active, independent directors. We believe this structure provides for open communication between the Board and management and provides the oversight and safeguards necessary to operate our business successfully. 
In Mr. Eggemeyer's role as Chairman, he has responsibility for, among other things: Table of Contents
In Mr. Hosler's role as Lead Independent Director, he has considerable authority and responsibility, including the following:
      Board Attendance         
The CNG Committee regularly considers the composition of our Board to ensure there is a proper combination of skills and viewpoints. 
During 2018, the Board met nine times. The independent directors met four times in executive session during 2018, and Mr. Hosler, the Lead Independent Director, presided over these sessions. In 2018, each director attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Company's Board and the committees on which he or she served. 
Directors are encouraged, but not required, to attend the Annual Meeting. Five directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting. The Company assists in making arrangements for directors that attend the Annual Meeting and reimburses directors for reasonable expenses in connection with his or her attendance. 
      Independent Director Information         
In 2018, independent directors comprised a majority of the Board in accordance with the Company's Guidelines. At least annually, the Board, with the assistance of the CNG Committee, evaluates director independence based on the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules and regulations. 
In February 2019, the Board affirmatively determined, upon the recommendation of the CNG Committee, that each director nominee, with the exceptions of Messrs. Pieczynski and Wagner, met the independence requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards and applicable SEC rules and regulations, including the independence requirements for committee membership. In making such determinations, the Board evaluated banking, commercial, service, familial, or other transactions  Table of Contents involving each director or immediate family member and their related interests, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, if any. 
In identifying and recommending director nominees, the CNG Committee places emphasis on the "Selection of Directors" criteria in our Guidelines, namely: (i) personal qualities and characteristics, accomplishments and professional reputation; (ii) current knowledge and contacts in the communities in which the Company does business and in the banking industry or other industries relevant to the Company's business; (iii) ability and willingness to commit adequate time to Board and committee matters; (iv) the fit of the skills and personality of director nominees with those of other directors in creating a Board that is effective, collegial and responsive to the needs of the Company; (v) diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, experience and geographical location; and (vi) ability and skill set as well as other relevant experience. 
The CNG Committee does not set specific, minimum qualifications that a director nominee must meet in order for the CNG Committee to recommend the director nominee to the Board. The CNG Committee believes that each director nominee should be evaluated based on his or her individual merits taking into account the needs of the Company and the composition of the Board. The CNG Committee evaluates the composition of the Board, including whether the diversity of the Board members is appropriate to advise the Company on its risks and opportunities, through its annual Board self-evaluation process. 
The CNG Committee members may seek input from other Board members in identifying possible director nominee candidates and may, at its discretion, engage one or more search firms to assist in the recruitment of director nominee candidates. The CNG Committee will consider candidates recommended by stockholders against the same criteria as director nominees not proposed by stockholders. Stockholders who wish to submit director nominees for consideration by the CNG Committee for election at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "2020 Annual Meeting") should follow the process detailed in the section entitled "—Other Business—Director Nominations" on page 71. 
      Board Committees         
Risk Committee 
The Board delegates authority to the Risk Committee to oversee specific, risk-related issues while facilitating Board comprehension of the Company's overall risk tolerance and enterprise-wide risk management activities and their effectiveness. The Risk Committee approves and periodically reviews the Company's enterprise-wide risk management policies and oversees the implementation of the Company's enterprise-wide risk management framework, including the strategies, policies, procedures and systems established by management to identify, assess, measure and manage the Company's material risk categories, including credit and liquidity risk. 
The Risk Committee also serves as a resource to management and its committees including, but not limited to, the Enterprise Risk Management Steering Committee, the Credit Committees, the Model Governance Committee and the Capital Committee in overseeing risk across the Company. The responsibilities of the Risk Committee include, among other things: Table of Contents
The Company's CRO, CCO, CFO and Executive Vice President, Operations & Systems Administration report on a quarterly basis to the Risk Committee, or more frequently as needed, regarding areas within their supervision that pertain to the Company's risk profile.

Management is responsible for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls and procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. The independent auditors are responsible for planning and carrying out an audit of the Company's annual financial statements, reviewing the Company's quarterly financial statements prior to the filing of each quarterly report on Form 10-Q, annually reporting on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and other procedures. Our independent auditors, KPMG LLP and its team members have extensive, long-term knowledge of the Company and the banking industry.  Table of Contents
The Board determined that the following nominees to the Audit Committee are financially literate and that each of Ms. Lester and Messrs. Burke, Carlson, Hosler, Molvar and Yung is qualified as an audit committee financial expert with accounting or related financial management expertise, in each case in accordance with the SEC rules and the NASDAQ listing standards. The biographies of each director nominee, including the background and experience of Ms. Lester and each of Messrs. Burke, Carlson, Hosler, Molvar and Yung, are under the section titled "Proposal 1: Election of Directors" beginning on page 20. Information regarding the functions performed by the Audit Committee can be found in the "Audit Committee Report" included in this Proxy Statement and in the Audit Committee charter. 
A copy of our Audit Committee charter, last approved by the Board in February 2019, may be obtained on the Company's website at  www.pacwestbancorp.com under the section titled "Corporate Governance". During 2018, the Audit Committee met 15 times. 
Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee 
The CNG Committee reviews, approves and makes recommendations to the Board on matters concerning the compensation and benefits, including equity compensation, of the Company's executive officers, directors and employees. The CNG Committee is responsible for the creation of compensation principles and processes that are designed to balance risk and reward in a way that does not encourage unnecessary risk taking by our employees. The CNG Committee also ensures that our compensation programs are competitive and aligned with our stockholders' long-term interests. The responsibilities of the CNG Committee include, among other things:
The CNG Committee assists the Board in promoting the best interests of the Company and its stockholders through the implementation of sound corporate governance principles and practices, which helps to frame our organization-wide risk management policies, including oversight of the Company's Stock Ownership and Clawback Policy (the "Stock Ownership Policy"). 
For further information with respect to the Company's processes and procedures in the consideration and determination of director compensation, please see the section titled "Director Compensation" on page 21. For further information with respect to the Company's processes and procedures in the  Table of Contents consideration and determination of executive compensation, please see the CD&A section beginning on page 31. 
A copy of our CNG Committee charter, last approved by the Board in February 2019, may be obtained on the Company's website at  www.pacwestbancorp.com under the section titled "Corporate Governance". During 2018, the CNG Committee met five times. 
Executive Committee 
The primary purpose of the Executive Committee is to meet when it is impractical for the full Board to meet and act on behalf of the Board, subject to such limitations as the Board, the Executive Committee charter and applicable law may impose. In addition, the Executive Committee is a forum to review other significant matters, including strategic opportunities, not addressed by the other Board committees and to make appropriate recommendations to the Board. 
A copy of our Executive Committee charter, last approved by the Board in February 2019, may be obtained on the Company's website at  www.pacwestbancorp.com under the section titled "Corporate Governance". During 2018, the Executive Committee met once. 
      Board's Role in Risk Oversight         
We believe that effective risk management is of primary importance to the success of our Company because our business exposes us to credit, interest rate and price, liquidity, operations, information technology, compliance, strategic, reputation, human resources and capital risks. As a result, we have a comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management process that monitors, measures, evaluates and manages these risks. 
The Board is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk management processes and effectively challenging management's strategic initiatives. The Board's risk management oversight is managed through the responsibilities of the following Board standing committees: (i) the Risk Committee, (ii) the ALM Committee, (iii) the Audit Committee and (iv) the CNG Committee. Each of these committees is responsible for monitoring risks within their areas of responsibility as well as Company risks. Each committee reports to the Board and has the responsibility for ensuring that overall risk awareness and risk management is appropriate. Our RAS establishes the Company's risk appetite and tolerance for each of our core risk pillars referenced above as well as it details the policies and procedures for assessing, measuring and controlling these risks. Management has identified several key risk and performance indicators that are tracked quarterly and reported to the Board through a risk dashboard. 
The Board engages in regular risk-management discussions with the CEO; CFO; CCO; CRO; CAE; Executive Vice President, Operations & Systems Administration; Executive Vice President, Human Resources; Executive Vice President, General Counsel; and other Company officers as the Board may deem appropriate. 
As a general matter, except for cases in which a particular committee may choose to meet in executive session, all Board members are invited (but not required) to attend the regular meetings of all Board committees. We believe that this open and collaborative structure provides for a more informed Board and helps the Board understand and monitor internal and external risks. 
Company management is responsible for day-to-day risk management. Our Internal Audit, Risk Management, Information Technology, Human Resources, Legal, Accounting, Finance and Treasury departments, among others, monitor compliance with Company-wide policies and procedures and the day-to-day risk management of the Company. We believe that this approach to risk management adequately addresses the Company risks.  Table of Contents
      Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions         
Related-Party Transactions Policy 
The RPT Policy prohibits Related-Party Transactions unless they are approved or ratified by the Audit Committee. The Board-approved RPT Policy governs the approval of a related-party transaction ("RPT"). A RPT includes any transaction involving:
These transactions need to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. Such transactions do not include, however, indemnification payments or compensation paid to directors and executive officers for their services as directors and executive officers. 
Our General Counsel, in consultation with management and outside counsel, analyzes all potential RPTs to determine whether a transaction constitutes a RPT. If a transaction is a RPT, the Audit Committee will review the transaction to determine whether to approve the transaction. In making its determination, the Audit Committee considers several factors including, but not limited to:
Any member of the Audit Committee that has an interest in a transaction under review must abstain from voting on the RPT, but may, if the Audit Committee Chairperson requests, participate in the Audit Committee's discussion of the transaction. 
During 2018, the Bank provided a revolving line of credit, with a limit of $5 million, to an entity in which Mr. Yung is the executive chairman and has an ownership interest of approximately 3%. Interest income and fees associated with this revolving line of credit were $192,874 for the year ended December 31, 2018. The principal balance of this revolving line of credit varied in 2018 and was $2,709,560 as of December 31, 2018.  Table of Contents
      Family Relationships         
There are no family relationships among any of the directors or executive officers of the Company. 
      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation         
During 2018, Messrs. Burke, Hosler, Molvar and Stine served on the CNG Committee. None of these current directors was formerly, or during 2018, an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. 
No executive officer of the Company serves on the board of directors of any other company that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the CNG Committee. In addition, no executive officer of the Company serves as a member of the compensation committee of the board of any other company that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of the Board of Directors or the CNG Committee. No such interlocking relationships existed during 2018.  Table of Contents 
      Nominees         
The Board is currently composed of 12 directors, of which 11 directors were elected at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
      2018 Annual Meeting Director Nominee Vote         
One director, Ms. Tanya Acker, did not receive a majority of votes cast at the 2018 Annual Meeting. 
The Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws and Corporate Governance Guidelines each provides that any nominee for director who receives a greater number of "against" votes than "for" votes shall promptly tender his or her resignation following certification of the vote for consideration by the CNG Committee. At the 2018 Annual Meeting, Ms. Acker received a greater number of "against" votes than "for" votes and, accordingly, she tendered her resignation to the Board on May 15, 2018, following certification of the vote. 
The CNG Committee promptly considered Ms. Acker's tendered resignation and recommended to the Board not to accept the resignation. In considering whether to recommend that the Board accept or reject Ms. Acker's tendered resignation, the CNG Committee evaluated the best interests of stockholders and the Company and considered all factors it believed relevant, including, without limitation: (a) the reasons Ms. Acker did not receive the required vote and whether the underlying cause or causes were curable; (b) the expertise Ms. Acker brings to the Board through her experience as an attorney and arbitrator and as a director of several nonprofit organizations and particularly in the areas of legal and regulatory matters, risk management and strategic planning; and (c) feedback the Company received from a number of its stockholders as a result of the Company's outreach to stockholders in respect of this matter. In addition, the CNG Committee considered that over 48% of the votes cast by stockholders were for Ms. Acker to remain on the Board. 
The CNG Committee determined that the primary factor that led to the negative vote for Ms. Acker was the negative recommendation by Institutional Shareholder Services based upon Ms. Acker's failure to attend at least 75% of the 2017 Board meetings. Ms. Acker's failure to meet the 75% standard was excused due to her inability to attend some of the meetings due to prior commitments that could not be rescheduled as well as certain meetings that were scheduled on short notice. Ms. Acker, however, attended all in-person meetings. In addition, Ms. Acker missed the 75% standard by 2 percentage points (having attended 73% of the Board meetings). During 2018, Ms. Acker attended 100% of the Board meetings. 
The Board acted on the recommendation of the CNG Committee and rejected Ms. Acker's resignation and reaffirmed her appointment as a director. As a result, Ms. Acker continued to serve as a director in 2018. 
Ms. Acker did not participate in the deliberations by the CNG Committee or the Board with regard to her tendered resignation. 
In response to the vote, the Board took action to ensure attendance by Board members of at least 75% of all Board and committee meetings including ensuring that the Company's Board calendar accommodated the schedules of all Board members. In addition, the General Counsel reviewed Board attendance throughout the year to ensure attendance compliance.  Table of Contents
The 12 director nominees have been recommended by the CNG Committee and approved by the Board as nominees for election to serve as directors of the Company until the 2020 Annual Meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified. All director nominees are current directors. 
      Director Core Competencies         
Our Board members represent a mix of experience, tenure, diversity, leadership, skills and qualifications in areas of importance to our Company. The CNG Committee believes the following director qualifications are the most important to oversee the interests of our Company: 
      Vote Required         
In an uncontested election, a director must be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to him or her (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee). In a contested election (a situation in which the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the standard for election of directors will be a plurality of the votes cast such that the nominees receiving the greatest number of votes "for" will be elected as directors without regard to the number of shares voted "against" such nominee. 
A director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation to the Board. The CNG Committee will consider the resignation and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the CNG Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale within 90 days from the date the election results are certified. A director who failed to receive a majority of the votes cast will not participate in the Board's decision. 
With respect to the election of directors, absent any specific instruction in the proxies solicited by the Board, the proxies will be voted in the sole discretion of the proxy holders to effect the election of all 12 of the Board's nominees. In the event that any of the Board's nominees are unable to serve as directors, it is intended that each proxy will be voted for the election of such substitute nominees, if any, as shall be designated by the Board. The Company has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable to serve as directors. 
The PacWest Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" all of the director nominees listed below.
      Director Compensation         
The CNG Committee evaluates director compensation and compares the Company's director compensation to that offered by peer companies. The CNG Committee recommends to the Board non-employee director compensation and the Board determines director compensation for each fiscal year. The compensation is designed to attract and retain qualified directors and to compensate them for the time and risk associated with being a director. The Company reimburses its directors for reasonable travel, lodging, food and other expenses incurred in connection with their service on the  Table of Contents
Board and Board committees. In 2018, the CNG Committee engaged an independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer, to perform a competitive assessment with respect to total non-employee director compensation, including Lead Independent Director compensation and Chairman of the Board compensation, equity grant levels, and non-employee director stock ownership guidelines. Based on Pearl Meyer's recommendations, the CNG Committee did not increase director cash retainers or annual equity grants. 2018 director compensation was as follows: 
      Stock Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors         
In an effort to ensure that the interests of our non-employee directors are aligned with our stockholders, the Company established non-employee director stock ownership guidelines that require non-employee directors to own shares equal to five times their annual cash retainer. Executive officers, including those serving as directors, are subject to stock ownership guidelines as more particularly described below. Non-employee directors are expected to meet this requirement within five years of the later of May 16, 2016 or the date of their election or appointment to the Board. If the compliance date were the Record Date, other than the two directors who joined the Board in 2016 and 2017, all of the non-employee director nominees meet the stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors. 
The table below presents all compensation paid to Company non-employee directors who served during 2018:

Our governance approach has evolved over time to ensure alignment with Company performance and continued stockholder value creation, including the following: Table of Contents
In 2018, we received a 96% "say-on-pay" approval vote evidencing stockholder concurrence with our compensation principles and process. Continued enhancements to the Company's compensation program demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that our executive compensation program aligns executive compensation with the Company's short-term and long-term performance and stockholder interests. At the same time, we are providing the compensation and incentives needed to attract, reward, motivate and retain key executives. 
      Compensation Decisions         
Over the last several years, we made changes to our executive compensation program to ensure that our NEO's base salaries, annual incentives (annual cash bonus) and equity compensation continues to be aligned with Company performance. Below is a summary of 2018 NEO compensation decisions:
      Compensation Philosophy and Objectives         
The CNG Committee administers the Company's compensation program and incentive plans, including the EIC Plan. The EIC Plan is designed to: (i) align executive compensation with the Company's short-term and long-term performance, (ii) enhance and reinforce the Company's goals of profitable growth, (iii) continue sound overall financial practices and (iv) continue creating stockholder value. 
The CNG Committee reviews executive compensation levels paid by peer companies across a range of asset sizes based on available data. Key elements of NEO and other executive officer compensation include pay out following the achievement of pre-determined financial and non-financial objectives. The CNG Committee intends to pay at the high end of the range among its peer group for total compensation only if the Company performs at the high end of the range among its peers.  Table of Contents
Our compensation program is best supported by the following philosophy and objectives:

      2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—Pay Mix         
As highlighted below, a material portion of the total compensation opportunity for each of our executives, including our NEOs, is directly tied to financial performance factors that measure our success relative to compensation plan performance goals and peers. Accordingly, approximately half of executive compensation is at risk depending on Company performance. The Company believes that its executive compensation program balances risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage imprudent risk-taking. 
      2018 Executive Compensation Decisions         
Base Salary 
NEO base salaries are set at levels that are intended to reflect the competitive marketplace in attracting, retaining, motivating and rewarding high performing executives. In determining base salaries, the CNG Committee considers the following elements: (i) individual performance based on experience and scope of responsibility, (ii) non-financial performance indicators including strategic developments for which an executive has responsibility and managerial performance, (iii) structure and complexity of the Company, (iv) compensation paid by peers, (v) functionality of the executive management team, (vi) economic conditions in the Company's market areas and (vii) analyses or guidance from consultants during the annual review process. 
With the exception of Mr. Wagner, whose base salary is determined by the Board, the CNG Committee is responsible for setting the NEOs' base salaries. The base salaries are intended to compensate the NEOs for the day-to-day services performed for the Company.  Table of Contents 
Below are changes to NEO base salaries from 2017 to 2018.

Annual Cash Incentive Bonus 
Annual cash incentive bonuses are granted under the EIC Plan based solely on the achievement of certain pre-established performance targets. The EIC Plan performance targets generally represent an increase in the performance target over the previous fiscal year, a significant achievement in a given economic environment, or meaningful goals that balance the performance of the Company and return to stockholders with prudent risk management. Financial performance targets corresponding to achievement of a payout equal to a participant's target incentive are set at levels equal to the Company's budgeted financial performance for the current fiscal year. 
The performance measures and corresponding award opportunities are not determined by the CNG Committee based on any set formula or pre-determined methodology, but, instead, reflect the CNG Committee's review of data and, in some cases, recommendations from its independent compensation consultant as well as subjective determinations made by the CNG Committee with respect to the appropriate incentives to encourage management to focus on the profitability, targeted growth and Company risk management. It is possible that not all NEOs and other EIC participants will receive an annual cash incentive bonus. 
In February 2018, the CNG Committee, and the Board in the case of Mr. Wagner, established the 2018 Company performance measures, required achievement levels and corresponding award opportunities for each executive officer eligible under the EIC Plan. The CNG Committee and the Board reviewed and monitored these measures and levels throughout 2018. The target award opportunities are determined based upon the executive officer's position, responsibilities and historical and expected contributions to the Company and are equal to a percentage of that executive officer's base salary earned at year end. Below are the EIC Plan target award opportunities for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         CEO                  150% of Base Salary 
 Other Executive Officers   100% of Base Salary

The CNG Committee confirmed the required Earnings Per Share ("EPS") performance levels and pay outs and the ranges for average core deposit and average net loan growth were appropriate and properly aligned executive incentive compensation to stockholder interests. In addition, these  Table of Contents metrics were critical in assessing Company success. Below are the approved 2018 Company executive officer target performance measures, weights and corresponding award opportunities:

   Equity Compensation         
   Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") Compensation Plan Overview 
We provide a meaningful portion of NEO compensation in the form of long-term, equity incentive compensation. The CNG Committee grants PRSUs and TRSAs to align NEO performance with Company objectives to create long-term stockholder value. Equity awards granted to Company executive officers may be granted from time to time at the discretion of the CNG Committee, and equity awards granted to the CEO are based on the recommendation of the CNG Committee and approval of the Board. The timing and amount of equity awards is based on the Company's performance, the executive officer's position and the executive officer's experience in that role. In considering whether to approve the grant of an equity award and the value of the grant to be awarded, the CNG Committee considers, among other things, with respect to the executive officer, the salary level and the executive's expected contributions toward the strategic growth, financial strength, risk management and profitability of the Company. 
The LTI program provides for 50% of an executive's annual equity compensation to be in the form of PRSUs and the other 50% of an executive's annual equity compensation to be in the form of TRSAs. The CEO, CFO and other executive officer's target equity compensation is 300%, 200% and 150%, respectively of their respective base salaries. The Company did not make changes to its PRSU or TRSA grant structure in 2018. The Company concluded that the PRSU and TRSA grants continued to align executive compensation with the Company's long-term market and financial performance and creation of long-term stockholder value. TRSAs vest ratably over four years from the date of grant, and PRSUs will vest only if performance goals with respect to Relative TSR, EPS growth, or ROAA (defined below) are met over the performance period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020 (the "2018 Performance Period"). 
Unvested PRSUs will participate with common stock in any dividends declared and paid only on the shares which ultimately vest, if any, at the end of the 2018 Performance Period. Unvested TRSAs are entitled to receive any dividends on a current basis. In paying dividends on unvested TRSAs, the CNG Committee and the Board determined that such payments are consistent with the Company's overall goals of tying executive compensation to the performance of the Company and aligning management interests with those of the Company's stockholders. For many of the Company's key executives, the dividends represent a meaningful component of their compensation. Further, such dividends are evaluated in connection with the granting of TRSAs and determination of an executive officer's overall compensation.  Table of Contents
The TRSAs and PRSUs granted to the Company's NEOs in 2018 were as follows:

   2018 PRSU Grants 
In February 2018, the CNG Committee set performance targets for a three-year performance cycle for the 2018 PRSU grants. The 2018 PRSU grants are for the 2018 Performance Period. At the end of the 2018 Performance Period, PRSUs will only vest if Company results meet or exceed the performance thresholds set at the beginning of the 2018 Performance Period. The number of shares vested by an executive depends on the achievement of three financial metrics:
The CNG Committee considers these performance metrics to be key measures of the Company's financial performance based on analysis of the correlation of these financial metrics to TSR, noting the metrics are consistent with those metrics used by peers. The following tables reflect the key financial measures, weightings and performance standards that the CNG Committee set for the 2018 Performance Period.

   2016 PRSU Grants—Achievement of Performance  Objectives 
The 2016 PRSUs granted to the NEOs (other than Mr. Boulden) on February 10, 2016 were based on a performance period beginning January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 (the "2016 Performance Period"). The table below details the 2016 PRSU performance measures, weightings, targets, results, percentage of target achieved and percentage of 2016 PRSUs earned: 
Based on the weightings of the performance measures and 2016 Performance Period results, each NEO (other than Mr. Boulden) earned PRSUs equal to 92% of the total number of PRSUs granted to each NEO. As a result, on February 10, 2019, Messrs. Wagner, Rusnak, Pieczynski and Corsini vested in 42,719, 18,985, 31,642 and 11,867, respectively, shares of common stock. In addition, each of Messrs. Wagner, Rusnak, Pieczynski and Corsini each earned cumulative dividends on the vested shares equal to $269,130, $119,606, $199,345 and $74,762, respectively. 
Decision Making Process  
Role of the CNG Committee 
The CNG Committee oversees the NEO executive compensation program and is comprised of independent, non-employee members of the Board. The CNG Committee works closely with its independent compensation consultant and senior management to examine the effectiveness of the Company's NEO executive compensation program throughout the year. As discussed above, details about the CNG Committee can be found in "—Board Committees—Compensation, Nominating and Governance Committee" on page 16.  Table of Contents 
The CNG Committee has not established a policy or target for the allocation between cash and non-cash or short-term and long-term compensation. Rather, the CNG Committee undertakes a subjective analysis in light of the philosophy and objectives described in this CD&A and, in connection with its analysis, reviews and considers information provided by its independent compensation consultant and surveys to determine the appropriate level and mix of base compensation, performance-based pay and other elements of compensation. 
The CNG Committee makes all final NEO compensation and equity award decisions except for the CEO, whose compensation is determined by the independent members of the Board based upon the recommendation of the CNG Committee. 
Role of Senior Management 
Members of our senior management team attend regular meetings in which executive compensation, Company performance, individual performance and competitive compensation levels and practices are discussed and evaluated. Only the CNG Committee members can vote on decisions regarding NEO compensation. The CEO does not participate in the deliberations of the CNG Committee with respect to his compensation. 
The CEO, CFO, CRO, General Counsel and Executive Vice President, Human Resources comprise the Incentive Plan Compensation Committee ("IPC"). The IPC is responsible for evaluating all incentive-based compensation plans as they pertain to certain Company employee groups. The IPC regularly reviews Company performance, our compensation philosophy and objectives, trends, regulatory developments and other topics. IPC's review confirmed that our incentive compensation plans encourage behavior that is within the Company's risk tolerance, are compatible with effective controls and risk management and are supported by strong corporate governance. 
Role of the Independent Consultant  
The CNG Committee has the authority to engage and retain an independent compensation consultant to provide independent counsel and advice. The CNG Committee engages an independent compensation consultant no less than once every three years, when there is a significant change in the Company or when meaningful changes to compensation or the Company's compensation program are proposed. The CNG Committee reviews both compensation and performance of peer companies as just one among several factors to inform its decision-making process so it can set total compensation levels commensurate with the Company's performance and strategic initiatives. 
In 2018, the CNG Committee engaged Pearl Meyer as the independent compensation consultant after an extensive review process conducted by the CNG Committee. The CNG Committee engaged Pearl Meyer to review the Company's peer group and executive officer compensation programs, including its short- and long-term incentive programs to ensure that each program, among other things, continued to be aligned with stockholder interests. Pearl Meyer reviewed: (i) a peer group of 19 publicly-traded financial institutions generally representing banks with assets between $20 billion to $43 billion (shown below) and (ii) published survey data. 
In addition, at the request of the CNG Committee, Pearl Meyer met with members of management to gather information with respect to management proposals and recommendations to be presented to the CNG Committee. 
In addition, the CNG Committee assessed the independence of Pearl Meyer in 2018 as required under NYSE listing rules. The CNG Committee considered and assessed all relevant factors including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in Rule 10C-1(b)(4)(i) through (vi) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") that could give rise to a  Table of Contents potential conflict of interest with respect to the compensation consultant described above. Based on this review, we are not aware of any conflict of interest raised by the work performed by Pearl Meyer that would prevent the consultant from serving as an independent compensation consultant to the CNG Committee. 
      Peer Group         
Each year, we review our peer group to ensure our compensation is being benchmarked to comparable companies considering industry, financial and operational similarities. In late 2017, upon review of the 2017 peer group, the CNG Committee determined no changes were required to the 19 publicly-traded companies to serve as the peer group for the purposes of setting compensation for 2018. The 2018 peer group included the following companies: 
The companies comprising the peer group generally have similar business models and are within comparable size ranges (i.e, total assets, market capitalization, revenue). In June 2018, Pearl Meyer conducted a comprehensive review of the Company's prior compensation peer group and proposed adjustments for consideration by the CNG Committee and management. Following this review, it was determined that for purposes of setting compensation for 2019, four of the prior peers would be replaced with companies that were determined to be more relevant from size and business model perspectives:
      Best Practices Compensation Matters         
Our executive compensation programs incorporate many best practices, including the ones described below. 
We Can Clawback Incentive Compensation 
If we restate our financial statements, or a financial statement or the calculation of a performance goal or metric is materially inaccurate, the CNG Committee, in its sole discretion, may require recoupment from our executive officers, including our NEOs, of the portion of any annual or long-term cash or equity-based incentive or bonus compensation paid, provided, or awarded to any executive officer on or after December 11, 2014 that represents the excess over what would have been paid if such event had not occurred.  Table of Contents
We Require Minimum Levels of Stock Ownership by Our Executives 
Our executive Stock Ownership Policy require the CEO and our executive officers to accumulate a meaningful position in Company shares. Our stock ownership requirement for our CEO and our executive officers is tied to a multiple of base salary as noted below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
         CEO                  5.0 
 Other Executive Officers   3.0 
[END TABLE]
An executive officer is required to achieve the stock ownership necessary to meet the requirements within five years of the later of December 11, 2014 or the date of becoming subject to the requirements. As of the Record Date, the CEO and seven other executive officers satisfied these requirements. Four executive officers have not yet satisfied these requirements but are expected to be in compliance with the Stock Ownership Policy by his or her applicable compliance date. We believe that the Stock Ownership Policy results in significant common stock ownership by our executive officers and aligns their interests with our stockholders. 
Stock ownership is determined from the totals on Table 1 of Form 4 "Statement of Changes in Beneficial Ownership of Securities" as filed by the Company with the SEC on behalf of the Company's executive officers. Unvested TRSAs and outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights (whether or not vested) are not included in the total number of shares to determine stock ownership under the Stock Ownership Policy. The value of an executive officer's shares of common stock is determined by multiplying his or her total number of shares by the highest Company share price in the preceding 52-week period. The Stock Ownership Policy may be waived in the discretion of the CNG Committee based upon bona fide personal financial need or hardship, other special circumstances, or if compliance would prevent an executive officer from complying with law, regulation or a court order. Compliance with the Stock Ownership Policy is determined annually by the CNG Committee. 
We Prohibit Excise Tax Gross-Up Payments 
Our Executive Severance Pay Plan (the "Severance Pay Plan") prohibits excise tax gross-up payments. Specifically, payments made in connection with the Severance Pay Plan, as amended, will be cut back to amounts that do not exceed the safe harbor provisions of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"). 
We Have Double-Trigger Change of Control Provisions for Our Equity Awards 
In the event of a change of control, equity awards will vest if within two years after the change in control, the recipient of the award is terminated from employment without cause or terminates employment for good reason (i.e., if his or her job duties have been significantly diminished) ("double-trigger" vesting). The terms of our equity awards granted prior to 2014 provided that the awards would vest immediately upon a change in control ("single-trigger" vesting). 
We Do Not Have Employment Contracts 
Our executive officers do not have employment contracts and are "at-will" employees who may be terminated at our discretion, subject to compliance with the Severance Pay Plan, if applicable. We believe this provides greater flexibility in our employment arrangements with our executive officers.  Table of Contents
We Have an Anti-Hedging Policy 
The Company's Insider Trading Policy prohibits all directors, executive officers and certain other employees (collectively, an "Insider") from purchasing financial instruments designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Company's shares. We believe that these instruments result in the Insider no longer being exposed to the full risks of ownership. 
We Do Not Have SERPs or Deferred Compensation Arrangements 
We have chosen not to provide our executive officers with retirement benefits such as supplemental executive retirement plans or deferred compensation arrangements. 
401(k) Plan 
Our 401(k) Plan allows executives and other participants to defer a portion of their compensation and, in 2018, the Company provided participants a match of 50% of contributions up to 6% of their base salaries, subject to IRS limitations. We currently have no tax-deferred compensation plans for our executive officers other than our 401(k) Plan. 
Other Benefits 
Our compensation process focuses our executives on goals and objectives that are in the best interests of the Company and stockholders. Other than certain perquisites to our executive officers such as an automobile allowance or use of a company vehicle, reimbursement of relocation expenses, reimbursement of club dues for clubs that are used frequently for business purposes and life, disability and long- term care insurance, the Company does not provide any other compensation benefits. In 2018, the Company provided limited use of an aircraft to Mr. Wagner for personal reasons. This service was afforded to Mr. Wagner to reduce travel time and related disruptions and to provide additional security to Mr. Wagner, thereby increasing his availability, efficiency and productivity. Income related to this benefit is imputed to Mr. Wagner for income tax purposes and he is not provided a tax reimbursement. 
In 2018, Messrs. Wagner and Rusnak received certain benefits to compensate them for relocating to the Company's Greenwood Village, Colorado office. These benefits are paid under the terms of the Company's Relocation Allowance Policy (the "Relocation Policy"), including the costs of selling existing housing or exiting an existing lease, moving expenses, temporary living expenses and other expenses detailed in the Relocation Policy. 
      Tax Deductibility of Compensation         
Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits the deductibility of compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million during a year. The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation was (for the Company's case) repealed with the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, effective for years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the group of covered executive officers has been expanded to include the CFO (as well as any individual that was a covered executive officer for any taxable year after December 31, 2016). Therefore, compensation (including performance-based compensation) paid to covered executive officers in excess of $1 million in calendar year 2018 and subsequent calendar years generally will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief. The CNG Committee continues to consider the tax consequences when determining NEO compensation, including in light of the changes to Section 162(m).  Table of Contents
      Calculation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures         
We use tangible book value per share and return on tangible equity, non-GAAP financial measures, to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's financial performance and to enhance investor's overall understanding of such financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain intangible assets. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in the following tables.

      Potential Payments on Termination and Change in Control         
Change in Control for the Severance Pay Plan 
The Company has a Severance Pay Plan in which the NEOs participate. The Severance Pay Plan is a "double trigger" plan that provides severance to participants on a termination of employment by a participant for Good Reason (defined below) or by the Company other than for Just Cause (defined below) on or within two years of a Change in Control (defined below). Under those circumstances, each NEO is entitled to: (i) his or her accrued base salary and benefits through termination, (ii) the pro rata target annual incentive for the year in which the termination occurs, (iii) a designated multiple (three times for Mr. Wagner and two times for the other NEOs) of the NEOs annual compensation (annual base salary plus annual target incentive, automobile allowance and club dues) and (iv) continued medical, dental and vision coverage for the NEO and his or her dependents for the number of years corresponding to the participant's severance multiple, unless the participant obtains other health coverage. 
Our Severance Pay Plan prohibits excise tax gross-up payments and provides that payments made in connection with the plan will be cut back to amounts that do not exceed the safe harbor provisions of Section 280G of the Code. In consideration for the severance, a participant will be subject to a non-solicitation covenant following any termination of his or her employment for the number of years corresponding to the participant's severance multiple. The Severance Pay Plan is administered by the Company's CNG Committee. 
The relevant definitions under the Severance Pay Plan are summarized as follows:
In addition, all unvested TRSA and PRSU awards are subject to "double-trigger", accelerated vesting upon the occurrence of a "change-in-control" and the NEO's termination of employment by the Company without "Just Cause" or by the NEO for "Good Reason", in each case, on or before the second anniversary of the change in control. In the TRSA and PRSU award agreements, "change-in-control" generally means: (i) the consummation of a plan of dissolution or liquidation of the Company; (ii) the incumbent board members cease to constitute at least two-thirds of the Company's Board; (iii) the consummation of a plan of reorganization, merger or consolidation involving the Company, if the Company's stockholders do not hold at least 70% of the combined  Table of Contents voting power of the resulting company of the individuals who were members of the Company's incumbent Board do not constitute at least two-thirds of the Board of the resulting Company; (iv) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (v) the acquisition by another person of stock representing more than 50% of the Company's then outstanding voting power. 
The following table sets forth the potential payments that may be made to the NEOs upon a termination in connection with a Change in Control or otherwise. Except as described pursuant to the Severance Pay Plan, there are no agreements, arrangements or plans that entitle executive officers to severance, perquisites or other enhanced benefits upon termination of their employment. Any agreement to provide such payments or benefits to a terminated executive officer (other than following a qualifying termination on or within two years of a change in control) would be in the discretion of the CNG Committee. The payments calculated below are based on the executive's salary as of December 31, 2018 and assume a qualifying termination on December 31, 2018.  Table of Contents

Upon a Change in Control defined above, each PRSU will: (i) be deemed earned at the target level with respect to all open performance periods if the Change in Control occurs within six months after the grant date, and (ii) be deemed earned at the actual performance level as of the date of the Change in Control if a change in control occurs more than six months after the grant date. In both cases, the PRSU will not be subject to any further performance conditions (and the number of PRSUs earned will be treated as the number of units that are outstanding, including for purposes of a  Table of Contents subsequent vesting event), but will be subject to time-based service vesting following the Change in Control in accordance with the original performance period.  
PRSUs and TRSAs accelerate vesting and vest in full with PRSUs performance deemed achieved (i) at target level with respect to all open performance periods if death occurs during the performance period, and (ii) at the actual performance level if death occurs after the end of the performance period but before the vesting date. 
For a termination at December 31, 2018:
See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions" beginning on page 35 of this Proxy Statement for more information regarding the award opportunities under the EIC Plan during 2018.  
The change in control termination benefits for all of our NEO's are subject to reduction to the extent that they exceed the safe harbor amount calculated under Section 280G of the Code. At December 31, 2018, none of our NEOs change in control termination benefits would be reduced due to Section 280G of the Code.  Table of Contents 
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are seeking advisory (non-binding) stockholder approval of the compensation of our NEOs. 
Our stockholders approved our 2018 "say-on-pay" vote as a result of a number of actions we took to strengthen our corporate governance to more closely align our executive compensation program with the Company's performance and to make our compensation program more responsive to stockholder interests, including:
Over the past several years, we have continued to enhance our compensation programs as a result of continued stockholder engagement, including this proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, that gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on the compensation of our NEOs. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather to present our overall compensation philosophy and objectives with respect to our NEOs. Accordingly, your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit any existing compensation or award arrangement of any of our NEOs. 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Board or the Company. The CNG Committee, however, values the opinions expressed by stockholders in their vote on this proposal and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for NEOs. The Board believes that the compensation of the Company's NEOs is appropriate and should be approved on an advisory basis by the Company's stockholders as more particularly outlined in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 31. 
The PacWest Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" approval of the compensation paid to the Company's NEOs as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion.
      CEO Pay Ratio         
The Company believes executive pay should be aligned with our employees to create stockholder value. Annually, the CNG Committee reviews the amounts paid to our CEO as compared to amounts paid to all employees. 
Set forth below is the annual total compensation of our median employee, the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Wagner, and the ratio of those two amounts: Table of Contents
Our CEO-to-median employee pay ratio is calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC. The rules for determining the pay ratio based on the median employee's annual total compensation allow companies to utilize different methodologies that reflect their employment and compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to our pay ratio. To determine the median employee, we used the following methodology:
The results were sorted from lowest total compensation to highest total compensation to determine the median employee. After identifying the median employee, the Company calculated the 2018 annual total compensation for both our median employee and our CEO using the same methodology that the Company used to calculate the CEO's annual total compensation for the "2018 NEO Summary Compensation Table" in this Proxy Statement and as further described below as applicable:
The CEO's total compensation is divided by the total compensation of the median employee to determine the CEO pay ratio.    Table of Contents

The Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of: (i) the quality and integrity of the Company's financial statements, (ii) the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, (iii) the independent auditors' qualifications and independence, (iv) the performance of the independent auditors and the Company's internal audit function and (v) in conjunction with the Risk Committee, the Company's risk management functions. The Audit Committee also assists in deciding whether to appoint, retain or terminate the Company's independent auditors and pre-approves all audit, audit-related and other services, if any, to be provided by the independent auditors. 
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation and integrity of the Company's financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, the Company's accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and internal controls and the procedures that provide for compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Our independent auditors are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's annual financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and expressing an opinion as to the conformity of such financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, reviewing the Company's quarterly financial statements prior to the filing of each quarterly report on Form 10-Q and annually reporting on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and other procedures. 
During 2018, the Audit Committee performed all of its duties and responsibilities under the Audit Committee charter. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 with management and the independent auditors. The Audit Committee also discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by applicable requirements of PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee as well as by SEC regulations. 
The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also discussed auditor independence with the independent auditors. 
Based upon the reports and discussions described above and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee referred to above and in the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company for 2018 be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee adopted a policy that requires advance approval by the Audit Committee of all audit, audit-related, tax and all other services performed by the independent auditors. During 2018, the Audit Committee pre-approved all audit services, non-audit services, audit-related services and tax services performed by KPMG LLP on behalf of the Company. In approving any non-audit services, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of such services would be compatible with maintaining the independence of KPMG LLP.  Table of Contents
The Company's Audit Committee appointed the firm of KPMG LLP as independent auditors for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and is submitting its selection for ratification by our stockholders. KPMG LLP has served as the independent auditors for the Company or its predecessors since 1982. Subject to the matters discussed under the section entitled "Audit Committee Report", the Audit Committee carefully considered the firm's qualifications as independent auditors for the Company, including a review of the qualifications of the engagement team, the quality control procedures the firm has established and any issues raised by the most recent quality control review of the firm. The Audit Committee's review also included the matters regarding auditor independence discussed under the section entitled "Audit Committee Report", including whether the nature and extent of non-audit services would impair the independence of the auditors. Services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by KPMG LLP during fiscal year 2018 are described under the section titled "Independent Auditor Fees" above. 
The Company's organizational documents do not require that stockholders ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as independent auditors. The Company is seeking stockholder approval because the Board believes it is a matter of good corporate governance practice. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP, then the Audit Committee may consider the appointment of other independent auditors, but is not required to do so. The Audit Committee retains the power to replace the independent auditors if the Audit Committee determines that the best interests of the Company warrant a change. 
The PacWest Board of Directors recommends a vote "FOR" ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Table of Contents

The SEC approved a rule concerning the delivery of annual reports and proxy statements. It permits a single set of these reports to be sent to any household in which two or more stockholders reside if they appear to be members of the same family. Each stockholder continues to receive a separate proxy card. This procedure, referred to as "householding", reduces the volume of duplicate information stockholders receive and reduces Company mailing and printing expenses. 
In accordance with a notice sent to certain stockholders who shared a single address, only one annual report and proxy statement will be sent to that address unless a stockholder at that address requests that multiple sets of documents be sent. If a stockholder who agreed to householding wishes to receive a separate proxy statement or annual report either now or in the future, he or she may contact our transfer agent, EQ Shareowner Services, at (800) 468-9716 or by mail at P.O. Box 64874, St. Paul, Minnesota 55164-0874. Requests will be responded to promptly. Stockholders who are record holders and share an address and that would like to receive a single set of reports or proxy statements may do so by contacting their banks or brokers, if they are beneficial holders, or by contacting EQ Shareowner Services at the address set forth above. 
Except as set forth herein, management has no knowledge of any other business to come before the Annual Meeting. If, however, any other matters of which management is now unaware properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the proxy to vote the proxy in accordance with the recommendations of management on such matters and discretionary authority to do so is included in the proxy. 
      Stockholder Proposals         
Business must be properly brought before an annual meeting in order to be considered by stockholders.

Any proposal submitted for the proxy materials will be subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC concerning stockholder proposals. The notice of a proposal must also contain the following items:
Assuming the Company holds the 2020 Annual Meeting on the anniversary of the Annual Meeting, matters proposed by stockholders for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting but not included in our proxy materials must be received by our Corporate Secretary no earlier than January 14, 2020 and no later than February 13, 2020.
