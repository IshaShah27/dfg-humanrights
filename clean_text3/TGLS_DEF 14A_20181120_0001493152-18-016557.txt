PROXY STATEMENT
Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on December 12, This proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy is furnished to shareholders of Tecnoglass Inc. in connection with the solicitation of proxies by our board of directors for use in voting at our annual general meeting of shareholders to be held at JW Marriott, Miami, 1109 Brickell Avenue, Miami, FL 33131, on Wednesday, December 12, 2018, at 2:30 p.m., and at any and all postponements or adjournments.
This proxy statement, the accompanying notice of annual general meeting of shareholders, the proxy and the annual report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 are being mailed to shareholders of record on October 26, 2018. We are bearing all costs of this solicitation.
What matters am I voting on?
You are being asked to vote on the following matters:
Who is entitled to vote?
Holders of our ordinary shares as of the close of business on October 26, 2018, the record date, are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of the record date, we had issued and outstanding 37,534,416 ordinary shares, our only class of voting securities outstanding. Each holder of our ordinary shares is entitled to one vote for each share held on the record date.
How do I vote?
If you are a record holder of your shares, you may vote your ordinary shares at the annual general meeting by:
If your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or such other nominee to ensure that votes related to the shares you beneficially own are properly counted.
If you would like to attend the meeting and vote in person and your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee, you must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee to attend the meeting. That is the only way we can be sure that the broker, bank or nominee has not already voted your shares.
What is the effect of giving a proxy?
Proxies in the form enclosed are solicited by and on behalf of our board of directors. The persons named in the proxy have been designated as proxies by our board of directors. If you sign and return the proxy in accordance with the procedures set forth in this proxy statement, the persons designated as proxies by our board of directors will vote your shares at the meeting as specified in your proxy.
If you sign and return your proxy in accordance with the procedures set forth in this proxy statement but you do not provide any instructions as to how your shares should be voted, your shares will be voted FOR the election of the Class B director nominees (Proposal 1).
If you give your proxy, your shares also will be voted in the discretion of the proxies named on the proxy card with respect to any other matters properly brought before the meeting and any postponements or adjournments. If any other matters are properly brought before the meeting, the persons named in the proxy will vote the proxies in accordance with their best judgment.
May I change my vote after I return my proxy card?
If you are a record owner of your shares and you give a proxy, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by:
Please note that your attendance at the meeting will not alone serve to revoke your proxy.
If your shares are held in the name of your broker, bank or another nominee, you should contact your broker, bank or such other nominee for information on how to revoke your voting instructions.
What is a quorum?
A quorum is the minimum number of shares required to be present at the annual general meeting for the meeting to be properly held under our Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and the Companies Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands. The presence, in person, by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative or proxy, of the holders of a majority of our ordinary shares constitutes a quorum. Proxies that are marked "abstain" and proxies relating to "street name" shares that are returned to us but marked by brokers as "not voted" will be treated as shares present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum on all matters. The latter will not be treated as shares voting on the matter as to which authority to vote is withheld from the broker. If a shareholder does not give the broker voting instructions, under applicable self-regulatory organization rules, its broker may not vote its shares on "non-routine" proposals, such as the election of Class B directors.
How many votes are needed for approval of each matter?
The election of a director. Directors are elected by ordinary resolution which will require the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of ordinary shares present (in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative) who, being entitled to vote on such proposal at the annual general meeting, vote. Abstentions are deemed voted on the director proposal. Therefore, they have the same effect as a vote against any particular nominee. Broker non-votes, while considered present for the purposes of establishing a quorum, will have no effect on such proposal.
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank, or other financial institution, your broker will not be permitted to vote on your behalf in the election of our Class B directors without your instructions to do so. Please communicate your voting instructions to your broker, bank, or other financial institution before the meeting so that your vote will be counted.
SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The table and accompanying footnotes set forth certain information as of October 26, 2018 with respect to the ownership of our ordinary shares by:
A person is deemed to be the beneficial owner of securities that can be acquired by the person within 60 days from the record date upon the exercise of warrants or other derivative securities. Accordingly, ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of warrants or other derivative securities that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of October 26, 2018 have been included in the table with respect to the beneficial ownership of the person owning the warrants or other derivative securities, but not with respect to any other persons.

PROPOSAL 1 â€” ELECTION OF CLASS B DIRECTORS
Our board of directors is divided into three classes with only one class of directors being elected in each year and each class serving a three-year term. The term of office of our Class B directors, consisting of Christian T. Daes and Julio A. Torres, will expire at this year's annual general meeting.

Azout, Luis Fernando Castro Vergara and Martha (Stormy) L. Byorum, will expire at our annual general meeting in 2020.
Our nominating committee has nominated each of Messrs. Daes and Torres to be re-elected as a Class B director.
Recommendation and Vote Required
The election of directors requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the ordinary shares present (in person or by proxy or, if a corporation or other non-natural person, by its duly authorized representative) who, being entitled to vote on such proposal at the annual general meeting, vote.
Unless authority is withheld or the shares are subject to a broker non-vote, the proxies solicited by the board of directors will be voted "FOR" the election of these nominees. In case any of the nominees becomes unavailable for election to the board of directors, an event that is not anticipated, the persons named as proxies, or their substitutes, will have full discretion and authority to vote or refrain from voting for any other candidate in accordance with their judgment.
THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE CLASS B DIRECTOR NOMINEES LISTED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

Director Independence
Our ordinary shares are listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market and therefore, we adhere to the NASDAQ listing standards in determining whether a director is independent. Our board of directors consults with its counsel to ensure that the board's determinations are consistent with those rules and all relevant securities and other laws and regulations regarding the independence of directors.
The NASDAQ listing standards define an "independent director" as a person, other than an executive officer of a company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the issuer's board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Consistent with these considerations, we have affirmatively determined that Messrs. Weil, Azout, Castro Vergara, Torres and Ms. Byorum qualify as independent directors. Our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present.
Board of Directors Meetings and Committees
Our board of directors held three meetings in 2017 and acted by written consent eight times. We held our 2017 annual general meeting of shareholders on December 6, 2017, which was attended by two of our directors. No director attended fewer than 75% of the meetings of the board and of the committees thereof upon which he or she served in 2017.
We do not have any formal policy regarding director attendance at annual general meetings of shareholders; however, we will attempt to schedule our annual general meetings so that all of our directors can attend. In addition, we expect our directors to attend all board and committee meetings and to spend the time needed and meet as frequently as necessary to properly discharge their responsibilities.
Leadership Structure
Our board of directors has determined to keep separate the positions of board chairman and chief executive officer at this time. This permits our chief executive officer to concentrate his efforts primarily on managing the Company's business operations and development, while our chairman can focus on, among other things, communications and relations between our board of directors and senior management, consideration by our board of directors of the Company's strategies and policies and our chief executive officer evaluation processes.
Risk Oversight
Our board of directors' primary function is one of oversight. Our board of directors as a whole has responsibility for risk oversight and reviews management's risk assessment and risk management policies and procedures. Our audit committee discusses with our management major financial risk exposures and reports its findings to our board of directors in connection with our board of directors' risk oversight review. Our compensation committee is responsible for creating incentives that encourage behavior consistent with our business strategy, without encouraging undue risk-taking.
Code of Conduct
In October 2017, we adopted an updated code of conduct that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of conduct codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business. We will provide, without charge, upon request, copies of our code of conduct. Requests for copies of our code of conduct should be sent in writing to Tecnoglass Inc., Avenida Circunvalar a 100 mts de la Via 40, Barrio Las Flores, Barranquilla, Colombia, Attn: Corporate Secretary. Readers can also obtain a copy of our code of conduct on our website.
Corporate Governance
Audit Committee
We have a standing audit committee of the board of directors, which consists of Martha L. Byorum, Samuel R. Azout and Julio Torres, with Martha L. Byorum serving as chairman. Each of the members of the audit committee is independent under the applicable NASDAQ listing standards.
The audit committee held four meetings in 2017. The audit committee has a written charter, which is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and can be found on our website. The purpose of the audit committee is to appoint, retain, set compensation of, and supervise our independent accountants, review the results and scope of the audit and other accounting related services and review our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting and disclosure controls. The audit committee's duties, which are specified in the audit committee charter, include, but are not limited to:
Audit Committee Financial Expert
As required by the NASDAQ listing standards, the audit committee will at all times be composed exclusively ofâ€‰independent directors who are "financially literate." NASDAQ listing standards define "financially literate" as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a company's balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. In addition, the Company must certify to NASDAQ the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individual's financial sophistication. The board of directors has determined that Martha Byorum satisfies NASDAQ's definition of financial sophistication and also qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined under rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Audit Committee Report
Our audit committee is responsible for supervising our independent accountants, reviewing the results and scope of the audit and other accounting related services and reviewing our accounting practices and systems of internal accounting and disclosure controls, among other things. These responsibilities include reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor the annual audited financial statements. The audit committee does not itself prepare financial statements or perform audits, and its members are not auditors or certifiers of our financial statements.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibility of appointing and reviewing the services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee carefully reviews the policies and procedures for the engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm, including the scope of the audit, audit fees, auditor independence matters and the extent to which the independent registered public accounting firm may be retained to perform non-audit related services.
The audit committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 with our management and PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltda. ("PwC"), our independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee has also discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU Section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) in Rule 3200T regarding "Communication with Audit Committees."
The audit committee has also received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from PwC required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and has discussed with PwC its independence from the Company.
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the board that the financial statements referred to above be included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Nominating Committee
We have a standing nominating committee, which consists of A. Lorne Weil, Martha L. Byorum and Samuel R. Azout, with A. Lorne Weil serving as chairperson. Each member of the nominating committee is an "independent director" as defined under NASDAQ listing standards. Pursuant to its written charter, which is included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and can be found on our website, our nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee did not meet in person in 2017 but acted by unanimous written consent one time.
Guidelines for Selecting Director Nominees
The nominating committee considers persons identified by its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others. Currently, the guidelines for selecting nominees, which are specified in the nominating committee charter, generally provide that persons to be nominated:
The nominating committee will consider a number of qualifications relating to management and leadership experience, background and integrity and professionalism in evaluating a person's candidacy for membership on the board of directors. The nominating committee may require certain skills or attributes, such as financial or accounting experience, to meet specific board needs that arise from time to time and will also consider the overall experience and makeup of its members to obtain a broad and diverse mix of board members. The nominating committee does not distinguish among nominees recommended by shareholders and other persons.
Compensation Committee
In December 2013, we established a standing compensation committee. Our compensation committee currently consists of Julio Torres, Samuel R. Azout and Luis Fernando Castro Vergara, with Julio Torres serving as chairperson. The compensation committee met two times in 2017. The compensation committee's duties, which are specified in our compensation committee charter included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and can be found on our website, include, but are not limited to:
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Officers, directors and ten percent shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they file. Based solely on a review of such reports received by us and written representations from certain reporting persons that no Form 5s were required for those persons, we believe that, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, all reports required to be filed by our officers, directors and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of our equity securities were filed on a timely basis.
EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Overview
Our policies with respect to the compensation of our executive officers are administered by our board in consultation with our compensation committee. Our compensation policies are intended to provide for compensation that is sufficient to attract, motivate and retain executives of outstanding ability and potential and to establish an appropriate relationship between executive compensation and the creation of shareholder value. To meet these goals, the compensation committee is charged with recommending executive compensation packages to our board.
Summary Compensation Table
The following table summarizes the total compensation for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 of each of our named executive officers.

Each of the bonuses will be based on the Company's 2018 financial performance and achievement of certain to-be-agreed upon targets throughout the year.
The Company estimates median annual total compensation of employees to be $10,714. The ratio of the annual total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer to that of the median employee is 90:1.

Certain Relationships and Related-Party Transactions
Related Party Transactions

Indemnification Agreements
Effective March 5, 2014, we entered into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and members of our board of directors. The indemnification agreements supplement our Third Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association and Cayman Islands law in providing certain indemnification rights to these individuals. The indemnification agreements provide, among other things that we will indemnify these individuals to the fullest extent permitted by Cayman Islands law and to any greater extent that Cayman Islands law may in the future permit, including the advancement of attorneys' fees and other expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or other proceeding, whether of a civil, criminal, administrative, regulatory, legislative or investigative nature, relating to any occurrence or event before or after the date of the indemnification agreements, by reason of the fact that such individuals is or were our directors or executive officers, subject to certain exclusions and procedures set forth in the indemnification agreements, including the absence of fraud or willful default on the part of the indemnitee and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that the indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.
Related Party Policy
Our Code of Conduct requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries are a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.
Our audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, is responsible for reviewing and approving material or significant related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. Additionally, we require each of our directors and executive officers to complete an annual directors' and officers' questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.
These procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.
