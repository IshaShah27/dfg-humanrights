His experience in the Pharmaceutical Industry includes product development; manufacturing; and technical and corporate management.
Bashir Timol. Mr. Timol has been a director of the Company since the Company was organized on December 24, 2013.  He has been a director of Dermal Diagnostics Limited from October 30, 2013. On April 9, 2018, Mr. Timol was appointed to the role of Chief Business Officer.  Mr. Timol possesses over 10 years' experience in food and beverage, franchise, and logistic operations.  His experience includes constructing sales contracts and having the responsibility for overseeing the key managers in the operation of a large scale retail food chain.  He has experience as an entrepreneur investing in and operating a number of retail food chains in the UK, including DIXY Chicken and Costa Coffee.

Mr. Johnson received his first class Masters of Science in Mathematics and Physics from the University of Manchester, UK. Salim Natha.

He is currently practicing as an Eye Surgeon in the UK National Health Service (NHS), and is the clinical lead for a retinopathy screening programme for over 20,000 diabetics in the Ashton, Wigan and Leigh region. He has published several articles in the medical literature and is a peer reviewer for the English National Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Programme.

He is a practicing Chartered Tax Adviser and earned his first class Bachelor of Arts in French and Russian from the University of Northumbria, UK.
The Board  has reviewed the independence of our directors, applying the NASDAQ independence standards. Based on this review, the Board determined that each of Thomas Moore, Dr. Salim Natha and Timothy Johnson are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ rules. In making this determination, our Board considered the relationships that each of these non-employee directors has with us and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence. As required under applicable NASDAQ rules, we anticipate that our independent directors will meet on a regular basis as often as necessary to fulfil their responsibilities, including at least annually in executive session without the presence of non-independent directors and management.
Board Operations
Mr. Chowdhury holds the positions of chief executive officer and chairman of the Board. The Board believes that Mr. Chowdhury's services as both chief executive officer and chairman of the Board is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Mr. Chowdhury possesses detailed and in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing the Company in its business and is thus best positioned to develop agendas that ensure that the Board's time and attention are focused on the most critical matters relating to the business of the Company. His combined role enables decisive leadership, ensures clear accountability, and enhances the Company's ability to communicate its message and strategy clearly and consistently to the Company's stockholders, employees and customers. Mr. Chowdhury chairs the Board and stockholder meetings and participates in preparing their agendas.  The Board has not designated a lead director. Given the limited number of directors comprising the Board, the independent directors call, plan, and chairs their executive sessions collaboratively and, between board meetings, communicate with management and one another directly.  Under these circumstances, the directors believe designating a lead director to take on responsibility for functions in which they all currently participate might detract from rather than enhance performance of their responsibilities as directors.  The Company believes that these arrangements afford the independent directors sufficient resources to supervise management effectively, without being overly engaged in day-to-day operations.
Risk Oversight
Management is responsible for assessing and managing risk, subject to oversight by the Board. The Board oversees our risk management policies and risk appetite, including operational risks and risks relating to our business strategy and transactions. Various committees of the Board assist the Board in this oversight responsibility in their respective areas of expertise as set forth below:

Material Changes to the Procedures by which Security Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board
We do not currently have a procedure by which security holders may recommend nominees to the Board. Prior to the listing of our common stock on NASDAQ, as a private company with a limited shareholder base, we did not believe that it was important to provide such a procedure. However, as a publicly traded NASDAQ company with the requirement to hold annual shareholder meetings, we will consider implementing such a policy in the future.
The Board does not have a formal policy on Board candidate qualifications.  The Board may consider those factors it deems appropriate in evaluating director nominees made either by the Board or stockholders, including judgment, skill, strength of character, experience with businesses and organizations comparable in size or scope to the Company, experience and skill relative to other Board members, and specialized knowledge or experience.  Depending upon the current needs of the Board, certain factors may be weighed more or less heavily.  In considering candidates for the Board, the directors evaluate the entirety of each candidate's credentials and do not have any specific minimum qualifications that must be met.  The directors will consider candidates from any reasonable source, including current Board members, stockholders, professional search firms or other persons.  The directors will not evaluate candidates differently based on who has made the recommendation. Stockholder Communications
Stockholders can mail communications to the Board, c/o Secretary, Nemaura Medical Inc., Advanced Technology Innovation Centre, Loughborough University Science and Enterprise Parks, 5 Oakwood Drive, Loughborough, Leicestershire, LE11 3QF, United Kingdom, who will forward the correspondence to each addressee.

Each of our independent directors receive annual fees of ยฃ5,000 pounds sterling or $7,000 USD for their service on our Board and board committees. We currently have no plan for compensating our executive directors for their services in their capacity as directors.  Although we have agreements with each of our independent directors to serve on our board, in which we provide for the grant of options, at this time no such option grants have been made and no equity compensation plan has been approved. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions
Nemaura Pharma Limited (Pharma) and NDM Technologies Limited (NDM) are entities controlled by our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chairman of the Board and majority shareholder, Dewan Fazlul Hoque Chowdhury.

In addition, certain operating expenses of DDL and TCL were incurred and paid by Pharma and NDM which have been invoiced to us.

PROPOSAL 2
RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
The Audit Committee has appointed Mayer Hoffman McCann P.C. ("MHM") as independent accountants for fiscal 2019. Representatives of  MHM have been invited to attend the Annual Meeting in person or by tele-conference to respond to appropriate questions and will have an opportunity to make a statement, if they so desire.
On August 1, 2018, the Company engaged MHM as its independent registered public accountant and dismissed Crowe LLP (formerly known was Crowe Horwath LLP, "Crowe") from that role.  The change in the Company's independent registered public accountant was approved by the Company's Audit Committee.
Crowe's audit report on the Company's financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion.  During the Company's most recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and for the subsequent interim period through August 1, 2018, the Company had no "disagreements" (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K) with Crowe on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Crowe, would have caused it to make reference in connection with its opinion to the subject matter of the disagreements.
During the Company's most recent fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and for the subsequent interim period through August 1, 2018, there was a "reportable event" as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v)(A) of Regulation S-K.  Crowe advised the Company that the internal controls necessary for the Company to develop reliable financial statements did not exist as a result of the material weaknesses described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on June 12, 2018.  Mr. Timothy Johnson, Chair of the Company's Audit Committee discussed the Company's internal controls with Crowe.  The Company has not precluded Crowe from responding fully to any inquiries of MHM concerning the reportable event.
In accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K, we furnished Crowe with a copy of the Company's current report on Form 8-K, filed with SEC on August 6, 2018, providing Crowe with the opportunity to furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the statements made by the Company herein in response to Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K as the same pertains to Crowe and, if not, stating the respect in which it does not agree. A copy of Crowe's response letter addressed to the SEC relating to such statements made by the Company was filed as an exhibit to the Company's current report on Form 8-K/A, on August 9, 2018.
On August 1, 2018, the Company engaged MHM as the Company's new independent registered public accounting firm effective immediately. The retention of MHM was approved by the Audit Committee.  During the Company's two most recent fiscal years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, and for the subsequent interim period through August 1, 2018, neither the Company, nor anyone on behalf of the Company consulted with MHM regarding either: (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement as described in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K or a reportable event within the meaning of Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K..
