Dear Shareholder:
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Home Bancorp, Inc. The meeting will be held at the Petroleum Club of Lafayette located at 111 Heymann Boulevard, Lafayette, Louisiana, on Friday, May 3, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time. The matters to be considered by shareholders at the Annual Meeting are described in detail in the accompanying materials.
This year we are again using a Securities and Exchange Commission rule to furnish our proxy statement, 2018 Annual Report and proxy card over the internet to shareholders. This means that most shareholders will not receive paper copies of these documents. Instead, these shareholders will receive only a notice containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet. This rule allows us to lower the costs of delivering the annual meeting materials and reduce the environmental impact of the meeting. If you received only the notice and would like to receive a copy of the printed materials, the notice contains instructions on how you can request copies of these documents.
It is very important that you be represented at the Annual Meeting regardless of the number of shares you own or whether you are able to attend the meeting in person. We urge you to vote promptly. You may vote on the internet or by telephone. If you received a paper copy of our annual meeting materials, you may vote by mail. Voting in any of these ways will not prevent you from voting in person at the Annual Meeting, but will ensure that your vote is counted if you are unable to attend.
Your continued support of Home Bancorp, Inc. is sincerely appreciated.

Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rule allows us to furnish proxy materials to shareholders over the internet.   As a result, beginning on or about March 22, 2019, we sent by mail a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("the Notice"), containing instructions on how to access our proxy materials, including our Proxy Statement and 2018 Annual Report, over the internet and how to vote.  Internet availability of our proxy materials is designed to expedite receipt by shareholders and lower the cost and environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. However, if you received such a notice and would prefer to receive paper copies of the proxy materials, please follow the instructions included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or send an email to investorvote@computershare.com with "Proxy Materials Home Bancorp, Inc." in the subject line. Include in the message your full name and address, plus the control number located on the proxy notice, and state in the email that you want a paper copy of current meeting materials.
If you have received paper copies of the proxy materials and would prefer to receive only electronic copies of such materials, please contact our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, at 800-368-5948, or write them at Computershare, Shareholder Services, 462 South 4th Street, Suite 1600, Louisville, KY 40202.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS FOR HOME BANCORP, INC.'S ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MAY 3, 2019.
Our Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting and our Annual Report to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018 are available at www.investorvote.com/HBCP and under the "Investor Relations" tab at www.home24bank.com.
HOME BANCORP, INC.
PROXY STATEMENT
We are furnishing this proxy statement to holders of common stock of Home Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), the holding company of Home Bank, N.A. (the "Bank"). We are soliciting proxies on behalf of our Board of Directors to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held at the Petroleum Club of Lafayette located at 111 Heymann Boulevard, Lafayette, Louisiana, on Friday, May 3, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., Central Daylight Time, and at any adjournment thereof, for the purposes set forth in the attached Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders. This proxy statement is first being made available or mailed to shareholders on or about March 22, 2019.
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials via the internet. Internet delivery of our proxy materials allows us to provide our shareholders with the information they need timely, while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting. Accordingly, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which we refer to as the Notice, to our shareholders and beneficial owners as of the Record Date. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on a website referred to in the Notice or, if they prefer, request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Notice. In addition, shareholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically on an ongoing basis by calling Computershare at 1-800-368-5948 or sending an email to investorvote@computershare.com.
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?
The Notice provides you with instructions regarding how to view our proxy materials for the Annual Meeting via the internet. In addition, the Notice provides how you can instruct us to send future proxy materials to you electronically by e-mail. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by e-mail will save us the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of our Annual Meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?
At our Annual Meeting, shareholders will act upon the election of directors and ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, management will report on the performance of Home Bancorp, Inc. and respond to questions from shareholders.
Who is entitled to vote?
Only shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 14, 2019 (the "record date" for the meeting), are entitled to vote at the meeting. On the record date, we had 9,485,540 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and no other class of equity securities outstanding. For each issued and outstanding share of common stock you own on the record date, you will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted on at the meeting, in person or by proxy.
How do I submit my vote?
Some of the Company's shareholders hold their shares through a stockbroker, bank or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some differences between shares held of record and those owned beneficially. You may vote your shares in one of several ways, depending upon how you own your shares.
Shares registered directly in your name through our transfer agent.  If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record, and these proxy materials are being sent to you by the Company through its transfer agent. As the shareholder of record, you have the right to grant your voting proxy directly to the Company or to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.
If you are a shareholder of record, there are four ways that you can vote your shares. Voting by any of these methods will supersede any prior vote you made regardless of how that vote was made. PLEASE CHOOSE ONLY ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
Shares held in "street" or "nominee" name (through a bank, broker or other nominee).  If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and your broker or other nominee is considered, with respect to those shares, the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker or other nominee on how to vote.
Regardless of how you own your shares, if you are a shareholder of record, you may vote by attending the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you submit your voting instructions or proxy or vote by telephone or the internet so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the meeting.
If my shares are held in "street name" by my broker, could my broker automatically vote my shares for me?
Your broker may not vote on the election of directors if you do not furnish instructions for such proposal. You should use the voting instruction card provided by the institution that holds your shares to instruct your broker to vote your shares or else your shares will be considered "broker non-votes."
Broker non-votes are shares held by brokers or nominees as to which voting instructions have not been received from the beneficial owners or the persons entitled to vote those shares and the broker or other nominee does not have discretionary voting power under rules applicable to broker-dealers. Under these rules, the proposal to elect directors is not an item on which brokerage firms may vote in their discretion on behalf of their clients if such clients have not furnished voting instructions.
Your broker may vote in its discretion on the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm if you do not furnish instructions.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of votes that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter will constitute a quorum. Proxies received but marked as abstentions and broker non-votes will be included in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present at the meeting.
What are the Board of Directors' recommendations?
The recommendations of the Board of Directors are set forth under the description of each proposal in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the nominees for director described herein and FOR ratification of Porter Keadle Moore, LLC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.
The proxy solicited hereby, if properly signed and returned to us and not revoked prior to its use, will be voted in accordance with your instructions contained in the proxy. If a proxy is properly signed and returned, but no instructions are given, it will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board of Directors and, upon the transaction of such other business as may properly come before the meeting, in accordance with the best judgment of the persons appointed as proxies. Proxies solicited hereby may be exercised only at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment of the Annual Meeting and will not be used for any other meeting.
What vote is required to approve each item?
The election of directors will be determined by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. The nominees for director receiving the most "for" votes will be elected. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required for approval of the proposal to ratify the appointment of Porter Keadle Moore, LLC for the year ending December 31, 2019. Abstentions and broker non-votes are considered in determining the presence of a quorum, but will not affect the vote required on the proposals to be considered at the Annual Meeting.
Where can I find directions to the Annual Meeting?
Directions to the Annual Meeting are available through our Investor Relations website at http://home24bank.investorroom.com.

[END TABLE]
Election of Directors (Proposal One)
Our Articles of Incorporation provide that the Board of Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as possible. The directors are elected by our shareholders for staggered terms and until their successors are elected and qualified. No director is related to any other director or executive officer by first cousin or closer.
At this Annual Meeting, you will be asked to elect three directors for a three-year term expiring in 2022. Shareholders of the Company are not permitted to use cumulative voting for the election of directors. Our Board of Directors, by unanimous action of all of its independent directors, nominated Messrs. Mark M. Cole, Michael P. Maraist and Donald W. Washington to a three-year term expiring in 2022. Two current directors of the Company, Messrs. Marc W. Judice and Richard J. Bourgeois, are 72 years old and, consistent with the retirement provisions in the Company's bylaws, will retire as directors as of the date of the Annual Meeting. Mr. Bourgeois is in the class of directors whose term expires at the Annual Meeting while Mr. Judice currently is in the class of directors whose term will expire in 2020. All of the Company's directors also serve as directors of Home Bank, N.A., the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary.
Unless otherwise directed, each proxy executed and returned by a shareholder will be voted for the election of the nominees for director listed below. If any person named as a nominee should be unable or unwilling to stand for election at the time of the Annual Meeting, the proxies will nominate and vote for any replacement nominee or nominees recommended by our Board of Directors. At this time, the Board of Directors knows of no reason why any of the nominees listed below may not be able to serve as a director if elected.
The following tables present information concerning the nominees for director and each director whose term continues, all of whom also serve as directors of Home Bank, N.A. Ages are reflected as of March 14, 2019. Where applicable, service as a director includes service as a director of Home Bank, N.A.

Board Leadership Structure and the Board's Role in Risk Oversight
Mr. John W. Bordelon serves as our President and Chief Executive Officer and Mr. Michael P. Maraist serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board of Directors has determined that separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and President may enhance Board independence and oversight. Further, the separation of the Chairman of the Board permits the President and Chief Executive Officer to better focus on his responsibilities of managing the daily operations of the Company, enhancing shareholder value and expanding and strengthening our franchise while allowing the Chairman to lead the Board of Directors in its fundamental role of providing independent oversight, Board governance and advice to management. The Chairman also serves as a liaison between the Board of Directors and executive management. Mr. Maraist is an independent director under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Risk is inherent with every business, particularly financial institutions. We face a number of risks, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, price risk, operational risk, compliance risk, strategic risk and reputational risk. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks the Company faces, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to ensure that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. In this regard, the Chairman of the Board meets regularly with management to discuss strategy and various risks facing the Company.
Members of executive management regularly attend meetings of the Board of Directors and address any questions or concerns raised by the Board on risk management or other matters. The Board's risk oversight function is carried out through, among other factors, its review and approval of various policies and procedures, such as the Bank's lending and investment policies, ratification or approval of loans exceeding certain thresholds, and regular review of risk elements.
Stock Ownership Guidelines
To further align management's interests with those of shareholders, the Company expects directors and our President and Chief Executive Officer to establish and maintain a significant level of stock ownership. Under such guidelines, non-employee directors are expected to own our common stock with a value of $150,000 or, if shares of our common stock have a market value of $25.00 per share or less, at least 6,000 shares, and our President and Chief Executive Officer is expected to own shares with a value of not less than four times his annual salary. The Company's non-employee directors with the exception of one director and President and Chief Executive Officer satisfy the stock ownership guidelines. New non-employee directors and any new President and Chief Executive Officer are expected to satisfy the Company's stock ownership guidelines within an eighteen-month period.
Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has reviewed the Company's policies and practices applicable to employees, including the Company's benefit plans, arrangements and agreements, and does not believe that they are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Committee does not believe the Company's policies and practices encourage officers or employees to take unnecessary or excessive risks or behavior focused on short-term results rather than the creation of long-term value.
Executive Officers Who Are Not Directors
Jason P. Freyou. Age 54. Mr. Freyou joined the Company and the Bank in March 2015 as Executive Vice President and Chief Operations Officer. Previously, Mr. Freyou served as Chief Investment Officer for JD Bank from July 2014 to March 2015, and as Chief Operations Officer of Teche Federal Bank from July 2008 to July 2014.
Darren E. Guidry. Age 56. Mr. Guidry has served as an Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer for the Bank since October 2013 and, prior thereto, as Chief Lending Officer for the Bank since 1993.
Scott A. Ridley. Age 56. Mr. Ridley has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer for the Bank since October 2013. Previously, Mr. Ridley served as Group Executive of Louisiana Business Banking at Capital One Bank since 2007 and, prior thereto, as Senior Vice President of Business Banking Market Manager at Capital One Bank.
Joseph B. Zanco. Age 49. Mr. Zanco has served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the Bank and the Company since April 2008. Previously, Mr. Zanco served as Controller and Principal Accounting Officer at IberiaBank Corporation since May 2003 and, prior thereto, as Internal Audit Manager at IberiaBank.
In accordance with Home Bancorp's Bylaws, our executive officers are elected annually and hold office until their respective successors have been elected and qualified or until death, resignation or removal by the Board of Directors.
Director Compensation
Directors of Home Bancorp are not compensated separately by Home Bancorp. The directors also serve as directors of Home Bank and are compensated by Home Bank for such service.
The Bank's directors currently receive an annual retainer of $17,000 plus $600 per Board meeting attended and $400 per Committee meeting attended. The Chairman of the Board and Committee Chairs receive an additional $50 per meeting attended. Each director also received a Christmas gift of $300 in 2018.
The table below summarizes the total compensation paid to the Bank's directors for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, except for Mr. Bordelon who is in the Summary Compensation Table below.
Committees and Meetings of the Board of Directors
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors of Home Bancorp met eight times. No director of Home Bancorp attended fewer than 75% of the aggregate of the total number of Board meetings held during the period for which he/she has served as a director and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he/she served. A majority of our directors are independent directors as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. The Board of Directors has determined that Messrs. Blanchet, Bourgeois, Cole, Guidry, Hendry, Judice, Rader, Maraist and Washington are independent directors. Members of the Board also serve on committees of Home Bank, N.A.
Membership on Certain Board Committees. The Board of Directors of Home Bancorp has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee ("Nominating Committee"). During 2018, Messrs. Cole and Rader did not serve on a Home Bancorp committee. The following table sets forth the membership of such committees as of the date of this proxy statement.

Director Nominations
The Nominating Committee considers various criteria when selecting individuals for nomination including: ensuring that the Board of Directors, as a whole, is diverse and consists of individuals with various and relevant career experience, relevant technical skills, industry knowledge and experience, financial expertise (including expertise that could qualify a director as a "financial expert," as that term is defined by the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")), local or community ties, minimum individual qualifications, including strength of character, mature judgment, familiarity with our business and industry, independence of thought and an ability to work collegially. The Nominating Committee also may consider the extent to which the candidate would fill a present need on the Board of Directors, such as industry or board expertise. The Nominating Committee will also consider candidates for director suggested by our management or shareholders. Any shareholder wishing to make a nomination must follow our procedures for shareholder nominations, which are described under "Shareholder Proposals, Nominations and Communications with the Board of Directors" at pages 31 and 32. Director nominations for the 2019 annual meeting were made by all independent directors. Each of the current members of the Nominating Committee is an independent director as defined in the Nasdaq listing standards. A copy of the Nominating Committee's charter is available on our website at www.home24bank.com under the Investor Relations heading.
Directors' Attendance at Annual Meetings
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding attendance by members of the Board of Directors at Annual Meetings of shareholders, we expect that our directors will attend. All directors attended our Annual Meeting of Shareholders held in May 2018.
Code of Conduct and Ethics
Home Bancorp maintains a comprehensive Code of Conduct and Ethics which requires that our directors, officers and employees avoid conflicts of interest; maintain the confidentiality of information relating to Home Bancorp and its customers; engage in transactions in the common stock only in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the requirements set forth in the Code of Conduct and Ethics; and comply with other requirements which are intended to ensure that they conduct business in an honest and ethical manner and otherwise act with integrity and in the best interest of Home Bancorp.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives. Our Compensation Committee has the responsibility for establishing and reviewing our compensation philosophy and objectives. In this role, the Compensation Committee has sought to design a compensation plan that is structured to attract and retain qualified and experienced officers and, at the same time, is reasonable and competitive. Our compensation plan contains various elements including cash compensation, salary and bonuses, stock-based benefit plans and retirement benefits. The cash salary portion of the compensation package is in place to attract and remain competitive in rewarding the daily contributions of the executive. The annual incentive bonus is utilized to reward those contributions to the yearly success of the Company. The stock based benefits are in place to reward the long term improvement in shareholder value created by the efforts of the executive and to retain such executive with the delayed payout of such benefits. The retirement benefits are in place to remain competitive in attracting and retaining strong leaders of the Company. The Compensation Committee reviews the overall compensation of each named executive officer to determine the appropriateness of the level of overall compensation as well as the amount for each element of that compensation based upon the performance of the individual employee and the performance of the Company. It is the intent of the Compensation Committee to target approximately 25% of the overall compensation in long term stock benefits of the executives to ensure the continuous viability of the Company and the improvement of shareholder value.
Role of Executive Officers and Management. The President and Chief Executive Officer provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee on matters of compensation philosophy, plan design and the general guidelines for employee compensation. These recommendations are then considered by the Compensation Committee. The President and Chief Executive Officer generally attends Compensation Committee meetings, but is not present for any discussion of his own compensation.
Elements of Executive Compensation. When setting the compensation of our executive officers, the Compensation Committee generally targets compensation to mirror short and long term performance of the Company. The compensation we provide to our executive officers and other employees primarily consists of the following:
Base Salary. We provide named executive officers and other employees with a base salary to compensate them competitively for services rendered during the year. Base salary ranges for named executive officers are determined for each employee based on his or her position and responsibility, performance and compensation levels paid by peers to executives in similar positions. The Compensation Committee targets base salaries at the market mid-point (50th percentile) and structures pay-for-performance incentives to the 50th percentile of market for total direct compensation. When performance goals are met and exceeded, the upper quartile of market (75th percentile) would be appropriate under our compensation policies and practices. Salary increases normally take effect in April of each year.
During its review of base salaries for executives, the Compensation Committee primarily considers:
Base salaries are reviewed annually and adjusted from time to time to align salaries with market levels after taking into account individual responsibilities, performance, experience and overall compensation. In April 2018, the Compensation Committee increased the base salary of Messrs. Bordelon, Freyou, Guidry, Ridley and Zanco by 2.9%, 6.0%, 5.8%, 3.0% and 5.0%, respectively.
Incentive Bonuses. In addition to base salary, we have established incentive plans for many executives of the Company. The amount of these cash bonuses typically has a stated target based upon reaching desired goals and a predetermined range above and below the target for fluctuations in employee and Company performance. The Compensation Committee has determined that such bonuses provide incentive for short term goals and are appropriate in light of bonuses paid to officers with the same position at comparable institutions, as reported in publicly available proxy statements. The Compensation Committee has developed specific individual or Company performance targets as a measure to determine bonus amounts for each participant. All cash bonuses of the executive officers and all bonus plan designs are evaluated and approved by the Compensation Committee and are ratified by the Board of Directors. In its evaluation, the Compensation Committee seeks to ensure that bonus plans align with the Company's goals, and risks associated with the plans are effectively mitigated. The compensation plan is designed to compensate the executive via incentive compensation for attaining pre-determined strategic goals of the Compensation Committee during a given year. These goals include, but are not limited to, return on average assets, return on equity, efficiency ratio, earnings per share growth, loan growth, core deposit growth, and other strategic objectives. Attainment of these goals provides the Company with the framework to become a high performing company. For 2018, the bonuses to Messrs. Bordelon, Freyou, Guidry, Ridley and Zanco were $180,239, $83,896, $70,220, $77,075 and $83,861, respectively, and were determined based upon consideration of the matrix shown below.
Bonus payments are also subject to the satisfaction of the Company's Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's Safety and Soundness Examination, Compliance Examination and a satisfactory external audit as well as consideration of subjective individual performance evaluations.
Equity Compensation. The Compensation Plan is designed to maintain a portion of the compensation paid to executives of the Company in long term compensation as a means of rewarding strong performance over numerous years for retention of the named executives and to act as a retention incentive. Our named executive officers received awards from the Compensation Committee under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2014 Plan") in May 2018, which are vesting at a rate of 20% per year over five years. The Compensation Committee believes that the five year vesting of stock options and restricted stock units will focus senior management on long term performance and stock appreciation. All grants of options were made with exercise prices equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Through our employee stock ownership plan, as well as our 401(k) plan, we provide all of our employees, including our named executive officers, with tax-qualified retirement benefits. The employee stock ownership plan is allocated as a percentage of each employee's salary to total salaries of the Company. The Company makes a matching 401(k) contribution of 100% of the employee's contribution up to 2%, plus 50% of the employee's contributions over 2% but not over 6% of the employee's pay.
Other Elements of Executive Compensation. In addition to direct cash compensation and awards under our equity compensations plans, we provide our named executive officers with certain compensation and benefits as described below.
Clawback Policy
The Company's Board of Directors has instituted a "clawback" policy with respect to incentive compensation. The clawback policy mitigates the risks associated with the Company's compensation policies, because certain executive employees will be required to repay compensation in the circumstances identified in the policy. The clawback policy provides that our Board of Directors will seek recoupment of incentive based compensation paid or granted to our named executive officers in the event of a material restatement of the Company's financial statements due to material non-compliance with any financial reporting requirement under Federal securities laws. If the Company is required to make an accounting restatement, the policy requires the Board to seek to recover amounts of incentive compensation erroneously paid (that is, the excess of what amounts would have been paid to the executive under the restated financial statements) to the named executive officers during the three years preceding such restatement. The Board of Directors will reevaluate and, if necessary, revise the Company's clawback policy to comply with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act once the rules implementing the clawback requirements have been finalized by the SEC.
Additional Components of Executive Compensation.
In August 2007, we entered into a salary continuation plan with our President and Chief Executive Officer which will provide supplemental retirement benefits in a specified amount between $180,000 and $214,000 per year for 10 years upon his retirement, death, disability or termination in connection with or following a change in control. The salary and continuation plan was deemed appropriate by the Compensation Committee in light of Mr. Bordelon's performance as president and chief executive officer and as an incentive to retain his services until retirement. We also entered into a salary continuation plan with our Chief Credit Officer, which will provide supplemental retirement benefits equal to $75,000 per year for 10 years upon his retirement at age 65. The salary continuation plan entered into with Mr. Guidry was deemed appropriate as an incentive to maintain his continued services until retirement. The Compensation Committee may consider additional plans of this type for any other executive officers of the Company. These salary continuation plans are described in more detail on page 20 under "Salary Continuation Agreements".
Summary Compensation Table
The table below summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other executive officers (who we refer to as the "named executive officers") for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Benefit Plans
Salary Continuation Agreements. Effective August 1, 2007, the Bank entered into a salary continuation agreement with its President and Chief Executive Officer, John W. Bordelon. The agreement provides that Mr. Bordelon will receive an annual retirement benefit for a period of 10 years, with the annual benefit equal to $180,000 upon his earliest retirement age of 62 and increasing each additional year he remains employed until the annual benefit reaches $214,000 if he retires after age 65. The retirement benefits vested over a period of 10 years, and Mr. Bordelon became fully vested in his normal retirement benefit of $180,000 per year in August 2017. If Mr. Bordelon dies while still employed, the Bank will pay Mr. Bordelon's beneficiary an annual benefit of $360,000 each year for five years, payable in monthly installments.
A nonqualified salary continuation agreement was also entered into with Darren E. Guidry, effective August 1, 2007. Mr. Guidry's agreement provides for a retirement benefit of $75,000 per year if he remains employed until age 65, payable in equal monthly installments for a period of ten years. His retirement benefits vest over a period of 12 years, commencing August 1, 2008. In the event of early retirement, the Bank will pay Mr. Guidry his vested benefits in 120 equal monthly installments upon his attaining age 65. If Mr. Guidry dies while still employed, the Bank will pay his beneficiary an annual benefit of $75,000 each year for 10 years, payable in monthly installments. If Mr. Guidry has a separation from service within 24 months following a change in control but prior to reaching age 65, the Bank shall pay him the vested portion of his annual benefit in a lump sum on the first day of the month following the separation from service. In each case, benefits are subject to a six-month delay to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Code.
The table below shows the present value of accumulated benefits payable to Messrs. Bordelon and Guidry under the salary continuation agreements. The salary continuation agreements do not include any provision regarding years of credited service.
Employment Agreements
In May 2018, the Company extended the terms of its existing employment agreement with John W. Bordelon, and the Bank extended the terms of its existing employment agreements with Mr. Bordelon and Jason P. Freyou, Darren E. Guidry, Scott A. Ridley, and Joseph B. Zanco. The employment agreements with Mr. Bordelon have a term expiring on June 22, 2021, and the terms of the employment agreements with the other executive officers have a term expiring on June 22, 2020. At least annually, the Board of Directors of the Company and Home Bank will consider whether to renew and extend the term of the agreements. Any such renewals or extensions of the agreements will be reflected in an amendment or supplement to such agreement.
The employment agreements between the Bank and the named executive officers are terminable with or without cause by the Bank. The employment agreements provide that in the event of a termination of employment by the Bank other than due to cause, disability, death, retirement or in connection with a change in control of the Company or the Bank or in the event of a voluntary termination by the officer for "good reason" (which includes a change in the officer's position, salary or duties without his consent), each officer would be entitled to (1) an amount of cash severance which is equal to one times (three times in the case of Mr. Bordelon) the amount of his base salary as of the date of termination and (2) continued participation in certain employee benefit plans of Home Bank, including medical and dental plans, until the earlier of 12 months (36 months in the case of Mr. Bordelon) or the date the executive receives substantially similar benefits from full-time employment with another employer. In the event of termination of employment concurrently with or following a change in control of the Company or the Bank, including a voluntary termination by the officer for good reason, as defined, each officer would be entitled to (1) an amount of cash severance which is equal to two times (three times in the case of Mr. Bordelon) the sum of his base salary as of the date of termination plus his prior year's bonus and (2) continued participation in certain employee benefit plans, including medical and dental plans, until the earlier of 24 months (36 months in the case of Mr. Bordelon) or the date the officer receives substantially similar benefits from another employer upon his full-time employment. In the event an officer's employment is terminated due to cause, death, disability or retirement, he will have no rights under the employment agreements to any compensation or benefits following the date of termination. The employment agreements with the Bank provide that in the event any of the payments to be made thereunder or otherwise upon termination of employment are deemed to constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), payments and benefits received thereunder shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by the Bank for federal income tax purposes.
In addition to the employment agreement between the Bank and Mr. Bordelon, the Company has also entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Bordelon which is on terms substantially similar to his agreement with the Bank, except as described below. With respect to any change in control, if any payments to be made under Mr. Bordelon's employment agreement with the Company would be deemed to constitute "parachute payments", the payments and benefits to be received thereunder shall be reduced by the minimum amount necessary to result in no portion of the payments and benefits being non-deductible by the Company for federal income tax purposes. Under the employment agreements, Mr. Bordelon's compensation, benefits and expenses will be paid by the Company and the Bank in the same proportion as the time and services actually expended by Mr. Bordelon on behalf of each company.

Related Party Transactions
Loans and Extensions of Credit. The Bank offers loans to its directors, officers and employees as well as members of their immediate families and others who are considered "related persons" under Item 404 of Regulation S-K of the SEC. Any loans by the Bank to related persons were made in the ordinary course of business on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to the Bank. None of these loans involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavorable features. All of these loans were performing according to their original terms at December 31, 2018. None of the Bank's loans to any of its directors, executive officers, any of their immediate family members or to any related persons were non-accrual, past due, restructured or deemed potential problem loans at December 31, 2018.
Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act generally provides that any credit extended by a savings institution, such as the Bank, to its executive officers, directors and, to the extent otherwise permitted, principal stockholder(s), or any related interest of the foregoing, must be on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions by the savings institution with non-affiliated parties; unless the loans are made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that (i) is widely available to employees of the institution and (ii) does not give preference to any director, executive officer or principal stockholder, or certain affiliated interests of either, over other employees of the savings institution, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons. Regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency require that if any director or executive officer has any interest in a matter to be considered by the Bank's Board of Directors, he or she must fully disclose such interest, refrain from participating in the Board's discussion of the matter and recuse him or herself from voting on the matter. The Bank and its directors and executive officers, adhere to the regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in acting upon any matter in which a director or executive officer has a direct or indirect personal interest. Such matters may be approved by the Board provided that a majority of the non-interested directors conclude that the transaction is in the best interests of the Bank and consistent with all Federal regulations and the Bank's policies. The Board's minutes will reflect the interest of the subject director or executive officer and note that he or she did not participate in the discussion of, or vote on, the matter.
CEO Pay Ratio
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Company is required to provide disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual compensation to the annual compensation of the CEO in this Proxy Statement.
The median employee was identified from all full-time and part-time employees, excluding the CEO, who were employed by the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries on December 31, 2018.  A total of 451 employees were included in the analysis. Compensation was measured over the 12-month period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018.
The median employee compensation was determined using 2018 total cash compensation (includes base salary, overtime, commissions and bonuses). Wages were annualized for our employees who did not work the entire calendar year.
Mr. Bordelon had 2018 total compensation of $802,277 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. The median employee's total compensation for 2018 that would be reportable in the Summary Compensation Table was $47,104. As a result, the CEO pay ratio is 17:1.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
Messrs. Blanchet, Maraist, Judice and Mr. Hendry, who is Chairman of the Committee, serve as members of the Compensation Committee. None of the members of the Compensation Committee during 2018 was a current or former officer or employee of Home Bancorp or Home Bank. No member engaged in certain transactions with Home Bancorp or Home Bank required to be disclosed by regulations of the SEC. Additionally, there were no Compensation Committee "interlocks" during 2018, which generally means that no executive officer of Home Bancorp served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee of another entity, one of whose executive officers served as a director or member of the Compensation Committee of Home Bancorp.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of Home Bancorp's common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. We know of no person who owns 10% or more of Home Bancorp's common stock.
Other than as described below, based solely on our review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, or written representations from our officers and directors, we believe that during, and with respect to, the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, our officers and directors complied in all respects with the reporting requirements promulgated under Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Michael P. Maraist was late in filing two reports on Form 4 with respect to two transactions for a family partnership. Mr. Chris P. Rader was late in filing two reports on Form 4 with respect to two transactions for the purchase of stock in September 2018 and December 2018.
