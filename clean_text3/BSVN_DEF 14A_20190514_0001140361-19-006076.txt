April 11, IMPORTANT VOTING INFORMATION
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, you must instruct the broker how to vote your shares. If           you do not provide voting instructions, your shares will not be voted on any proposal on which the broker does not have discretionary authority to vote. This is called a "broker non-vote." In these cases, the broker can register your shares as           being present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but will not be able to vote on those matters for which specific authorization is required under the rules of the NASDAQ.
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record by a broker, your broker has discretionary voting authority under           NASDAQ rules to vote your shares on the ratification of the appointment of BKD LLP as independent registered public accounting firm for the year 2019 (Proposal 2), even if the broker does not receive voting instructions from you. However, your           broker does not have discretionary authority to vote on election of directors (Proposal 1) without instructions from you. Therefore, if you are a beneficial owner and do not provide your broker with instructions on those matters, a broker           non-vote will occur and your shares will not be voted on that matter. Accordingly, it is particularly important that beneficial owners instruct             their brokers how they wish to vote their shares.
MORE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE                      
If you have any questions about the proxy voting process, please contact the broker, bank or other financial institution where you           hold your shares.  The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") also has a website (www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters.shtml) with more information about your rights           as a shareholder.
Additionally, you may contact our Investor Relations Department at investorrelations@bank7.com.

PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our board of directors is classified into the following three             classes, with members of each class serving a three-year term: (i) Class I, which consists of three directors elected for a term expiring at the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2019; (ii) Class II, which consists of three directors             elected for a term expiring at the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2020; and (iii) Class III, which consists of three directors elected for a term expiring at the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2021. At each succeeding             annual shareholders' meeting, commencing with the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2019, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms then expire will be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding             annual shareholders' meeting after their election. Our directors hold office until their successors are elected and qualified, or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal.
Our board of directors has nominated for election Thomas L. Travis, Bobby J. Alexander, and J. Michael Sanner, all of whom           currently are Class I directors.
Each nominee must be elected by a plurality of shares voted in this election. The individuals named as proxies on your proxy card           will vote for the election of each nominee unless you withhold authorization. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not have any effect on this proposal.
Each nominee has agreed to serve for a three-year term, if elected. If any nominee is unable to stand for election at this Annual           Meeting, the Board may either (i) reduce its size or (ii) nominate an alternate candidate, in which case the proxies will be voted for the alternate candidate.
Your Board recommends a vote "FOR" these             directors.

BOARD MEETINGS AND COMMITTEES
Our Board conducts its business through meetings of the Board and of its committees. The Board met six times during 2018. Each           director in office on December 31, 2018 attended more than 75% of the total number of meetings held while such director was in office in 2018 of the Board and the committees on which he served.
Our board of directors believes it is important for all directors to attend the Annual Meeting of shareholders in order to show           their support for the Company and to provide an opportunity for shareholders to express any concerns to them. We have adopted a policy that all directors should attend each annual meeting of shareholders unless they are unable to attend by reason           of personal or family illness or pressing matters.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Corporate Governance             Guidelines. Our board of directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that set forth the framework within which our board of directors, assisted by the committees of our board of directors, directs the affairs of our           organization. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address, among other things, the composition and functions of our board of directors, director independence, compensation of directors, management succession and review, committees of our board of           directors and selection of new directors.
Director Independence.           Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Accordingly, we are required to comply with the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market with respect to the independence of directors who serve on our board of directors and its committees.           Under the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, independent directors must comprise a majority of our board of directors. The rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, as well as those of the SEC, also impose several other requirements with respect to the           independence of our directors.
Our board of directors has evaluated the independence of its members based upon the rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market and the SEC.           Applying these standards, our board of directors has affirmatively determined that each of Bobby J. Alexander, Charles W. Brown, William M. Buergler, Gary D. Whitcomb, Lonny D. Wilson and J. Michael Sanner is an independent director, as defined           under the applicable rules. The board determined that each of Chairman Haines, Mr. Travis and Mr. Phillips does not qualify as an independent director because each is an executive officer of the Company. The board of directors has also determined           that the members of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee are independent under the heightened standards of independence required by Sections 5605(c)(2)(A) and 5605(d)(2)(A), respectively, of the NASDAQ rules. In making these           determinations, the board of directors considered the banking relationships with directors and their related interests which we enter into in the ordinary course of our business and the compensation arrangements described under "Certain           Transaction," "Executive Compensation" and "Director Compensation."
Director Qualifications. We              believe that our directors should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in areas relevant to our business. They should be committed to enhancing shareholder           value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. Each director must represent the interests of all shareholders. When considering potential director candidates, our           board of directors also considers the candidate's character, judgment, diversity, skill set, specific business background and experience in the context of our needs and those of the board of directors.
Controlled Company. The              William Bradford Haines Financial Services Trust, the Lisa K. Haines Financial Services Trust, and the Julee S. Lawrence Financial Services Trust (collectively, the "Haines Family Trusts") control a majority of our outstanding voting power and           have made a filing as a group under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the corporate governance standards of NASDAQ Stock Market. As a result, although the members of our Audit           Committee are required to be independent, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function under the rules of the NASDAQ           Stock Market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are in full compliance with NASDAQ Global Select Market listing requirements for board independence and committee independence.
Family Relationships. There              are no family relationships among the directors of the Company, as defined in Item 401 of Regulation S-K. Our Chairman of the Board is the father of Lisa K. Haines, the Bank's Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. In addition, our           Chairman of the Board is the brother of Doug Haines, the Bank's Regional President for Western Oklahoma and Kansas, the uncle of Drew Haines, our Bank's Vice President – Commercial Lending, and the grandfather of one of the Bank's employees           working in the operations department.
Board of Directors Leadership             Structure. It is the practice of the Company to separate the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in recognition of the differences between the two roles. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting our           strategic direction and the day-to-day leadership and performance. The Chairman of the Board provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer, sets the agenda for board meetings, presides over meetings of the full board, and facilitates           communication among the independent directors and between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer. The board of directors further believes that the separation of the duties of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman of the           Board eliminates any inherent conflict of interest that may arise when the roles are combined. Table of Contents
Executive Sessions.  To              further strengthen the oversight of the board of directors, our board of directors holds regular executive sessions at which only independent directors are present.  In 2018, there were two executive sessions.  The executive sessions are presided           over by the Chairman of the Audit Committee, who is an independent director.
Compensation Committee             Interlocks and Insider Participation. None of the members of our Compensation Committee are or have been one of our officers or employees. In addition, none of our executive officers serves or has served as a member of the compensation           committee or other board committee performing equivalent functions of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as one of our directors or on our Compensation Committee.
Risk Management and             Oversight. The board of directors has ultimate authority and responsibility for overseeing our risk management. The board of directors monitors, reviews and reacts to material enterprise risks identified by management. The board           receives specific reports from executive management on credit, interest rate, liquidity, transactional, compliance and legal, strategic, and reputational risks and the degree of exposure to those risks. The board of directors helps ensure that           management is properly focused on risk by, among other things, reviewing and discussing the performance of senior management and business line leaders. Committees of the board of directors have responsibility for risk oversight in specific areas.           The Audit Committee oversees financial, accounting and internal control risk management policies. The Audit Committee also oversees the risk and compliance programs, adherence to management policies and procedures, compliance with regulatory           requirements and information technology strategies and activities. The Compensation Committee assesses and monitors risks in our compensation program.
Committees of the Board of Directors
Our board of directors has established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These           committees include the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee. Our board of directors also may establish such other committees as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable law and regulations and our certificate of incorporation           and bylaws.
Audit Committee.   Our board of directors has adopted an Audit Committee charter that sets out the responsibilities, authority and specific duties of the Audit Committee.

Buergler (Committee Chairman), Charles W. Brown, J. Michael Sanner and Gary D. Whitcomb.  The Audit Committee met eight times in 2018.
Our board of directors has evaluated the independence of each of the members of our Audit Committee and has affirmatively           determined that each of the members of our Audit Committee (1) is an independent director under NASDAQ Stock Market rules, (2) satisfies the additional independence standards under applicable SEC rules for audit committee service, and (3) has the           ability to read and understand fundamental financial statements.

Michael Sanner (Committee Chairman), Bobby J. Alexander, William M. Buergler and Lonny D. Wilson.  The Compensation             Committee met one time in 2018.

Nominating Directors. We              currently do not have a nominating and corporate governance committee and the independent members of our board of directors perform the principal functions of a nominating and corporate governance committee. Pursuant to NASDAQ Listing Rule           5605(e), our board of directors designated the independent directors of our board of directors, Messrs. Whitcomb, Alexander, Brown, Buergler, Wilson and Sanner, as well as any future members of the board of directors that qualify as independent           directors, or the Nominating Directors, as the independent directors responsible for, among other things, (i) determining the qualifications, qualities and skills required to be a director of the Company and evaluating, selecting and approving           nominees to serve as directors, (ii) periodically reviewing, assessing and making recommendations for changes to the board of directors and (iii) overseeing the process for evaluation of the board of directors. In addition, the Nominating           Directors will have unrestricted access to and assistance from our officers, employees and independent auditors and the authority to employ experts, consultants and professionals to assist with performance of their duties.
The Nominating Directors will also consider director nominees put forward by shareholders. Our bylaws contain provisions that           address the process by which a shareholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the board of directors at an annual or special meeting. The Nominating Directors do not have any specific minimum qualifications that director nominees           must have in order to be considered to serve on the board of directors. However, the Nominating Directors do take into consideration areas of expertise that director nominees may be able to offer, including professional experience, knowledge,           abilities and industry knowledge or expertise. The Nominating Directors also consider the director nominees' potential contribution to the overall composition and diversity of the board of directors. Table of Contents

 We compensate our named executive officers through a combination of base salary, annual discretionary bonuses, and other           benefits, including perquisites. Our board of directors believes the executive compensation packages that we provide to our executives, including the named executive officers, should reward performance. Each element of compensation is designed to           achieve a specific purpose and to contribute to a total package that is competitive with similar packages provided by other institutions that compete for the services of individuals like our named executive officers.
Base Salary
We provide each of our named executive officers with a competitive fixed annual base salary. The base salaries for our named             executive officers are reviewed annually by the board of directors by taking into account the results achieved by each executive, his or her future potential, scope of responsibilities and experience, and competitive pay practices. Based upon             the comprehensive review, the board of directors has determined the base salaries to be equitable and competitive for our market. Table of Contents
Bonuses
Historically, the board of directors has provided discretionary cash bonuses after the end of each fiscal year. The amount of these           discretionary awards, if any, has been based on an overall assessment of our performance, while taking into consideration other factors such as market conditions, regulatory changes, accounting changes, tax law changes and other items that may           impact our strategic direction. Based on the profitability of the Company, we set aside on a monthly basis a bonus pool to be allocated among the employees at the end of the fiscal year.
We intend to continue to provide annual cash bonuses to reward achievement of financial or operational goals so that total           compensation is reflective of actual company and individual performance. Our board of directors is currently working to provide incentive targets that tie compensation to our performance in 2019. These performance criteria may include a           discretionary provision for factors such as successful capital raises, acquisitions, and stock price performance.
Equity Incentives
We adopted, and our shareholders approved the Bank7 Corp. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2018 Plan, a new omnibus equity           incentive plan in which our employees, executive officers and/or directors may participate.
The 2018 Plan, provides for the issuance of up to 850,000 shares of common stock pursuant to awards of incentive stock options,           non-statutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, performance-based stock and stock unit awards, and other forms of equity or cash compensation. The maximum aggregate number of shares           of common stock that may be issued pursuant to all awards under the 2018 Plan is expected to increase annually on the first day of each fiscal year after the adoption of the 2018 Plan by the lesser of (i) 1.0% of the total issued and outstanding           shares of common stock on the first day of the respective fiscal year, (ii) 100,000 shares of common stock, or (iii) a lesser amount determined by our board of directors. The purpose of the 2018 Plan is to provide selected present and future           employees and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates with stock based incentives and other equity interests in the Company, thereby giving them a stake in the growth and prosperity of the Company and encouraging the           continuance of their services with the Company.
The 2018 Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee has the ability to make awards under the           2018 Plan, and to select employees and directors who may participate in the 2018 Plan, determine the amount and types of awards, determine the terms and conditions of awards, grant awards as an alternative to, or as the form of payment for grants           or rights earned or payable under, other bonus or compensation plans, arrangements or policies of the Company; grant substitute awards on terms and conditions as the Compensation Committee may prescribe; make all determinations under the 2018           Plan concerning termination of any participant's employment or service with the Company; determine whether or not a change-in-control has occurred under the 2018 Plan; construe and interpret the 2018 Plan and any agreement or instrument under the           2018 Plan; establish and administer any terms, conditions, restrictions, limitations, forfeiture, vesting or exercise schedule, and other provisions of or relating to any award; establish and administer any performance goals, including related           performance measures or performance criteria and applicable performance periods, determine the extent to which any performance goals and/or other terms and conditions of an award are attained or are not attained, and certify whether, and to what           extent, any such performance goals and other material terms applicable to awards under the 2018 Plan intended to qualify as performance-based compensation were in fact satisfied; construe any ambiguous provisions, correct any defects, supply any           omissions and reconcile any inconsistencies in the 2018 Plan and/or any award agreement; establish, adopt, amend, waive and/or rescind rules, regulations, procedures, guidelines, forms and/or instruments for the 2018 Plan's operation or           administration; make all valuation determinations relating to awards and the payment or settlement thereof; and grant waivers of terms, conditions, restrictions and limitations under the 2018 Plan or applicable to any award, or accelerate the           vesting or exercisability of any award.
Other Benefits and Perquisites
The named executive officers participate in the Bank's broad-based employee welfare benefit plans, such as medical, dental, vision,           supplemental disability and term life insurance. The named executive officers also participate in the Bank's 401(k) plan. The Bank matches 100% of an employee's contribution up to 5% of such employee's salary (excluding bonuses). The named           executive officers are provided the same benefits, and participate in the cost at the same rate, as all other employees.
We provide our named executive officers with certain perquisites that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our overall           compensation program to better enable us to attract and retain superior employees for key positions. The Compensation Committee will review the levels of perquisites and other personal benefits provided to named executive officers. Based on this           periodic review, perquisites will be awarded or adjusted on an individual basis. The perquisites received by our named executive officers in 2018 included an automobile and cell phone allowance and the use of the Bank-owned country club           membership. Table of Contents

Potential Payments on Termination or Change in Control
In connection with our issuance of restricted stock units to Mr. Travis and stock options to Mr. Travis and Mr. Phillips, we entered           into a Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement with Mr. Travis and a Stock Option Award Agreement with each of Mr. Travis and Mr. Phillips (the "Participants").  The Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement and the Stock Option Award Agreements each           provide for the vesting of all unvested restricted stock units and stock options, respectively, upon the earlier of (i) the Participant's death, (ii) the Participant's disability, or (iii) immediately prior to  a "Change in Control" of the           Company.  Generally, a "Change in Control" consists of one of the following events:
[BEGIN TABLE]
· a person becoming the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the Company's then outstanding voting securities;  
· the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets;  
· individuals serving on the Company's Board whose election or nomination was approved by a majority of the then incumbent board (outside the context of an election                        contest), cease to constitute a majority of the Board; and  
· a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation                          which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent at least 50% of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving                          entity or its parent outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation.  
[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, the value of Mr. Travis' restricted stock units that would vest upon his death, disability or a Change in           Control was $1,335,000.  The stock options held by Mr. Travis and Mr. Phillips' have an exercise price of $19.00 per share and were therefore not "in-the-money" as of December 31, 2018. Table of Contents
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Policies and Procedures Regarding Related Party Transactions
Transactions by us or the Bank with related persons are subject to regulatory requirements and restrictions. These requirements and           restrictions include the Affiliates Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W (which governs certain transactions by the Bank with its affiliates) and the Federal Reserve's Regulation O (which governs certain loans by the Bank to its executive           officers, directors, and principal shareholders). We have adopted policies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions.
In addition, our board of directors has adopted a written policy governing the approval of related person transactions that complies           with all applicable requirements of the SEC and the NASDAQ Global Select Market concerning related person transactions. Related person transactions are transactions in which we are a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a related           person has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related persons of the Company include directors (including nominees for election as directors), executive officers, beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock and the           immediate family members of these persons. Our executive management team, in consultation with outside counsel, as appropriate, will review potential related person transactions to determine if they are subject to the policy. In determining           whether to approve a related person transaction, that committee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related person's interest in the transaction, the appearance of an           improper conflict of interests for any director or executive officer taking into account the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related person, whether the transaction would impair an outside director's independence, the           acceptability of the transaction to our regulators and the potential violations of other corporate policies.
Ordinary Banking Relationships
Certain of our officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are customers           of, or have or have had transactions with us or the Bank in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include deposits, loans, wealth management products and other financial services related transactions. Related party transactions are           made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral (where applicable), as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to us, and do not involve           more than normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to us. Any loans we originate with officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are approved by our board           of directors in accordance with the Bank's regulatory requirements.
As of the date of this proxy statement, no related party loans were categorized as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential           problem loans. We expect to continue to enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business on similar terms with our officers, directors and principal shareholders, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates.
Directed Share Program
In connection with our initial public offering, at our request, our underwriters reserved for sale, 200,000 shares of our common stock           for sale to our directors, executive officers, employees and business associates and certain other related persons who have expressed an interest in purchasing our common stock in this offering through a directed share program at the initial           public offering price of $19.00 per share. Mr. Travis purchased 25,000 shares for a total of $475,000 through the directed share program.
Employment Arrangements
            We currently employ certain immediate family members of our Chairman of the Board in the following capacities: Douglas A. Haines, the Bank's Regional President for Western Oklahoma and Kansas, is the brother of our Chairman of the Board and Lisa           K. Haines, the Bank's Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, is the daughter of our Chairman of the Board. The background experience of Douglas A. Haines and Lisa K. Haines are discussed under the heading "Executive Officers".           During the year ended 2018, we paid Douglas A. Haines $278,761 and Lisa K. Haines $270,308 cash compensation for their services as employees. These individuals are also entitled to participate in the general welfare programs of the Bank to the           same extent as the other Bank employees.
Registration Rights Agreement
In connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Haines Family Trusts. The           agreement provides the Haines Family Trusts with certain demand and piggyback registration rights in respect of any registrable shares of our common stock held by them, subject to various conditions and limitations as set forth in the agreement.            We will pay all expenses in connection with any such registrations. Table of Contents
Other Transactions
Chairman Haines is the manager of Haines Realty Investments Co., LLC, or Haines Realty, a business entity owned by trusts established           for Lisa K. Haines and Julee S. Thummel, his daughters. The Bank leases its branch located in Woodward, Oklahoma from Haines Realty. During 2018, lease and common area maintenance payments to Haines Realty totaled $184,000 which we believe to be           consistent with prevailing market terms.
On September 28, 2018, the Bank sold its aircraft subsidiary, 711 Holdings, LLC to an entity controlled by Chairman Haines, the           William B. Haines 2003 Limited Partnership, for $1.5 million, which we believe to be the fair market value of the subsidiary.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our           common stock to file certain reports with the SEC concerning their beneficial ownership of our equity securities. The SEC's regulations also require that a copy of all such Section 16(a) forms filed must be furnished to us by the executive           officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such forms and amendments thereto received by us with respect to 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements were timely met. We           make no representation regarding persons who have not identified themselves as being subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or as to the appropriateness of disclaimers of beneficial           ownership.

Preapproval of Services
The Audit Committee is required by SEC regulations to preapprove all auditing services and permitted non-audit services provided by           the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. There is an exception for preapproval of non-audit services if the aggregate amount of all such non-audit services provided to us constitutes not more than five percent of the total           amount of revenues paid by it to its independent registered public accounting firm during the fiscal year in which the non-audit services are provided; such services were not recognized by us at the time of the engagement to be non-audit           services; and the non-audit services are promptly brought to the attention of the committee and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the committee or by one or more members of the committee to whom authority to grant such approval has           been delegated by the committee. All audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by our independent auditor have been preapproved by the Audit Committee as required by SEC regulations and the Audit Committee's charter without           exception.                       Table of Contents
REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
The Company's Audit Committee oversees and reports to the board of directors regarding accounting and financial reporting           processes, the audits of the financial statements, the qualifications and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to provide independent audits and related services, and the performance of the internal audit           function and independent registered public accounting firm; and also performs the other duties of the committee specified by federal securities laws and regulations, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and related regulations, the listing standards           of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange, and its charter. The committee (1) has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements included in the Company's 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K with management; (2) has discussed with our independent           registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16 (Communication with Audit Committees); and (3) has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered           public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the committee concerning independence and has discussed independence with the           independent registered public accounting firm. Based upon this review, discussion, disclosures, and materials described in (1) through (3), the committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in           the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The committee also has considered whether the amount and nature of non-audit services rendered by the independent accountant are consistent with its independence.

PROPOSAL 2—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019                      
Our Audit Committee recommended and our board of directors approved the engagement of BKD LLP as our independent registered public           accounting firm for 2019. The board of directors is submitting this appointment to the vote of the shareholders for ratification.
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at           the Annual Meeting is required to ratify the appointment of BKD LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Therefore, abstentions effectively count as votes against this proposal. If the appointment is not ratified by a           majority of the shareholders, the vote will be considered in connection with the auditor appointment for 2020. However, it is not anticipated that any change in our independent registered public accounting firm would be made for 2019 because of           the difficulty and expense of making another change so long after the beginning of the year.
Our board of directors recommends that you vote "FOR" the ratification of BKD LLP as our independent registered           public accounting firm for 2019.
CODE OF CONDUCT AND ETHICS
Our board of directors has adopted a Code of Conduct and Ethics             Policy, or Code of Conduct, that applies to all of our directors, officers and employees. The Code of Conduct sets forth the standard of conduct that we expect all of our directors, officers and employees to follow, including our Chief             Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. In addition, our board of directors has adopted a Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers that applies to our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial             Officer and any other officer serving in a finance function and sets forth specific standards of conduct and ethics that we expect from such individuals in addition to those set forth in the Code of Conduct. Our Code of Conduct and our Code of             Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers are available on our website at www.bank7.com. We expect that any amendments to the Code of Conduct or the Code of Ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and senior financial officers, or any waivers of their respective requirements, will be disclosed on our website,             as well as any other means required by NASDAQ Global Select Market rules or the SEC.
OTHER MATTERS
The Board is not aware of any business to come before the Annual Meeting other than those matters described above in this Proxy           Statement and matters incident to the conduct of the Annual Meeting. However, if any other matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is intended that proxies in the accompanying form will be voted as determined by a majority of           the board of directors.
