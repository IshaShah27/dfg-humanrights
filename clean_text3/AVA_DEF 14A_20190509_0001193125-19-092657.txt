Annual Meeting of Shareholders 
Important Voting Information 
Brokerage firms, banks and other nominees generally have the authority to vote their customers' shares when their customers do not provide voting instructions. However, with respect to certain specified matters, when such an entity does not receive instructions from its customers, shares cannot be voted on those matters. This is called a "broker non-vote." Matters on which organizations that are members of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") may not vote without instructions include the election of directors, matters relating to executive compensation and matters relating to certain corporate governance issues. For Avista Corporation ("Avista," or the "Company"), this means that NYSE member organizations may not vote shares on Proposals 1 and 3 if you have not given them instructions on how to vote. Please be sure to give any brokerage firm, bank, or other financial institution that holds shares on your behalf specific voting instructions so that your shares can be voted. 
Your Participation in Voting the Shares You Own is Important 
Your vote is important. Whether or not you plan to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") in person, we urge you to vote and submit your proxy by mail, telephone, or through the internet as promptly as possible. If you are submitting your proxy by mail, you should complete, sign, and date your proxy card, and return it in the envelope provided. If you plan to vote by telephone or through the internet, voting instructions are printed on your proxy card and/or proxy notice. If you hold your shares through an account with a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee, please follow the instructions you receive from them to vote your shares. 
More Information is available 
If you have any questions about the proxy voting process, please contact the broker, bank or other financial institution where you hold your shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") also has a website (www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters.shtml) with more information about your rights as a shareholder. Additionally, you may contact our Investor Relations Department at (509) 495-4203.

[END TABLE]
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
The Company's common stock is the only class of securities with general voting rights. The Board has set March 8, 2019, as the record date for the Annual Meeting (the "Record Date"). Only shareholders who own common stock at the close of business on the Record Date may attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. 
What are the voting rights of holders of common stock? 
Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. There is no cumulative voting. At the close of business on the Record Date, 65,745,035 shares of common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote. 
How many shares must be present to hold the Annual Meeting? 
Under Washington law, action may be taken on matters submitted to shareholders only if a quorum is present. The presence at the meeting in person or represented by proxy of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding as of the Record Date will constitute a quorum. Shares represented by proxy are deemed present for quorum purposes even if abstention is instructed or if no instructions are given. Subject to certain statutory exceptions, once a share is represented for any purpose at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting. 
ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
How do I vote shares registered in my name? 
If you hold shares that were registered in your name on the Record Date, then you, as the registered holder of those shares, may vote those shares: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By completing, dating and signing your proxy card and returning it to the Company by mail in the envelope  provided (or bringing it with you to the Annual Meeting);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By telephone or through the internet, following the instructions on your proxy card; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote shares held through a broker, bank or other nominee? 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, bank or other nominee, then you are not a record holder of these shares and may vote them only by instructing the registered holder how to vote them. 
You should follow the voting instructions given to you by the broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares. Generally, you will be able to give your voting instructions by mail, by telephone or through the internet. 
The Company's common stock is listed on the NYSE. Under NYSE rules, brokerage firms, banks and other nominees that are members of the NYSE generally have the authority to vote shares when their customers do not give voting instructions. However, NYSE rules prohibit member organizations from voting on certain types of matters without specific instructions from the beneficial owners—if a beneficial owner does not give instructions on such a matter, the member organization cannot vote on that matter. This is called a "broker non-vote." Matters on which NYSE member organizations may not vote without instructions include the election of directors, matters relating to executive compensation and matters relating to certain corporate governance issues. For Avista, this means that NYSE member organizations may not vote on Proposals 1 and 3 unless you have given instructions on how to vote. Please be sure to give specific voting instructions to any broker, bank, or other financial institution that holds your shares so that your shares can be voted. 
How do I vote shares held through an employee plan? 
If you are the beneficial owner of shares through participation in the Company's 401(k) plan, then you are not the record holder of these shares and may vote them only by instructing the plan trustee or agent how to vote them. 
You should follow the voting instructions given to you by the trustee or agent for the 401(k) plan. Generally, you will be able to give your voting instructions by mail, by telephone or through the internet. 
How can I revoke my proxy or change my vote after returning my proxy card or giving voting instructions? 
If you were a registered holder as of the Record Date and returned a proxy card, you may revoke your proxy or change your vote at any time before it is exercised at the Annual Meeting by giving written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company. You may also change your vote by timely delivering a later-dated proxy or a later-dated vote by telephone or through the internet or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. 
If you were not a registered holder as of the Record Date and wish to change or revoke your voting instructions, you should follow the instructions given to you by your broker, bank or other financial institution that holds your shares. 
How many votes are required to elect directors and approve the other proposals? 
Proposal 1—election of directors. A nominee will be elected if the number of votes cast "for" exceeds the number of votes cast "against." Brokers may not vote on this proposal without instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions or broker non-votes with respect to any shares will have no effect on the election of that director since those shares will not be voted at all. If you are the registered holder (and not a broker) of the shares and sign but give no instructions on the proxy card with respect to this proposal, the shares represented by that proxy card will be voted for each of the nominees. Shareholders may not cumulate votes in the election of directors. If an incumbent director does not receive a majority of votes cast with respect to his/her re-election in an uncontested election, he/she would continue to serve a term that would terminate on the date that is the earliest of: (i) the date of the commencement of the term of a new director selected by the Board to fill the office held by such director, (ii) the effective date of the resignation of such director, or (iii) December 31, 2019.

ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Proposal 2—the proposal for ratifying the appointment of the firm of Deloitte as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for 2019, will be approved if the number of votes cast "for" exceeds the number of votes cast "against." Brokers may vote on this proposal without instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions with respect to any shares will have no impact on the outcome of this proposal since those shares will not be voted at all. If you are the registered holder of the shares and sign but give no instructions on the proxy card with respect to this proposal, the shares represented by that proxy card will be voted for this proposal. 
Proposal 3—the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation will be approved if the number of votes cast "for" exceeds the number of votes cast "against." Brokers may not vote on this proposal without instructions from the beneficial owner. Abstentions and broker non-votes with respect to any shares will have no impact on this Proposal since those shares will not be voted at all. If you are the registered holder (and not a broker) of the shares and sign but give no instructions on the proxy card with respect to this proposal, the shares represented by that proxy card will be voted for this proposal. 
Who pays for the proxy solicitation and how will the Company solicit votes? 
The expense of soliciting proxies will be borne by the Company. Proxies will be solicited by the Company primarily by mail, but may also be solicited personally and by telephone at nominal expense to the Company by directors, officers, and regular employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has engaged D.F. King & Co., Inc. at a cost of $7,000 plus out-of-pocket expenses, to solicit proxies in the same manner. The Company will also request banks, brokerage houses, custodians, nominees, and other record holders of the Company's common stock to forward copies of the proxy soliciting material and the Company's 2018 Annual Report to the beneficial owners of such stock, and the Company will reimburse such record holders for their expenses in connection therewith. 
Who can I contact if I have questions or need assistance in voting my shares? 
If you have any questions about the proxy voting process, please contact the broker, bank or other financial institution where you hold your shares. You may also contact our Investor Relations Department at (509) 495-4203. Additionally, the SEC has a website (www.sec.gov/spotlight/proxymatters.shtml) with more information about your rights as a shareholder.

COMPENSATION HIGHLIGHTS 
In 2018, the Compensation and Organization Committee ("Compensation Committee") established performance goals for the Company based on input from the CEO and aligned the short-term and long-term incentive plans with those goals. Our incentive arrangements allow us to focus on maintaining an attractive financial profile while creating long-term value for shareholders and customers. 
As summarized below, the compensation earned by our Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") in 2018 reflects our corporate performance for the fiscal year. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     The Compensation Committee approved base salary adjustments ranging  from 1.4% to 6.6% for our NEOs based on market comparisons, its assessment of individual performance and other factors as discussed in more detail below in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, beginning on page 27.     Our 2018 consolidated Net Income performance was slightly below  target while our other metrics performed above target resulting in a total annual cash incentive payment of 101.4% of target, which was 101.4% of base salary for our CEO and averaged 62.1% of base salary for our other NEOs.     Our Return on Equity (ROE) exceeded target; therefore one-third of our CEOs Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted in 2016 and 2017 and the associated dividend equivalents vested and were paid in early 2019.     Our CEOs 2018 RSU grant vests solely on the basis of time  rather than on the basis of the performance measure used in prior years. One-third of his 2018 RSU grant and the associated dividend equivalents vested and were paid in early 2019. (See Restricted Stock  Units on page 39.)     In early 2019, our NEOs (other than the CEO) received a payout for one-third of their RSUs granted in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, along with the associated dividend equivalents. These RSUs are time-based, and one-third vest each year over a  three-year period.     Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, performance  shares related to Total Shareholder Return (TSR) awarded for the 2016-2018 period, along with associated dividends, were forfeited with no payout because our relative TSR for the period was below threshold performance requirements.     Our Cumulative Earnings Per Share (CEPS) grew more than  3.0% over the three-year performance period (compounded annually), which resulted in payment of 56% of the performance shares related to CEPS granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period and the related dividend equivalents.     Our CEOs pay is 29 times higher than our median employees  pay.

Information With Respect to Director Nominees 
The Board is elected by the shareholders to oversee their interests in the long-term overall success of the Company's business and its financial strength. Our directors have diverse backgrounds and experience and represent a broad spectrum of viewpoints. 
The Board has a robust and effective director nomination and evaluation process in place. The Board has delegated to the Governance Committee the responsibility for reviewing and recommending to the Board nominees for director. The Governance Committee annually reviews with the Board the composition of the Board as a whole and recommends, if necessary, steps to be taken so that the Board reflects the appropriate balance of knowledge, experience, competencies, expertise and diversity, all in the context of an assessment of the needs of the Board and the Company at the time. In evaluating a director candidate, the Governance Committee considers the knowledge, experience, integrity, business acumen and judgment of that candidate; the potential contribution of that candidate to the diversity of backgrounds, experience and competencies that the Board desires to have represented; willingness of that candidate to consider strategic proposals; and any other criteria established by the Board, as well as any core competencies or technical expertise necessary to staff the Board Committees. For longer-serving directors, the Governance Committee also considers the tenure of a director and whether the duration of service impairs such director's independence from management, as demonstrated by the director's relationship with management and the director's participation in Board and Committee deliberations. Directors must be able to commit the requisite time for preparation and attendance at regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings, as well as be able to participate in other matters necessary to ensure that good corporate governance is practiced. The Board is committed to actively seeking out highly qualified women and minority candidates for the Board. The Board takes into account diversity of experience, skills, background, and viewpoint, as well as diversity in race, gender and culture when considering individual candidates. The Board considers the following, among other criteria: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The appropriate size of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The needs of the Company with respect to the particular talents and experience of its directors;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The qualifications, knowledge, competencies, abilities and executive leadership experience of nominees, as well  as work experience at the executive leadership level in his/her field of expertise;

• Familiarity with the energy/utility industry;

• Knowledge of the business of, and/or facilities for, the generation, purchase, transmission and/or distribution  of electric energy and/or the purchase, storage and/or distribution of natural gas;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attributes that would enhance the diversity and perspective of the Board; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Knowledge of the customers, community and employee base.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that it must continue to refresh itself. During the last five years, the Board has added two new independent members partly as a result of retirements and departures of Board members due to professional and personal commitments. There has also been an expansion of qualifications and diversity represented on the Board and the creation of a Lead Director position. The Board consists of directors with a range of experience at policy-making levels in business, government and other areas that are relevant to the Company's activities. The average tenure of the current independent director nominees is 12 years and the average age is 60.

PROPOSAL 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The Governance Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the current members of the Board. Current members of the Board with competencies and experience that are relevant to the Company's business strategies and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board did not wish to continue in service, or if the Governance Committee decided not to nominate a member for re-election, the Committee then would identify the desired qualifications, competencies, expertise, diversity, abilities and experience of a new nominee in light of the criteria set forth above. Current members of the Board are polled for recommendations of individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Governance Committee may also consider candidates recommended by management, employees or others. The Governance Committee may, at its discretion, engage executive search firms to identify qualified and diverse individuals. 
Shareholder Recommendations and Nominations of Director Candidates; Proxy Access 
The Governance Committee will consider written recommendations for candidates for the Board that are made by shareholders. Recommendations must include detailed biographical material indicating the qualifications of the candidate for the Board, and must include a written statement from the candidate of willingness and availability to serve. The Governance Committee will consider any candidate recommended in good faith by a shareholder. The Governance Committee will evaluate director nominees in the same manner as other candidates are evaluated; as discussed above. 
While candidates for director are usually nominated by the Board (after consideration and recommendation by the Governance Committee, as discussed above), shareholders may directly nominate candidates for election as directors. In order to do so, shareholders must follow the procedures set forth in the Company's Bylaws ("Bylaws"), referred to under "2020 Annual Meeting," on page 62. The Chair of the meeting may refuse to acknowledge any nomination not made in compliance with the Bylaws. 
In addition, subject to the satisfaction of additional requirements and conditions, and to the exceptions and limitations set forth in the Bylaws, each registered shareholder (or group of not more than 20 shareholders) who has owned at least 3% of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock for at least three years, may designate one nominee for election as a director of the Company for inclusion in management's proxy soliciting materials for each Annual Meeting of Shareholders; provided, however, that management is not required to include a number of such designees greater than 20% of the total number of members of the Board of Directors; and provided, further, that the designating shareholder(s) and the designated nominee(s) shall also meet the eligibility and other requirements set forth in the Bylaws. 
Nominees 
Ten directors are to be elected to hold office for a one-year term, and until a qualified successor is elected. Upon recommendation from the Governance Committee, the Board has nominated Kristianne Blake, Donald C. Burke, Rebecca A. Klein, Scott H. Maw, Scott L. Morris, Marc F. Racicot, Heidi B. Stanley, R. John Taylor, Dennis P. Vermillion and Janet D. Widmann to be re-elected as directors for a one-year term to expire at the Annual Meeting in 2020 and until their successors shall have been elected. The nominees have consented to serve as directors, and the Board has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable to serve. If a nominee should become unavailable, your shares will be voted for a Board-approved substitute. The Board has concluded that all nominees, with the exception of Messrs. Morris and Vermillion, are independent and that all nominees satisfy the various criteria for nomination as directors. 
On March 22, 2019, Erik J. Anderson, an incumbent independent director who had been nominated by the Board for re-election at the Annual Meeting, notified the Board that he would not stand for re-election. Mr. Anderson's decision was not the result of any disagreement with the Company or the Board on any matter relating to the Company's operations, policies or practices. Following Mr. Anderson's notification, the Board, in accordance with the Company's Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, will reduce the number of directors on the Board to ten, effective as of May 9, 2019. 
Mr. Anderson has been a Board member since 2000. He has been the CEO of WestRiver Group since 2002. He is also the Executive Chairman of Topgolf Entertainment Group, Vice-Chairman of ONEHOPE and a board member of Singularity University. From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Anderson was CEO of Matthew G Norton Co., a private investment company. In addition, his experience includes being partner at the private equity firm of Frazier & Company, LP. and Vice President at Goldman, Sachs & Co. 
Included in each nominee's biography is an assessment of the specific qualifications, competencies, attributes and experience of such nominee based on the qualifications described above.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Corporate Governance Principles 
The Board is responsible for management oversight and providing strategic guidance to the Company. The Board believes that it must continue to renew itself to ensure that its members understand the industry and the markets in which the Company operates. The Board also believes that it must remain well-informed about the positive and negative issues, problems, risks and challenges facing the Company so that the Board members can exercise their fiduciary responsibilities to the Company's shareholders. The Board has adopted Governance Guidelines to address matters including qualification of directors, standards of independence for directors, election of directors, responsibilities and expectations of directors, and evaluation of director and committee performance. The Governance Guidelines are reviewed regularly and updated as necessary. 
Board Leadership Structure 
The Board does not have a policy as to whether the role of CEO should be separate from that of the Chairman, nor, if the roles are separate, whether the Chairman should be selected from the independent directors. The Board selects the Chairman in a manner that it determines to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. This flexibility has allowed the Board to determine whether the role should be separated based on the individuals and the circumstances existing at that time. The Board believes that the Company has been well served by this leadership structure. 
The positions of Chairman and CEO have not been separated, except on one occasion during 2000-2001. Annually, the Board examines its governance practices, including the separation of the positions of the Chairman and the CEO and the independence of the Chairman. The Board has concluded that it should not have a rigid policy as to these issues but, rather, should consider them, together with other relevant factors, to determine the right leadership structure. The Board believes that it needs to retain the ability to balance the independent Board structure with the flexibility to appoint as Chairman someone with hands-on knowledge of and experience in the operations of the Company. Currently, having a single person serve as Chairman and CEO continues to provide unified and responsible leadership and is currently considered the right form of leadership for the Company and the Board. 
The Company is led by Mr. Morris, who has served as its Chairman and CEO since 2008. Given the issues facing the Company and the possible technological, regulatory and legislative changes that may occur in the industry, the Board continues to believe that Mr. Morris provides strategic, operational, and technical expertise and context for the matters considered by the Board. 
Duties of the Chairman 
The Chairman's duties include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chairing all meetings of the Board in a manner that effectively utilizes the Board's time and which takes  full advantage of the skills, expertise and experience that each director has to offer;

Lead Director 
The Board has also established the position of an independent Lead Director. Ms. Blake was elected on May 12, 2017, to serve as Lead Director for a three-year term. The Lead Director's duties include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Maintaining an active, positive and collaborative relationship with the Chairman and the CEO;   
[END TABLE]

• Keeping an open line of communication that provides for dissemination of information to the Board and discussion  before actions are finalized;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Calling meetings of the independent directors when necessary and appropriate; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Working with the Chairman to set meeting schedules and agendas for the Board meetings, including soliciting input  from the other independent directors on items for the Board agendas, to ensure that appropriate agenda items are included and that there is adequate time for discussion of these items.  
[END TABLE]
The Lead Director is available for communications and consultation with major shareholders. The Company has a mechanism for shareholders to communicate with the Lead Director and independent directors as a group, or on an individual basis. (See "Communications with Shareholders" on page 17.) 
Director Independence 
The Board has been, and continues to be, a strong proponent of director independence. It is the policy of the Board that a majority of the directors be independent from management and that the Board not engage in transactions that would conflict with the best interests of the Company's business. 
The Company's corporate governance structures and practices provide for a strong, independent Board and include several independent oversight mechanisms: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of the Board are independent with the exception of Messrs. Morris and Vermillion.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All members of the Board committees are independent, with the exception of Mr. Morris who chairs the  Executive Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In addition to the Executive Committee, the Board has five independent committees, each with a separate  independent chair.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• All Board committees may seek legal, financial or other expert advice from sources independent from management.   
[END TABLE]
The Board believes this governance structure and these practices ensure that strong and independent directors will continue to effectively oversee the Company's management and key issues related to its long-range business plans, long-range strategic decisions, risks and integrity. 
Independence determinations are made on an annual basis at the time the Board approves nominees for election at the next Annual Meeting and, if a director joins the Board between Annual Meetings, at such time. To assist in this determination, the Board adopted Categorical Standards for Independence of Directors (the "Categorical Standards"). As a result of this review, the Board has affirmatively determined that the directors nominated for election at the Annual Meeting are independent of the Company and its management; with the exception of Messrs. Morris and Vermillion, who are considered inside directors because of their employment as CEO and President of the Company, respectively. 
Related Party Transactions 
The Board recognizes that related party transactions present a heightened risk of conflicts of interest and/or improper valuation (or the perception thereof) and, therefore, has adopted a Related Party Transaction Policy, which is followed in connection with all related party transactions involving the Company and specified related persons that include directors (including nominees) and executive officers, certain family members and certain shareholders, all as outlined in the applicable rules of the SEC. During its annual review, the Board considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between directors or members of their immediate families (or any entity of which a director or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner, or significant equity holder) and members of the Company's senior management or their affiliates that are inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
SEC rules require that the Company disclose any related party transaction in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 in the last year. The Governance Committee has determined that the Company has no related party transactions that were reportable for 2018. 
In making its determination, the Board considered that the Company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business have during the last three years purchased products and services from companies at which some of our directors were officers, board members, or investors during 2018. The Board specifically considered the following relationships, which it determined are immaterial to the director's independence: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Stanley is co-owner and chair of the board of a company that has  for many years, commencing prior to the time Ms. Stanley became a director of the Company, sold, and continues to sell, hardware supplies to the Company in arm's-length transactions. The amount paid  to that company in 2018 was $50,485, which did not exceed the threshold amount in the SEC rules. The amount paid in the prior three years was comparable in amount and did not exceed the threshold amount.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Taylor is a board member of a corporation that owns and operates radio stations in Idaho, Washington and  Oregon. In 2018, the Company's advertising agency purchased radio advertisements on some of those stations in arm's-length transactions. The amount paid to that company in 2018 was $9,779, which did  not exceed the threshold amount in the SEC rules. The amount paid in the prior three years was comparable in amount and did not exceed the threshold amount.  
[END TABLE]
Board Meetings 
The Board strongly encourages its members to attend all Board and committee meetings and the Annual Meeting. The Board held eight meetings in 2018. The attendance at all Board and committee meetings was 97.3%. All of the directors attended the prior year's Annual Meeting and all directors are planning to attend the upcoming Annual Meeting. 
Meetings of Independent Directors 
The independent directors meet at each regularly scheduled Board meeting in an executive session without management present. The Lead Director chairs the executive sessions. The Lead Director establishes the agenda for each executive session, and also determines which, if any, other individuals, including members of management and independent advisors, should be available for each such meeting. 
Board Risk Oversight 
The Board plays an active role in the identification, oversight and management of the major risks affecting the Company. The Board's risk oversight process includes receiving reports from members of corporate management on areas of material risk to the Company, including financial, regulatory, energy commodity, operational, compliance, cyber and technology, strategic and external mandate risks. The Board's oversight is conducted primarily through the committees of the Board as set out below in the description of each committee and as set out in their charters, but the full Board retains responsibility for general oversight of risks. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks, and the appropriate Company officer reports on risk to the appropriate Board committee or to the full Board. For example, quarterly, the Director of Risk Management reports on the Company's risk analysis and risk management processes to the Audit Committee; quarterly, the Environmental, Technology & Operations Committee ("Environmental Committee") reviews risks related to the Company's operations; and, annually, the CFO reports to the entire Board on the Company's enterprise risk program and processes. When a committee receives a report from management, the chair of that committee advises the full Board at its next meeting. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate risk oversight, particularly with respect to the interrelationships among various risks. The Annual Report contains a detailed discussion of the material risks to the Company's business and the Company's efforts to manage them. 
CEO Succession Plan 
Succession plans for our CEO and other officers are an important part of the Company's long-term success, and the Company has in place a succession-planning process that reflects the Company's long-term business strategy. The Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of the succession plans for our CEO and other executives of the Company and receives quarterly updates on the plans. Our CEO and the Compensation Committee review those succession plans annually with the 
[BEGIN TABLE]

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
full Board. The succession plans reflect the Board's belief that the Company should regularly identify internal candidates for the CEO and other executive positions and that it should develop those candidates for consideration when a transition is planned or necessary. Accordingly, management has identified internal candidates in various phases of development and has implemented development plans to assure the candidates' readiness. Those development plans identify the candidates' strengths and developmental opportunities, and the Compensation Committee receives periodic updates and regularly reviews the candidates' progress. In addition to internal development pools, to assure selection of the best candidate(s), the Company may recruit externally if such approach would better suit the Company's strategic needs. The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's succession planning process provides a good structure to assure that the Company will have qualified successors for its executive officers. 
In order to have a fully comprehensive CEO succession plan in place, the Board adopted a Contingency CEO Succession Plan to outline the procedures for the temporary appointment of an interim CEO and an interim Chairman to avoid a vacancy in leadership that may occur because of an absence event due to death, illness, disability, or sudden departure of our CEO. 
Director Orientation and Continuing Education 
The Governance Committee and management are responsible for director orientation programs. Orientation programs are designed to familiarize new directors with the Company's business strategies and polices. The Governance Committee is also responsible for director continuing education. Continuing education programs for directors include a combination of internally developed materials and presentations and outside programs presented by third parties. Financial and administrative support is available to directors for attendance at academic or other independent programs. 
Director Retirement Policy 
Directors may not stand for election after age 72. 
Code of Conduct 
The Company has adopted a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our employees, including our CEO (the principal executive officer) and our CFO (the principal financial officer) and the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MATTERS 
Board Committees 
The Board has six standing committees—Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Governance Committee, Finance Committee, Environmental Committee and Executive Committee. Each of these committees is comprised solely of independent directors, with the exception of the Executive Committee, which is chaired by Mr. Morris. The committees, their membership as of the end of 2018, and their principal responsibilities are described below.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION – 2018 
The Board regularly reviews director compensation with the assistance of an outside advisor to ensure that it is appropriate and competitive in light of market circumstances and prevailing best practices for corporate governance for the energy/utility industry. Through this review process, the Board targets overall director compensation to the median of the same peer group as is used to review executive compensation (see page 33 for the peer group.) The elements of director compensation reflect the Board's view that compensation to the independent directors should consist of an appropriate mix of cash and stock. Both the cash and stock portions of the retainer are paid quarterly. Employee directors are not compensated for their Board service. 
Elements of Director Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Annual Retainer (cash and stock)    Board Members:    $ 150,000     
    Directors receive an annual retainer of $150,000, with $75,000 automatically paid in stock. Directors have the option of taking the remaining $75,000 in cash, stock or a combination of both cash and stock.    
   Committee Chair Retainers (Cash)    Audit Committee:    $ 15,000     
   Meeting Fees (Cash)       Board and Committee Meetings       $    1,500         
   Meeting Fees (Cash)       Board and Committee Meetings       $    1,500         
[END TABLE]
The ownership expectation illustrates the Board's philosophy of the importance of stock ownership for directors to further strengthen the commonality of interest between the Board and shareholders. The Governance Committee annually reviews director holdings to determine whether they meet ownership expectations. All directors currently comply, or are making adequate progress towards compliance based on their years of service completed on the Board.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board that outlines its responsibilities and the practices it follows. The charter can be found on the Company's website at www.avistacorp.com. The Audit Committee reviews and assesses the adequacy of its Charter at least annually, and, when appropriate, recommends changes to the Board. 
The Audit Committee is composed of non-management directors who meet the independence and financial literacy requirements of the NYSE and additional, heightened independence criteria applicable to members of the Audit Committee under SEC and NYSE rules. The Audit Committee recommended to the Board the designation of Donald C. Burke as the Audit Committee Financial Expert solely for the purposes of compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Board approved such recommendation. 
Primary Responsibilities and 2018 Action Items 
The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibility for oversight of the Company's systems of internal controls, including, without limitation, those established and maintained pursuant to the Exchange Act, as amended, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Audit Committee also assists the Board in overseeing the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the Company's Code of Conduct, the Company's enterprise risk management program and the independent auditor's qualifications and independence. In addition the Audit Committee participates in external education sessions and educational sessions developed by management, at the request of the Audit Committee. 
In 2018, the Audit Committee held eight meetings. Meeting agendas are established by the Audit Committee's Chair and the Director of Internal Audit. During 2018, among other things, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Prior to the inclusion of the financial statements in the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC for each of the first three quarters of 2018, reviewed the Company's unaudited quarterly financial statements and management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and  results of operations and discussed them with management and Deloitte, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee reviewed with the CEO and CFO their certifications as to the accuracy of these financial  statements and the establishment and maintenance of internal controls and procedures. It also reviewed with management all earnings press releases relating to 2018 annual and quarterly earnings prior to their issuance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• At its February 2019 meeting, reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements and  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018, with management, which has primary responsibility for the financial statements, and with Deloitte, which is  responsible as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the audit of those statements. Based on its review and discussions, the Audit Committee approved the inclusion of the Company's audited financial statements in  the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.  
[END TABLE]

The Audit Committee also discussed the results of the internal audit examinations, received and reviewed quarterly risk management reports, and received and reviewed annual compliance, technology and business continuity reports.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviewed and discussed with Deloitte all written communications required by the PCAOB Ethics and Independence  Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence; also discussed with Deloitte its internal quality-control reviews and procedures, the results of its external reviews and inspections, and any relationships that could be  reasonably thought to bear on its objectivity and independence.

This report is provided by the following independent directors, who comprise the Audit Committee: 
PROPOSAL 2—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
The Audit Committee has the direct responsibility to hire, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the Company's independent auditors and, in its capacity as a committee of the Board, is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation and general oversight of the work of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee has appointed Deloitte, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, for continuing audit work in 2019. 
Shareholder approval is not required for the appointment of Deloitte. However, the appointment is being submitted to shareholders for ratification. Should the shareholders fail to ratify the appointment of Deloitte, such failure (1) would have no effect on the validity of such appointment for 2019 (given the difficulty and expense of changing the independent registered public accounting firm mid-way through a year) and (2) would be a factor to be taken into account, together with other relevant factors, by the Audit Committee in the selection and appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm for 2020 (but would not necessarily be the determining factor). 
Annual Evaluation and Selection of the Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee annually reviews Deloitte's independence and performance in deciding whether to retain Deloitte or engage another independent auditor. In the course of these reviews, the Audit Committee considers, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte's historical and recent performance on the Company's audit.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte's technical expertise and knowledge of the Company's business and industry.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The quality and candor of Deloitte's communications with the Audit Committee and management.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte's independence.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The quality and efficiency of the services provided by Deloitte, including input from management on  Deloitte's performance and how effectively Deloitte demonstrated its independent judgment, objectivity and professional skepticism.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• External data on audit quality and performance, including recent PCAOB reports on Deloitte and its peers.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The appropriateness of Deloitte's fees for audit and non-audit  services.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Deloitte's tenure as the Company's independent auditor, including the benefits of having a long-tenured  auditor.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The controls and processes that help ensure Deloitte's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Long Tenure Benefits 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Higher audit quality. Through years of experience with Avista, Deloitte (including its predecessors) has  gained institutional knowledge of and deep expertise regarding Avista's operations and businesses, accounting policies and practices, and internal control over financial reporting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Efficient fee structure. Deloitte's aggregate fees are competitive with peer companies because of  Deloitte's familiarity with our business.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• No onboarding or educating new auditor. Bringing on a new auditor requires a significant time commitment  that could distract from management's focus on financial reporting and internal controls.

[END TABLE]
PROPOSAL 2—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
Independence Controls 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Thorough Audit Committee oversight. The committee's oversight includes meetings with Deloitte (the  full committee meets with Deloitte at least four times per year and the chair at least eight times per year), a comprehensive annual evaluation by the Audit Committee in determining whether to engage Deloitte, and a committee-directed process for  selecting the lead partner.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Rigorous limits on non-audit services. The Audit Committee has a  policy that requires preapproval of all non-audit services, subject to a de minimis exception, and Deloitte is engaged only when it is best-suited for the job.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong internal Deloitte independence process. Deloitte conducts periodic internal quality reviews of its  audit work, assesses the adequacy of partners and other personnel working on the Company's account, and rotates the lead partner every five years.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strong regulatory framework. Deloitte, as an independent registered public accounting firm, is subject to  PCAOB inspections, peer reviews, and PCAOB and SEC oversight.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that Deloitte is independent and that it is in the best interests of Avista and our shareholders to retain it as our independent auditor for 2019. 
Audit Fees and All Other Fees 
The Audit Committee oversees the fees paid to Deloitte for audit and non-audit services and receives periodic reports on the amount of fees paid. The aggregate fees for audit and other services provided by Deloitte in 2018 and 2017 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees(a)    $ 2,077,745      $ 2,029,449

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services of Independent Auditors 
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed. The Audit Committee has adopted what it terms its Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy (the "Policy"), which sets forth the procedures and conditions pursuant to which services proposed to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm may be pre-approved. All services provided by Deloitte in 2018 and 2017 were pre-approved in accordance with the Policy adopted by the Audit Committee. 
The SEC's rules establish two alternatives for pre-approving services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. Engagements for proposed services may either be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee (specific pre-approval) or entered into pursuant to detailed pre-approval policies and procedures established by the Audit Committee, as 
PROPOSAL 2—RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF DELOITTE AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019 
long as in the latter circumstance the Audit Committee is informed on a timely basis of any engagement entered into on such basis (general pre-approval). The Audit Committee combined these two approaches in its Policy after concluding that doing so will result in an effective and efficient procedure to pre-approve services to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
As set forth in the Policy, except for those categories of services for which the Policy requires specific pre-approval, engagements may be entered into pursuant to general pre-approvals established by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee will periodically review and generally pre-approve the categories of services that may, as contemplated by the Policy, be provided by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee, and will establish budgeted amounts for such categories. The Audit Committee may add to or subtract from the list of general pre-approved services from time-to-time, based on subsequent determinations by the Audit Committee. Any general pre-approval will be set forth in writing and included in the Audit Committee minutes. Unless an engagement of the independent auditor to provide a particular service is entered into pursuant to and in accordance with the Audit Committee's general pre-approval then in effect, the engagement will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
Proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels or budget amounts previously established by the Audit Committee will also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee intends to pre-approve services, whether specifically or pursuant to general pre-approvals, only if the provision of such services is consistent with SEC and PCAOB rules on auditor independence and all other applicable laws and regulations. In rendering specific or general pre-approvals, the Audit Committee will consider whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of specific services, or categories of services, would be inconsistent with the independence of the auditor. 
Hiring Restrictions for Deloitte Employees 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy that has certain restrictions on the Company's hiring of any Deloitte partner, director, manager, staff member, advising member of the department of professional practice, reviewing tax professional and any other individuals responsible for providing audit assurance on any aspect of Deloitte's audit and review of the Company's financial statements. 
Other Information 
The Company has been advised by Deloitte that neither the firm, nor any covered person of the firm, has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in any capacity in the Company or its subsidiaries. A representative of Deloitte is expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if he/she desires to do so, and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the shares of common stock voting in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte as the  Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.

• Our compensation philosophy and objectives; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The elements of the Company's executive compensation program.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Summary 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee established performance goals for the Company based on input from the CEO and aligned the short-term and long-term incentive plans with those goals. Our incentive arrangements allow us to focus on maintaining an attractive financial profile while creating long-term value for shareholders and customers. 
As summarized below, the compensation earned by our NEOs in 2018 reflects our corporate performance for the fiscal year. 
2018 Executive Compensation Highlights 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee approved base salary adjustments ranging from 1.4% to 6.6% for our NEOs based on  market comparisons, its assessment of individual performance and other factors as discussed in more detail below in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, beginning on this page.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our 2018 consolidated Net Income performance was slightly below target while our other metrics performed above  target resulting in a total annual cash incentive payment of 101.4% of target, which was 101.4% of base salary for our CEO and averaged 62.1% of base salary for our other NEOs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our ROE exceeded target; therefore one-third of our CEO's RSUs  granted in 2016 and 2017 and the associated dividend equivalents vested and were paid in early 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO's 2018 RSU grant vests solely on the basis of time rather than on the basis of the performance  measure used in prior years. One-third of his 2018 RSU grant and the associated dividend equivalents vested and were paid in early 2019. (See "Restricted Stock Units" on page 39.)   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In early 2019, our NEOs (other than the CEO) received a payout for  one-third of their RSUs granted in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018, along with the associated dividend equivalents. These RSUs are time-based, and one-third vest each year  over a three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consistent with our pay for performance philosophy, performance shares related to TSR awarded for the 2016-2018  period, along with associated dividends, were forfeited with no payout because our relative TSR for the period was below threshold performance requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEPS grew more than 3.0% over the three-year performance period (compounded annually), which resulted in  payment of 56% of the performance shares related to CEPS granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period and the related dividend equivalents.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our CEO's pay is 29 times higher than our median employee's pay.  
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
Business Results Impact Compensation 
The Compensation Committee, with input from the CEO, establishes target compensation for our NEOs at the beginning of each performance period. Actual pay varies above or below the target based on individual, organizational, and stock performance. Because a substantial portion of each NEO's compensation is in the form of equity, our NEO's actual compensation aligns closely with changes in the stock price. 
We employ several quantitative criteria to assess the performance of our NEOs. Our objectives include achieving the EPS target and achieving favorable TSR relative to our peers, reducing our costs per customer, improving customer satisfaction, improving our response time to natural gas emergency calls, and improving reliability of service. The charts below illustrate the relationship between our 2018 financial performance targets and our actual performance.

Chief Executive Officer: 2018 Target Compensation vs. Realized Compensation 
The chart below illustrates the relationship between our 2018 performance and our CEO's 2018 compensation. 
2018 actual pay realized by the CEO was 70% of targeted value Target Realized Base Salary 2018 Annual Incentive RSUs* PSUs* 
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  The target amount shown for our CEO's RSUs represent the grant date fair value of the portion of the 2016  and 2017 awards that could have vested if the 2018 ROE performance condition was met. Also represented in the RSUs is the grant date fair value of the portion of the 2018 award that could have vested if the CEO was not terminated on  December 31, 2018. The target amount for the CEO's performance shares represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the 2016 awards that could have vested if the TSR and the three-year CEPS performance conditions were met for the  2016-2018 performance period. The amount shown as the actual compensation realized by our CEO for 2018 includes his base salary, the actual annual cash incentive plan amount paid in early 2019 for 2018 performance, the value, as of the vesting date,  of the RSUs that vested in early 2019 for 2018 performance, and the actual value, as of the vesting date, of the performance shares that were realized for the 2016-2018 performance period. In each case, the value of vested RSUs and performance share  units ("PSUs") includes dividends.

2018 Say on Pay Advisory Vote 
At the May 2018 Annual Meeting, shareholders expressed substantial support for the compensation of our NEOs, with approximately 96.28% of the votes cast for the Say on Pay advisory resolution approving our executive compensation. Although this was a slightly lower percentage of support than the previous year, we still view this outcome as a signal of strong shareholder support for our executive compensation philosophy, policies and practices. 
Following the 2018 Annual Meeting, we discussed our overall approach to executive compensation and governance and took into consideration feedback we received from meetings with various shareholders. Based on the feedback received and the results of the Say on Pay advisory vote, we did not make any significant changes during 2018 to our overall approach to executive compensation and governance. 
Decision Making Process 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee makes all compensation decisions regarding our CEO, our other NEOs and other executive officers, including the level of cash compensation and equity awards. Our CEO annually reviews each executive officer's performance ratings from his or her direct manager and presents the ratings to the Compensation Committee for its consideration with respect to salary adjustments, annual incentive opportunity and annual equity award amounts. 
Role of the Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee selects and retains an independent compensation consultant to support its oversight of our executive compensation programs. For 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners ("Meridian") as its independent compensation consultant. Meridian provides the Compensation Committee consulting services solely relating to executive compensation and governance matters. In accordance with NYSE rules, the Compensation Committee determined that Meridian is independent and, further, that there were no conflicts of interest. 
A representative of Meridian attended Compensation Committee meetings in 2018 and advised the Compensation Committee on the principal aspects of executive compensation, including the competitiveness of program design and award values and specific analyses with respect to our executive officers. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
30      Avista     
[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
The Compensation Committee determines the work to be performed by Meridian. Meridian works with our Sr. Vice President and CHRO and her staff to gather data required in preparing Meridian's analyses for Compensation Committee review. Meridian provides services or advice to management only to the extent requested by the Compensation Committee. 
Meridian interacts with management to gather information and obtain recommendations, but the Compensation Committee Chair determines if and when Meridian's advice and materials can be shared with management. When important pay decisions are made, Meridian provides advice to the Compensation Committee in an executive session without Company management present. This approach ensures that the Compensation Committee receives objective advice from Meridian so that the Compensation Committee can make independent decisions about executive pay. 
Role of Management 
Meridian advises the Compensation Committee as to the amount and form of executive compensation for all executive officers including our CEO, and our CEO also provides input on the recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to the compensation of all of our executive officers (other than the CEO). 
At the request of the Compensation Committee, both the Sr. Vice President/CHRO and our CEO regularly attend Compensation Committee meetings, excluding the executive sessions during which their respective compensation and other matters are discussed. 
Risk Mitigation Overview 
The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In establishing pay practices for the Company, the Compensation Committee's goal is to design a compensation structure that does not encourage inappropriate risk-taking by employees or executive officers. The following features of the compensation structure reflect this approach: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Short and long-term incentive payments are capped;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash incentive design balances key performance metrics that are focused on financial results and system  sustainability over time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total compensation program does not guarantee bonuses and has multiple financial and non-financial performance measures;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee reviews both short-term and long-term financial scenarios to ensure the plan design  does not encourage executives to take excessive risks but also does not discourage appropriate risks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership guidelines are in place to strengthen the alignment of the financial interests of executives with  those of shareholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Officers are prohibited from engaging in short-sales, pledging, or hedging the economic interest in their Company  shares; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company maintains a formal recoupment (i.e., clawback) policy.  
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
The Compensation Committee approves and implements a compensation program that focuses executives on the achievement of specific annual, long-term, and strategic goals aligning executives' interests with those of shareholders by rewarding performance that maintains and improves shareholder value. The Compensation Committee believes that the overall compensation of our senior executives should be weighted toward variable performance-based compensation. A significant portion of compensation is linked with goals related to specific items of corporate performance that are likely to produce long-term shareholder and customer value. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
The charts below show the portion of target compensation that is variable and therefore is "at risk" for our CEO and the average for our other NEOs. Variable compensation includes: annual incentives, RSUs and performance shares. The charts also show the portion of target compensation for our CEO and the average target compensation for our other NEOs that is directly linked to share value, including RSUs and performance shares. 
Competitive Analysis and Peer Group 
The Compensation Committee believes it is important to provide a compensation structure that is competitive with compensation paid to comparable executives of companies within the energy/utility industry to ensure the Company attracts and retains quality employees in key positions to lead the Company. To achieve this objective, the Compensation Committee works with Meridian to conduct an annual competitive review of its total compensation program for our CEO and other NEOs. Through the review process, the Compensation Committee generally targets overall total compensation levels (base, short-term incentive and long-term incentives) at the median of the peer group. Pay components for an individual NEO may be higher or lower than the median depending on an individual's role, responsibilities, and performance within the Company. The Compensation Committee believes this target positioning is effective to attract and retain our executives. 
The Compensation Committee annually compares each element of NEO total compensation against a peer group of publicly-traded companies within the energy/utility industry of similar revenue size and market capitalization. For 2018, our NEO compensation was compared with market data, as disclosed in proxy statements, from a customized group of utilities ("Proxy Peer Group"). This group is designed to be representative of the Company's business, size and competitive market for talent. All market data from the Proxy Peer Group was gathered from publicly available sources, including proxy statements, Form 8-Ks, and Form 4s. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
The use of publicly disclosed data allows the Company to maintain a consistent peer group without being restricted by private survey participation, which varies from year to year. For the Proxy Peer Group in 2018, the Compensation Committee used sixteen companies from the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Utilities Index. The index group can change slightly from year to year due to changes in company size and weightings determined by S&P. There were four changes from the index group used in 2017. S&P removed Cleco Corp., Talen Energy Resources and Westar Energy, Inc. from the index because they were each acquired. S&P moved Alliant Energy to the S&P 500 and added Northwestern Corp. to the index group. The median revenues and market capitalization of the Proxy Peer Group were $2.2 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively. This compares with Avista's revenues of $1.5 billion and market capitalization of $3.4 billion. The companies comprising the Proxy Peer Group were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Aqua America, Inc.    MDU Resources Group, Inc.    PNM Resources, Inc. 
 Atmos Energy Corporation    National Fuel Gas Company    UGI Corporation 
 Black Hills Corporation    New Jersey Resources Corporation    Vectren Corporation 
 Great Plains Energy, Inc.    Northwestern Corporation    WGL Holdings, Inc. 
 Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.    OGE Energy Corporation    
 IDACORP, Inc.    ONE Gas, Inc.    
[END TABLE]
As in prior years, for 2018 the Compensation Committee also used the Willis Towers Watson Energy Services Executive Compensation database for additional compensation data on comparable diversified energy companies with revenues between $1 billion and $3 billion and with median revenues of $1.9 billion. The advantage of also considering survey information is that it provides competitive data for all of our executive officer positions. The Compensation Committee uses all of these sources of data to help it make informed decisions about market compensation practices. 
Performance Management 
The Compensation Committee believes in aligning pay with performance. To help accomplish that alignment, all executives receive annual performance reviews conducted by their direct manager, and the Compensation Committee reviews each NEO's performance ratings. For each NEO, the Compensation Committee also reviews the results of the Company's 360-degree survey, which is a standardized performance survey conducted periodically on multiple leadership performance categories that includes feedback from peers within the Company, direct reports, and the NEO's direct manager. 
At the beginning of each calendar year, the Compensation Committee asks our CEO to develop specific performance targets and goals for his role based on strategic goals set by the Board. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves our CEO's goals at its annual February meeting and presents those goals to the full Board for its information and review. The Compensation Committee quarterly reviews our CEO's performance relative to his targets and provides quarterly status updates to the full Board. At the end of the year, the Compensation Committee reviews our CEO's year-end results as part of its overall CEO annual performance review process. 
Base Salary 
Our NEOs are provided with an annual base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the year. The Compensation Committee reviews the base salary of all executive officers at least annually. The factors that influence the Compensation Committee's decisions in setting the annual base salary for our NEOs include the market data provided by its consultant and each NEO's job complexity, experience and breadth of knowledge in the utility and diversified energy industry. The Compensation Committee also considers each NEO's responsibilities, which may include electric and natural gas utility operations, as well as subsidiary operations, and recognizes that the Company operates in several states, which requires quality relationships and interaction with multiple regulatory agencies. 
2018 Base Salaries 
In addition to considering the factors noted above, the Compensation Committee also reviews performance results from the prior year to determine how our CEO performed against specific targets and operational goals established at the beginning of the prior year. Our CEO's annual performance goals for 2017 were generally related to strategic planning, financial performance, safety targets, diversified energy resource management, regulatory and legislative matters, succession planning, governance and customer value delivery. When reviewing the CEO's base salary for 2018, the Compensation Committee agreed that our CEO had met the established goals for 2017 performance. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
The Compensation Committee also reviewed performance ratings of each of the other NEOs to determine appropriate adjustments in base salary. The Committee considered market data and individual performance in determining 2018 salary increases. The Compensation Committee noted that the market data provided by Meridian showed that the base salary for one of our NEOs, Dennis Vermillion, was below the market median and accordingly, he received a slightly greater increase than the other NEOs. After the adjustments shown below, base salaries generally are within the range of the median of the Proxy Peer Group. The table below outlines the changes to base salary in 2018 for our NEOs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 S. L. Morris    $ 820,000        3.0%    $ 844,500   
 M. T. Thies    $ 420,200        3.0%    $ 433,000

 K. S. Feltes    $ 355,000        1.4%    $ 360,000   
[END TABLE]
2018 Executive Officer Annual Cash Incentive 
The 2018 Executive Officer Annual Cash Incentive Plan (the "Cash Incentive Plan") was designed to align the interests of our NEOs and senior management with both shareholder and customer interests to achieve overall positive financial and operational performance for the Company. The Cash Incentive Plan reflects these goals by having 60% of the total incentive opportunity tied to Consolidated Net Income, which was used in 2018 instead of Consolidated Earnings Per Share based on the assumption that the Hydro One merger would be completed in 2018, and the remaining 40% tied to key components of utility operation. Each metric is independent, which allows the Cash Incentive Plan to pay a portion of the award upon the attainment of one goal even if the other goals are not met. 
The Cash Incentive Plan's performance metrics are based on factors that are essential for the long-term success of the Company, and, with the exception of the Net Income goal, are identical to performance metrics used in the Company's annual cash incentive plan for non-executive employees. The Compensation Committee believes that having similar metrics for both the Cash Incentive Plan and the non-executive plan encourages employees at all levels of the Company to focus on common objectives.

The Compensation Committee sets target goals for these performance metrics that are rigorous, but reasonably achievable with strong management performance. Maximum performance levels were designed to be difficult to achieve given historical performance and the Company's forecasted results at the time the performance metrics were approved. Over the last ten years, the actual performance results of the Plans have averaged 104% of target and ranged from a low of 41% of target to a high of 150% of target as shown in the chart below. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
2018 Executive Officer Annual Cash Incentive Target Award Opportunity 
Individual annual cash incentive awards are set as a percentage of base salary. The Compensation Committee compares annual cash incentive opportunity levels against the Proxy Peer Group. As discussed previously, the Compensation Committee targets overall total compensation levels, which include base salaries, short-term incentives and long-term incentives at the median of the Proxy Peer Group. The Compensation Committee noted that the market data provided by Meridian showed that the annual cash incentive opportunity level for one of our NEOs, Dennis Vermillion, was below the market median and accordingly he received a slightly greater opportunity than the other NEOs. For 2018, the Compensation Committee maintained the target opportunity of 100% of base salary for the CEO and the target opportunity of 60% of base salary for each NEO except for Dennis Vermillion's target opportunity which was increased from 60% to 65% of base salary. The actual total amounts paid could increase (up to 150% of target) or decrease (as low as 0% of target) depending on the Company's actual performance. 
2018 Results for the Executive Officer's Annual Cash Incentive Plan 
After the end of the year, the Compensation Committee assesses the performance of the Company against each Plan objective, comparing the actual year-end results to the pre-determined threshold, target, and exceeds levels for each objective, and an overall percentage amount for meeting the objectives is calculated and audited. The results also are reviewed by the Finance Committee. 
Based on this review, at its February 2019 meeting, the Compensation Committee determined that the Company fell slightly below the target performance level for Consolidated Net Income. The Company exceeded the target performance level for O&M Cost Per Customer and met the targets for all three non-financial metrics: customer satisfaction, reliability and response time. The actual performance result of the 2018 executive officer's annual cash incentive plan was 101.4% of target. As a result, and at the same meeting, the Compensation Committee authorized payment of cash incentives equal to 101.4% of base salary (101.4% of 100%) for our CEO, and an average of 62.1% of base salary (101.4% of 61%) for all other NEOs. 
Long-Term Equity Compensation 
The Compensation Committee believes that equity-based compensation is the most effective way to create a long-term link between shareholder returns and the compensation provided to NEOs and other key management. This program encourages participants to focus on long-term Company performance and provides an opportunity for executive officers and designated key employees to maintain ownership in the Company through grants of Company stock that can be earned based on either service or performance, and sometimes both, over a three-year cycle. Through the use of long-term performance awards and RSUs, the Company can compensate executives for sustained increases in the Company's stock performance, as well as long-term growth relative to its peer group for the relevant cycle. 
The Company's current Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") authorizes various types of equity awards. As with all the components of executive compensation, the Compensation Committee determines all material aspects of the long-term incentive awards—who receives an award, the form of the award, the amount of the award, the timing of the award, as well as any other aspect of the award it may deem material. For 2018, our program continued to be heavily weighted toward "performance-based" equity awards, 75% of the value being granted in the form of performance shares and 25% being granted in the form of RSUs that vest based on continued service. 
When deciding grant amounts, the Compensation Committee considers competitive market data and which executives have the greatest ability to influence overall Company performance. In addition, and as previously discussed, the Compensation Committee targets overall total compensation levels, which include base salaries, short-term incentives and long-term incentives at the median of the Proxy Peer Group. 
Awards are generally granted each year at the February Compensation Committee meeting and the granting of awards is not coordinated with the release of material non-public information.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
Performance-Based Equity Awards 
Our performance-based equity awards are designed to provide a direct link to the long-term interests of shareholders by assuring that shares will be paid only if the Company attains specified performance levels. In 2018, as in 2017, 50% of the awards were contingent on TSR relative to our peers and 25% was measured by our CEPS over a three-year period. In 2018, the Compensation Committee considered market data provided by Meridian regarding the total compensation levels for our CEO and all other NEOs to the market median of the Proxy Peer Group. In order to maintain target award values comparable to prior years, the target number of performance shares granted to our NEOs declined in 2018 to account for the increase in share price since the 2017 grant. 
The peer group for TSR performance purposes consists of all companies comprising the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Utilities Index, as discussed previously, as of January 1 in the first year of the three-year performance cycle. Throughout the course of the performance cycle, companies may be added or dropped from the index by S&P due to mergers or other activities. At the end of the cycle, new companies that were added to the index are included in the rankings as if they had been in the ranking from the beginning, provided there is sufficient trading history to include them in the final calculation. When a company is dropped from the index, everything related to the company is excluded as if it were never in the index. The amount of the payment with respect to any award is determined at the end of the three-year performance cycle based on the Company's percentile rate-of-return ranking compared to that of the companies in the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Utilities Index, and is payable at the Compensation Committee's discretion in cash, shares of Company common stock, or a combination of both. Dividend equivalents on performance awards are accumulated and paid upon vesting if the awards vest and are paid based on performance. If the Company's relative TSR over the three-year performance period is below the threshold performance required to earn the award, then the accumulated dividends are forfeited as well. 
The second performance metric, CEPS, aligns with current competitive practices within the peer group based on market data provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant. Each year the Compensation Committee reviews and establishes a threshold, target, and maximum performance level for CEPS. The Compensation Committee seeks to establish performance levels that assure the goals are realistic enough to be achievable yet difficult enough to incentivize outstanding performance. The amount of the payment with respect to any award is determined at the end of the three-year performance cycle based on the Company's earnings, and is payable at the Compensation Committee's discretion in cash, shares of Company common stock, or a combination of both. Dividend equivalents on performance awards are accumulated and paid upon vesting if the awards vest and are paid based on performance. If the Company's CEPS over the three-year performance period is below the threshold performance required to earn the award, then the accumulated dividends are forfeited as well. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
Range of Award Opportunity for Performance Shares 
Each year, the Compensation Committee approves a grant to each NEO of a target number of performance shares that vest over a three-year performance cycle based on achieving pre-determined performance goals. The number of performance shares that may be earned at the end of the cycle can range from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance shares granted, depending upon the level of performance. 
Individual grant amounts are set at the beginning of each year. The Compensation Committee compares long-term incentive opportunity levels against the Proxy Peer Group. As discussed previously, the Compensation Committee targets overall total compensation levels that include base salaries, short-term incentives and long-term incentives to the market median. The table below shows the changes made to the target number of performance share grants in 2018 for the 2018 through 2020 performance period for our NEOs. As discussed previously, adjustments were made to the number of performance shares granted to our NEOs to maintain target award values comparable to prior year values given the increase in share price since the prior grant.

2016-2018 Performance Shares Settlement 
For performance shares linked to the Company's TSR and granted in 2016 for the performance period ending December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee held a special meeting on January 10, 2019, to review, certify, and settle the issuance of shares to executive officers. The Company's TSR was 49% during the three-year performance cycle, which placed the Company at the 24th percentile among the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Utilities Index. Since the results were below threshold performance level, no shares were earned and no cash dividend equivalents were paid on performance shares covered by the 2016 grant. 
For performance shares linked to the Company's CEPS and granted in 2016 for the performance period ending December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed, certified and settled the issuance of shares to executive officers at its February 2019 meeting. The Company's CEPS grew more than 3.0% over the three-year performance period (compounded annually). Based on these results, our CEO and our other NEOs earned 56% of the performance share awards granted in 2016 vesting on the basis of CEPS. Accrued cash dividend equivalents were paid out on the same percentage of performance shares covered by the 2016 grant.

Restricted Stock Units 
The Company awards RSUs to improve retention and link compensation to the value of the Company common stock. For all NEOs and other executive officers other than our CEO, the vesting of RSUs is time-based, and the RSUs vest and shares are issued in three equal annual increments, provided the executive remains employed by the Company on the last day of each year of the three-year period. Dividend equivalents on time-based RSUs accrue and are paid in cash if and when the underlying RSUs vest. If the related RSUs are forfeited, the accrued cash dividends are also forfeited. 
Individual grant amounts are set at the beginning of each year. The Compensation Committee compares long-term incentive opportunity levels against the Proxy Peer Group. The table below shows the changes made to the target number of RSU grants in 2018 for the 2018 through 2020 vesting period for our NEOs. As discussed previously, adjustments were made to the

As a result of the changes to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code for awards granted after 2017, eliminating the ability to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million whether or not the compensation qualified as "performance-based compensation," in 2018, the Compensation Committee granted our CEO RSUs that vest on the basis of time rather requiring performance-based vesting, as they had done in prior years. For our CEO, the RSUs granted in 2018 vest and shares are issued in three equal annual increments provided our CEO remains employed by the Company on the last day of each year of the three-year period. Dividend equivalents on time-based RSUs accrue and are paid in cash if and when the underlying RSUs vest. If the related RSUs are forfeited, the accrued cash dividends are also forfeited. 
For our CEO, the RSUs granted in 2016 and 2017 vest and shares are issued in three equal annual increments provided our CEO remains employed by the Company on the last day of each year of the three-year period and the Company has attained the performance target. In order for any annual portion of our CEO's RSUs granted in 2016 and 2017 to vest, the Company's ROE for the year must exceed a hurdle rate equal to the Company's weighted average cost of debt. Dividend equivalents accrue on the unvested RSUs and, if the performance target is met, the dividend equivalents are paid in cash at the same time that the underlying RSUs vest and are issued in shares. If the Company does not achieve the minimum ROE performance target for the year, no shares or dividend equivalents are earned by our CEO. 
Using a weighted average cost of debt, the Compensation Committee determined early in 2018 that a 5.70% ROE hurdle rate was appropriate for 2018. For 2018, we achieved an ROE of 7.89% and the hurdle rate was met; therefore, one-third of our CEO's RSUs granted during each of 2016 and 2017 vested and shares were issued along with the associated cash dividend equivalents. 
The following chart shows the value realized by our CEO because the Company achieved the 2018 hurdle rate and by our other NEOs for the RSUs that were vested and issued along with the associated cash dividend equivalents.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
The Company's retirement plan provides a traditional retirement benefit based on employees' compensation and years of credited service. Earnings credited for retirement purposes represent the final average annual base salary of the employee for the highest 36 consecutive months during the last 120 months of service with the Company. 
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan 
In addition to the Company's retirement plan for all employees, the Company provides additional pension benefits through the SERP to the Company's executive officers. Details of the SERP benefits and the amounts accrued by each NEO are found in the Pension Benefits section on page 50. 
The Compensation Committee believes the pension plans and the SERP are an important part of our NEOs compensation. These plans are market competitive within the energy/utility industry and serve a critically important role in the retention of senior executives. The benefits increase each year these executives remain employed, thereby encouraging our most senior executives to remain employed and continue their work on behalf of shareholders. 
Executive Deferred Compensation 
The Company also maintains an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "EDC Plan"). Each NEO may voluntarily participate in this EDC Plan on the same terms and conditions as all other eligible employees who reach a set compensation level. This EDC Plan is competitive in the market and provides eligible employees and executives with a tax-efficient savings method. Additional information about this EDC Plan, including 2018 contributions and year-end account balances, can be found in the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan table on page 51. 
Company Self-Funded Death Benefit Plan 
To provide death benefits to beneficiaries of executive officers who die during their term of office, the Company maintains an executive death benefit plan that will provide an executive officer's designated beneficiary with a lump sum payment equal to twice the executive officer's final annual base salary, payable within 30 days of the executive's death. Prior to January 1, 2008, the plan continued to provide the death benefit to the beneficiaries of executives who died after retirement. Effective January 1, 2008, the post-retirement death benefit was eliminated for any individual who became an executive officer after that date. Individuals who were executive officers prior to January 1, 2008, including all of our NEOs, continue to be eligible for the post-retirement death benefit. For an officer who is eligible for the post-retirement death benefit, in the event of his or her death after retirement, the designated beneficiary will receive a lump sum equal to twice the retired executive officer's total annual pension benefit. Death benefits are paid from the general assets of the Company. The present value of this benefit for each NEO can be found in the Potential Payment Upon Termination or Change in Control ("CIC") Tables starting on page 51. 
Supplemental Executive Disability Plan 
The Supplemental Executive Disability Plan provides benefits to the Company's executive officers who become disabled during employment. The plan provides a benefit equal to 60% of the executive officer's annual salary at the date of disability reduced by the aggregate amount, if any, of disability benefits provided for under the Company's Long-Term Disability Plan for employees, workers' compensation benefits, and any benefit payable under provisions of the Federal Social Security Act. Benefits will be payable until the earlier of the executive officer's date of retirement or age 65. The present value of this benefit for each NEO can be found in the Potential Payment Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables on page 51. 
Change in Control and Severance Benefits 
The Compensation Committee believes it is in the interest of shareholders to provide severance to our executive officers in the event of a Change in Control ("CIC"), thereby reducing the inherent conflict of our executive officers pursuing a transaction that may result in their personal job loss. No CIC agreements provide cash severance benefits in excess of three times base salary and bonus. The Company's CIC agreements all have double triggers that provide for a severance payment only upon the occurrence of both a CIC and qualified termination. 
Additional information regarding the CIC agreements, including definitions of key terms and a quantification of benefits that would have been received by our NEOs had termination occurred on December 31, 2018, due to a CIC, is found in the Potential Payment Upon Termination or Change in Control Tables on page 51. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A") 
CIC agreements entered into on or after November 13, 2009, do not provide for excise tax gross-ups. CIC agreements entered into before that date contain gross-ups, but the gross-up provisions have been modified to eliminate the gross-up payment if the golden parachute excise tax imposed by Code Sections 280G and 4999 could be avoided by reducing an executive's total CIC payments (other than the gross-up) by 10% or less. 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) ("Code") 
Code Section 162(m) limits the tax deduction that a publicly held corporation may take with respect to annual compensation in excess of $1 million for any fiscal year paid to certain NEOs. For the periods before 2018, the $1 million limit did not apply to compensation that qualified as "performance-based" compensation, as defined by the Code. For taxable years beginning after 2017, the exception for "performance-based" compensation was repealed, and the 162(m) limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all NEOs. As a result, compensation in excess of $1 million on account of services after 2017 paid to the NEOs will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. When consistent with the Company's compensation philosophy and objectives, the Compensation Committee structures its compensation plans so that the related compensation expense may be deductible for tax purposes. However, in light of the need to maintain flexibility in administering our executive compensation program and the recent changes in the tax law, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to recommend to the Board executive compensation that will not be deductible. 
Compensation Governance Matters 
Recoupment Policy 
The Compensation Committee believes that if the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement as a result of misconduct or a material error, incentive payouts based on the original results should be revised. Therefore, the Board has adopted a formal recoupment policy applicable to incentive compensation awards. The policy authorizes the Company to recover incentive payouts if those payouts are based on performance results that are subsequently revised or restated to levels that would have produced payouts lower than the original incentive plan payouts. If misconduct or material error results in a restatement of financial results, the Compensation Committee may recommend that the Board either require forfeiture of incentive awards or seek to recover appropriate portions of the executive officer's compensation for the relevant period, in addition to other disciplinary actions that might be appropriate based on the circumstances. The Board, in its discretion, would determine when the need for a recoupment is triggered, to whom the recoupment would apply and the recoupment mechanism. 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Board has implemented stock ownership guidelines for the Company's executive officers. The guidelines require executive officers to own shares and achieve set ownership levels based on a formula designated as a multiple of salary within a target timeframe of five years from their employment date or date of promotion, as described within the program guidelines. The value for each executive's ownership level is determined by using the average closing share price over the prior calendar year. This methodology aligns with current competitive practices within the peer group based on market data provided by the Compensation Committee's consultant. 
The objectives of our stock ownership guidelines are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Strengthen alignment of the executives' financial interests with those of shareholders;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Enhance executive long-term perspective and focus on shareholder value growth;

• Reinforce "pay at risk" philosophy and provide an additional basis for sharing in Company success or  failure as reflected in shareholder returns; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align Company practice with corporate governance best practices.  
[END TABLE]
Each year at the February meeting, the Compensation Committee reviews the ownership levels to assure adherence to the guidelines. In 2018, the Compensation Committee conducted its annual review to assess that each officer was at or moving toward the required ownership level for his or her position. During the review process a new stock ownership level of four times base salary was added for the role of President of the Company. The new level aligns with current competitive practices within the peer group.

At the same meeting, the Compensation Committee conducted its annual review, using the requirements prior to the change, to assess whether each officer was at or moving toward the required ownership level for his or her position. The Compensation Committee determined that all NEOs had met the required level. 
Based on the guideline definition of ownership after the change in requirements, the following chart shows the required ownership level for each NEO and the number of shares owned as of March 1, 2019.

CEO Pay Ratio 
The Compensation Committee reviewed a comparison of CEO total compensation to the total compensation of the median employee. The compensation for the CEO in 2018 was approximately 29 times the total compensation of our median employee. 
Last year we identified the median employee by first collecting pay records on all employees from all companies within the corporation including subsidiaries, 1,922 (full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary), who were employed by us on December 29, 2017. As is permitted under the SEC rules, to determine our median employee, we used a definition that was not annual total compensation, as shown in the 2017 Summary Compensation Table above, and instead chose "base pay rate", which we then annualized it as if all employees worked full-time and worked all year for 2017. We identified 471 employees whose annualized base pay was within a +/-10% range of the median annualized base pay rate. Total cash compensation from 2017 was collected for each of the 471 employees to further narrow down the population. We believe the use of total cash compensation for this group of employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. Less than 3% of our employees receive annual equity awards. 
As is permitted under the SEC rules, we used the same median employee as last year because there have been no changes in our employee population or in our employee compensation package that we believe would significantly change this disclosure. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
We calculated annual total compensation for the employee using the same methodology we use for our NEOs as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table on page 44. The annual total compensation for year 2018 for our CEO was $3,817,421 and $131,014 for our median employee. The resulting ratio of our CEO's pay to the pay of our median employee for 2018 is 29 to 1. 
The foregoing pay ratio disclosure, including but not limited to any assumptions, adjustments, methodologies and existing internal records used to identify our median employee, is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to make reasonable assumptions and estimates, and to apply a variety of methodologies and exclusions that reflect their compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different compensation practices, and may utilize different assumptions, estimates, methodologies and exclusions in calculating their own pay ratios.

  (2)  Potential annual cash incentive awards granted to NEOs for 2018 performance in accordance with the 2018 Cash  Incentive Plan. The amounts actually paid to our NEOs for 2018 performance appear in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. See the CD&A for further  explanation.  
  (3)  Performance share awards are granted under the LTIP and vest over a three-year period. The number of shares  earned at the end of the three-year performance period depends on the level of performance achieved. See the CD&A for further explanation.  
  (4)  In 2018, all of our NEOs were awarded RSUs under the LTIP that vest over a three-year period. One-third of the shares vest and shares are issued on an annual basis, provided that the NEO is employed on the last day of the vesting period. Dividend equivalents accrue on the unvested RSUs and are paid in cash  at the same time the underlying RSUs vest. Therefore, if an NEO's employment ends prior to the last day of the vesting period, no RSUs or dividend equivalents are earned or paid.  
  (5)  The amounts shown for the grant date fair value of the target number of performance share awards tied to TSR  were calculated in accordance with ASC 718. Assumptions used in the calculation of these amounts are included in Note 1 of the Company's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, included in the Company's Form  10-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019. The grant date fair value for the target number of performance shares tied to TSR was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation to produce a probable value for the awards, which resulted in a fair value  per share higher than the closing price per share on the grant date.

(1)  For the performance period ended December 31, 2018, our TSR placed us in the 24th percentile of companies included in our peer group, which resulted in issuing 0% of the performance shares granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period and the related dividend equivalents.  Dividend equivalents were not earned and not paid in cash.  
(2)  For the performance period ended December 31, 2018, our cumulative EPS grew more than 3.0% over the  three-year performance period (compounded annually), which resulted in issuing 56% of the performance shares granted in 2016 for the 2016-2018 performance period and the related dividend equivalents. Value is based on the closing stock price  ($41.42) as reported on February 5, 2019, the day the Compensation Committee certified that the performance target was met and the shares were issuable. Dividend equivalents were paid in cash at the same time the underlying performance shares  vested.  
(3)  Our NEOs, excluding our CEO, were granted RSUs in 2016, 2017 and 2018, of which  one-third vests each year if an NEO remains employed on December 31. Therefore, one-third of each grant vested. Our NEOs received the last  one-third of their RSUs granted in 2016 and one-third of their RSUs granted in 2017 and 2018. In 2018, Mr. Morris received a grant of RSUs that vested over a  three-year period on the basis of time. One-third of that grant vested on December 31, 2018 because he remained employed on that date. The value of all RSUs that vested on December 31, 2018, is based  on

(4)  Mr. Morris was granted RSUs in 2016 and 2017, of which one-third  vests each year based on his continued employment on December 31 and the Company achieving the minimum ROE performance target. The 2018 performance target for the portion of the 2016 and 2017 RSUs that could vest at the end of 2018 was 5.70%.  During 2018, we achieved an ROE of 7.89%, which exceeded the target and resulted in vesting of one-third of each of the grants. Value is based on the closing stock price ($41.42) as reported on  February 5, 2019, the day the Compensation Committee certified that the performance target was met and the shares were issuable. Dividend equivalents were paid in cash at the same time the underlying RSUs vested.

Pension Benefits—2018 
The table below reflects benefits accrued under the Retirement Plan for Employees and the two SERPs (for purposes of the discussion below, we refer to both the pre-2005 SERP and the post-2004 SERP as the "SERP") for our NEOs. The Company's Retirement Plan for Employees provides a retirement benefit based upon employees' compensation and years of credited service. The retirement benefit under the Retirement Plan is based on a participant's final average annual base salary for the highest 36 consecutive months during the last 120 months of service with the Company. Base salary for our NEOs is the amount under "Salary" in the Summary Compensation Table on page 44. 
The SERP provides additional pension benefits to executive officers of the Company, who have attained the age of 55 and a minimum of 15 years of vesting service with the Company. The SERP is intended to provide benefits to executive officers whose pension benefits under the Company's Retirement Plan are reduced due to the application of limitations on qualified plans under the Code and the deferral of salary pursuant to the EDC Plan. When combined with the Retirement Plan, the SERP will provide benefits to executive officers, other than our CEO, who retire at age 62 or older, of 2.5% of the final average annual base salary during the highest 60 consecutive months during the last 120 months of service for each credited year of service up to 30 years. When combined with the Retirement Plan, the SERP will provide higher benefits to our CEO, if he retires on or after age 65, of 3% of final average base salary during the highest 60 consecutive months during the last 120 months of service for each credited year of service up to 30 years. Benefits will be reduced for executives who retire before age 62. Reductions are either 4% or 5% for each year of retirement before age 62 as prescribed in the Retirement Plan.

(2)(3)  Effective January 1, 2005, the SERP was modified to comply with requirements of Code Section 409A.  This plan is noted as SERP 2005+. The plan prior to this date, SERP pre-2005, is grandfathered and is not subject to Code Section 409A. SERP pre-2005 benefits were  frozen as of December 31, 2004.  
(4)  Mr. Thies is currently receiving a "two for one" credit for vesting service only for each  completed year of full-time service from year ten through year 12 (employment service). His ten-year employment anniversary, September 29, 2018, triggered commencement of the additional vesting service  credit. There is no "two for one" credit prior to completion of his tenth year of employment or after completion of his twelfth year of employment.  
(5)  After five years, Ms. Durkin received a "two for one" credit for vesting service only for each  completed year of full-time service from year six through year ten (employment service). Since Ms. Durkin has completed her tenth year of employment, her vesting credit will now accumulate year-for-year based on actual service for any future years.

Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan—2018 
The following table shows the non-qualified deferred compensation activity for our NEOs accrued through December 31, 2018:

(1)  Eligible employees may elect to defer up to 75% of their base annual salary and up to 100% of their annual  bonus. This column represents deferrals of this compensation during the last year. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 44 for further explanation.  
(2)  The Company matching contribution under the EDC Plan is equal to $0.75 for every $1.00 contributed up to a  maximum of 6% of the executive's base pay less the maximum contribution allowed under the 401(k) plan assuming the participant has contributed up to the limit set forth in Code Section 402(g) for the plan year. See "All Other  Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table for further explanation.  
(3)  Earnings reflect the market returns of the NEO's respective investment allocations. The earnings accrued  for deferred compensation are determined by actual earnings of Avista common stock and selected mutual funds. None of the earnings are included as compensation on the Summary Compensation Table since none are above market earnings. The Compensation  Committee selects the mutual funds that are available for investment under the EDC Plan, and the participants may allocate their accounts among these investments, including Avista common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Potential Payment Upon Termination or Change in Control ("CIC") 
The Company has CIC agreements with all of our NEOs. The cash components are paid in a lump sum and are based on a multiple of base salary. No CIC agreement provides for a severance multiple greater than three times base salary and bonus. The CIC agreements all have double triggers that provide for a severance payment only upon the occurrence of both a CIC and an adverse impact on an NEO's employment. 
Specifically, an NEO receives payments only if, in connection with a CIC, the executive officer's employment is terminated involuntarily by the Company or voluntarily by the officer for good reason. Good reason includes assignment of any duties inconsistent with the executive officer's position, authority, duties or responsibilities or any other action that results in a material diminution in such position, authority, duties or responsibilities or material diminution in the executive's base annual salary, or requiring the executive officer to be based at any location over 50 miles from the location the executive officer was assigned to preceding the CIC. 
The agreements also provide compensation and benefits to our NEOs during employment following a CIC of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, during the three (for our NEOs other than Mr. Vermillion) or two years (for Mr. Vermillion) following a CIC of the Company, an NEO will receive an annual base salary equal to at least 12 times the 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
highest monthly base salary paid to such executive officer in the 12 months preceding the CIC. In addition, each NEO will receive an annual bonus at least equal to such executive officer's highest bonus paid by the Company under the Company's Annual Cash Incentive Plan during the three years preceding the CIC (the "Recent Annual Bonus"). 
If employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by such executive officer for good reason during the first three years after a CIC, the executive officer will receive a payment equal to the sum of: (i) the earned but unpaid base salary due to such executive officer as of the date of termination; (ii) a proportionate annual bonus due to such executive officer for the portion of the year worked prior to the termination, based on the higher of the Recent Annual Bonus and the NEO's annual bonus for the last year (the "Highest Annual Bonus"); and (iii) a lump sum payment equal to two or three times (depending on the officer's level) the sum of the NEO's annual base salary and the Highest Annual Bonus plus an amount equal to the 2014 bonus (paid in 2015) for four of our NEOs, including our CEO, and 2016 bonus (paid in 2017) for one of our NEOs. For all new CIC agreements entered into on or after November 11, 2010, "Highest Annual Bonus" has been changed to "target bonus." The NEO will also receive all unpaid vacation pay, may continue to receive employee welfare benefits for a two-year period from the date of termination, and may receive outplacement assistance. 
In November 2009, the Board eliminated the excise tax gross-up benefit for all new CIC agreements entered into on or after November 13, 2009. Agreements in effect on that date have since been modified to provide that if payments (other than the gross-up payment) to the NEO do not exceed 110% of the maximum amount the NEO could receive without triggering the excise tax, the payments to such executive officer will be reduced to that maximum amount and such executive officer will not receive a gross-up payment. 
The excise tax amount in the tables below is based on the Company's estimate of the individual's liabilities under Code Sections 280G and 4999, assuming the NEO was terminated in connection with a CIC on December 31, 2018, and that the payments could not be reduced in accordance with the change described above. 
If employment terminates for any reason other than for retirement, death or disability during a performance cycle, all performance-based awards are forfeited. If employment terminates due to retirement, death or disability, the payment amount is still determined at the end of the three-year performance cycle and is prorated based on the number of months of active service during the cycle. If employment terminates in connection with a CIC, RSUs are fully accelerated and performance shares have prorated acceleration based on target performance. Payments required by these agreements, as well as payments provided by the other Company compensation arrangements described above, are summarized in the tables below.

PROPOSAL 3—ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    What are you voting  on?      Shareholders are being asked to approve, on an  advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs. 
    What are you voting  on?      Shareholders are being asked to approve, on an  advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs. 
    Voting Recommendation:      The Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal and urges beneficial owners, if they are not the record holders, to instruct their brokers or other nominees to vote for Proposal 3. 
    Voting Recommendation:      The Board unanimously recommends a vote FOR this proposal and urges beneficial owners, if they are not the record holders, to instruct their brokers or other nominees to vote for Proposal 3. 
[END TABLE]
As required by the Exchange Act, the Board is submitting a separate resolution, to be voted on by shareholders in a non-binding vote, approving, on an advisory basis, the Company's executive compensation. 
The text of the resolution in respect of this Proposal 3 is as follows: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's NEOs as disclosed in the Company's proxy statement, pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, under the "CD&A," "Executive Compensation Tables" and the related narrative disclosure." 
The Board recommends a vote for this resolution. As described in this proxy statement under the CD&A, the Company's compensation program is designed to focus Company executives on the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals set by the Company. The goals are structured to align executives' interests with those of shareholders by rewarding performance that maintains and improves shareholder value. The following features of the compensation structure reflect this approach: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executive compensation programs have both short and long-term components.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual cash incentive components focus on both the actual results and the sustainability and quality of those  results.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The total compensation program does not provide for guaranteed bonuses and has multiple performance measures.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company only has two executive employment agreements in place for NEOs, and they do not contain guarantees  for salary increases, non-performance-based bonuses or equity compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In 2010, the Company adopted a recoupment policy that authorizes the Board to recover incentive payouts based on  performance results that are subsequently revised or restated to levels that would have produced payouts lower than the original incentive plan payouts.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that the Company's current executive compensation program properly focuses our executives on the achievement of specific annual, long-term and strategic goals. The Board also believes that the Company's executive compensation program properly aligns the executives' interests with those of shareholders. 
Shareholders are urged to read the CD&A section of this proxy statement, which discusses in greater detail how the Company's compensation program implements the specific goals set by the Company. 
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" the approval, on an advisory basis, of the compensation of the Company's NEOs. 
Although the advisory vote on Proposal 3 is non-binding, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the results of the votes and, consistent with our record of shareholder engagement, are expected to take the outcome of the votes into consideration, along with other relevant factors, in making a determination concerning future executive compensation and the frequency of such advisory votes.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT 
The following table shows the number of shares of common stock of the Company held beneficially, as of March 1, 2019, by (i) each director and nominee, (ii) each of our NEOs in the Summary Compensation Table, (iii) all current directors and executive officers as a group and (iv) each person who is known to the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our common stock. No director or executive officer owns in excess of 1% of the stock of any indirect subsidiaries of the Company. None of the directors or NEOs has pledged Company common stock as security. As of March 1, 2019, there were 65,745,035 shares of common stock outstanding. 
Beneficial ownership, as shown below under the heading "Shares Beneficially Owned", has been determined in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon the exercise of an option or warrant or the vesting of an equity award) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. Shares shown under the heading "Other" are not considered beneficially owned in accordance with Rule 13d-3, but are considered by the Company in determining whether an individual has met the Company's share ownership guidelines. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the table may not necessarily reflect the person's actual voting power at any particular date. 
To our knowledge, except as indicated in footnotes to the table, the persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock shown as beneficially owned by them.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act requires that executive officers, directors and holders of more than 10% of the Company's common stock file reports of their ownership and changes in their ownership of the Company equity securities with the SEC. Based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished to the Company with respect to 2018 and written representations from certain insiders that no other reports were required, the Company believes that all Section 16 filing requirements applicable to these persons were completed in a timely manner. 
ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
A copy of the Company's 2018 Annual Report, which contains the Company's audited financial statements, accompanies this proxy statement. Our Annual Report and this proxy statement are also posted on our web site at www.avistacorp.com. This Annual Report includes our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC (without exhibits). If you have not received or do not have access to the Annual Report, call our Investor Relations department at (509) 495-4203, and we will send a copy (without exhibits) to you without charge; or send a written request to Avista, Attn: Investor Relations Department, 1411 E. Mission Ave., Spokane, Washington 99202. 
HOUSEHOLDING 
The Company understands that, if two or more beneficial owners of our common stock share the same address, the brokerage firm or other intermediary through which these shares are held may, unless contrary instructions are received from any such beneficial owner, deliver a single copy of the proxy statement, annual report and related proxy soliciting materials for all beneficial owners at that address. This procedure is called "householding." Beneficial owners of common stock who currently receive multiple copies of the proxy statement, annual report and other proxy soliciting materials and would prefer "householding" should contact their broker. Beneficial owners subject to "householding" who would prefer to receive separate copies of the proxy soliciting materials for each beneficial owner at their address should contact their broker and revoke their consent to "householding." Alternatively, beneficial owners may request a separate set of the proxy soliciting materials from the Company in writing sent to Avista, Investor Relations, 1411 E. Mission Avenue, Spokane, WA 99202 or by telephone at 509-495-4203. 
The Company and its transfer agent do not engage in "householding" for registered holders of common stock. 
OTHER BUSINESS 
The Board does not intend to present any business at the meeting other than as set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting, and has no present knowledge that others intend to present business at the meeting. If, however, other matters requiring the vote of the shareholders properly come before the meeting or any adjournment(s) thereof, the individuals named in the proxy card will have discretionary authority to vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their judgment as to such matters.
