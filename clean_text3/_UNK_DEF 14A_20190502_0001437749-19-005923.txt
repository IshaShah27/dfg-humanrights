Proposal 1 – Election of Directors
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT YOU ARE VOTING ON:   
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors consists of three classes of directors, each serving a staggered three-year term. Upon the recommendation of our Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, Richard A. Brenner, Susan E. Cates and Charles A. Norris are each nominated as a Class III director to serve three-year terms until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 and until their successors are elected and qualified. Messrs. Brenner and Norris and Mrs. Cates each currently serves as a director and has agreed to be named in this proxy statement and serve if elected.
Although we know of no reason why any nominee would not be able to serve, if any such nominee is unavailable for election, the proxies intend to vote your shares for any substitute nominee proposed by our Board of Directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Majority Voting Policy  
 The three nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes will be elected as directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders. Votes withheld by stockholders, broker non-votes and abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the director elections.  
 In January 2019, our Board of Directors adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines which provide that, in any uncontested election of directors, in the event that a nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast in respect of such director's election, the Board of Directors expects such nominee to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors, regardless of whether such nominee received the votes necessary for election under our Bylaws. The Nominating and Governance Committee will act on an expedited basis to determine whether to recommend to the Board of Directors whether to accept such director's resignation. The Board of Directors will make, and publicly disclose, its decision with respect to the acceptance or rejection of a resignation tendered pursuant to this policy within 90 days after the certification of the results of the meeting of stockholders at which such director's nomination was considered, and such public disclosure will include the rationale underlying such decision. The Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board of Directors expect the director whose resignation is under consideration to abstain from participating in any decision regarding such resignation.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1 – Election of Directors
Director Nomination Process
Our Board of Directors has a standing Nominating and Governance Committee comprised solely of independent directors. Our Board of Directors has delegated to its Nominating and Governance Committee the responsibility for establishing membership criteria for our Board of Directors, identifying individuals qualified to become directors consistent with such criteria and recommending the director nominees.
Our Nominating and Governance Committee actively searches for director nominees whose complementary knowledge, experience and skills provide a broad and diverse spectrum of perspectives and leadership experience in the beverage sector and broader consumer product goods industry, strategic planning, finance and accounting, risk management, marketing and distribution, corporate governance and other skills important to the development, execution and oversight of our long-term strategy. In identifying potential director candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee seeks input from its Committee members, other directors and management. The Nominating and Governance Committee may engage the services of search firms and advisors to help identify and screen potential director nominees. The Nominating and Governance Committee will also consider director candidates appropriately recommended by stockholders, and the Nominating and Governance Committee will discuss with the Board of Directors any candidates who were considered by the Nominating and Governance Committee but not recommended for election or re-election.
In identifying and assessing director candidates, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• roles and contributions valuable to the business community;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout Board service a reputation of integrity, trust, respect, competence and adherence to the highest ethical standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• relevant knowledge and diversity of background, viewpoint and experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time and willingness required for active preparation, participation and attendance at all meetings;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• applicable Nasdaq listing standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the number of other public and private company boards on which a director candidate serves;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a commitment to protecting stockholder value and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the current needs of the Board, including the need for specific industry or professional experience.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors believes that diverse membership with varying perspectives and breadth of experience is an important attribute to a well-functioning Board of Directors, promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, and results in both better corporate governance and improved corporate performance. Our Board of Directors believes that the benefits of inclusion and diversity are critical to our long-term success and viability in an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment. To this end, as set forth in our Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy, diversity (based on factors commonly associated with diversity such as race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation or identity, as well as on broader principles such as diversity of perspective and experience) is one of many elements to be considered in evaluating a particular candidate for appointment to the Board of Directors. Please see "Board Diversity" beginning on page 21 of this Proxy Statement for a more in-depth discussion of the consideration of diversity-related factors by the Board of Directors in its nomination considerations.
Proposal 1 – Election of Directors
Our Board of Directors also assesses director age and tenure of Board service and seeks to attain a reasonable balance between the perspectives of new directors and the industry and institutional knowledge offered by existing directors. In determining whether to recommend a director for re-election to the Board of Directors, our Nominating and Governance Committee will consider, among other factors, the director's participation in and contributions to the Board, the results of the most recent Board evaluation, and the director's record of past attendance at Board and committee meetings. Further, under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, no person is eligible for election or re-election as a director if, at the time of such election, he or she is 75 or more years of age, unless our Board of Directors affirmatively determines otherwise.
All director candidates, including candidates appropriately recommended by stockholders, are evaluated in accordance with the process described above.
Stockholder Recommendations of Director Candidates
Stockholders who wish to recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Governance Committee may do so by submitting a written recommendation to our Corporate Secretary at 101 North Cherry Street, Suite 501, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27101. Such recommendation must include a detailed background of the suggested candidate that demonstrates how the individual meets the criteria set forth above. If a candidate proposed by a stockholder or other source meets such criteria, the individual will be considered on the same basis as other candidates in accordance with the director nomination process set forth above.
Recommendations by stockholders for director candidates to be considered for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be delivered to Primo's Corporate Secretary not earlier than the close of business on January 3, 2020 and not later than the close of business on February 2, 2020. Recommendations by stockholders for director candidates to be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders must be received no later than November 28, 2019. Notice of a director nomination must be submitted in accordance with the requirements set forth in our bylaws which include requirements to provide the name and address of the stockholder making the recommendation, a representation that the recommending stockholder is a record holder of our common stock, all information regarding the nominee that would be required to be set forth in a proxy statement and the consent of the nominee to serve as a director. Appropriate submission of a recommendation by a stockholder does not guarantee the selection of the stockholder's candidate or the inclusion of the candidate in our proxy statement; however, the Nominating and Governance Committee will consider any such candidate in accordance with the director nomination process described above.

Recent Corporate Governance Enhancements
Earlier this year, our Board of Directors approved a series of corporate governance-related enhancements to strengthen and improve our commitment to adopting and enforcing strong corporate governance practices.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Summary of Corporate Governance Enhancements  
 Majority Voting Policy   In the event that a director nominee does not receive a majority of the votes cast in respect of such director's election in an uncontested election, the Board expects such nominee to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Board. The Board will act on an expedited basis to determine whether to accept such resignation.  
 Board Diversity Policy   Our Board of Directors adopted its Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy to formally codify the consideration given by the Board to diversity and other important qualifications in its identification and assessment of director nominees.  
 Corporate Governance Guidelines   Our Board of Directors adopted a new set of Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board and its committees in the exercise of its responsibilities and to establish a common set of expectations and guidelines to provide a strong and robust governance framework for the Company. Topics covered include, among others, (i) the majority voting policy summarized above; (ii) director tenure and age limits; (iii) limits on service on other public company boards and (iv) Board and Committee self-evaluations.  
 Lead Independent Director   The independent members of our Board of Directors elected Susan Cates to serve as Lead Independent Director, and her key responsibilities and obligations are set forth below under "Duties of Lead Independent Director."  
 Committee Membership Refreshment   Formally codified within our Corporate Governance Guidelines our Board's policy to periodically recommend rotation of the chairperson and memberships of the Compensation Committee on a periodic basis, in each case, giving consideration to the duration of each director's tenure on the Compensation Committee (including a director's tenure as chair of the Compensation Committee) and the qualifications and attributes of each director. For all other committees, the Board of Directors expects but does not mandate periodic rotation of committee assignments and chairs. In connection with this committee refreshment policy, in February 2019, our Board approved a substantial refreshment of the composition of the committees of the Board of Directors, including a new chairperson and two new committee members of the Compensation Committee.  
 Committee Charters   Each committee approved newly amended and restated committee charters to enact a number of "best practices" approaches developed since the last committee charter adoptions.  
 Stockholder Engagement   Our Board and senior management team engaged in extended and thorough discussions with key stockholders throughout the last twelve months to discuss enhancements to our corporate governance and executive compensation practices, policies, programs and procedures.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance
Our Board of Directors
Structure and Composition
Primo is governed by our Board of Directors and various committees of the board that meet throughout the year. Our Board of Directors and its committees have general oversight responsibility for the affairs of Primo.
Our certificate of incorporation provides that our Board of Directors will consist of between three and 12 members with the precise number to be determined by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors currently consists of nine directors. Our certificate of incorporation also provides that any vacancies or newly-created directorships may be filled only by the remaining members of our Board of Directors.
Since our initial public offering in 2010, our Board of Directors has been classified into three separate and equal classes (Classes I, II and III), with one class of directors nominated for re-election each year. Our Board of Directors believes the classification of the Board is important to our philosophy of managing and promoting the Company's long-term growth. Given the highly competitive nature of our business and the complexity and evolution of the retail industry more broadly, it can take several years to gain a robust understanding of our business and strategy, the Company's organization and structure, our customers and our industry. Having each of our directors stand for re-election every three years is intended to promote continuity and stability of strategy and business direction for the best long-term interests of our stockholders, the confidence of our customers and retail partners, and the long-term expectations of other stakeholders.
Board Qualifications
The Nominating and Governance Committee Charter specifies eight criteria which our Nominating and Governance Committee considers as it identifies and assesses candidates for membership to the Board of Directors, consisting of (i) roles and contributions valuable to the business community; (ii) personal qualities of leadership, character, judgment and whether the candidate possesses and maintains throughout Board service a reputation of integrity, trust, respect, competence and adherence to the highest ethical standards; (iii) relevant knowledge and diversity of background, viewpoint and experience; (iv) whether the candidate is free of conflicts and has the time and willingness required for active preparation, participation and attendance at all meetings; (v) applicable Nasdaq listing standards; (vi) the number of other public and private company boards on which a director candidate serves; (vii) a commitment to protecting stockholder value and (viii) the current needs of the Board, including the need for specific industry or professional experience. The Board of Directors also assesses director age and tenure of Board service and seeks to attain a reasonable balance between the perspectives of new directors and the industry and institutional knowledge offered by existing directors.
Corporate Governance
In addition to the eight criteria set forth above, in connection with a series of enhancements to Primo's corporate governance policies, practices and procedures, in January 2019 the Board of Directors adopted, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, a new Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy which reflects the Board of Directors' commitment to selecting ideal candidates for Board service (the "Board Diversity Policy"). As set forth in the Board Diversity Policy, the Board of Directors has identified the following qualifications, attributes, experiences and skills important to be represented on the Board of Directors as a whole, considering Primo's current and future goals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Leadership Experience:   Senior leadership experience as board chair, chief executive officer or president or other leadership experience in consumer goods and packaging, retail or similar industries; experience in mergers, acquisitions, strategic partnerships and strategic planning  
 Marketing and Consumer Experience:   Experience in consumer packaging and goods omni-channel branding and marketing; managing retailers' transition to omni-channel approach; e-commerce, digital and online marketing; retailer relationships  
 Financial Expertise:   Accounting or related financial management expertise; experience with public company annual and quarterly reporting requirements; knowledge of finance, lending and credit markets; financial oversight; prior audit committee service  
 Manufacturing and Distribution Experience:   Experience in manufacturing, distribution and logistics in the consumer packaging and goods; international commerce; retail omni-channels  
 Risk Assessment and Capital Management Experience:   Enterprise risk management experience; knowledge of capital allocation and/or business risk  
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Board Diversity  
 Our Board of Directors believes in diversity as a core value and recognizes that diversity is a strategic driver of our success. Our Board of Directors believes that diverse membership with varying perspectives and breadth of experience is an important attribute to a well-functioning Board of Directors, promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas, and results in both better corporate governance and improved corporate performance. Our Board of Directors believes that the benefits of inclusion and diversity are critical to our long-term success and viability in an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment. In addition, our Board's commitment to diversity aligns its interests with those of many of its key constituencies, including our customers, the consumers of its products and services, its employees and its stockholders. To this end, as set forth in the Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy, diversity (based on factors commonly associated with diversity such as race, gender, national origin, religion or sexual orientation or identity, as well as on broader principles such as diversity of perspective and experience) is one of many elements to be considered in evaluating a particular candidate for appointment to the Board of Directors. A number of these factors of diversity, and specifically the factors of racial and gender diversity, have been considered by the Board of Directors in filling all vacancies arising on the Board of Directors since the adoption of the Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy, including in respect of the appointment of Emma S. Battle in February 2019.  
 The Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy also provides that the Nominating and Governance Committee is responsible, on an annual basis, for reviewing and evaluating the size, composition, function and duties of the Board of Directors consistent with its needs and, in connection with such review, our Nominating and Governance Committee and our Board will consider the benefits of all aspects of diversity, including the factors set forth above, and will consider whether, and if so how, to identify new candidates for service on the Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with its annual self-performance evaluation, our Nominating and Governance Committee will consider the balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge of our business on our Board of Directors and the diversity of representation of our Board of Directors, including how our Board of Directors works together as a unit and other factors relevant to effectiveness. Our Nominating and Governance Committee will also review whether the Board's approach to diversity is functioning effectively.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance
[BEGIN TABLE]
 In addition, the Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy provides that the Nominating and Governance Committee will discuss and agree, on an annual basis, on any and all measureable objectives for achieving diversity on the Board of Directors. At any given time, the Board of Directors may seek to improve one or more aspects of its diversity and measure progress accordingly. The Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy provides that our Nominating and Governance Committee, when identifying potential new Board members or filling a vacancy on the Board of Directors, will seek women and diverse candidates.

Director Responsibilities
Each director has the basic and essential responsibility to exercise their business judgment to act in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and to carry out his or her obligations in accordance with their duties of loyalty, good faith and due care. In carrying out these obligations, our directors rely on the honesty, integrity and good faith of the Company's senior executives, outside advisors and independent auditors.
Board Administration
Code of Conduct. We are committed to operating with the highest level of integrity, responsibility and accountability. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all directors, officers and employees, including our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics describes each director's, officer's and employee's responsibility to conduct business with the highest standards of conduct in every business relationship—within Primo and with our customers, business partners and competitors. Among other matters, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote (i) honest and ethical conduct by everyone associated with the Company, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest; (ii) full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we submit to the SEC and in our other public communications; (iii) compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations; (iv) prompt internal reporting of any violation of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to the appropriate Primo personnel and (v) accountability for adherence to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our corporate website (www.primowater.com). Our Board of Directors is strongly predisposed not to waive any provisions of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. We expect that any amendments to the code, or any waivers of its requirements, will be disclosed on our website.
Corporate Governance
Meetings and Executive Session. Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board of Directors and its committees and the annual meeting of stockholders. In 2018, our Board of Directors held 6 meetings. No director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the committees to which such director was assigned except for Mr. Brenner who attended 70% of the total number of meetings of the committees to which he was assigned in 2018. In addition, all directors serving on our Board of Directors at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the annual meeting. The independent directors meet regularly in executive session without the presence of management directors or other Primo officers or employees. The Lead Independent Director presides over all executive sessions.

 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Corporate Governance Guidelines  
 Earlier this year, our Board of Directors approved a series of corporate governance-related enhancements to strengthen and improve our commitment to adopting and enforcing strong corporate governance practices. Our Board of Directors adopted a new set of Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board and its committees in the exercise of its responsibilities and to establish a common set of expectations and guidelines to provide a strong and robust governance framework for the Company. Among other topics, the Corporate Governance Guidelines address the following matters:  
• Board Evaluation. Our Board of Directors assessed that a vigorous annual evaluation process of the Board, its committees and each director is necessary and critical to maintain and enhance our corporate governance practices. Accordingly, in March 2019, our Board of Directors completed its first confidential performance evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are performing adequately and effectively. Our Board of Directors will conduct such an evaluation annually. As part of the evaluation, each director completes a written self-assessment questionnaire with a variety of questions designed to gather suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the Board of Directors and to solicit feedback on a range of issues, including Board composition, Board dynamics, the Board's relationship with senior management, Board agendas and meetings, Board processes and Board committees. The Lead Independent Director works in conjunction with the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee to design, implement, monitor and oversee the performance evaluation process.  
• Availability for Board Service. Our Board of Directors recognizes that its members benefit from service on the boards of other companies. However, our Board of Directors also believes it is critical that directors have the ability to dedicate sufficient time and energy to their service on the Primo Board of Directors. To that end, our Board of Directors imposes the following limitations on each director's service on boards of other public companies: (i) directors cannot serve on more than three public company boards in addition to the Primo Board of Directors (for a total of four public company boards); (ii) a Board member who also serves as chief executive officer of another public company cannot serve on more than one other public company board in addition to the Primo Board of Directors (for a total of two public company boards) and (iii) directors cannot serve on more than three public company audit committees (including our Audit Committee). Directors who are considering joining the board of another entity (whether for-profit or non-profit) must provide timely notice to the Executive Chairman and the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee before accepting the invitation to serve on such board.  
• Age and Tenure. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, no person is eligible for election or re-election as a director if, at the time of such election, he or she is 75 or more years of age, unless our Board of Directors affirmatively determines otherwise. Other than this mandatory retirement age, our Board of Directors does not impose term limits on directors, though the Nominating and Governance Committee will review the continuation of each director nominated for election and monitor each director's performance through the evaluation process described above.  
• Director Orientation and Education. In order to become familiar with Primo and the functioning of our Board of Directors, newly-appointed directors receive a variety of materials which provide an overview of Primo, its operations and organization, which may include presentations by senior management to familiarize new directors with our senior management and strategic plans, significant financial, accounting and risk management issues, our internal and independent auditors, and our governance and compliance programs, policies and procedures. Each director is also encouraged to take advantage of continuing education opportunities that enhance their ability to fulfill their responsibilities, including programs familiarizing directors with Primo's business units, recent financial performance, accounting and risk management programs and programs, and the directors' responsibilities under law and Nasdaq listing standards.

Corporate Governance
Board Leadership Structure
Executive Chairman and Lead Independent Director
Our Board of Directors is committed to impartial, independent leadership of our Board of Directors and its committees. Our Board of Directors believes that impartial and active oversight of management is necessary to achieve Primo's long-term, strategic corporate goals and generating value for Primo stockholders. Our Board of Directors does not have a formal policy regarding the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Board of Directors believes that it is in the best interests of Primo and its stockholders to retain flexibility in determining whether to separate or combine the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer based on our circumstances.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Appointment of Lead Independent Director  
 In January 2019, in connection with a broader enhancement of our corporate governance policies, practices and procedures and in connection with feedback from and engagement with stockholders, our Board of Directors adopted new Corporate Governance Guidelines which provide that, at any time where the Board appoints a Chairman who is not independent under applicable Nasdaq listing standards, the independent members of the Board of Directors will annually elect a Lead Independent Director from among the independent directors. In connection with the adoption of the Corporate Governance Guidelines, the independent members of the Board of Directors elected Susan Cates to serve as Lead Independent Director. The Lead Independent Director's key responsibilities and obligations are set forth below under "Duties of Lead Independent Director".  
[END TABLE]
Our Board of Directors believes that the current leadership structure, which separates the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is appropriate in light of the recent leadership transition and Primo's current operating environment. In particular, our Board of Directors believes this structure clearly establishes the individual roles and responsibilities of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, streamlines decision-making, enhances accountability of the senior management team to our Board of Directors and emphasizes the independence of our Board of Directors. Further, our Board of Directors believes that the appointment of Billy Prim as Executive Chairman and Susan Cates as Lead Independent Director provides robust, active and impartial oversight of the senior management team that, at this time, will best drive long-term value for our stockholders.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines empower our Lead Independent Director with well-defined duties that are further summarized below. In addition, our Board of Directors is comprised of experienced and committed independent directors who are committed to engaging with stockholders to ensure our Board leadership structure is most appropriate to generate long-term value for our stockholders. Our Board of Directors believes that our Board leadership structure, taken as a whole, provides for robust and impartial leadership, effective engagement with and oversight of management, and a unified voice that is accountable to our stockholders.
Duties of Executive Chairman
In his role as Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Prim serves a critical role as a bridge between the senior management of the Company and its stockholders, key customers and suppliers and other important stakeholders. Given Mr. Prim's extensive history as our founder and Chief Executive Officer, his leadership abilities and his knowledge of the bottled water industry and Primo's operating environment, our Board of Directors believes that Mr. Prim's service as Executive Chairman continues to ensure Primo's best position for success while emphasizing independence and accountability of Primo's management team to our Board of Directors.

Review of Board Leadership Structure
Our Board of Directors recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure so as to provide strong, independent oversight of senior management, a highly engaged Board of Directors, and the right balance among (i) effective independent oversight of the Company's business, (ii) our Board's activities and (iii) consistent corporate leadership. Our Board of Directors is open to – and regularly engages with stockholders regarding – different structures that provide such an optimal leadership structure, particularly given the dynamic and competitive environment in which the Company operates.
Director Independence
Our Board of Directors – which consists entirely of independent directors other than Messrs. Prim and Sheehan – exercises a strong, robust and independent oversight function. This oversight function is enhanced by the fact that our Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees are comprised entirely of independent directors. Our Board of Directors can and will change its leadership structure if it determines that doing so is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders.
Our Board of Directors, on an annual basis, determines the independence of its members based on the standards specified by NASDAQ. Under the applicable NASDAQ listing standards, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company's board of directors. In addition, NASDAQ's rules require that, subject to specific exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit committee and those members of the board of directors determining executive compensation and director nominations be independent. Audit Committee members also must satisfy the independence criteria set forth in rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under NASDAQ rules, a director will only qualify as an "independent director" if, in the opinion of the company's board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
Our Board of Directors has reviewed the relationships between Primo and each director to determine compliance with the NASDAQ listing standards and has determined that none of Ms. Battle, Mr. Brenner, Ms. Cates, Mr. Kilgore, Mr. McQuilkin, Mr. Norris and Mr. Warnock has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is "independent" as that term is defined under NASDAQ rules. Our Board of Directors also determined that Mess. Battle and Cates and Messrs. Brenner, McQuilkin and Norris, who comprise our Audit Committee, Ms. Cates and Messrs. Kilgore, Norris and Warnock, who comprise our Compensation Committee, and Ms. Battle and Messrs. Brenner, Kilgore, McQuilkin and Warnock, who comprise our Nominating and Governance Committee, satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable SEC and NASDAQ rules. In making these determinations, our Board of Directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with Primo and all other facts and circumstances our Board of Directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. There is no family relationship between any director, executive officer or person nominated to become a director or executive officer.
Corporate Governance
Board Committees
Our Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee. Each committee is currently comprised entirely of non-employee directors. Our Board of Directors may establish other committees from time to time to facilitate our corporate governance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Committee Membership Refreshment  
 In connection with the adoption of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Corporate Governance Guidelines formally codified the Board's policy to periodically recommend rotation of the chairperson and memberships of the Compensation Committee, in each case, giving consideration to the duration of each director's tenure on the Compensation Committee (including a director's tenure as chair of the Compensation Committee) and the qualifications and attributes of each director. For all other committees, the Board of Directors expects but does not mandate periodic rotation of committee assignments and chairs. In connection with this committee refreshment policy, in February 2019, upon the recommendation of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Board of Directors approved a substantial refreshment of the membership of the Board's committees, including a new chairperson and two new committee members of the Compensation Committee.  
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Conditioning Directors' Committee Compensation on Committee Meeting Attendance  
 In 2018, we amended our Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy to provide that all compensation payable to a non-employee director for service on our Board's committees is conditioned on such director attending at least 75% or more of the applicable committee's meetings for the year for which such compensation is being paid.  
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Committee Charters  
 Each committee operates under a written charter adopted by our Board of Directors. In connection with our corporate governance enhancements undertaken in the first quarter of 2019, each committee approved newly amended and restated committee charters to enact a number of "best practices" approaches developed since the last committee charter adoptions. These charters are available on our corporate website (www.primowater.com) in the "Investor Relations" section under "Corporate Governance."

Management Succession Planning
Our goal is to develop well-rounded and experienced senior leaders. High potential executives are challenged regularly with additional responsibilities, new positions or promotions to expose them to a broad spectrum of our operations. Our Board of Directors recognizes that one of its most important duties is to ensure continuity in these senior leadership positions by overseeing the development of executive talent and planning for the succession of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer.
Our Compensation Committee is charged with reviewing and overseeing the development and implementation of senior management succession plans, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Chairman, the Lead Independent Director and the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee. Together with the Executive Chairman, the Lead Independent Director, the Chief Executive Officer and the chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee will periodically report to the Board of Directors on (i) such management succession plans, including recommendations and evaluations of potential successors to the Chief Executive Officer and other members of senior management and (ii) any development plans for then-current members of senior management.
In addition, the Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Directors management succession plans in the event of an emergency in order that Primo can maintain operations and minimize potential disruption to its business in the face of unexpected vacancies in positions of senior leadership, including those resulting from catastrophe.
Corporate Governance
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We believe that integrating and promoting best practices in the areas of environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance (ESG) into our day-to-day operations underscores the importance of conducting business ethically and responsibly by delivering value to our customers, building strong communities, leveraging innovation and supporting the expertise, dedication and commitment of our employees and the communities in which they work. ESG is firmly rooted in how we deliver sustainable growth to our employees, customers and stockholders, reflects our corporate values – including our corporate vision, The Primo Way – and the personal values of our management team and employees at large, presents significant business opportunities and allows us to create shared success with our customers, employees, stockholders and communities.
Environmental Stewardship
We are uniquely positioned within the water and beverage industries to deliver products and services that can assist communities in their transition to a healthier and more environmentally sustainable lifestyle. Traditional water consumption, particularly via single-serve plastic water bottles, is environmentally unsustainable. 2017 data shows that, globally, approximately 1 million plastic bottles are purchased each minute, and that approximately 70% of plastic bottles once consumed are not recycled. Given that a single plastic bottle can take over 1,000 years to completely biodegrade, the current bottled and purified water consumption business model requires fundamental changes to meet consumer preferences for environmentally-friendly products. Recently proposed legislation reflects these concerns with the passage of "bottle bills" in many jurisdictions that tax the purchase of plastic water bottles, require deposits with the purchase of certain plastic bottles, prohibit the use of government funds to purchase plastic water bottles and ban certain plastic bottles from landfills.
As a purpose-driven company aiming to inspire healthier lives through better water, we are building our Refill, Exchange and Dispenser businesses in a manner that seeks to achieve a sustainable solution to the world's problem of excessive plastic consumption and disposal. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally conscious and effective. We estimate that approximately 1,100 single-serve plastic bottles are saved by a single five-gallon bottle used in our Refill or Exchange water. Further, each of our multi-gallon Exchange water bottles can be sanitized and reused up to 40 times before being taken out of use, crushed and recycled, substantially reducing landfill waste compared to consumption of equivalent volumes of single-serve bottled water. We estimate that, since 2004, approximately 14.5 billion single-serve plastic bottles have been saved by consumer adoption of our Refill, Exchange and Dispenser products and offerings. We believe our focus on achieving an environmentally sustainable solution to the delivery and consumption of purified and filtered water provides a competitive advantage as we aim to meet the demands of consumers increasingly favoring products with a lower environmental impact with a "reuse, recycle, reduce" mindset becoming a common driver of their behavior.
Our Refill systems provide safe and economical drinking water to consumers by means of our environmentally friendly business model. Consumers reuse their water bottles by refilling them with sterilized high purity reverse osmosis water from our dispensers. This eliminates the need to purchase expensive, resource-consuming single-serve bottled water, which, when finished, are often disposed in landfill sites, oceans and other receiving streams.
Further, we have strategically placed over 24,000 Refill systems at grocery/retail locations across the United States and Canada. This ensures that refill water purchases are made efficiently during regular shopping trips, reducing the transportation time and related carbon emissions. There are no isolated, stand-alone Primo refill systems or systems located in water treatment specialty shops.
Recent improvements and investments in systems technology may substantially reduce our carbon footprint by cutting down on the number of driving hours by our service technicians. Our Refill service routes and dispatches are now managed by means of sophisticated routing and equipment maintenance software. This software monitors and directs our field service technicians via cellular and GPS technology to perform scheduled or emergency service. The system knows the location, schedule, traffic conditions and associated tasks for our technicians and will assign service calls in the most efficient manner.
Corporate Governance
Our Exchange business model is also environmentally friendly. Consumers return their empty 5 or 3 gallon bulk water bottles to grocery/retail locations throughout the United States and Canada, and exchange it for a full prefilled bottle of Primo water. The empty bottle returns to the bottling plant and is cleaned, sanitized and refilled.
The water and wastewater infrastructure in the United States and Canada was given a D- grade by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2017. Trillions of dollars will be required to bring water treatment and drinking water distribution into compliance with applicable laws and standards over the next twenty years. In addition, many sources of drinking water are now contaminated with known and emerging contaminants which will likely require sophisticated water treatment technologies to render tap water safe. Providing safe drinking water now will fall to forward thinking companies such as Primo who not only provide water that consumers trust but also provide products that align with a sustainable, environmentally friendly business model. While many water filtration manufacturers promote their faucet filters and other products to remove heavy metals from tap water, the onus is on the user to dispose of them responsibly. A used faucet filter cartridge loaded with lead and or arsenic that is tossed into the residential garbage collection will likely end up in a landfill site, which may contribute to contamination of the groundwater there in years to come. We believe The Primo Way is a better way.
Corporate Social Responsibility
We have built our corporate vision on these and other principles established in our vision statement, The Primo Way, and work daily to maintain an environment which is open, diverse and inclusive, and where our team members feel valued and included in our broader mission. Examples of our active and engaged commitment to our communities and social responsibility more broadly can be seen in, among other matters:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Active responses to communities affected by hurricanes, wildfires and other natural disasters, including assistance with disaster relief efforts and the donation of Primo bottles and dispensers to affected communities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Donation of bottles and dispensers to several charitable and community service initiatives including the Pan-Mass challenge, the Los Angeles Chinatown Firecracker Run and the National MS Tour to Tanglewood;

Corporate Governance
An Inclusive and Diverse Work Environment
A critical focus of our ESG-related efforts is creating a strong, diverse and supportive workplace environment for our employees. Our culture reflects how we operate our business everyday, and in order to achieve the vision set forth in The Primo Way, we are constantly striving to create a workplace where our employees feel engaged, empowered and committed to our business, its customers and our communities for the long term. Our commitment to workplace diversity reflects the importance of this initiative, where more than 43% of our global workforce is racially or ethnically diverse. In addition, we believe our workplace fosters a supportive environment that encourages employees to have open and honest dialogue on topics important to them and to create awareness of employees' experiences and perspectives arising out of differences in background, experience and viewpoints, such as class, age, gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity. We continue to focus on offering innovative and cost-effective benefits and supporting our employees' physical, financial and emotional well-being.
Our Board's Role in Risk Management
While management is primarily responsible for managing the risks that Primo faces, our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing management's approach to risk management. Our Board of Directors oversees management in exercising its responsibility managing risk, assessing our framework of practices, programs, policies and procedures related to risk management in order to identify, monitor, evaluate and manage risks across Primo.
While our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight responsibility for management's risk management process, various committees of the Board assist it in fulfilling that responsibility. In particular, our Audit Committee assists management in its review of the practices, programs, policies and procedures regarding identifying, monitoring, evaluating and managing Primo's financial reporting risk and investment, tax and other financial risks. Our Audit Committee also oversees the development of our enterprise risk management policies and procedures and reports regularly to our Board of Directors regarding Primo's risk management process. In addition, our Compensation Committee reviews our compensation practices and policies to ensure they do not create inappropriate or unintended significant risks to Primo as a whole, and provides oversight and direction regarding these practices, policies and compensation-related risk management.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Cybersecurity and Data Protection Risk Management  
 Protecting the privacy of our customers' and employees' information and the security of our systems and networks has long been and will continue to be a priority for Primo and our Board of Directors. We have technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of customer and employee information and data we collect and store (including data from credit card payment machines installed on our Refill machines). In addition, our comprehensive information security program includes, among other aspects, vulnerability management, antivirus and malware protection, file integrity monitoring, encryption and access control.  
 Consistent with our Board of Director's risk management and oversight structure, our Audit Committee has primary responsibility for overseeing our risk management practices, programs, policies and procedures related to data privacy, data protection and network security. Management provides our Audit Committee and our Board of Directors with updates about cybersecurity practices, programs, policies and procedures, the status of projects designed to strengthen internal cybersecurity and data protection. Our Board of Directors and our Audit Committee also discusses recent incidents throughout our industry and any significant emerging threats.  
[END TABLE]
Corporate Governance
Stockholder Engagement
We believe effective corporate governance requires regular, constructive and thoughtful engagement with our stockholders on a number of topics, including operating performance, corporate governance, long-term strategy, executive compensation and ESG issues. Our Executive Chairman, Lead Independent Director and senior management team play a central role in our stockholder engagement efforts and regularly engage stockholders throughout the year and consider their input. In addition, our Compensation Committee is charged with monitoring and evaluating the Company's engagement with stockholders to solicit feedback on the Company's compensation philosophy, structure, programs, practices and policies.
Our Board of Directors and senior management team has enhanced its commitment to solicit ongoing feedback from major stockholders and to provide for continued and robust stockholder engagement throughout the year. Our Board welcomes feedback on its corporate governance and executive compensation practices and policies and believes that this continued engagement with stockholders will further align the long-term interests of our Board of Directors, the Company, its management and its stockholders.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Corporate Governance Enhancement – Stockholder Engagement  
 In January 2019, as a result of extensive stockholder engagement and outreach, our Board of Directors approved a series of corporate governance-related enhancements to strengthen and improve our commitment to adopting and enforcing strong corporate governance practices. Among others, the Board of Directors adopted a new set of Corporate Governance Guidelines to assist the Board and its committees in the exercise of its responsibilities and to establish a common set of expectations and guidelines to provide a strong and robust governance framework for the Company.  
 Further, the Board of Directors appointed Susan Cates to serve as Lead Independent Director. In her new role as Lead Independent Director, Ms. Cates will be responsible for helping to set agendas for meetings of the Board of Directors, leading the Board's review of management performance and the succession planning process currently underway. Ms. Cates will also lead executive sessions of the independent members of the Board and, if requested by major stockholders, ensure her availability for consultation and direct communication as part of a Primo-wide initiative to enhance stockholder outreach and communication. Please see "Board Leadership Structure" beginning on page 18 for a more detailed discussion on the role and responsibilities of the Lead Independent Director.  
 In addition, the Board of Directors adopted a Board Diversity and Qualifications Policy that reinforces and reflects the Board's belief that diversity is a core value of Primo, a strategic driver of its success, and that diverse membership of the Board of Directors with varying perspectives and breadth of experience promotes the inclusion of different perspectives and ideas and results in both better corporate governance and improved corporate performance. In addition, the Board of Directors and each of its committees approved amended and restated committee charters requiring and promoting certain best practices in the operation of each committee.

[END TABLE]
Under our current Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (the "Director Compensation Policy"), which was approved effective February 28, 2019, each non-employee director receives the following compensation.
Initial Compensation
Upon a non-employee director's initial election or appointment to the Board, such director receives a grant of restricted stock units having a value equal to 150% of the Total Annual Retainer (as defined in the Director Compensation Policy) in effect at the time of such non-employee director's election or appointment, with the number of restricted stock units to be issued being determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. Such restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.
Director Compensation
Annual Cash Compensation
Each non-employee director receives, on an annual basis, (1) a cash retainer in an amount equal to 25% of the Total Annual Retainer (as defined in the Director Compensation Policy), which such 25% currently equals $25,000, (2) committee chairmanship fees payable in cash equal to $15,000 for the chair of the Audit Committee, $10,000 for chair of the Compensation Committee and $5,000 for chair of each other standing committee (currently only the Nominating and Governance Committee), (3) committee membership fees payable in cash equal to $7,500 for Audit Committee membership, $5,000 for Compensation Committee Membership and $2,500 for membership of each other standing committee and (4) an additional $15,000 payable in cash to the Chairman of the Board (if such Chairman is an independent director) or to the Lead Independent Director (if there is no independent Chairman of the Board) (clauses (1) through (4), collectively, the "Cash Compensation").
Committee membership fees in clause (3) above are only payable to a non-employee director if such director attends at least 75% or more of the applicable committee's meetings in respect of the year for which such compensation is being paid.
In advance of each annual meeting of the stockholders, each non-employee director may choose to receive his or her Cash Compensation for the following year 100% in cash (Option 1) or 100% in equity (Option 2). If a director elects Option 1, the director receives a one-time payment of the Cash Compensation within 14 days of the annual meeting of stockholders immediately following the year for which such compensation is payable. If a director elects Option 2, the director receives a one-time grant of fully-vested restricted stock units valued at the Cash Compensation on the business day immediately prior to the next annual meeting, and the number of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders that preceded the grant date.
Annual Equity Compensation
Each non-employee director, on an annual basis, is granted a number of restricted stock units having a value equal to 75% of the Total Annual Retainer (as defined in the Director Compensation Policy), which such 75% currently equals $75,000, with the number of restricted stock units to be issued being determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of the annual meeting of stockholders that preceded the grant date.
Grants made under the Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy are made pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. Messrs. Prim and Sheehan receive no compensation for their service on our Board or Directors.

This CD&A should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures following the CD&A, including under the section titled "Executive Compensation Tables" beginning on page 46 of this proxy statement. This CD&A includes statements regarding financial and operating performance targets in the limited context of our executive compensation programs, and investors should not evaluate these statements in any other context. This CD&A also contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt in the future may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this CD&A.
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives
Compensation Governance 
Our Compensation Committee oversees the design and implementation of our executive compensation program and approves the target compensation (including base salaries, short-term and long-term incentive compensation with both performance and fixed targets) for each of our Named Executive Officers.
Our Compensation Committee exercises robust, independent and vigorous oversight of the compensation payable to all of our Named Executive Officers, including our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Compensation Committee reviews and approves financial, strategic and operational goals and objectives related to the compensation payable to the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer, and evaluates the performance of each of the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer in light of these goals and objectives.
Our Compensation Committee periodically consults with our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for their views on whether the existing executive compensation practices and policies support our long-term strategic objectives and whether such practices and policies are properly aligned with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our Compensation Committee also consults with our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on the total compensation opportunities for our other Named Executive Offices, but our Compensation Committee is not required to accept any recommendations from such individuals. In addition, our Compensation Committee periodically consults with our Chief Financial Officer in evaluating the financial, accounting and tax implications of our executive compensation program. However, our Compensation Committee retains ultimate authority for the design, implementation and oversight of our executive compensation program, and none of our Named Executive Officers are present during any deliberation or voting with respect to his or her compensation.
Executive Compensation
In 2016, our Compensation Committee formally engaged The Korn Ferry Hay Group ("Korn Ferry") as a compensation consultant to provide strategic advice in setting and structuring our compensation programs and policies for 2017 as well as going forward. Our Compensation Committee did not engage the services of Korn Ferry or any other independent compensation consultant in 2018. Going forward, our Compensation Committee will consider the advice and recommendations of compensation consultants we may engage in setting and structuring our executive compensation programs.
Shareholder Engagement and Executive Compensation Enhancements
Our Board of Directors, its Compensation Committee and our senior management team value the input of our shareholders regarding the design, implementation and effectiveness of our executive compensation program. Our Compensation Committee regularly monitors and evaluates such engagement with shareholders to solicit and consider feedback on such design, implementation and effectiveness. Throughout 2018 and into 2019, our Board of Directors, its Compensation Committee, the Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer engaged in extensive and constructive dialogue with holders of over 40% of our outstanding Common Stock on a number of executive compensation-related topics, including, among others, the frequency of our say-on-pay votes on Named Executive Officer compensation, the Compensation Committee's choice of performance measures for short- and long-term incentive compensation, and compensation disclosure initiatives.
As a result of these discussions, in order to increase the alignment of our executive compensation programs with the long-term interests of our shareholders, our Compensation Committee and Board of Directors implemented a number of enhancements to our executive compensation program since our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, highlights of which are set forth below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Compensation Enhancements  
• In May 2018, the Board voted to hold a say-on-pay vote on an annual basis beginning at the 2019 Annual Meeting (instead of holding such vote every three years).  
• In January 2019, the Board voted to rotate and refresh membership of the Compensation Committee, including the naming of a new Chair, David Warnock, and the addition of two new members, including Susan Cates, our Lead Independent Director.  
• In January 2019, the Board adopted an amended and restated Compensation Committee Charter with updated best practices for Compensation Committee operation and administration, including requiring the Compensation Committee's approval for any special or supplemental compensation to Named Executive Officers and individuals who formerly served as Named Executive Officers, including retirement benefits and perquisites provided during and after employment.  
• In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved long-term, performance-based equity awards covering the three-year period beginning in January 2019 based upon the achievement of free cash flow- and revenue-based performance-based metrics in response to discussions with shareholders regarding the use of duplicate performance measures, such as adjusted EBITDA, for both short- and long-term incentive compensation.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Objectives
Attract and Retain High-Performing Executives. The labor market for highly talented executives in the beverage segment and consumer products goods industry more broadly is extremely competitive. We are constantly evaluating and adjusting our executive compensation program to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving marketplace for such senior managers. Our Compensation Committee relies on market analyses, third-party compensation surveys, publicly available data and other market information specific to the roles and responsibilities of each executive officer. Our Compensation Committee does not specifically tie the total compensation opportunities to specific market percentiles, and such total compensation opportunities may be below or above median amounts on account of a number of factors, including an executive's specific skill set and his or her tenure with the Company.
Executive Compensation
Shareholder-Aligned Performance Pay. Our incentive compensation arrangements are tied to specific performance measures that are designed to promote the Company's long-term growth, the achievement of strategic objectives and enhanced, long-term value creation for our shareholders. Our engagement of Korn Ferry in 2016 enhanced the link between our executive compensation and shareholder value when we adopted our Long-Term Performance Plan, which is discussed further below under "Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation".
Manage Excessive Compensation-Related Risks. The Compensation Committee aims to design our executive compensation program in a manner that includes design features that balance short-term and long-term incentive compensation and discourage unnecessary and excessive risk-taking by our executives, both in the short- and long-term. We ceased granting stock option awards on a regular basis in 2015, we do not offer guaranteed bonuses, and we do not provide excessive perquisites. In addition, we have adopted a policy that prohibits pledging, hedging and trading in derivatives of our securities, which is discussed further under "Other Compensation Matters" beginning on page 43 of this proxy statement.
Executive Compensation Program Design
Components of Executive Compensation
Our Compensation Committee determines the appropriate balance between fixed and performance-based pay components, short- and long-term pay components, and cash and equity-based pay components when determining total compensation opportunities for each of our Named Executive Officers.
The current principal components of our executive compensation program are (a) base salary, (b) annual cash and equity performance-based compensation and (c) long-term time-based equity compensation in the form of restricted stock units and performance-based equity compensation in the form of awards made under our Long-Term Performance Plan ("LTPP"), a long-term, performance-based incentive arrangement established in February 2017 as a replacement of our Value Creation Plan, a long-term, performance-based incentive arrangement which was terminated by our Compensation Committee in December 2016. As described below, each of those compensation elements satisfies one or more of our compensation objectives described above.
Executive Compensation
Total Target Compensation Objectives for 2018. For total annual target compensation for Named Executive Officers our Compensation Committee reviews the balance of short- and long-term compensation, the balance of fixed and performance-based compensation as well as the balance of cash and equity compensation.
For 2018, the total annual target compensation for the Named Executive Officers that was long-term in nature was between 45% and 50%. In addition, for 2018 the total annual target compensation that was performance-based in nature was between 50% and 70%. Further, for 2018 the total target compensation that was equity-based was between 45% and 50%.
Of the equity-based target compensation for 2018, between 75% and 85% was subject to performance-based vesting conditions measured over a three-year period, in each case, in order to promote the proper incentives within our Named Executive Officers and to further align their interests with our shareholders' interests.

[END TABLE]
Each of these pay components, including the utilization of each such component in establishing total compensation opportunities for our Named Executive Officers in 2018, is discussed in further detail below.
Each of Messrs. Prim, Sheehan and Mills have entered into an employment agreement with the Company, Mr. Castaneda was subject to the terms of an employment agreement with the Company while employed by the Company in the year ended December 31, 2018. The material terms of those employment agreements are described below under "Employment Agreements and Change of Control Agreements." Mr. Hass has not yet entered into an employment agreement with the Company.
Base Salary
We believe that a competitive base salary is an important component of compensation as it provides a degree of financial stability for our Named Executive Officers and is critical to recruiting and retaining our executives. Base salary is also designed to recognize the scope of responsibilities assigned to each Named Executive Officer and reward each executive for his or her unique leadership skills, management experience and contributions. We make a subjective determination of base salary after considering such factors collectively. Our Board of Directors established base salaries for each of our Named Executive Officers at the amounts set forth below for 2018.

Annual Cash and Equity Performance-based Incentive Compensation
We established an annual performance-based incentive plan for 2018, which created an annual bonus pool and set payout bands for our officers, including our Named Executive Officers, based on the Company's achievement of certain adjusted EBITDA goals. Our Compensation Committee structured and implemented this plan to motivate our executive officers to achieve our annual strategic and financial goals. Each year, our Compensation Committee establishes the potential value of the awards under the annual incentive plan and the performance targets required to achieve these awards, and our Compensation Committee sets these targets to challenge our Named Executive Officers to drive business results that generate stockholder return. Our Compensation Committee approved the following 2018 annual incentive plan bonus pool with a Target Adjusted EBITDA level of $65.0 million:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Percentage of Target Adjusted  EBITDA Achieved:   Size of Annual Bonus Pool  
 Percentage of Target Adjusted  EBITDA Achieved:   Size of Annual Bonus Pool  
 95%   $1,625,000  
 100%   $3,250,000  
 105%   $3,575,000  
 110%   $3,900,000  
 115%   $4,225,000  
 120%   $4,550,000  
[END TABLE]
Adjusted EBITDA under our 2018 annual incentive plan is calculated in the same manner as set forth in our Credit and Guaranty Agreement entered into in June 2018 with SunTrust Bank, and generally includes income (loss) from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization, interest expense, net, income tax benefit, non-cash change in fair value of warrant liability, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, special items (which include non-recurring and acquisition-related costs), and impairment charges and other. Our Compensation Committee has recently utilized adjusted EBITDA as the operational performance measure for our Annual Incentive Plan because the Compensation Committee believes that achievement of adjusted EBITDA-based goals is consistent with our strategic goals, including our operating performance, overall growth, the cost to us of achieving such growth, and our ability to repay our outstanding indebtedness. Further, adjusted EBITDA is utilized by our management, shareholders, creditors and analysts as a key indicator of our ongoing operational performance and profitability.
Our actual pre-bonus, adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $55.4 million, or 85.2% of the $65.0 million adjusted EBITDA goal for 2018, which resulted in no annual bonus payable by the Company under the 2018 Annual Incentive Plan.
Executive Compensation
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation
Overview and Background
Long-term equity incentive compensation is a fundamental tenet of our executive compensation program. Our Compensation Committee believes that long-term equity incentive compensation rewards the performance of our Named Executive Officers over the longer term and further aligns the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders. In 2018, the total annual target incentive compensation for the Named Executive Officers that was long-term in nature was between 45% and 50%.
Our long-term equity incentive compensation is comprised of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based awards granted under our LTPP, which are further discussed below. Our Compensation Committee establishes a Named Executive Officer's award opportunity as a percentage of base salary, and the Compensation Committee assumes that each Named Executive Officer will earn 100% of the RSUs and LTPP awards for purposes of determining such Named Executive Officer's total compensation opportunity.
Each of our time-based RSU awards vests in three equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Our Compensation Committee believes this vesting schedule is appropriate for our time-based awards as it promotes stability in our experienced management team for our employees, shareholders and other stakeholders and also properly incentivizes each of our Named Executive Officers to remain in employment with the Company for an extended period of time in order to oversee and implement the Company's long-term strategies.
Each of our performance-based awards granted under our LTPP is subject to a three-year performance cycle, with cliff vesting at the end of the three-year period with respect to all of the LTPP awards earned by each Named Executive Officer at the end of such three-year performance cycle. In addition to further promoting the long-term stability and Named Executive Officer retention, our Compensation Committee believes that a three-year performance cycle is appropriate because it enables the Compensation Committee and our shareholders to meaningfully evaluate the execution of our long-term strategies and the impact on shareholder value.
Historically, we have provided long-term equity compensation primarily through grants of restricted stock units and performance-based awards through annual grants approved by our Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. We intend to continue these practices in the future as we believe such grants further our compensation objectives of aligning the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our stockholders, encouraging long-term performance, and providing a simple and easy-to-understand form of equity compensation that promotes executive retention. We view such grants both as incentives for future performance and as compensation for past accomplishments.
Adoption and Implementation of Long-Term Performance Plan
Prior to the adoption of the Long-Term Performance Plan ("LTPP"), in May 2012, we established our Value Creation Plan ("VCP"). The VCP was amended and restated in May 2013, and further amended and restated in March 2016 prior to being terminated in December 2016. Prior to the March 2016 amendment and restatement, the VCP provided for up to three separate awards to be issued to participants based upon the Company's achieving adjusted EBITDA targets of $15 million, $20 million and $25 million for any fiscal year through the end of 2018. Our Compensation Committee set these targets at very aspirational levels as the Company's adjusted EBITDA for 2011 was $3.4 million. In March 2016, our Compensation Committee (a) increased the second adjusted EBITDA target from $20 million to $24 million, (b) increased the third adjusted EBITDA target from $25 million to $28 million, and (c) extended the performance period under the plan from the end of 2018 through the end of 2019. In December 2016 and prior to the final award being issued, our Compensation Committee approved the termination of the VCP. All awards granted under the VCP that were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 were governed by the VCP and subject to the achievement of the adjusted EBITDA performance targets for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Executive Compensation
Our Board and Compensation Committee believe that the VCP successfully and rapidly achieved its designed goals of maximizing shareholder value and promoting the long-term performance and operational success of our Company. In the period covered by the awards granted under our VCP, our adjusted EBITDA increased by 619% from $3.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 to $24.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Building upon the success of the VCP, our Board of Directors, Compensation Committee and senior management engaged with our shareholders as we sought to restructure our long-term equity incentive compensation program to reflect the evolving strategic and operational goals of a larger organization, including the establishment of additional performance-based metrics by which our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee could promote the long-term growth mindset.
After the success of our VCP in promoting our Named Executive Officers to achieve aspirational adjusted EBITDA targets in a short period of time, and in connection with and following extensive engagement with our key shareholders and other important stakeholders, our Board and Compensation Committee undertook a redesign of our long-term equity compensation plan structure. After the termination of the VCP our Board and Compensation Committee, following thorough consultation with, and upon the recommendation of, Korn Ferry, established our LTPP in February 2017. Like the VCP, we believe our LTPP serves to attract and retain highly qualified executive officers, officers and key employees and to motivate such executive officers, officers and key employees to serve the Company and expend maximum effort to improve the long-term business results of the Company and to further align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Our Compensation Committee believes that the LTPP is properly designed to take into account the Company's increased size, complexity and long-term strategic growth objectives. Further, because the value of our LTPP awards to our Named Executive Officers is tied to both our stock price and the performance targets discussed below in more detail, our Compensation Committee believes that LTPP awards provide a strong incentive to executives to deliver value to our shareholders.
Our LTPP is administered under the Omnibus Plan as a sub-plan of the Omnibus Plan.
Structure of LTPP Awards
The period in which performance is measured, and to which the achievement of the performance-based metrics described below is tied, begins on January 1 of the grant year and ends on December 31 of the third year following the grant year (the "Performance Period").
Of the LTPP awards issued in 2018, 60% are subject to the achievement of certain Adjusted EBITDA targets during the Performance Period (the "AE LTPP Units"), with adjusted EBITDA measured in accordance with the Company's current credit agreement, and 40% are subject to the achievement of certain free cash flow targets during the Performance Period (the "FCF LTPP Units" and, with the AE LTPP Units, the "LTPP Units"). Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities plus non-recurring and acquisition-related costs minus net cash used in investing activities excluding acquisitions and intangibles.
For the 2018 LTPP Awards, the LTPP Units are generally earned upon the achievement of at least 80% of target adjusted EBITDA and target free cash flow during the Performance Period, as applicable, at which time 50% of the AE LTPP Units and/or FCF LTPP Units, respectively, are earned. The LTPP Units are capped at achievement of 120% of target adjusted EBITDA and target Free Cash Flow during the Performance Period, as applicable, at which time 140% of the AE LTPP Units and/or FCF LTPP Units, respectively, are earned. The number of LTPP Units earned between 80% of the applicable target and 120% of the applicable target are subject to a linear interpolation of the applicable target. See below under "2018 LTPP Awards" for further discussion and detail on the LTPP Awards granted in 2018.
Executive Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Compensation Enhancement – New LTPP Performance Metric   
 In February 2019, in connection with a detailed review of the Long-Term Performance Plan by our Compensation Committee to ensure its success in linking executive performance with long-term growth and shareholder value, and in conjunction with recent and extensive feedback from our engagement with shareholders, our Compensation Committee approved 2019 LTPP Awards which are subject to the achievement of certain revenue and free cash flow targets during the applicable Performance Period, which will run from January 1, 2019 until December 31, 2021.  
 Our Compensation Committee understands that, as a matter of best practices in executive compensation, it was important to provide that the performance-based metrics utilized in our short-term performance-based incentive compensation (adjusted EBITDA) were different from those utilized in our long-term performance-based incentive compensation so as not to place undue influence on the performance and behavior of our management team to achieve one performance-based metric, which may create misalignment between executives and the long-term interests of shareholders if they fail to sufficiently focus on other important metrics. As a result, the Compensation Committee approved 2019 LTPP Awards that substituted revenue for adjusted EBITDA as one of two applicable performance-based metrics. For the 2019 LTPP Awards, 50% are subject to the achievement of certain Revenue targets and 50% are subject to the achievement of Free Cash Flow targets.  
 Our Compensation Committee believes that revenue is also an important performance-based metric for the Company's long-term strategic growth. Following our acquisition of Glacier Water in December 2016, leveraging our newly increased scale and related synergies to drive top-line growth from our businesses and, in particular, our Refill business, is a core element of our long-term growth strategies.  
 Our Compensation Committee believes that free cash flow is an important indicator of our continued, long-term success as it measures our ability to generate cash from operations, which may be used, among other ways, to repay our outstanding indebtedness on an accelerated timeframe, or return capital to shareholders in the form of future share repurchase programs (subject to the terms of any financing arrangements in place at any given time).  
[END TABLE]
Impact of Change of Control Transaction on LTPP Awards
Except for Messrs. Prim, Sheehan and Mills, discussed below, there is no acceleration of LTPP awards in the event of a change of control transaction. Upon a change of control, the performance of each award recipient under the terms of each then-outstanding LTPP award is measured against the applicable performance metrics and related targets for the respective LTPP award, assuming the applicable performance period terminates upon the change of control transaction. If the threshold, target or maximum performance criteria have been satisfied as of such change of control date, then such award recipient will receive the number of shares of Common Stock as provided under the applicable LTPP award agreement. However, in the event the threshold performance criteria has not been achieved as of such change of control date, the LTPP award will be immediately cancelled and forfeited. No performance metrics and related targets are reduced by any amount due to the reduction in time to achieve such performance targets as a result of the change of control.
With respect to Messrs. Prim, Sheehan and Mills, the terms of each of their respective employment agreements control in the event of any inconsistency with any LTPP awards granted to them. As discussed further below under "Employment Agreements and Change of Control Arrangements" beginning on Page 55, all equity compensation awards held by Messrs. Prim, Sheehan and Mills that are unvested immediately prior to a change of control transaction will immediately vest as of the date of a change of control transaction, including any LTPP awards then-outstanding. As discussed further below, for each of Messrs. Prim, Sheehan and Mills, the "Potential Payments upon a Change of Control" table below assumes and reflects the receipt of an amount of shares of our common stock equal to the threshold levels under each LTPP award outstanding as of December 31, 2018.
Executive Compensation
Amended and Restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan
On June 29, 2015, our Board and our Compensation Committee approved the Primo Water Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan. Our Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan designed to allow our officers to defer the payment of awards under the VCP. On February 28, 2017, our Board and our Compensation Committee approved an amended and restated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan in order to allow our officers to defer payment of awards under our LTPP. The Amended and Restated Primo Water Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan as in effect on February 28, 2017 is referred to as the "Deferred Compensation Plan."
Deferred Compensation Plan Promotes Responsible Executive Compensation Program
Our Deferred Compensation Plan allows participating employees, including each of our Named Executive Officers, to elect to defer up to 100% of his or her award that may become payable under the VCP and/or LTPP for a performance year, as applicable. Any amounts otherwise payable under our VCP and/or LTPP that are deferred into our Deferred Compensation Plan are not taxable to the participants for income tax purposes until the time such awards are actually received by the participant. This allows each of our Deferred Compensation Plan participants, including our Named Executive Officers, the ability to achieve more efficient tax planning and structuring of their awards under the VCP and/or the LTPP. Participation in our Deferred Compensation Plan by our Named Executive Officers increases the receptiveness of our Named Executive Officers to awards issued under our VCP and/or LTPP and allows our Compensation Committee to utilize such long-term equity incentive compensation arrangements to further align the interests of our Named Executive Officers with those of our shareholders and other key stakeholders.
Operational Summary of Deferred Compensation Plan
Our Deferred Compensation Plan permits a participating employee to elect to defer up to 100% of his or her award that may become payable under the VCP and/or LTPP for a performance year, as applicable. The Company establishes an account for each participant in our Deferred Compensation Plan, and a participant's account is then credited with a number of deferred stock units equal to the number of shares of Company common stock that would have been payable to the participant under the VCP and/or our LTPP, as applicable, but for the deferral election.
A participant's account will be distributed based on the participant's payment election made at the time of deferral. A participant can elect to have deferrals credited to a "post-service account," to be paid in a lump sum or installments (of up to 10 years) commencing the seventh month after a separation from service. Alternatively, a participant can elect to have deferrals credited to an "in-service account," to be paid in a lump sum or installments (of up to 10 years) commencing in a year specified by the participant at the time of the deferral election. With respect to a deferral to an "in-service account," a participant can also elect to have payment commence the seventh month after a separation from service that occurs prior to the specified payment year.
When due, payments under our Deferred Compensation Plan will be made in the form of a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to the number of stock units payable to the participant, in the manner elected by the participant and provided for in our Deferred Compensation Plan, such that the value of the participant's account under our Deferred Compensation Plan will rise and fall with the value of our common stock, creating further alignment between the long-term interests of participants and our shareholders.

In addition, in January 2018, in connection with his appointment as Chief Financial Officer of the Company upon Mr. Castaneda's retirement, we granted Mr. Mills restricted stock units covering an additional 10,000 shares of our Common Stock which will vest in four equal annual installments on January 15 of each of 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.
It is our current intention to issue all foreseeable equity compensation plan awards under the Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan if such plan is approved by our stockholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting and, if such plan is not approved by our stockholders at the 2019 Annual Meeting, under our Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan until its termination.

Mr. Castaneda retired from the Company on January 12, 2018 and was not employed at the time the Compensation Committee approved the above grants to our Named Executive Officers.
The Performance Period covering the 2018 LTPP awards is January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2020.
Executive Compensation
2017 LTPP Awards
Our Compensation Committee approved the first set of awards under our LTPP in February 2017. Performance under the 2017 LTPP awards will be assessed following the end of the three-year performance period ending on December 31, 2019. The number of shares of Common Stock to be earned under the 2017 LTPP awards will be based upon an assessment of our aggregate adjusted EBITDA and aggregate free cash flow during the performance period against the applicable metric goals.
For our 2017 LTPP awards, 60% of each award is subject to the achievement of a target adjusted EBITDA of $183.4 million, and 40% of each award is subject to the achievement of a target free cash flow of $66.4 million.
LTPP Units subject to our 2017 LTPP awards follow the same vesting schedule as our 2018 LTPP awards. Under our 2017 LTPP awards, LTPP Units are generally earned upon the achievement of at least 80% of target Adjusted EBITDA and target Free Cash Flow during the Performance Period, as applicable, at which time 50% of the AE LTPP Units and/or FCF LTPP Units, respectively, are earned. The LTPP Units are capped at achievement of 120% of target Adjusted EBITDA and target Free Cash Flow during the Performance Period, as applicable, at which time 140% of the AE LTPP Units and/or FCF LTPP Units, respectively, are earned. The number of LTPP Units earned between 80% of the applicable target and 120% of the applicable target are subject to a linear interpolation of the applicable target.
As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate adjusted EBITDA was approximately $110.1 million, and our aggregate free cash flow was approximately $15.3 million.
Other Compensation Matters
Securities Trading Compliance Policy 
Our Securities Trading Compliance Policy prohibits short sales of our securities by our directors, executives and certain other employees, including any employee who is in possession of material non-public information, each of whom is referred to as a "Covered Person". Our Securities Trading Compliance Policy also prohibits Covered Persons from trading in derivatives of our securities and from holding our securities in a margin account or pledging such securities as collateral for a loan. All Covered Persons are also prohibited from engaging in any hedging or monetization transactions, including transactions that permit ownership of Company securities while reducing the exposure to the risks and rewards of such ownership. An exception to the prohibition on pledging our securities may be permitted in certain limited circumstances with the advance written approval of the Chief Financial Officer.
Our Securities Trading Compliance Policy also requires all Covered Persons to seek pre-clearance from the Company's Chief Financial Officer before trading or gifting any Company securities, including the establishment of any 10b5-1 trading plans. In the event a Covered Person wishes to establish a 10b5-1 trading plan, such Covered Person must seek the approval of such plan from our Chief Financial Officer. Each 10b5-1 plan must specify the amount, pricing and timing of transactions in advance or delegate discretion of those matters to an independent third party, and, once the 10b5-1 plan is established, the Covered Person is prohibited from exercising any influence over the amount, pricing and timing of transactions under it.
Executive Compensation
Perquisites and Other Benefits
As a general matter, we do not offer perquisites or other benefits to any executive officer, including our Named Executive Officers, with an aggregate value in excess of $10,000 annually, because we believe we can provide better incentives for desired performance with compensation in the forms described above. We recognize that, from time to time, it may be appropriate to provide some perquisites or other benefits in order to attract, motivate and retain our executives, with any such decision to be reviewed and approved by our Compensation Committee.
Our executive officers are eligible to participate in our customary employee benefit plans, including medical, dental, vision, life and other employee benefit and insurance plans made available to our employees generally. We maintain a 401(k) plan, which is intended to be a tax-qualified defined contribution plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In general, all of our employees are eligible to participate in this plan.
Employment and Severance and Change of Control Benefits
A detailed description of our employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers is available under the section captioned "Employment Agreements and Change of Control Agreements" below, and the benefits are quantified in the section captioned "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control."
Risk Assessment
As a publicly-traded company, we are subject to the SEC's rules regarding risk assessment. Those rules require a publicly-traded company to determine whether any of its existing incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company. We do not believe that our incentive compensation plans, programs or arrangements create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Accounting and Tax Implications
Our Compensation Committee considers the accounting and tax impact reflected in our financial statements when establishing the amount and forms of long-term and equity compensation. The forms of long-term compensation selected are intended to be cost-efficient. We account for all awards settled in equity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, pursuant to which the fair value of the grant, net of estimated forfeitures, is expensed over the service/vesting period based on the number of options, shares or units, as applicable, that vest. The estimated payout amount of performance awards, along with any changes in that estimate, is recognized over the performance period under "liability" accounting. Our ultimate expense for performance awards will equal the value earned by/paid to the executives.
Tax Deductibility of Compensation; Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
We seek to maximize long-term stockholder value when determining all elements of compensation. As a result, tax deductibility is not the only consideration in awarding compensation. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code ("Section 162(m)") limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1.0 million paid to any one covered employee in any calendar year. Under the tax rules in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m) was deductible without regard to this $1.0 million limit. However, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law December 22, 2017, eliminated this performance-based compensation exception effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that "grandfathers" certain awards and arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017. As a result, compensation that our Compensation Committee structured in 2017 and prior years with the intent of qualifying as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) that is paid on or after January 1, 2018 may not be fully deductible, depending on the application of the special grandfather rules. Moreover, from and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1.0 million to our Named Executive Officers generally will not be deductible. While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will limit the deductibility of compensation paid to our covered employees, our Compensation Committee will—consistent with its past practice—continue to retain flexibility to design compensation programs that are in the best long-term interests of the Company and our stockholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of a variety of considerations taken into account.

Executive Compensation Tables
Stock Awards (Column (d)) 
The amounts shown in this column indicate the grant date fair value of stock awards computed in accordance with ASC 718. Generally, the grant date fair value is the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the award's vesting schedule. For additional information regarding the assumptions made in calculating these amounts, see the Notes to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts reflect our accounting expense for these awards and do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by our Named Executive Officers. The amounts set forth in this column also include the grant date fair value as of March 9, 2018 ($11.95) of target award opportunities in connection with awards issued to our Named Executive Officers under our LTPP computed in accordance with ASC 718. Assuming the achievement of the maximum share target amount under each award, maximum amounts (calculated as of the grant date) issued to our Named Executive Officers with respect to such awards would be approximately $913,267, $919,684, $344,600 and $344,638 for Mr. Prim, Mr. Sheehan, Mr. Mills and Mr. Hass, respectively. In addition, the $52,359 for Mr. Castaneda is attributable to the incremental accounting charge incurred by the Company in 2018 in connection with the Compensation Committee's decision to extend the exercise period for all of Mr. Castaneda's vested stock options from 30 days to one year following his retirement from the Company in January 2018.
Option Awards (Column (e))
The amounts shown in this column represent the aggregate grant date fair value of the option awards computed in accordance with ASC 718. Generally, the grant date fair value is the amount that we would expense in our financial statements over the award's vesting schedule. For additional information regarding the assumptions made in calculating these amounts, see the Notes to our audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. These amounts reflect our accounting expense for these awards and do not correspond to the actual value that will be recognized by our Named Executive Officers.
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation (Column (f))
Each of our Named Executive Officers was entitled in 2018 to a target annual performance-based incentive award equal to a specified percentage of his base salary, which was 100% for Mr. Prim, 100% for Mr. Sheehan and 50% for each of Mr. Mills and Mr. Hass. Mr. Castaneda retired from the Company on January 12, 2018 and was not eligible for an annual incentive award. Our actual pre-bonus, adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $55.4 million, or 85.2% of the $65.0 million adjusted EBITDA goal for 2018, which resulted in no annual bonus payable by the Company under the 2018 annual incentive plan. Our 2018 annual performance-based incentive plan is described in greater detail in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" above under "Annual Cash and Equity Performance-based Incentive Compensation."
All Other Compensation (Column (g))
Amounts shown in this column relate to matching contributions to our Named Executive Officers' accounts under Primo's 401(k) plan. In addition, with respect to the amounts set forth in this column for Mr. Castaneda, such amounts include certain payments paid to Mr. Castaneda in connection with his retirement from the Company on January 12, 2018, as more fully described below in "Employment Agreements and Change of Control Arrangements".

Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table
Our Deferred Compensation Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan which allows participating employees, including each of our Named Executive Officers, to elect to defer up to 100% of his or her award that may become payable under the VCP and/or LTPP for a performance year, as applicable. Any amounts otherwise payable under our VCP and/or LTPP that are deferred into our Deferred Compensation Plan are not taxable to the participants for income tax purposes until the time such awards are actually received by the participant. Each of our Named Executive Officers has deferred amounts otherwise payable under the VCP into an account under our Deferred Compensation Plan, which is then credited with a number of deferred stock units equal to the number of shares of Company common stock that would have been payable to the participant under the VCP and/or our LTPP, as applicable, but for the deferral election

CEO Pay Ratio
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by SEC rules, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Matthew T. Sheehan, our CEO for 2018. The pay ratio included below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
For 2018, the median of the annual total compensation for our employees (other than our CEO) was $41,966, and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table included above (adjusted as noted below), was $1,239,609. Based on this information, for 2018 the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees was approximately 30 to 1.
We took the following steps to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees, as well as to determine the annual total compensation of our median employee and our CEO:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 1.   We determined that, as of December 31, 2018, our entire employee population consisted of approximately 602 individuals, with approximately 576 employees working in the U.S. and approximately 26 employees working in Canada. Under the de minimis exception permitted by the SEC rules, we excluded all of our Canadian employees when identifying our "median employee." To identify the median employee from our U.S. employee population, we used the amount of "gross wages" for the employees as reflected in our payroll records for 2018. For gross wages, we generally used the total amount of compensation the employees were paid before any taxes, deductions, insurance premiums, and other payroll withholding. We did not use any statistical sampling techniques.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 2.   For the annual total compensation of our median employee, we identified and calculated the elements of that employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402(c)(2)(x), and then added the approximate value of the employee's Company-provided group medical benefits, resulting in annual total compensation of $41,966.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 3.   For the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of our 2018 Summary Compensation Table, adjusted to add $13,881 for the estimated value of Company-provided group medical benefits.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our executive officers, directors and certain persons who beneficially own more than 10% of our common stock to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock and other equity securities. Executive officers, directors and such greater than 10% stockholders are required to furnish us copies of all ownership reports they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of the reports that we received and written representations that no other reports were required, we believe that our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders complied with all applicable filing requirements on a timely basis during 2018, except that David Hass filed one late report related to a purchase of shares from the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan and Susan Cates filed one late Form 5.

Primo's management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of complete and accurate financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions, acquisitions and dispositions of Primo's assets and for maintaining appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies and establishing and maintaining internal controls designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws. Primo's registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and conducting in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States an audit of Primo's annual financial statements and a review of Primo's quarterly financial statements.
In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management Primo's audited consolidated financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
During the past fiscal year, the Audit Committee discussed with Primo's registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The Audit Committee also received during the past year the written disclosures and the letter from Primo's registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with the registered public accounting firm their independence.
Based on the reviews, discussions and disclosures referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements of Primo for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for such fiscal year.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
Proposal 2 – Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation
This Proposal 2 enables our stockholders to cast a non-binding, advisory vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.
As described in detail under the heading "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 32, our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and retain our executive officers, who are critical to our success. Please read the "Executive Compensation – Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section beginning on page 32 for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the 2018 compensation of our named executive officers.
We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation programs as described in this proxy statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, objectives and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we are asking our stockholders to vote FOR the following resolution at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the related compensation tables and the related narrative information in the proxy statement for the Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, is hereby APPROVED."
Although the vote on this Proposal 2 regarding the compensation of our named executive officers is not binding on our Board of Directors, we value the opinions of our stockholders and will consider the result of the vote when determining future executive compensation arrangements.
Vote Required for Approval
The foregoing resolution will be approved if holders of a majority of the shares present or represented at the 2019 annual meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting on Proposal 2 vote in favor of such resolution.
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Background and the Proposal
On February 28, 2019, our Board of Directors approved, subject to stockholder approval, the Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan"). If the 2019 Plan is approved by our stockholders, it will authorize the issuance of a number of shares of our common stock equal to 1,500,000, in addition to any shares remaining available for issuance under our 2004 Stock Plan and our Amended and Restated 2010 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2019 Plan will replace the Company's 2010 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "Prior Plan"), and no new awards will be granted under the Prior Plan. Any awards outstanding under the Prior Plan on the date of stockholder approval of the 2019 Plan will remain subject to and be paid under the Prior Plan, and any shares subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan that subsequently expire, terminate, or are surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of shares will automatically become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan.
Our Board of Directors recommends that stockholders approve the 2019 Plan. The purposes of the 2019 Plan are to enhance the Company's ability to attract and retain highly qualified officers, non-employee directors, key employees, and consultants, and to motivate such service providers to serve the Company and to expend maximum effort to improve the business results and earnings of the Company, by providing to such persons an opportunity to acquire or increase a direct proprietary interest in the operations and future success of the Company. The 2019 Plan also allows the Company to promote greater ownership in the Company by such service providers in order to align their interests more closely with the interests of our stockholders. Stockholder approval of the 2019 Plan will also enable the Company to grant awards under the 2019 Plan that are designed to qualify for special tax treatment under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. Before the 2019 Plan may be effective, stockholder approval is required under NASDAQ Rule 5635(c).
Vote Required for Approval
The 2019 Plan will be approved if holders of a majority of the shares present or represented at the 2019 annual meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting on Proposal 3 vote in favor of the 2019 Plan.
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Summary of the 2019 Plan
The principal features of the 2019 Plan are summarized below. The following summary of the 2019 Plan does not purport to be a complete description of all of the provisions of the 2019 Plan. It is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the 2019 Plan, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
Eligibility
Awards may be granted under the 2019 Plan to officers, employees, and consultants of the company and its subsidiaries and to non-employee directors of the Company. Incentive stock options may be granted only to employees of the Company or its subsidiaries. As of March 12, 2019, approximately 91 individuals were eligible to receive awards under the 2019 Plan, including four executive officers and seven non-employee directors.
Administration
The 2019 Plan is administered by our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee. For purposes of this summary, we will refer to the 2019 Plan administrator as the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, in its discretion, selects the individuals to whom awards may be granted, the time or times at which such awards are granted, and the terms of such awards. The Compensation Committee may also delegate its authority under the 2019 Plan to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Number of Authorized Shares
The number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2019 Plan is 1,500,000. In addition, as of the date of stockholder approval of the 2019 Plan, any awards then outstanding under the Prior Plan will remain subject to and be paid under the Prior Plan and any shares then subject to outstanding awards under the Prior Plan that subsequently expire, terminate, or are surrendered or forfeited for any reason without issuance of shares will automatically become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. Up to 1,500,000 shares may be granted as incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The shares of common stock issuable under the 2019 Plan will consist of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares purchased on the open market or otherwise.
If any award is canceled, terminates, expires or lapses for any reason prior to the issuance of shares or if shares are issued under the 2019 Plan and thereafter are forfeited to the Company, the shares subject to such awards and the forfeited shares will again be available for grant under the 2019 Plan. In addition, the following items will not count against the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2019 Plan: (a) the payment in cash of dividends or dividend equivalents under any outstanding award, (b) any award that is settled in cash rather than by issuance of shares of common stock, or (c) awards granted in assumption of or in substitution for awards previously granted by an acquired Company. Shares tendered or withheld to pay the option exercise price or tax withholding will not count against the aggregate number of shares of common stock available for grant under the 2019 Plan. In addition, only the net number of shares paid for stock-settled SARs or net-settled options will be counted against the pool of available shares, not the total number of shares subject to the award.
Adjustments
If certain changes in the common stock occur by reason of any recapitalization, reclassification, stock split, reverse split, combination of shares, exchange of shares, stock dividend or other distribution payable in stock, or other increase or decrease in the common stock without receipt of consideration by the Company, or if there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution of assets by the company, the number and kind of securities for which stock options and other stock-based awards may be made under the 2019 Plan will be equitably adjusted by the Company. In addition, if there occurs any spin-off, split-up, extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution of assets by the Company, the number and kind of securities subject to any outstanding awards and the exercise price of any outstanding stock options or SARs will be equitably adjusted by the Company.
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Types of Awards
The 2019 Plan permits the granting of any or all of the following types of awards:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options. Stock options entitle the holder to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at a specified price (the exercise price), subject to the terms and conditions of the stock option grant. The Compensation Committee may grant either incentive stock options, which must comply with Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, or nonqualified stock options. The Compensation Committee sets exercise prices and terms, except that stock options must be granted with an exercise price not less than 100% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant (excluding stock options granted in connection with assuming or substituting stock options in acquisition transactions). Unless the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, fair market value means, as of a given date, the closing price of the common stock. The fair market value of a share of our common stock as of March 12, 2019 was $15.47. At the time of grant, the Compensation Committee determines the terms and conditions of stock options, including the quantity, exercise price, vesting periods, term (which cannot exceed ten years) and other conditions on exercise.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Appreciation Rights. The Compensation Committee may grant SARs, as a right in tandem with the number of shares underlying stock options granted under the 2019 Plan or as a freestanding award. Upon exercise, SARs entitle the holder to receive payment per share in stock or cash, or in a combination of stock and cash, equal to the excess of the share's fair market value on the date of exercise over the grant price of the SAR. The grant price of a tandem SAR is equal to the exercise price of the related stock option and the grant price for a freestanding SAR is determined by the Compensation Committee in accordance with the procedures described above for stock options. Exercise of a SAR issued in tandem with a stock option will reduce the number of shares underlying the related stock option to the extent of the SAR exercised. The term of a freestanding SAR cannot exceed ten years, and the term of a tandem SAR cannot exceed the term of the related stock option.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Other Stock-Based Awards. The Compensation Committee may grant awards of restricted stock, which are shares of common stock subject to specified restrictions, and restricted stock units, which represent the right to receive shares of the common stock in the future. These awards may be made subject to repurchase, forfeiture or vesting restrictions at the Compensation Committee's discretion. The restrictions may be based on continuous service with the Company or the attainment of specified performance goals, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Stock units may be paid in stock or cash or a combination of stock and cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee may also grant other types of equity or equity-based awards subject to the terms of the 2019 Plan and any other terms and conditions determined by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Awards.The Compensation Committee may condition the grant, exercise, vesting, or settlement of any award on such performance conditions as it may specify. We refer to these awards as "performance awards." The Compensation Committee may select such business criteria or other performance measures as it may deem appropriate in establishing any performance conditions. Business criteria include, but are not limited to, any of the following: (i) net sales; (ii) revenue; (iii) revenue growth or product revenue growth; (iv) operating income (before or after taxes); (v) pre-or after-tax income (before or after allocation of corporate overhead and bonuses; (vi) net earnings; (vii) earnings per share; (viii) net income (before or after taxes); (ix) return on equity; (x) total shareholder return; (xi) return on assets or net assets; (xii) appreciation in and/or maintenance of share price; (xiii) market share; (xiv) market capitalization; (xv) gross profits; (xvi) earnings (including earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes or earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization); (xvii) economic value-added models or equivalent metrics; (xviii) comparisons with various stock market indices; (xix) reduction in costs; (xx) cash flow or cash flow per share (before or after dividends); (xxi) return on capital (including return on total capital or return on invested capital; (xxii) cash flow return on investment; (xxiii) improvement in or attainment of expense levels or working capital levels; (xxiv) operating margins; (xxv) gross margins or cash margin; (xxvi) year-end cash; (xxvii) debt reductions; (xxviii) shareholder equity; (xxix) regulatory performance; and (xxx) implementation, completion or attainment of measurable objectives with respect to (A) research, (B) development, (C) products or projects and (D) recruiting and maintaining personnel.  
[END TABLE]
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Award Limits for Non-Employee Directors
The value of awards made to non-employee directors under the 2019 Plan is limited according to the individual's position on our Board of Directors. For a calendar year, the value of awards received by the Chair of our Board of Directors, taken together with the value of cash fees and awards granted under any other equity compensation plan of the Company, may not exceed $900,000, and for all other non-employee directors, the total annual value may not exceed $600,000. Awards made to non-employee directors upon their initial election to our Board of Directors or to the board of a Company affiliate do not count against the aforementioned limitations.
No Repricing
Without stockholder approval, the Compensation Committee is not authorized to (a) lower the exercise or grant price of a stock option or SAR after it is granted, except in connection with certain adjustments to our corporate or capital structure permitted by the 2019 Plan, such as stock splits, (b) take any other action that is treated as a repricing under generally accepted accounting principles or (c) cancel a stock option or SAR at a time when its exercise or grant price exceeds the fair market value of the underlying stock, in exchange for cash, another stock option or SAR, restricted stock, restricted stock units or other equity award, unless the cancellation and exchange occur in connection with a change in capitalization or other similar change.
Clawback
All cash and equity awards granted under the 2019 Plan will be subject to clawback, cancellation, recoupment, rescission, payback, reduction, or other similar action in accordance with the terms of any Company clawback or similar policy or any applicable law related to such actions, as may be in effect from time to time.
Transferability
Awards are not transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, except that in certain instances transfers may be made to or for the benefit of designated family members of the participant for no value.
Change in Control
Our Board of Directors will determine the effect of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the 2019 Plan) of the Company with respect to any award or awards, including but not limited to, acceleration of vesting or termination of awards.
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
Term, Termination and Amendment of the 2019 Plan
Unless earlier terminated by the Board of Directors, the 2019 Plan will terminate, and no further awards may be granted, five years after the date on which it is approved by stockholders. Our Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the 2019 Plan at any time, except that, if required by applicable law, regulation or stock exchange rule, stockholder approval will be required for any amendment. The amendment, suspension or termination of the 2019 Plan or the amendment of an outstanding award generally may not, without a participant's consent, materially impair the participant's rights under an outstanding award.
New Plan Benefits
We cannot provide a new plan benefits table for the 2019 Plan and the benefits or amounts that would have been received by or allocated to participants for the last completed fiscal year under the 2019 Plan if the 2019 Plan was then in effect, as described in the federal proxy rules, because all awards made under the 2019 Plan will be made at the Compensation Committee's discretion, subject to the terms of the 2019 Plan. Therefore, the benefits and amounts that will be received or allocated under the 2019 Plan are not determinable at this time. The equity grant program for our non-employee directors is described under the Director Compensation section in this proxy statement.
Federal Income Tax Information
The following is a brief summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the 2019 Plan generally applicable to the company and to participants in the 2019 Plan who are subject to U.S. federal taxes. The summary is based on the Internal Revenue Code, applicable Treasury Regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date of this proxy statement, and is, therefore, subject to future changes in the law, possibly with retroactive effect. The summary is general in nature and does not purport to be legal or tax advice. Furthermore, the summary does not address issues relating to any U.S. gift or estate tax consequences or the consequences of any state, local or foreign tax laws.
Nonqualified Stock Options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a nonqualified stock option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the stock option on the date of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option. When a participant sells the shares, the participant will have short-term or long-term capital gain or loss, as the case may be, equal to the difference between the amount the participant received from the sale and the tax basis of the shares sold. The tax basis of the shares generally will be equal to the greater of the fair market value of the shares on the exercise date or the exercise price of the stock option.
Incentive Stock Options. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant of an incentive stock option. If a participant exercises an incentive stock option during employment or within three months after employment ends (12 months in the case of permanent and total disability), the participant will not recognize taxable income at the time of exercise for regular U.S. federal income tax purposes (although the participant generally will have taxable income for alternative minimum tax purposes at that time as if the stock option were a nonqualified stock option). If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of the shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option after the later of (a) one year from the date the participant exercised the option and (b) two years from the grant date of the stock option, the participant generally will recognize long-term capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount the participant received in the disposition and the exercise price of the stock option. If a participant sells or otherwise disposes of shares acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option before these holding period requirements are satisfied, the disposition will constitute a "disqualifying disposition," and the participant generally will recognize taxable ordinary income in the year of disposition equal to the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise over the exercise price of the stock option (or, if less, the excess of the amount realized on the disposition of the shares over the exercise price of the stock option). The balance of the participant's gain on a disqualifying disposition, if any, will be taxed as short-term or long-term capital gain, as the case may be.
Proposal 3 – Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan
With respect to both nonqualified stock options and incentive stock options, special rules apply if a participant uses shares of common stock already held by the participant to pay the exercise price or if the shares received upon exercise of the stock option are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture by the participant.
Stock Appreciation Rights. A participant generally will not recognize taxable income upon the grant or vesting of a SAR with a grant price at least equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and no additional deferral feature. Upon the exercise of a SAR, a participant generally will recognize compensation taxable as ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares underlying the SAR on the date of exercise and the grant price of the SAR.
Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, and Performance Awards. A participant generally will not have taxable income upon the grant of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance awards. Instead, the participant will recognize ordinary income at the time of vesting or payout equal to the fair market value (on the vesting or payout date) of the shares or cash received minus any amount paid. For restricted stock only, a participant may instead elect to be taxed at the time of grant.
Other Stock or Cash-Based Awards. The U.S. federal income tax consequences of other stock or cash-based awards will depend upon the specific terms of each award.
Tax Consequences to the Company. In the foregoing cases, we generally will be entitled to a deduction at the same time, and in the same amount, as a participant recognizes ordinary income, subject to certain limitations imposed under the Internal Revenue Code.
Section 409A. We intend that awards granted under the 2019 Plan comply with, or otherwise be exempt from, Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, but make no representation or warranty to that effect.
Tax Withholding. We are authorized to deduct or withhold from any award granted or payment due under the 2019 Plan, or require a participant to remit to us, the amount of any withholding taxes due in respect of the award or payment and to take such other action as may be necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment of applicable withholding taxes. We are not required to issue any shares of common stock or otherwise settle an award under the 2019 Plan until all tax withholding obligations are satisfied.
Proposal 4 – Approval of Amendment No. 3 to 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Proposal 4 – Approval of Amendment No. 3 to 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Background and the Proposal
Our Board of Directors is seeking the approval of our stockholders of an amendment to the Primo Water Corporation 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as previously amended by Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 thereto (as so amended, the "ESPP"), which amendment was adopted by our Board of Directors on February 28, 2019 subject to stockholder approval (the "ESPP Amendment No. 3"). As more fully described below, upon approval, the ESPP Amendment No. 3 would extend the term of the ESPP for an additional five years, so that our eligible employees may continue to participate in and benefit from the ESPP until April 2025. No new shares are being added to the ESPP at this time.
Stockholder approval of the ESPP, as amended by the ESPP Amendment No. 3, is required in order for the ESPP to continue to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" as defined under Section 423 of the Code.
Vote Required for Approval
The ESPP Amendment No. 3 will be approved if holders of a majority of the shares present or represented at the 2019 annual meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting on Proposal 4 vote in favor of the ESPP Amendment No. 3.
Proposal 4 – Approval of Amendment No. 3 to 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Summary of ESPP Amendment No. 3
This summary of the ESPP Amendment No. 3 is not intended to be a complete description of the ESPP Amendment No. 3 and is qualified in its entirety by the actual text of the ESPP Amendment No. 3, which is attached as Annex B to this Proxy Statement.
General
The ESPP was approved by our Board of Directors in March 2010, and by our stockholders in April 2010, and became effective upon the approval of our stockholders, and was subsequently amended with the approval of our stockholders, effective April 11, 2012 and April 27, 2017. Our ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" as defined under Section 423 of the Code.
We currently have 423,957 shares authorized for sale under the ESPP. ESPP Amendment No. 3 makes no changes to the number of shares authorized under the ESPP.
Reasons for Amendment
The ESPP provides our employees a convenient and economical way to invest in the Company and aligns their interests with those of our stockholders, encouraging long-term performance and rewarding participants for creating stockholder value. Our Board of Directors desires to continue to provide our employees the opportunity to invest in the Company through the ESPP. ESPP Amendment No. 3 allows us to continue to do so for an additional five years.
Material Features of the Plan
Administration of the ESPP. Our Compensation Committee has the authority to interpret and implement the terms of the ESPP. Our Compensation Committee has the discretion to set the terms of each offering in accordance with the provisions of the ESPP, to make all determinations regarding the ESPP, including eligibility, and otherwise administer the ESPP.
Number of Authorized Shares. A total of 23,957 shares of our common stock were originally available for sale under our ESPP, subject to adjustment in the event of any significant change in our capitalization, such as a stock split, a combination or exchange of shares, or a stock dividend or other distribution. Effective April 11, 2012, pursuant to Amendment No. 1 to the ESPP, the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under the ESPP was increased to 273,957, and was increased again effective April 27, 2017 to 423,957. The closing price of our common stock on March 12, 2019, the record date, was $15.47 per share.
Eligibility and Participation. All of our employees generally are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us or any participating subsidiary for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. As of March 12, 2019, there were 546 employees eligible to participate in the ESPP. Our Compensation Committee may exclude from an offering period highly-compensated employees or employees who have not satisfied a minimum period of employment with us which may not exceed a period of two years. In addition, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under our ESPP if such employee would:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• immediately after any grant of purchase rights, own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our capital stock; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• hold rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of our stock for each calendar year.  
[END TABLE]
Offering Periods and Purchase Periods. The ESPP provides for offering periods of up to 27 months. The offering periods under the ESPP currently consist of 12-month offering periods, with a new offering period beginning every January 1 and separate purchases taking place every 6 months during each offering period. However, we may change the timing and duration of offering periods and the frequency of purchases, as long as such changes comply with the terms of the ESPP. Unless otherwise specified by our Compensation Committee, a participant may purchase a maximum of 25,000 shares of common stock during an offering period.
Proposal 4 – Approval of Amendment No. 3 to 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Payroll Deductions. Our ESPP permits participants to exercise their stock purchase rights under the ESPP through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant's gross base compensation from the Company, excluding overtime payments, sales commissions, incentive compensation, bonuses, expense reimbursements, fringe benefits and other special payments.
Exercise of Purchase Rights. Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each purchase period during an offering period. The purchase price of the shares will not be less than 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last day of the applicable purchase period, whichever is lower. Participants may withdraw from participation in the ESPP at any time during an offering period, and will be paid their accrued payroll deductions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.
Change in Control. In the even of a "Change in Control" (as defined in the ESPP), our Compensation Committee may provide for the successor corporation to assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right, cashout of the participant's purchase right, acceleration of the next purchase date or termination of the current offering period without a purchase.
Amendment and Termination. The ESPP, as amended by ESPP Amendment No. 3, will automatically terminate in 2025, unless we terminate it sooner. The ESPP prior to ESPP Amendment No. 3 is scheduled to terminate in 2020. In addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our ESPP, except that, subject to certain exceptions described in the ESPP, no such action may adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase stock under our ESPP.
New Plan Benefits. The benefits or amounts that will be received by any participant under the ESPP, as amended by the ESPP Amendment No. 3, are not currently determinable as they are dependent upon each participant's future payroll deduction election for each offering period under the ESPP.
Federal Income Tax Consequences
The following is a summary of the material United States federal income taxation consequences to the Company and participants subject to U.S. taxation with respect to participation in the ESPP. Tax consequences for any particular individual or under state or non-U.S. tax laws may be different.
The ESPP is intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under such an arrangement, no taxable income is recognized by a participant either at the time of election to participate in an offering period under the ESPP or at the time shares are purchased thereunder, and no deductions will be allowable to us, upon either the grant or the exercise of the purchase rights.
If shares are disposed of at least two years after the grant date and at least one year after the purchase date, then the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such disposition over the purchase price of the shares or (ii) the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the grant date over the purchase price (determined as of the grant date in certain circumstances) will be treated as ordinary income to the participant. Any further gain upon such disposition will be taxed as long-term capital gain at the rates then in effect. If the shares are sold and the sale price is less than the purchase price, there is no ordinary income and the participant will have a capital loss equal to the difference between the sale price and the purchase price. The ability of a participant to utilize such a capital loss will depend on the participant's other tax attributes and the statutory limitations on capital loss deductions not discussed herein.
Proposal 4 – Approval of Amendment No. 3 to 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
If a participant disposes of the shares before the expiration of the one-year and two-year holding periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), then upon such disposition the federal income tax consequences will be as follows: (1) the difference between the purchase price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of purchase will be taxed to the participant as ordinary income, and (2) the excess, if any, of the fair market of the shares on the date of disposition over the fair market value on the date of purchase will be taxed as capital gain. If the shares are sold for less than their fair market value on the purchase date, the same amount of ordinary income will be attributed to the participant and a capital loss recognized equal to the difference between the sale price and the value of the shares on such purchase date. As indicated above, the ability of the participant to utilize such a capital loss will depend on the participant's other tax attributes and the statutory limitation on capital losses not discussed herein.
The amount of ordinary income recognized by the participant in case of a disqualifying disposition will generally be deductible by us for federal income tax purposes.
Registration of Shares. We have registered on Form S-8 under the Securities Act all of the shares currently authorized for issuance under the ESPP.

What is a stockholder of record?
A stockholder of record or registered stockholder is a stockholder whose ownership of Primo stock is reflected directly on the books and records of our transfer agent, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. If you hold stock through an account with a bank, broker or similar organization, you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name" and are not a stockholder of record. For shares held in street name, the stockholder of record is your bank, broker or similar organization. We only have access to ownership records for the registered shares. If you are not a stockholder of record, we will require additional documentation to evidence your stock ownership as of the record date, such as a copy of your brokerage account statement, a letter from your broker, bank or other nominee or a copy of your notice or voting instruction card. As described below, if you are not a stockholder of record, you will not be able to vote your shares unless you have a proxy from the stockholder of record authorizing you to vote your shares.

If you are a stockholder of record and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board of Directors on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion for any other matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting.
Beneficial owners of shares held in "street name." If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote."
Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"? 
The election of directors ("Proposal 1"), the advisory vote on compensation paid to our named executive officers ("Proposal 2"), the approval of the Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Proposal 3") and the approval of Amendment No. 3 to the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Proposal 4") are considered to be non-routine matters under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore there may be broker non-votes on Proposal 1, Proposal 2, Proposal 3 and Proposal 4.
Questions and Answers
The ratification of the appointment of BDO as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 ("Proposal 5") is considered to be a routine matter under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters, and we do not expect there to be any broker non-votes with respect to Proposal 5.
What is the quorum for the annual meeting? 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote is necessary for the transaction of business at the annual meeting. This is called a quorum.
What is the voting requirement to approve each of the proposals?
The following are the voting requirements for each proposal:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1, Election of Directors. The three nominees receiving the highest number of votes will be elected as the Class III directors to serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 2, Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation. The compensation paid to our named executive officers will be considered approved if a majority of the votes of stockholders present in person or by proxy with respect to this matter are cast in favor of the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 3, Approval of Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan. The Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan will be approved if a majority of the votes of stockholders present in person or by proxy with respect to this matter are cast in favor of the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 4, Approval of Amendment No. 3 to the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Amendment No. 3 to the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan will be approved if a majority of the votes of stockholders present in person or by proxy with respect to this matter are cast in favor of the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 5, Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. The ratification of the Audit Committee's appointment of BDO as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 will be approved if a majority of the votes of stockholders present in person or by proxy with respect to this matter are cast in favor of the proposal.  
[END TABLE]
How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
Broker non-votes and abstentions are counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. Broker non-votes and abstentions are not counted as votes cast on any proposal considered at the annual meeting and, therefore, will have no effect on the proposal regarding the election of directors, the advisory vote on the compensation paid to our named executive officers, the Primo Water Corporation 2019 Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan and Amendment No. 3 to the 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We expect no broker non-votes on the proposal regarding the ratification of the appointment of BDO as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019, and abstentions will have no effect on this proposal.
Questions and Answers
Who pays for solicitation of proxies?
We are paying the cost of soliciting proxies.

A cancellation and exchange under clause (C) would be considered a "repricing" regardless of whether it is treated as a "repricing" under generally accepted accounting principles and regardless of whether it is voluntary on the part of the Grantee.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, equity-based Awards granted under the Plan shall vest no earlier than the first anniversary of the date the Award is granted, excluding, for this purpose, any (i) Substitute Awards, (ii) shares delivered in lieu of fully vested cash Awards, and (iii) Awards to non-employee members of the Board that vest on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of grant or the next annual meeting of stockholders (provided that such vesting period under this clause (iii) may not be less than 50 weeks after grant); provided that the Board may grant equity-based Awards without regard to the foregoing minimum vesting requirement with respect to a maximum of five percent (5%) of the available share reserve authorized for issuance under the Plan pursuant to Section 4 (subject to adjustment under Section 15); and, provided further, for the avoidance of doubt, that the foregoing restriction does not apply to the Committee's discretion to provide for accelerated exercisability or vesting of any Award, including in cases of retirement, death, disability or a Change in Control, in the terms of the Award or otherwise.

Subject to adjustments in accordance with Section 15 hereof, 1,500,000 of such shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan shall be available for issuance pursuant to Incentive Stock Options.
The Board may adopt reasonable counting procedures to ensure appropriate counting, avoid double counting (as, for example, in the case of tandem or Substitute Awards) and make adjustments in accordance with Section 15. To the extent that an Award is canceled, expired, forfeited, settled in cash, settled by issuance of fewer shares than the number underlying the Award, or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares to the Grantee, the shares retained by or returned to the Company will be available under the Plan. If the Option Price of any Option, or if pursuant to Section 17.3 the withholding obligation of any Grantee with respect to an Option or other Award, is satisfied by tendering shares of Stock to the Company (by either actual delivery or by attestation) or by withholding shares of Stock, the number of shares of Stock issued net of the shares of Stock tendered or withheld shall be deemed delivered for purposes of determining the maximum number of shares of Stock available for delivery under the Plan, and shares that are withheld from such an Award or separately surrendered by the Grantee in payment of any Option Price or taxes relating to such an Award shall be deemed to constitute shares not delivered to the Grantee and will be available under the Plan. In addition, in the case of any Substitute Award, such Substitute Award shall not be counted against the number of shares reserved under the Plan.
The maximum value of Awards granted during any calendar year to any nonemployee member of the Board or the board of directors of an Affiliate ("Nonemployee Director"), taken together with any cash fees paid to such Nonemployee Director during the calendar year and the value of awards granted to the Nonemployee Director under any other equity compensation plan of the Company or an Affiliate during the calendar year, shall not exceed the following in total value (calculating the value of any Awards or other equity compensation plan awards based on the grant date fair value for financial reporting purposes): (i) $900,000 for the Chair of the Board and (ii) $600,000 for each Nonemployee Director other than the Chair of the Board; provided, however, that awards granted to Nonemployee Directors upon their initial election to the Board or the board of directors of an affiliate shall not be counted towards the limit under this paragraph.

 14.   REQUIREMENTS OF LAW   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 14.1.   General.   
[END TABLE]
The Company shall not be required to sell or issue any shares of Stock under any Award if the sale or issuance of such shares would constitute a violation by the Grantee, any other individual exercising an Option, or the Company of any provision of any law or regulation of any governmental authority, including without limitation any federal or state securities laws or regulations. If at any time the Company shall determine, in its discretion, that the listing, registration or qualification of any shares subject to an Award upon any securities exchange or under any governmental regulatory body is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the issuance or purchase of shares hereunder, no shares of Stock may be issued or sold to the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option pursuant to such Award unless such listing, registration, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Company, and any delay caused thereby shall in no way affect the date of termination of the Award. Specifically, in connection with the Securities Act, upon the exercise of any Option or the delivery of any shares of Stock underlying an Award, unless a registration statement under such Act is in effect with respect to the shares of Stock covered by such Award, the Company shall not be required to sell or issue such shares unless the Board has received evidence satisfactory to it that the Grantee or any other individual exercising an Option may acquire such shares pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Any determination in this connection by the Board shall be final, binding, and conclusive. The Company may, but shall in no event be obligated to, register any securities covered hereby pursuant to the Securities Act. The Company shall not be obligated to take any affirmative action in order to cause the exercise of an Option or the issuance of shares of Stock pursuant to the Plan to comply with any law or regulation of any governmental authority. As to any jurisdiction that expressly imposes the requirement that an Option shall not be exercisable until the shares of Stock covered by such Option are registered or are exempt from registration, the exercise of such Option (under circumstances in which the laws of such jurisdiction apply) shall be deemed conditioned upon the effectiveness of such registration or the availability of such an exemption.

 14.2.   Rule 16b-3.   
[END TABLE]
During any time when the Company has a class of equity security registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that Awards and the exercise of Options granted to officers and directors hereunder will qualify for the exemption provided by Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. To the extent that any provision of the Plan or action by the Board or Committee does not comply with the requirements of Rule 16b-3, it shall be deemed inoperative to the extent permitted by law and deemed advisable by the Board, and shall not affect the validity of the Plan. In the event that Rule 16b-3 is revised or replaced, the Board may exercise its discretion to modify this Plan in any respect necessary to satisfy the requirements of, or to take advantage of any features of, the revised exemption or its replacement.

In addition, in the event of any such increase or decease in the number of outstanding shares or other transaction described in clause (ii) above, the number and kind of shares for which Awards are outstanding and the Option Price per share of outstanding options and SAR Exercise Price per share of outstanding SARs shall be equitably adjusted; provided that any such adjustment shall comply with Section 409A.

 15.2.   Effect of Certain Transactions.  
[END TABLE]
Except as otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, in the event of (a) the liquidation or dissolution of the Company or (b) a reorganization, merger, exchange or consolidation of the Company or involving the shares of Common Stock (a "Transaction"), the Plan and the Awards issued hereunder shall continue in effect in accordance with their respective terms, except that following a Transaction either (i) each outstanding Award shall be treated as provided for in the agreement entered into in connection with the Transaction or (ii) if not so provided in such agreement, each Grantee shall be entitled to receive in respect of each share of Common Stock subject to any outstanding Awards, upon exercise or payment or transfer in respect of any Award, the same number and kind of stock, securities, cash, property or other consideration that each holder of a share of Common Stock was entitled to receive in the Transaction in respect of a share of Common stock; provided, however, that, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, such stock, securities, cash, property or other consideration shall remain subject to all of the conditions, restrictions and performance criteria which were applicable to the Awards prior to such Transaction. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the treatment of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to this Section 15.1.2 in connection with a Transaction in which the consideration paid or distributed to the Company's stockholders is not entirely shares of common stock of the acquiring or resulting corporation may include the cancellation of outstanding Options and Stock Appreciation Rights upon consummation of the Transaction as long as, at the election of the Committee, (x) the holders of affected Options and SARs have been given a period of at least fifteen days prior to the date of the consummation of the Transaction to exercise the Options or SARs (whether or not they were otherwise exercisable) or (y) the holders of the affected Options and SARs are paid (in cash or cash equivalents) in respect of each Share covered by the Option or SAR being canceled an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the per share price paid or distributed to stockholders in the transaction (the value of any non-cash consideration to be determined by the Committee in its sole discretion) over the Price Option or SAR Exercise Price, as applicable. For avoidance of doubt, (1) the cancellation of Options and SARs pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence may be effected notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Plan or any Award Agreement and (2) if the amount determined pursuant to clause (y) of the preceding sentence is zero or less, the affected Option or SAR may be cancelled without any payment therefore. The treatment of any Award as provided in this Section 15.1.2 shall be conclusively presumed to be appropriate for purposes of Section 15.1.1.

No provision in the Plan or in any Award Agreement shall be construed to confer upon any individual the right to remain in the employ or service of the Company or any Affiliate, or to interfere in any way with any contractual or other right or authority of the Company either to increase or decrease the compensation or other payments to any individual at any time, or to terminate any employment or other relationship between any individual and the Company. In addition, notwithstanding anything contained in the Plan to the contrary, unless otherwise stated in the applicable Award Agreement, no Award granted under the Plan shall be affected by any change of duties or position of the Grantee, so long as such Grantee continues to be a Service Provider. The obligation of the Company to pay any benefits pursuant to this Plan shall be interpreted as a contractual obligation to pay only those amounts described herein, in the manner and under the conditions prescribed herein. The Plan shall in no way be interpreted to require the Company to transfer any amounts to a third party trustee or otherwise hold any amounts in trust or escrow for payment to any Grantee or beneficiary under the terms of the Plan.

[BEGIN TABLE]
 17.3.   Withholding Taxes.   
[END TABLE]
The Company or an Affiliate, as the case may be, shall have the right to deduct from payments of any kind otherwise due to a Grantee any federal, state, or local taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld (i) with respect to the vesting of or other lapse of restrictions applicable to an Award, (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Stock upon the exercise of an Option or SAR, or (iii) otherwise due in connection with an Award. At the time of such vesting, lapse, or exercise, the Grantee shall pay to the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, any amount that the Company or the Affiliate may reasonably determine to be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation. Subject to the prior approval of the Company or the Affiliate, which may be withheld by the Company or the Affiliate, as the case may be, in its sole discretion, the Grantee may elect to satisfy such obligations, or the Company may require such obligations (up to maximum statutory rates) to be satisfied, in whole or in part, (i) by causing the Company or the Affiliate to withhold the number of shares of Stock otherwise issuable to the Grantee as may be necessary to satisfy such withholding obligation or (ii) by delivering to the Company or the Affiliate shares of Stock already owned by the Grantee. The shares of Stock so delivered or withheld shall have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such withholding obligations (up to maximum statutory rates). The Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock used to satisfy such withholding obligation shall be determined by the Company or the Affiliate as of the date that the amount of tax to be withheld is to be determined. A Grantee who has made an election pursuant to this Section 17.3 may satisfy his or her withholding obligation only with shares of Stock that are not subject to any repurchase, forfeiture, unfulfilled vesting, or other similar requirements.
