To Our Stockholders:
You are cordially invited to attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Pura Naturals, Inc., to be held on January 31, 2019, 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time (the "Annual Meeting"), at 23101 Lake Center Drive, Suite 100, Lake Forest, California 92630.
The matters expected to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting are described in the following Notice of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement.
We will provide our shareholders with online access to proxy materials pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. These rules allow us to advise stockholders of the availability of our proxy materials by sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, which provides instructions for how to access the full set of proxy materials through the Internet or make a request to have printed proxy materials delivered by mail. We believe compliance with these rules will allow us to provide our stockholders with the materials they need to make informed decisions, lower the costs of printing and delivering those materials, and significantly reduce the environmental impact of our Annual or Annual Meeting.
It is important that you use this opportunity to participate in the affairs of Pura Naturals, Inc. by voting on the matters to be discussed this meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we hope you will vote as soon as possible using one of the voting methods we have provided to you. Please review the voting instructions described in the accompanying Proxy Statement. Returning the proxy card with your vote does not deprive you of your right to attend the meeting and to vote your shares in person.
If your shares are held in the name of a broker, trust, bank or other nominee, you will need proof of ownership to be admitted to the meeting, as described under "How can I attend the Annual Meeting?" beginning on Page 1 of this Proxy Statement.
Thank you for your interest and investment in Pura Naturals, Inc.
Sincerely,

Questions and Answers about the Annual Meeting and Voting
Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement and proxy card?
You are receiving this Proxy Statement and proxy card because you were a Company stockholder of record at the close of business on the Record Date and are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement describes issues on which the Company would like you, as a Company stockholder, to vote. This Proxy Statement provides information on these issues so that you can make an informed decision. You do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares of Common Stock.
When you sign the proxy card, you appoint Robert Doherty, Chief Executive Officer of the Company, as your representative at the Annual Meeting. As your representative, Mr. Doherty will vote your shares of Common Stock at the Annual Meeting (or any adjournments or postponements) as you have instructed on your proxy card. With proxy voting, Mr. Doherty will vote your shares of Common Stock whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is a good idea to complete, sign and return your proxy card in advance of the Annual Meeting, just in case your plans change.
If a matter comes up for vote at the Annual Meeting (or any adjournments or postponements) that is not described in this Proxy Statement, your representatives will vote your shares of Common Stock under your proxy, at their discretion, subject to any limitations imposed by law.
When is the Record Date?
The Board of Directors has fixed December 3, 2018, as the Record Date for the Annual Meeting. Only holders of shares of Common Stock as of the close of business on that date will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
How many shares of Common Stock are outstanding?
As of December 3, 2018, the Company had 483,235,856 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to vote on matters at the Annual Meeting.
What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, VStock Transfer LLC, located at 18 Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598, you are considered, for those shares, to be the "stockholder of record." The Notice and proxy card documents for the Annual Meeting have been sent directly to you by Broadridge, our service provider, located at 5 Dakota Drive, Suite 300, Lake Success, New York 11042.
If you hold your shares in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of shares held in street name. A Notice and separate proxy card has been forwarded to you by your broker, bank or other holder of record who is considered, for those shares, the stockholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to direct your broker, bank or other holder of record on how to vote your shares by using the voting instruction card included in that mailing from your broker, bank or other holder of record.
How do I vote?
If you hold shares beneficially in street name, you may vote your proxy via the Internet, by telephone or mail by following the voting instruction card provided to you by your broker, bank or other nominee. If you do this, your shares of common stock represented by the proxy will be voted by the proxy holders in accordance with your instructions. The Internet and telephone voting facilities will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern time on January 30, 2019.
You may vote all of your shares using any of the following methods:
You can vote by mail using the proxy card that was separately mailed to you by us or by your broker, bank or other holder of record. Be sure to complete, sign and date the proxy card or voting instruction card and return it in the prepaid envelope. If you are a stockholder of record and you return your signed proxy card but do not indicate your voting preferences, the person named on the proxy card will vote the shares represented by that proxy as recommended by our Board of Directors for all matters other than the election of directors.
If you are a stockholder of record, and the prepaid envelope is missing, please mail your completed proxy card to Pura Naturals, Inc., Secretary, 23101 Lake Center Drive, Suite 100, Lake Forest, CA, 92630.
You can vote by proxy over the Internet by following the instructions provided to you on the proxy card or in the Notice. Internet voting is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 30th, 2019 by visiting www.vstocktransfer/proxy and following the instructions. Our Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders by using individual control numbers, which are located on the proxy card. If you vote by Internet, you do not need to return your proxy card.
You can vote by proxy over the Phone by following the instructions provided to you on the proxy card or in the Notice. Phone voting is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and will be accessible until 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on January 30th, 2019 by dialing 1-800-454-8683 and following the instructions.
All stockholders of record may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. You may also be represented by another person at the Annual Meeting by executing a proper proxy designating that person as your representative. If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other holder of record and present it to the inspectors of election with your ballot to be able to vote in person at the Annual Meeting.
Your vote is important. You can save us the expense of a second mailing by voting promptly.
Who will count the vote?
Representatives from VStock Transfer LLC will tabulate the votes, and an employee of ours, appointed during the meeting, will act as the inspector of election.
What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares?
Any person giving a proxy pursuant to this solicitation has the power to revoke it at any time before it is voted. A proxy may be revoked by filing with us at our principal executive office, 23101 Lake Center Drive, Suite 100, Lake Forest, CA, 92630, a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date, or it may be revoked by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your bank, broker or other holder of record. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy as described in the answer to the previous question.
All shares that have been properly voted and not revoked will be voted at the Annual Meeting.
What shares are included on the proxy card?
If you are a stockholder of record you will receive only one proxy card for all the shares (including Restricted Shares) that you hold in certificate form and in book-entry form. If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive voting instructions, and information regarding the house holding, or consolidation, of your vote, from your bank, broker or other holder of record. 
Is there a list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?
The names of stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and for ten days prior to the Annual Meeting for any purpose germane to the meeting, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Pacific Time, at our principal executive office at 23101 Lake Center Drive Suite 100, Lake Forest California, by contacting Robert Switzer, (949) 273-8100, at our offices.
What is a "quorum" at the Annual Meeting?
The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date will constitute a "quorum." Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting, who will determine whether or not a quorum is present. Abstentions and broker non-votes are each included in the determination of the number of shares present and voting for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present.
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions?
Stockholders of Record
If you are a stockholder of record and you:
Beneficial Owners of Shares Held in Street Name.
If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and do not provide the organization that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, under the rules of various national and regional securities exchanges, the organization that holds your shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters. If the organization that holds your shares does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares on a non-routine matter, the organization that holds your shares will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on this matter with respect to your shares. This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote."
Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"?
Proposals 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are routine and Proposal 2 is considered non-routine.
What vote is required to approve each proposal?
Proposal Nos.1, 3, 4, 5 and 6: Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation for Authorized Share Increase and Stock Split Appointment of the Board of Directors, Appointment of Accountants, Adjournment and Other. Proposal No. 4, the election of directors requires the approval of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Proposals Nos. 1, 3, 5 and 6, on all other matters, including, without limitation, the ratification of the appointment of Malone-Bailey ("MB") as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018, requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on Proposals Nos. 5 and 6. For Proposals Nos. 4, 5 and 6, the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting will count the votes "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions will be treated as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions have no effect and will not be counted towards the vote total for Proposals Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
Proposal Nos. 2: Amendment of the Articles of Incorporation for Authorized Creation of Preferred Shares. Proposal 2 require the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For such Proposals, the inspector of elections appointed for the Annual Meeting will count the votes "FOR," "AGAINST," or "ABSTAIN." Abstentions will be treated as shares present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions have no effect and will not be counted towards the vote total for Proposal No. 2.
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?

PROPOSAL 1
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION: 
AUTHORIZED SHARE INCREASE
Introduction
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to amend Article Twelve of the Articles of Incorporation (such amendment as shown in Appendix B) to (i) increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock by 1,000,000,000 shares from 500,000,000, par value $0.001, to 1,500,000,000 par value $0.001.
Why did the Board approve the Authorized Share Increase?
We believe that the Authorized Share Increase, if approved, will provide us with the flexibility to issue shares for issuance for general corporate purposes, including financing activities, without the requirement of further action by our stockholders. Potential uses of the additional authorized shares may include public or private offerings, conversions of convertible securities, issuance of options pursuant to employee benefit plans, acquisition transactions and other general corporate purposes. Increasing the authorized number of shares of our common stock will give us greater flexibility and will allow us to issue such shares in most cases without the expense of delay of seeking stockholder approval. Our company is at all times investigating additional sources of financing which our board of directors believes will be in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. We do not currently have any agreements for any transaction that would require the issuance of additional shares of common stock. Our common shares carry no pre-emptive rights to purchase additional shares. The adoption of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation will not of itself cause any changes in our capital accounts.
Why has the Board sought approval of the Authorized Share Increase?
The Board believes it is in the best interests of the stockholders to approve the Authorized Share Increase to provide the Company with the necessary flexibility to issue shares for general corporate purposes, including financing activities, without requiring further action by our stockholders. Approving the Authorized Share Increase would permit the Company to issue no more than 1,500,000,000 shares of its Common Stock.
What could happen if the stockholders do not approve the Authorized Share Increase?
We currently have no unreserved and unissued shares of authorized common stock. If we do not increase our authorized shares of Common Stock, we may be unable to conduct further offerings of our equity securities to raise additional capital to implement our business plan or to further our corporate objectives.
What dilutive effect will the Authorized Share Increase?
If the stockholders approve the Authorized Share Increase, the Board issue additional shares of Common Stock without obtaining further shareholder approval, except as provided under Colorado corporate law or under the rules of any national securities exchange or automated quotation system on which shares of Common Stock of the Company are then quoted, listed or traded. The relative voting and other rights of holders of the Common Stock will not be altered by the authorization of additional shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock will continue to entitle its owner to one vote. When issued, the additional shares of Common Stock authorized by the amendment will have the same rights and privileges as the shares of Common Stock currently authorized and outstanding. Issuance of significant numbers of additional shares of the Company's Common Stock in the future (i) will dilute current stockholders' percentage ownership, (ii) if such shares are issued at prices below what current stockholders' paid for their shares, may dilute the value of current stockholders' shares and (iii) by reducing the percentage of equity of the Company owned by present stockholders, would reduce such present stockholders' ability to influence the election of directors or any other action taken by the holders of Common Stock and (iv) issuance of a material number of shares of Common Stock could create downward pressure on the per share price of the Common Stock, thereby diminishing the value of the shareholder's shares of Common Stock.
While the proposed amendment may have anti-takeover ramifications, the Board believes that the benefits it would confer on the Company outweigh any potential disadvantages. In addition to the enhanced ability to finance acquisitions and secure capital, as discussed above, the Company would gain a degree of protection from hostile takeovers that might be contrary to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board has no present intention to issue the authorized preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders. Rather, the Board intends to issue preferred shares only for the purpose of facilitating acquisitions, capital-raising transactions and for other corporate purposes which the Board believes are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
If the stockholders approve the Authorized Share Increase, does the Company have plans for future issuances of shares of Common Stock?
Given the Company's current available capital, its cash and cash equivalents, and its need for additional capital to implement its plan of operations, the Company currently anticipates that it will be required to conduct an offering of its equity securities in the near future. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the Company has not entered into any formal agreements with respect to the securities it might offer or the terms and conditions of such offering, but the Company anticipates that the securities it offers might consist of shares of Common Stock, Common Stock purchase warrants, convertible debt or other derivative securities of the Company. Such securities would be offered at a price negotiated at arm's length under the current market conditions at the time of pricing.
We anticipate that the offering, if conducted, will be an offering of Common Stock, Common Stock warrants or a combination thereof. The offering will be made to third party investors, likely pursuant to a best efforts placement agency agreement with a FINRA-registered broker dealer. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, the size, pricing and other terms of the offering have not been determined and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to complete the offering.
We do not believe that we currently have sufficient available capital to fully execute our current strategy. We believe additional funding will be required in the near term. It is likely that such funding would require authorized shares beyond what is currently authorized without effecting either the Authorized Share Increase or the Reverse Stock Split. This Proxy Statement does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities.
Approval of the Authorized Share Increase will provide us with the necessary flexibility to raise capital and restructure our capital using equity, if and when the opportunities arise.
If the Authorized Share Increase is approved and we engage in one or more transactions involving the issuance of our equity securities, current stockholders of the Company may be substantially diluted as a result of such future issuances. The amount of potential dilution will be even greater if the Reverse Stock Split is approved and implemented by the Board. See "Proposal 3  — Reverse Stock Split" above.
What amendments are being made to the Articles of Incorporation?
The first paragraph of Article Four of the Articles of Incorporation which currently reads as follows:
"ARTICLE FOUR"
The total number of shares of capital stock the Corporation is authorized to issue is Five Hundred Million (500,000,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock")" shall be amended to read as follows:
"ARTICLE FOUR"
The total number of shares of capital stock the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,500,000,000 (one billion five hundred million) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock").
Does the Board recommend approval of the Authorized Share Increase?
Yes. After considering the entirety of the circumstances, the Board has unanimously concluded that the Authorized Share Increase is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the Board unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the Authorized Share Increase.
What vote is required to approve the Authorized Share Increase?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares is required to amend our Articles of Incorporation to effect the Authorized Share Increase. Failures to vote, abstentions and broker "non-votes", if any, will be the equivalent of a vote AGAINST this proposal.
Possible Anti-Takeover Implications of the Authorized Share Increase
The Company has no intent or plan to employ the additional unissued authorized shares as an anti-takeover device. As indicated above, the purpose of the Authorized Share Increase is to ensure that we have sufficient authorized Common Stock to, among other things, consummate future equity financings. However, the Company's authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock could be issued in one or more transactions that could make a change of control more difficult and therefore more unlikely.
Our Board did not propose the Authorized Share Increase in response to any effort known to our Board to accumulate Common Stock or to obtain control of the Company by means of a merger, tender offer or solicitation in opposition to management. Further, our Board does not currently contemplate recommending the adoption of any other amendments to our Articles of Incorporation that could be construed as limiting the ability of third parties to take over or effect a change of control.
The issuance in the future of additional authorized shares of Common Stock may have the effect of diluting the earnings or loss per share and book value per share, as well as the ownership and voting rights of the holders of our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. In addition, an increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock may have a potential anti-takeover effect, as our ability to issue additional shares could be used to thwart persons, or otherwise dilute the stock ownership of stockholders, seeking to control us. The Authorized Share Increase is not being recommended by our Board as part of an anti-takeover strategy.
While the proposed amendment may have anti-takeover ramifications, the Board believes that the benefits it would confer on the Company outweigh any potential disadvantages. In addition to the enhanced ability to finance acquisitions and secure capital, as discussed above, the Company would gain a degree of protection from hostile takeovers that might be contrary to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board has no present intention to issue the authorized preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders. Rather, the Board intends to issue preferred shares only for the purpose of facilitating acquisitions, capital-raising transactions and for other corporate purposes which the Board believes are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
Effect on Dividends
The payment of dividends, including the timing and amount dividends, must be made in accordance with our Articles of Incorporation and the requirements of Colorado. We cannot assure you that any dividends will be paid in the future on the shares of Common Stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory future prospects and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our Board deems relevant.
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers
Our directors and executive officers do not have substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposal except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock or any other of our securities.
Reservation of Right to Delay the Filing of, or Abandon the Authorized Share Increase
We reserve the right to delay the filing of, or abandon, the Authorized Share Increase without further action by our stockholders at any time before December 31, 2019, even if the Authorized Share Increase has been approved by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting. By voting in favor of the Authorized Share Increase, you are expressly also authorizing our Board to delay (until December 31, 2019) or abandon the Authorized Share Increase if it determines, in its sole discretion, that such action is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
The Board will consider whether the Reverse Stock Split (see Proposal 3 above) is approved and implemented in determining whether to effect the Authorized Share Increase. The Board may determine to implement the Authorized Share Increase only, the Reverse Stock Split only, neither or both.
Effective Date
Colorado law and our Articles of Incorporation require stockholder approval of the amendment effecting the Authorized Share Increase. If the amendment is approved by a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote thereon and our Board determines to proceed with the Authorized Share Increase, we will amend Article Four to increase the number of authorized Common Stock as described above. The Authorized Share Increase will become effective upon the filing of the amended Articles of Incorporation with the Colorado Secretary of State.
No Dissenters' Rights
Our stockholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the Authorized Share Increase. Furthermore, we do not intend to independently provide our stockholders with any such rights.
Certain Risks Associated with the Authorized Share Increase
There are a number of risks associated with the Authorized Share Increase, including as follows:
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT THE AUTHORIZED SHARE INCREASE. 
PROPOSAL 2
AMENDMENT OF ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION: 
AUTHORIZED THE CREATION OF PREFERRED SHARES
Introduction
Our Board has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to amend Article Twelve of the Articles of Incorporation (such amendment as shown in Appendix B) to authorize 100,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock, and grant the Board of Directors (the "Board") "blank check preferred stock" authority allowing the Board to fix the terms and issue new series of preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the Company's common stock.
Why did the Board approve the Creation of the Blank Check Preferred?
The Board of Directors has approved, subject to receipt of shareholder approval, an amendment to the Company's Certificate of Incorporation to authorize 100,000,000 shares of "blank check" preferred stock for issuance. The amendment will vest in the Board of Directors the authority to create one or more series of preferred stock and to determine by resolution the terms of each such series referred to as "blank check" provisions, without further shareholder approval. The authority of the Board of Directors with respect to each series, without limitation, includes a determination of the following: (a) the number of shares to constitute the series; (b) the liquidation rights, if any; (c) the dividend rights and rates, if any; (d) the rights and terms of redemption; (e) the voting rights, if any, which may be full, special, conditional, or limited; (f) whether the shares will be convertible or exchangeable into securities of the Corporation, and the rates thereof, if any; (g) any limitations on the payment of dividends on the common stock and non-voting common stock while any series is outstanding; (h) any other provisions that are not inconsistent with the Certificate of Incorporation; and (i) any other preference, limitations, or rights that are permitted by law. The adoption of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation will not of itself cause any changes in our capital accounts.
The Company's Certificate of Incorporation does not presently authorize the issuance of shares other than common stock. The primary purpose of establishing a class of "blank check" preferred stock is to provide the Corporation with greater flexibility with respect to future financing transactions. The Board of Directors has concluded that the Company should have a full range of capital financing alternatives available in its Certificate of Incorporation to meet the needs of particular transactions and then prevailing market conditions.
The Board of Directors believes that authorization of the preferred stock is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and does not have any plans calling for the issuance of shares of preferred stock at the present time. The designation and issuance of any series of preferred stock would be on terms deemed by the Board of Directors to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders at that time.
What dilutive effect will the Creation of Blank Check Preferred have?
The amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to authorize preferred stock as proposed could also adversely affect the ability of third parties to take over or change the control of the Company. The issuance of preferred stock with voting rights may, under certain circumstances, create voting impediments with respect to changes in control of the Company or dilute the stock ownership of holders of common stock seeking to obtain control of the Company. The ability of the Board to establish the rights of, and to cause the Company to issue, substantial amounts of preferred stock without the need for shareholder approval could discourage potential acquirers and therefore deprive shareholders of benefits they might otherwise obtain from an attempt to acquire ownership or control of the Company, such as selling their shares at a premium over market price. Potentially, the issuance of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board of Directors could make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors from office even if such change would serve the interests of the Company and its shareholders.
While the proposed amendment may have anti-takeover ramifications, the Board believes that the benefits it would confer on the Company outweigh any potential disadvantages. In addition to the enhanced ability to finance acquisitions and secure capital, as discussed above, the Company would gain a degree of protection from hostile takeovers that might be contrary to the interests of the Company and its shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board has no present intention to issue the authorized preferred shares for any defensive or anti-takeover purpose, subject to the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Company and its shareholders. Rather, the Board intends to issue preferred shares only for the purpose of facilitating acquisitions, capital-raising transactions and for other corporate purposes which the Board believes are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
If the stockholders approve the Creation of Preferred Stock, does the Company have plans for future issuances of shares of Preferred Stock?
The Board has no present intention to issue the authorized preferred shares. The Board intends to issue preferred shares only for the purpose of facilitating acquisitions, capital-raising transactions and for other corporate purposes which the Board believes are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
What amendments are being made to the Articles of Incorporation?
The first paragraph of Article Four of the Articles of Incorporation which currently reads as follows:
"ARTICLE FOUR"
The total number of shares of capital stock the Corporation is authorized to issue is Five Hundred Million (500,000,000) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock")"shall be amended to read as follows:
"ARTICLE FOUR"
The total number of shares of capital stock the Corporation is authorized to issue is 1,500,000,000 (one billion five hundred million) shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ("Preferred Stock").
The Board of Directors of the Corporation is hereby expressly authorized to provide for the issue of all of any of the remaining unissued and undesignated shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, and such designation, relative rights, preferences and limitations thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock."
Does the Board recommend approval for the Creation of the Preferred Shares?
Yes. After considering the entirety of the circumstances, the Board has unanimously concluded that the creation of Preferred stock is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the Board unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote in favor for the creation of Preferred stock.
What vote is required to approve the Creation of the Preferred Shares?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares is required to amend our Articles of Incorporation to effect the creation of Preferred stock. Failures to vote, abstentions and broker "non-votes", if any, will be the equivalent of a vote AGAINST this proposal.

THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE AMENDMENT OF THE ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION TO EFFECT THE CREATION OF THE PREFERRED SHARES. 
PROPOSAL 3 
REVERSE STOCK SPLIT
Introduction
In order to maintain flexibility to settle our debts and obligations through the issuance of shares and to permit the Company to issue additional shares of Common Stock as necessary to obtain financing for the Company, our Board has unanimously determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to amend Article Four of the Articles of Incorporation (such amendment as shown in Appendix B) to effect a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock at a ratio between 5-to-1 and 50-to-1 and effective upon a date on or prior to December 31, 2019, such ratio and effective date to be determined by the Board (the "Reverse Stock Split").
Why did the Board approve the Reverse Stock Split?
Authorized 
The general purpose and effect of the amendment to our corporation's Articles of Incorporation through the Reverse Stock Split and Authorized Share Increase is to increase our authorized share capital, which will enhance our company's ability to finance the development and operation of our business.
Our board of directors approved the amendment to our corporation's Articles of Incorporation to increase our authorized share capital so that such shares will be available for issuance for general corporate purposes, including financing activities, without the requirement of further action by our stockholders. Potential uses of the additional authorized shares may include public or private offerings, conversions of convertible securities, issuance of options pursuant to employee benefit plans, acquisition transactions and other general corporate purposes. Increasing the authorized number of shares of our common stock will give us greater flexibility and will allow us to issue such shares in most cases without the expense of delay of seeking stockholder approval. Our company is at all times investigating additional sources of financing which our board of directors believes will be in our best interests and in the best interests of our stockholders. We do not currently have any agreements for any transaction that would require the issuance of additional shares of common stock. Our common shares carry no pre-emptive rights to purchase additional shares. The adoption of the amendment to our Articles of Incorporation will not of itself cause any changes in our capital accounts.
Attraction of Institutional Investors
The Board also recommended the Reverse Stock Split, in part, because the Board and management of the Company believe that the Company can improve the marketability and liquidity of its Common Stock, annually with institutional investors, if the share price of the Common Stock is increased to a range closer to $5.00 per share.
Board Determination
The Board has considered the potential harm to the Company and our stockholders of the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Furthermore, in approving the proposal          authorizing the Reverse Stock Split, the Board considered that our Common Stock, at its current price, may not appeal to brokerage          firms that are reluctant to recommend lower priced securities to their clients. Investors may also be dissuaded from purchasing          lower priced stocks because the brokerage commissions, as a percentage of the total transaction, tend to be higher for such stocks.          Institutional investors may be prohibited from purchasing lower priced stocks based on their internal policies or governing documents.          Moreover, the analysts at many brokerage firms do not monitor the trading activity or otherwise provide coverage of lower priced          stocks.

Moreover, the analysts at many brokerage firms do not monitor the trading activity or otherwise provide coverage of lower priced          stocks.   
[END TABLE]
What amendments are being made to the Articles of Incorporation?
The following paragraph will be added to Article Four of the Articles of Incorporation:
"The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized to provide for a stock split, where each number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock in the range of five (5) to fifty (50) shares as selected by the Board of Directors shall be combined and converted automatically, without further action, into one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock (the "Stock Split") on a date selected by the Board of Directors through and including December 31, 2019 (the "Split Effective Date"). No certificate representing any fractional share interest in the Corporation's post-split shares shall be issued. In lieu of any fraction of a post-split share to which the stockholder is otherwise entitled, all fractional shares shall be rounded up and a stockholder of pre-split shares will receive an entire post-split share. No cash payment shall be made to reduce or eliminate any fractional share interest. Stockholders are not required to exchange their certificates representing shares of Common Stock held prior to the reverse stock split for new certificates representing shares of Common Stock after the reverse stock split."
Does the Board recommend approval of the Reverse Stock Split?
Yes. After considering all the circumstances, the Board has unanimously determined that the Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and the Board unanimously recommends that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of the Reverse Stock Split.
What vote is required to approve the Reverse Stock Split?
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting shares is required to amend the Articles of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split. Failures to vote and abstentions will be the equivalent of a vote against this proposal.
What dilutive effect will the Reverse Stock Split have?
Following the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, there will be an increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock. Additional shares of Common Stock, if issued, will have a dilutive effect upon the percentage of equity of the Company owned by our present stockholders. The relative voting and other rights of holders of the Common Stock will not be altered by the authorization of additional shares of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock will continue to entitle its owner to one vote. When issued, the additional shares of Common Stock authorized by the amendment will have the same rights and privileges as the shares of Common Stock currently authorized and outstanding. However, the issuance of such additional shares of Common Stock may be disadvantageous to current stockholders as (i) additional issuances would likely reduce per share dividends, if any, (ii) if such additional shares are issued at prices below what current stockholders' paid for their shares, additional issuances may dilute the value of current stockholders' shares and/or (iii) by reducing the percentage of equity of the Company owned by present stockholders, additional issuances would reduce such present stockholders' ability to influence the election of directors or any other action taken by the holders of Common Stock and (iv) issuance of a material number of shares of Common Stock could create downward pressure on the per share price of the Common Stock, thereby diminishing the value of the shareholder's shares of Common Stock.
Material Effects of the Proposed Reverse Stock Split
Should the shareholders vote to amend the Company's Articles of Incorporation to effect the Reverse Stock Split, the outstanding shares of our Common Stock will be reduced such that one share of our Common Stock will be issued for a specified number of shares, which number shall be equal to or greater than 5 and equal to or less than 50, of outstanding shares of our Common Stock, with the exact number within such range to be determined by the Board prior to the effective time of such amendment. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, any fractional shares that would otherwise be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. Even if stockholder approval of the Reverse Stock Split is obtained, the Board may abandon the Reverse Stock Split in its sole discretion if it determines that the Reverse Stock Split is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
The Reverse Stock Split will not change the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock (see Proposal II regarding the Authorized Share Increase).
The Reverse Stock Split will affect all holders of our Common Stock uniformly and will not affect any stockholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company (subject to the treatment of fractional shares). In addition, the Reverse Stock Split will not affect the proportionate voting power of any holder of Common Stock (subject to the treatment of fractional shares).
Based on our shares of Common Stock outstanding as of December 3, 2018, the principal effects of the Reverse Stock Split will be that the number of shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding will be reduced from 483,235,856 shares as of December 3, 2018, to a range of 96,647,171 (if a 1-for-5 ratio is chosen) to 9,664,717 shares (if a 1-for-50 ratio is chosen), depending on the exact exchange ratio chosen by the Board and without giving effect to any rounding up of fractional shares.
In determining which ratio to implement, if any, following receipt of stockholder approval, our Board may consider, among other things, various factors such as:
The principal effects of the Reverse Stock Split will be as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each 5 to 50 shares of Common Stock, inclusive, as determined in the sole discretion of our Board, will be combined into one new share of Common Stock, with any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the split being rounded up to the nearest whole share; 
• each 5 to 50 shares of Common Stock, inclusive, as determined in the sole discretion of our Board, will be combined into one new share of Common Stock, with any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the split being rounded up to the nearest whole share; 
• each 5 to 50 shares of Common Stock, inclusive, as determined in the sole discretion of our Board, will be combined into one new share of Common Stock, with any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the split being rounded up to the nearest whole share; 
• the number of shares of Common Stock available for  future issuance will increase accordingly, as illustrated in the table above.  
[END TABLE]
Possible Anti-Takeover Implications of the Reverse Stock Split
The issuance in the future of additional shares of our Common Stock made available by the Reverse Stock Split may have the effect of diluting the earnings or loss per share and book value per share, as well as the ownership and voting rights of the holders of our then-outstanding shares of Common Stock. In addition, an increase in the number of authorized but unissued shares of our Common Stock due to the Reverse Stock Split may have a potential anti-takeover effect, as our ability to issue additional shares could be used to thwart persons, or otherwise dilute the stock ownership of stockholders, seeking to control us. Further, the ability to issue our shares of Common Stock at a lower price may afford the Company added flexibility to deter a potential takeover of the Company by diluting the shares held by a potential suitor or issuing shares to a stockholder that will vote in accordance with the Board's desires at a very low par value. A takeover may be beneficial to independent stockholders because, among other reasons, a potential suitor may offer such stockholders a premium for their shares of Common Stock compared to the then-existing market price. The Reverse Stock Split is not being recommended by our Board as part of an anti-takeover strategy.
Reservation of Right to Delay the Filing of, or Abandon, the Reverse Stock Split
If stockholder approval is obtained to effect the Reserve Stock Split, the Board expects to select an appropriate ratio and will implement the Reverse Stock Split on or before December 31, 2019. However, the Board reserves the authority to decide, in its sole discretion, to delay or abandon the Reverse Stock Split after such vote and before the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split if it determines that the Reverse Stock Split is no longer in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
The Board will also consider whether the Authorized Share Increase (see Proposal II below) is approved and implemented in determining whether to effect the Reverse Stock Split. The Board may determine to implement the Authorized Share Increase only, the Reverse Stock Split only, neither or both.
Fractional Shares
Our stockholders will not receive fractional post-Reverse Stock Split shares in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Instead, any fractional shares that would otherwise be issuable as a result of the Reverse Stock Split will be rounded up to the nearest whole share. No stockholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares.
No Going Private Transaction
The Reverse Stock Split is not intended as, and will not have the effect of, a "going private transaction" covered by Rule 13e-3 under the U.S. Exchange Act. Following the Reverse Stock Split, the Company will continue to be subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
Effective Time
The proposed Reverse Stock Split would become effective as of 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time on the date specified in the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation effecting the Reverse Stock Split as filed with the office of the Secretary of State of Colorado or such other time on that date as the Board may determine (the "Effective Time"). Except as explained above with respect to fractional shares, at the Effective Time, shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior thereto will be combined, automatically and without any action on the part of our stockholders, into one share of our Common Stock in accordance with the ratio of between 1 for 5 and 1 for 50.
After the Effective Time, our Common Stock will have a new Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures ("CUSIP") number, which is a number used to identify our equity securities, and stock certificates with the older CUSIP numbers will need to be exchanged for stock certificates with the new CUSIP numbers by following the procedures described below.
Procedures for effecting the Reverse Stock Split and Exchange of Stock Certificates
If the Company's stockholders approve the Reverse Stock Split and the Board determines that it is in the Company's best interest to effect the Reverse Stock Split, the Reverse Stock Split would become effective at such time as the amendment to the Articles of Incorporation, the form of which is attached as Appendix B to this Proxy Statement, is filed with the Secretary of State of Colorado or such time and date as stated therein when filed.
As soon as practicable after the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, the Company will notify its stockholders that the Reverse Stock Split has been implemented. VStock Transfer LLC, the Company's transfer agent, will act as exchange agent for purposes of implementing the exchange of stock certificates. Holders of pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our Common Stock will be asked to surrender to the exchange agent certificates representing pre-Reverse Stock Split shares of our Common Stock in accordance with the procedures to be set forth in a letter of transmittal that will be delivered to the holders of the Company's Common Stock. No new certificates will be issued to a stockholder until the stockholder has surrendered to the exchange agent his, her or its outstanding certificate(s) together with the properly completed and executed letter of transmittal. STOCKHOLDERS SHOULD NOT DESTROY ANY STOCK CERTIFICATES AND SHOULD NOT SUBMIT ANY CERTIFICATES UNTIL REQUESTED TO DO SO. Stockholders whose shares are held by their stockbroker do not need to submit old share certificates for exchange. These shares will automatically reflect the new quantity of shares based on the Reverse Stock Split. Beginning on the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split, each certificate representing pre-Reverse Stock Split shares will be deemed for all corporate purposes to evidence ownership of post-Reverse Stock Split shares.
Effect on Registered and Beneficial Holders of Common Stock
Upon the effectiveness of the Reverse Stock Split, shares of our Common Stock held by stockholders that hold their shares through a broker or other nominee will be treated in the same manner as shares held by registered stockholders that hold their shares in their names. Brokers and other nominees that hold shares of our Common Stock will be instructed to effect the Reverse Stock Split for the beneficial owners of such shares. However, those brokers or other nominees may implement different procedures than those to be followed by registered stockholders for processing the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders whose shares of our Common Stock are held in the name of a broker or other nominee are encouraged to contact their broker or other nominee with any questions regarding the procedure of implementing the Reverse Stock Split with respect to their shares.
Effect on Registered "Book-Entry" Holders of Our Common Stock
Registered holders of shares of our Common Stock may hold some or all of their shares electronically in book-entry form under the direct registration system for the securities. Those stockholders will not have stock certificates evidencing their ownership of shares of our Common Stock, but generally have a statement reflecting the number of shares registered in their accounts.
Stockholders that hold registered shares of our Common Stock in book-entry form do not need to take any action to receive post-Reverse Stock Split shares. Any such stockholder that is entitled to post-Reverse Stock Split shares will automatically receive, at the stockholder's address of record, a transaction statement indicating the number of post-Reverse Stock Split shares held following the implementation of the Reverse Stock Split.
Dissenters' Rights
Our stockholders will not be entitled to dissenters' rights with respect to the proposed amendment to the Articles of Incorporation in connection with the Reverse Stock Split.
Effect on Dividends
The payment of dividends, including the timing and amount dividends, must be made in accordance with our Articles of Incorporation and the requirements of the Colorado Revised Statutes. We cannot assure you that any dividends will be paid in the future on the shares of Common Stock. Any declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our Common Stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory future prospects and contractual restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends, and other considerations that our Board deems relevant. See, however, Proposal 1  — Authorized Share Increase.
Accounting Matters
The Reverse Stock Split will change the number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. As a result, as of the effective time of the Reverse Stock Split, the stated capital attributable to the shares of our Common Stock on our balance sheet will be reduced proportionately based on the ratio chosen by the Board for the Reverse Stock Split to reflect the new number of shares outstanding, and the additional paid-in capital account will be credited with the amount by which the stated capital is reduced. The per share net income or loss will be restated because there will be fewer shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Effect on Our Senior Secured Convertible Notes, Options and Warrants
If the Reverse Stock Split is effected, the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of our outstanding stock options (including shares reserved for issuance under the Company's stock plans) and warrants will be proportionately adjusted by the applicable administrator, using the same ratio as the Reverse Stock Split, rounded up to the nearest whole share. In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the Board or the applicable administrator will implement only applicable technical, conforming changes to the securities, including ratably reducing the authorized shares of Common Stock available for awards under the Company's stock plans. In addition, the conversion price for each outstanding convertible notes and the exercise price for each outstanding stock option and warrant would be increased in inverse proportion to the split ratio such that upon an conversion or exercise, the aggregate conversion price for conversion of convertible notes and the aggregate exercise price payable by the optionee or warrant holder to the Company for the shares subject to the option or warrant would remain approximately and proportionally the same as the aggregate exercise price prior to the Reverse Stock Split.
Interests of Directors and Executive Officers
Our directors and executive officers do not have substantial interests, directly or indirectly, in the matters set forth in this proposal except to the extent of their ownership of shares of our Common Stock or any other of our securities.
Certain Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Reverse Stock Split
The following is a summary of material United States federal income tax consequences of the Reverse Stock Split to holders of our Common Stock. Except where noted, this summary deals only with our Common Stock that is held as a capital asset.
This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and United States Treasury regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized below.
This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes that may be applicable to holders of Common Stock and does not deal with non-U.S., state, local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to stockholders in light of their particular circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to Annual treatment under the United States federal income tax laws (including if you are a dealer in securities or currencies; a financial institution; a regulated investment company; a real estate investment trust; an insurance company; a tax-exempt organization; a person holding shares as part of a hedging, integrated or conversion transaction, a constructive sale or a straddle; a trader in securities that has elected the mark-to-market method of accounting for your securities; a person liable for alternative minimum tax; a person who owns or is deemed to own 10% or more of our voting stock; a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes; a person whose "functional currency" is not the United States dollar; a United States expatriate; a "controlled foreign corporation"; or a "passive foreign investment company").
We cannot assure you that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we describe in this summary. No ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or opinion of counsel will be obtained regarding the federal income tax consequences to stockholders as a result of the Reverse Stock Split.
If a partnership (or other entity treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds our Common Stock, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our Common Stock, you should consult your own tax advisors.
We believe that the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, would be a tax-free recapitalization under the Code. If the Reverse Stock Split qualifies as a tax-free recapitalization under the Code, then, generally, for United States federal income tax purposes, no gain or loss will be recognized by the Company in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and no gain or loss will be recognized by stockholders that exchange their shares of pre-split Common Stock for shares of post-split Common Stock. The post-split Common Stock in the hands of a stockholder following the Reverse Stock Split will have an aggregate tax basis equal to the aggregate tax basis of the pre-split Common Stock held by that stockholder immediately prior to the Reverse Stock Split. A stockholder's holding period for the post-split Common Stock generally will be the same as the holding period for the pre-split Common Stock exchanged therefor.
Alternative characterizations of the Reverse Stock Split are possible. For example, while the Reverse Stock Split, if implemented, would generally be treated as a tax-free recapitalization under the Code, stockholders whose fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split are rounded up to the nearest whole share may recognize gain for United States federal income tax purposes equal to the value of the additional fractional share. However, we believe that, in such case, the resulting tax liability may not be material in view of the low value of such fractional interest. Stockholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the characterization of the Reverse Stock Split for United States federal income tax purposes.
Certain Risks Associated with the Reverse Stock Split
The Board believes that the Reverse Stock Split will increase the price level of our shares of Common Stock and, as a result, may enable the Company to have sufficient shares to settle conversions of its outstanding convertible notes. There are a number of risks associated with the Reverse Stock Split, including as follow:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Board cannot predict the effect of the Reverse Stock Split upon the market price for our shares of Common Stock, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in like circumstances has varied. The Company has experienced a significant decline in its market price in each of its last three reverse stock splits and may likely experience a similar decline in market price in relation to this Reverse Stock Split as well.

The Company has experienced a significant decline in its market price in each of its last three reverse stock splits and may likely experience a similar decline in market price in relation to this Reverse Stock Split as well.   
• The Reverse Stock Split will dramatically reduce the number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock relative to the number of authorized shares of Common Stock, currently 500,000,000, but potentially 1,500,000,000 if the Authorized Share Increase is approved and implemented by the Board. A large amount of available shares of Common Stock could have adverse consequences. See "What dilutive effect will the Reverse Stock Split have?" above.

A large amount of available shares of Common Stock could have adverse consequences. See "What dilutive effect will the Reverse Stock Split have?" above.   
• The market price per share of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split may not rise in proportion to the reduction in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. If the market price of our shares of Common Stock declines after the Reverse Stock Split, the percentage decline as an absolute number and as a percentage of the Company's overall market capitalization may be greater than would occur in the absence of the Reverse Stock Split. Accordingly, the total market capitalization of our Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the Reverse Stock Split. Moreover, in the future, the market price of our Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the Reverse Stock Split.

Moreover, in the future, the market price of our Common Stock following the Reverse Stock Split may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the Reverse Stock Split.

• The market price of our shares of Common Stock may also be affected by the Company's performance and other factors, the effect of which the Board cannot predict.   
• Although the Board believes that a higher stock price may help generate the interest of new investors, the Reverse Stock Split may not result in a per-share price that will successfully attract certain types of investors and such resulting share price may not satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds. Further, other factors, such as our financial results, market conditions and the market perception of our business, may adversely affect the interest of new investors in the shares of our Common Stock. As a result, the trading liquidity of the shares of our Common Stock may not improve as a result of the Reverse Stock Split and there can be no assurance that the Reverse Stock Split, if completed, will result in the intended benefits described above.

• The Reverse Stock Split may result in some stockholders owning "odd lots" of less than 100 shares of Common Stock. Odd lot shares may be more difficult to sell, and brokerage commissions and other costs of transactions in odd lots are generally somewhat higher than the costs of transactions in "round lots" of even multiples of 100 shares.

Additionally, additional shares will be available for issuance pursuant to future potential equity          financings of the Company, including but not limited to, potentially registering these shares with the SEC.

PROPOSAL 4
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
The Board is currently comprised of four (4) members. We are therefore recommending the election of four of our existing Board members at the Meeting.

PROPOSAL 6
ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL
Introduction
If at the Annual Meeting the number of shares of Common Stock present or represented and voting in favor of either the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase is insufficient to approve the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase, management may move to adjourn, postpone or continue the Annual Meeting in order to enable the Board to continue to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase.
In this Adjournment Proposal, we are asking you to authorize the holder of any proxy solicited by the Board to vote in favor of adjourning, postponing or continuing the Annual Meeting and any later adjournments. If the stockholders approve the Adjournment Proposal, we could adjourn, postpone or continue the Annual Meeting, and any adjourned session of the Annual Meeting, to use the additional time to solicit additional proxies in favor of the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase. Among other things, approval of the Adjournment Proposal could mean that, even if proxies representing a sufficient number of votes against the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase have been received, we could adjourn, postpone or continue the Annual Meeting without a vote on the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase and seek to convince the holders of those shares to change their votes to votes in favor of the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase.
What vote is required to approve the Adjournment Proposal?
The Adjournment Proposal will be approved if a majority of the voting shares present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting votes FOR the proposal. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will be counted as votes AGAINST the Adjournment Proposal. No proxy that is specifically marked AGAINST the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase will be voted in favor of the Adjournment Proposal, unless it is specifically marked FOR the discretionary authority to adjourn, postpone or continue the Annual Meeting to a later date.
Why am I being asked to vote on the Adjournment Proposal?
The Board believes that if the number of shares of Common Stock present or represented at the Annual Meeting and voting in favor of the Reverse Stock Split and/or the Authorized Share Increase and Creation of Blank Check Preferred are insufficient to approve such proposals, it is in the best interests of the stockholders to enable the Board, for a limited period of time, to continue to seek to obtain a sufficient number of additional votes to approve the amendment.
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE ADJOURNMENT PROPOSAL.
OTHER MATTERS
The Company is unaware of any business, other than described in this Proxy Statement that may be considered at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters should properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment.

        Pursuant to Sections 7-110-103 and 7-110-107 of the Colorado Business Corporation Act, Pura Naturals, Inc., a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Colorado, hereby amends and restates its Articles of Incorporation and certifies that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     (c) The Corporation is authorized to purchase, maintain or provide          insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director of the Corporation against liability asserted against or incurred by the          director or arising from his status as a director.   ARTICLE FOUR. The total number of shares of capital stock the          Corporation         is authorized to issue is 1,500,000,000 (one billion five hundred million) shares of common stock, par          value $0.001 per share (the         "Common Stock"), and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001          per share (the "Preferred Stock").     The Board of Directors is hereby expressly authorized  to provide for a stock split, where each number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock in the range of five (5) to fifty  (50) shares as selected by the Board of Directors shall be combined and converted automatically, without further action, into  one (1) fully paid and non-assessable share of Common Stock (the "Stock Split") on a date selected by the Board of  Directors through and including December 31, 2019 (the "Split Effective Date"). No certificate representing any fractional  share interest in the Corporation's post-split shares shall be issued. In lieu of any fraction of a post-split share to  which the stockholder is otherwise entitled, all fractional shares shall be rounded up and a stockholder of pre-split shares will  receive an entire post-split share. No cash payment shall be made to reduce or eliminate any fractional share interest. Stockholders  are not required to exchange their certificates representing shares of Common Stock held prior to the reverse stock split for  new certificates representing shares of Common Stock after the reverse stock split.    The Board of Directors of the Corporation is hereby expressly authorized          to provide for the issue of all of any of the remaining unissued and undesignated shares of the Preferred Stock in one or more          series, and to fix the number of shares and to determine or alter for each such series, such voting powers, and such designation,          relative rights, preferences and limitations thereof, as shall be stated and expressed in the resolution or resolutions adopted          by the Board of Directors providing for the issuance of such shares of Preferred Stock.
