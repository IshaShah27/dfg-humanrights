By Order of the Board of Directors, 
Dana Incorporated

Maumee, Ohio 43537 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
The Board of Directors is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019, beginning at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at our World Headquarters located at 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio 43537. This proxy statement and the enclosed form of proxy are being made available to shareholders beginning March 14, 2019. 
What is a proxy? 
A proxy is your authorization for someone else to vote for you in the way that you want to vote. When you complete and submit a proxy card or use the automated telephone voting system or the Internet voting system, you are submitting a proxy. Dana's Board of Directors is soliciting this proxy. All references in this proxy statement to "you" will mean you, the shareholder, and to "yours" will mean the shareholder's or shareholders', as appropriate. 
What is a proxy statement? 
A proxy statement is a document the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) requires to explain the matters on which you are asked to vote on by proxy and to disclose certain related information. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card were first mailed to the shareholders on or about March 14, 2019. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At our Annual Meeting, shareholders will act upon the matters outlined in the notice of meeting, including i) the election of directors; ii) an advisory vote on executive compensation; iii) ratification of the appointment of Dana's independent registered public accounting firm; and iv) a shareholder proposal, if properly presented at the Annual Meeting. Also, management will report on the state of Dana and respond to questions from shareholders. 
What is the record date and what does it mean? 
The record date for the Annual Meeting is March 4, 2019 (the Record Date). The Record Date was established by the Board of Directors as required by Delaware law. Holders of our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date are entitled to receive notice of the meeting and to vote at the meeting and any adjournments or postponements of the meeting. 
Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Holders of our common stock at the close of business on the Record Date may vote at the meeting. On March 4, 2019, 143,461,011 shares of our common stock were outstanding, and accordingly, are eligible to be voted.  
What are the voting rights of the holders of common stock? 
Each outstanding share of common stock will be entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted upon.  What is the difference between a shareholder of record and a "street name" holder? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee, then the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record with respect to those shares. However, you still are considered the beneficial owner of those shares, and your shares are said to be held in "street name." Street name holders generally cannot vote their shares directly and must instead instruct the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee how to vote their shares. See "How do I vote my shares?" below. 
How do I vote my shares? 
If you are a shareholder of record as of March 4, 2019, as opposed to a street name holder, you will be able to vote in four ways: In person, by telephone, by the Internet, or by proxy card. 
To vote by proxy card, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card. To vote by using the automated telephone voting system or the Internet voting system, the instructions for shareholders of record are as follows: 
TO VOTE BY TELEPHONE: 866-883-3382

[END TABLE]
(OR) 
TO VOTE BY THE INTERNET: www.proxypush.com/DAN

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Have your proxy card and the last four digits of your Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number available when you access the website.   
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may log on to this Internet site at your convenience, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The deadline for Internet voting is 11:59 p.m. (ET) on  April 30, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
If you submit a proxy to Dana before the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares as you directed. If no instructions are specified, the proxy will be voted: i) "FOR" all of the listed director nominees; ii) "FOR" approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation; iii) "FOR" ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm; and iv) "AGAINST" the shareholder proposal. 
You may revoke a proxy at any time before the proxy is exercised by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (1)  delivering written notice of revocation to the Corporate Secretary of Dana at the Dana Law Department, 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio  43537;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (2)  submitting another properly completed proxy card that is later dated;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (3)  voting by telephone at a subsequent time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (4)  voting by Internet at a subsequent time; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (5)  voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold your shares in "street name," you must provide voting instructions for your shares in the manner prescribed by your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee. Your brokerage firm, bank or other nominee has enclosed or otherwise provided a voting instruction card for you to use in directing the brokerage firm, bank or other nominee how to vote your shares. If you hold your shares in street name and you want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from your broker and present it at the Annual Meeting. You will also need to provide to us a brokerage statement if you intend to attend the Annual Meeting. 
What is a quorum? 
There were 143,461,011 shares of Dana's common stock issued and outstanding on the Record Date. A majority of the issued and outstanding shares or 71,730,506 shares, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum. A quorum must exist to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. 
Will my shares be voted if I do not provide my proxy? 
For shareholders of record: If you are the shareholder of record and you do not vote by proxy card, by telephone or via the Internet or in person at the Annual Meeting, your shares will not be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
For holders in street name: If your shares are held in street name, your shares may be voted even if you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions. Under New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules, your broker may vote shares held in street name on certain "routine" matters. The NYSE rules consider the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm to be a routine matter. As a result, your broker is permitted to vote your shares on this matter at its discretion without instruction from you. 
When a proposal is not a routine matter, such as the election of directors, the advisory vote on executive compensation, and the shareholder proposal, and you have not provided voting instructions to the brokerage firm with respect to that proposal, the brokerage firm cannot vote the shares on that proposal. The missing votes for these non-routine matters are called "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes will be treated as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum, but not as shares present and voting on a specific proposal. 
What vote is required? 
Proposal I—Election of Directors: If a quorum exists, the election requires a plurality vote of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote, meaning that the director nominees with the most affirmative votes are elected to fill the available seats. As outlined in our Bylaws, regardless of this plurality vote any director who receives more "withheld" votes than "for" votes in an uncontested election is required to tender his or her resignation to the Board for consideration in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Bylaws. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then evaluate the best interests of Dana and its shareholders and will recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to the tendered resignation. Following the Board's determination, Dana will promptly publicly disclose the Board's decision of whether or not to accept the resignation and an explanation of how the decision was reached, including, if applicable, the reasons for rejecting the resignation. Broker non-votes will not be counted as eligible to vote and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting. 
Proposal II—Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation: The proposal represents an advisory vote and the results will not be binding on the Board or Dana. If a quorum exists, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter will constitute the shareholders' non-binding approval with respect to our executive compensation programs. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as voting against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as eligible to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on the   proposal. The Board will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
Proposal III—Ratification of the Appointment of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: If a quorum exists, the proposal to ratify the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as voting against the proposal. Brokers will have discretionary voting power to vote this proposal so we do not anticipate any broker non-votes (described above). 
Proposal IV—Shareholder Proposal: The shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. If a quorum exists, the shareholder proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. Therefore, abstentions will have the same effect as voting against the proposal. Broker non-votes will not be counted as eligible to vote on the proposal and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on the proposal. 
Dana will vote properly completed proxies it receives prior to the Annual Meeting in the way you direct. If you do not specify how you want your shares voted, they will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendations. If you hold shares in more than one account, you must vote each proxy and/or voting instruction card you receive to ensure that all shares you own are voted. No other matters are currently scheduled to be presented at the Annual Meeting. An independent third party, Equiniti Trust Company (formerly Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.), will act as the inspector of the Annual Meeting and the tabulator of votes. 
How do I attend the annual meeting? 
All shareholders as of the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the Annual Meeting. You must pre-register to attend. Please contact Dana Shareholder Services by email at InvestorRelations@dana.com or by telephone at 1-800-537-8823 providing your name, address, telephone number with area code, and note that you plan to attend the annual meeting. Dana will independently verify the status of shareholders of record as of the Record Date. Beneficial Shareholders must provide evidence of share ownership to Dana Shareholder Services. 
Beneficial Shareholders—Those shareholders that hold their shares in "street name" must contact their brokerage firm, bank or other nominee and obtain a legal proxy in order to attend the meeting and vote their shares in person. Generally, there will be a box that you can check on the voting instruction card or website to indicate that you wish to attend and vote your shares at the annual meeting. You must provide a copy of the legal proxy to Dana Shareholder Services as definitive proof of ownership as of the Record Date in order to attend the meeting and to vote your shares in person. 
If a beneficial shareholder does not obtain a legal proxy, but still wants to attend the annual meeting (and not vote their shares in person), you may provide other evidentiary material, such as broker statements, trade advices or a letter from your broker proving ownership as of the Record Date. Dana reserves the right to restrict admission if evidentiary material is not definitive proof of proper and timely ownership. 
Dana will maintain a list of verified shareholders at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. To gain admission at the meeting, you must present government-issued photo identification that matches the name on the pre-registration list. 
Annual meeting pre-registration requests must be received by the end of business on Tuesday, April 30, 2019. 
Seating is limited and admission is on a first-come basis.  Who pays for the costs of the Annual Meeting? 
Dana pays the cost of preparing and printing the proxy statement and soliciting proxies. Dana will solicit proxies primarily by mail, but may also solicit proxies personally and by telephone, the Internet, facsimile or other means. Dana will use the services of D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation firm, at a cost of approximately $12,500 plus out-of-pocket expenses and fees for any special services. Officers and regular employees of Dana and its subsidiaries may also solicit proxies, but they will not receive additional compensation for soliciting proxies. Dana also will reimburse banks, brokerage houses and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries for their out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding solicitation materials to beneficial owners of Dana's common stock. 
How can shareholders propose business (other than nominations) for consideration by shareholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders? 
Proposals to be Considered for Inclusion in Dana's Proxy Materials—Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), we must receive shareholder proposals by November 14, 2019 to consider them for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. A shareholder submitting a proposal for inclusion in our proxy materials must comply with Rule 14a-8. 
Other Proposals for Consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting—A shareholder who intends to propose an item of business at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (not for inclusion in our proxy materials) must comply with the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. Under Dana's Bylaws, our shareholders must provide advance notice to Dana in such cases. For the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, notice must be received by Dana's Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on February 1, 2020 and no earlier than the open of business on January 2, 2020. 
If Dana moves the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to a date that is more than 25 days before or after the date which is the one-year anniversary of this year's Annual Meeting date (i.e., May 1, 2020), Dana must receive your notice no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the meeting date is first distributed to shareholders or Dana makes a public announcement of the meeting date, whichever occurs first. 
Under Dana's Bylaws, the notice of proposed business must include a description of the business and the reasons for bringing the proposed business to the meeting, any material interest of the shareholder in the business and certain other information about the shareholder. Dana's Bylaws specifying the advance notice and additional requirements for submission of shareholder proposals are available on Dana's website at www.dana.com. 
How can shareholders nominate individuals for election as directors for consideration by shareholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders? 
Director Nominations for Inclusion in Dana's Proxy Materials (Proxy Access)—Pursuant to Dana's Bylaws, a shareholder (or a group of up to 20 shareholders) who has continuously owned at least 3% of our shares for at least three years and has complied with the other requirements of our Bylaws may nominate and include in Dana's proxy materials director nominees constituting up to 25% of Dana's Board. Notice of a proxy access nomination for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting must be received no later than the close of business on November 14, 2019 and no earlier than the open of business on October 15, 2019. 
Other Nominations for Consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting—A shareholder who intends to nominate a person for election as a director at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (other than under proxy access) must comply with the requirements set forth in our Bylaws. Under Dana's Bylaws, our shareholders must provide advance notice to Dana in such cases. For the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, notice must be received by Dana's Corporate Secretary no later than the close of business on February 1, 2020 and no earlier than the open of business on January 2, 2020.  If Dana moves the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to a date that is more than 25 days before or after the date which is the one-year anniversary of this year's Annual Meeting date (i.e., May 1, 2020), Dana must receive your notice no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which notice of the meeting date is first distributed to shareholders or Dana makes a public announcement of the meeting date, whichever occurs first. 
In All Cases—Whether a nomination is made under our proxy access bylaw or under our advance notice bylaw, a shareholder's notice to nominate individuals for election to the Board of Directors must provide information about the shareholder and the nominee, as well as the written consent of the proposed nominee to being named in the proxy statement and to serve as a director if elected. Dana's Bylaws specifying the proxy access, advance notice and additional requirements for submission of nominations are available on Dana's website at www.dana.com. 
Where should shareholders send proposals for business and director nominations for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders? 
All shareholder nominations of individuals for election as directors or proposals of other items of business to be considered by shareholders at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be submitted in writing to our Corporate Secretary, Dana Incorporated, 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio 43537. 
How many of Dana's directors are independent? 
Dana's Board of Directors has determined that seven of Dana's eight directors are independent. For a discussion of the Board of Directors' basis for this determination, see the section of this proxy statement entitled "Director Independence and Transactions of Directors with Dana." 
Does Dana have a Code of Ethics? 
Yes, Dana has Standards of Business Conduct for Employees, which applies to employees and agents of Dana and its subsidiaries and affiliates, as well as Standards of Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors. The Standards of Business Conduct for Employees and Standards of Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors are available on Dana's website at www.dana.com.

Yes. You may view this proxy statement and the proxy card, as well as the 2018 Annual Report, electronically by going to our website at www.dana.com/proxy and clicking on the document you wish to view, either the proxy statement and proxy card or annual report.

Final results will be published in a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed with the SEC within four business days after the Annual Meeting. If the official results are not available at that time, we will provide preliminary voting results in the Form 8-K and will provide the final results in an amendment to the Form 8-K as soon as they become available.

Executive Overview 
Financial Performance 
Dana's 2018 financial performance reflected the continuation of profitable growth and enhanced cash flows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sales were $8.1 billion, an increase of approximately $0.9 billion (13%) compared with 2017, primarily due to strong end-market demand across the markets we serve, and conversion of sales backlog.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDA of $957 million increased $122 million (15%) compared with 2017, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 11.8%, an  improvement of 20 bps over 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Free Cash Flow conversion of 3% of sales ($243 million), an $82 million (20 bps) increase over 2017.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share of $2.97 reflected an increase of $0.45 per share (18%) over 2017.  
[END TABLE]
 Dana's Compensation Philosophy 
Our compensation program is designed to balance short-term performance with long-term growth. Our compensation and benefits must be competitive with executive compensation arrangements provided to executive officers at similar levels at comparably-sized companies with whom we compete for talent. Dana's executive compensation philosophy is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee, and has the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  Reward performance  A substantial percentage of executive pay is performance-based and  therefore at risk. Our pay programs reflect our pay-for-performance culture that aligns incentives with shareholder interests.     ✓  Drive ownership mentality  We require executives to personally invest in Danas success  through stock ownership guidelines that require executives to own a significant amount of our stock. 
 ✓  Emphasize long-term incentive compensation  We share a portion of the value created for  shareholders with those responsible for the results through our performance-based long-term incentive compensation plans. Performance Shares reward executives for delivering long-term Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)  performance.     ✓  Retain, attract and reward the best talent to achieve superior results  To be consistently  better than our competitors, we need to retain and recruit superior talent capable of driving superior results. We have structured our compensation program to motivate and reward these results. 
[END TABLE]
Compensation Alignment with Business Strategy 
Our long-range enterprise strategy builds on our strong technology foundation and leverages our operating model driven by cross functional resource sharing while maintaining a customer centric focus. Our strategy furthers the expansion of our global markets while accelerating the commercialization of new technology as we continue our evolution into the era of vehicle electrification and a broader definition of mobility. 
Our executive pay program reflects our enterprise strategy in its design and with the metrics used to evaluate performance in our incentive plans. These metrics are important financial measures that provide focus on critical results in running our business effectively and efficiently. 
Enterprise Strategy  Dana's Executive Compensation Practices 
Dana's executive compensation program features many best practices that serve shareholder interests. 
Say on Pay 
Last year's advisory vote on executive compensation (Say on Pay) was strongly supported by our shareholders with 93% of votes cast in favor of our pay practices. After review of the effectiveness of the executive compensation program, its linkage to Dana's Enterprise Strategy, and given the level of shareholder support through the Say on Pay vote, the Compensation Committee elected not to make modifications to the program and to continue its practice of aligning compensation with Dana's business goals and objectives and shareholder interests. 
Relationship Between Dana's Pay & Performance 
Comparator Compensation Data 
One of the factors our Compensation Committee uses in setting executive compensation is an evaluation of how our target compensation and benefits levels compare to those of similarly-situated executives at companies that comprise our executive compensation peer group (Peer Group). Dana's philosophy for senior executive pay, including NEO pay, is to target a range of +/- 15% of the 50th percentile of our Peer Group and general industry market data as provided by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant. In addition to market data, other factors such as an individual's experience, responsibilities and long-term strategic value to Dana are also considered when making recommendations and decisions on compensation. 
The Peer Group used for benchmarking executive pay for all NEOs is made up of companies that are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in similar industries where Dana competes for talent, customers and capital – auto components, industrial machinery, construction and farm  machinery, heavy trucks and other durable goods manufacturers,  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• of similar size (as measured by annual revenue), with a range of about 1/3rd of to 3x Dana's revenue that results in a median revenue close to Dana's, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• of similar complexity to Dana (e.g. multi-country and multi-segment)  
[END TABLE]
 The Peer Group is reviewed by the Compensation Committee every year and modifications are made to ensure each company in the group meets the above comparison criteria. The companies shown in the table below comprise our Peer Group: 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee, after review with its executive compensation consultant, made the following changes to the Peer Group. The Manitowoc Company, Inc. was removed as it falls below the ideal revenue range for Peer Group selection. Delphi Technologies PLC, which spun off from Delphi Automotive, was determined to compare better than the residual Aptiv PLC in terms of business profile and was added in place of Delphi Automotive. Despite its acquisition of Federal-Mogul and planned separation into two independent companies, Tenneco Inc. remains a viable peer due to the availability of relevant benchmark data and was retained. 
Pay for Performance 
We believe it is important to look at how NEO realizable pay compares to Dana's performance as the pay that NEOs actually or could potentially receive is designed to link to such performance. The Compensation Committee and management analyzed the alignment between the pay of our NEOs and Dana's three-year (2015-2017) performance relative to the Peer Group. The table below shows the characteristics that were used for the study:  The following graphs show the correlation between realizable pay and the financial performance measures indicated above over a three-year period for Dana's CEO and other NEOs, and the CEOs and other NEOs in our Peer Group. Fortive and Delphi Technologies have been excluded due to the lack of three years of data.

Named Executive Officers  NEO Pay Mix 
To align pay levels for our NEOs with Dana's performance, our pay mix places the greatest emphasis on performance-based incentives. A significant majority (86% of our CEO's target compensation and 75% of the average target compensation of our other NEOs) is performance-based.  Elements of the 2018 Executive Compensation Program 
Our annual executive compensation program has three primary pay components: base salary, annual performance-based cash bonuses and long-term equity incentives. We also offer retirement and additional benefits.

Base Salary 
We provide base salaries to compensate our NEOs for their primary roles and responsibilities, and to provide a stable level of annual compensation. Actual NEO salary levels and increases vary based on the NEO's role, level of responsibility, experience, individual performance, future potential and market value. In addition, salary increases may be warranted because of a promotion or change in responsibilities.  Considering market-based positioning and each NEO's individual performance, the Compensation Committee approved the 2018 annualized base salary adjustments (effective April 1, 2018) below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 James K. Kamsickas    $ 1,130,000      $1,152,600      2.0%  
 Jonathan M. Collins    $ 575,000      $615,000      7.0%  
 Mark E. Wallace    $ 590,000      $605,000      2.5%  
 Aziz S. Aghili    $ 530,000      $550,000      3.8%  
 Robert D. Pyle    $ 510,000      $540,000      5.9%  
[END TABLE]
Base salary increases consider performance, market movement and other factors. Higher increases, as a percent of salary, were provided to Messrs. Collins and Pyle to align with base compensation comparable to similar positions of Dana's Peer Group. 
Annual Performance-Based Cash Incentive 
Our performance-based annual bonus program, the Dana Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) is a cash-based plan intended to motivate and reward employees based on Dana-wide, business unit and individual performance that drive shareholder value. 
The AIP covers approximately 3,200 employees, including our NEOs. At the beginning of each year, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves an annual cash bonus target for each NEO as a percentage of base salary for the upcoming performance period. The NEOs may earn from 0% to 200% of their target incentive opportunity. 80% of the incentive opportunity is based on actual consolidated and/or business unit financial performance compared to targets, and 20% is based on personal performance goals focused on driving strategic, operational and other priorities of the business. All performance-related goals are approved by the Compensation Committee. 
For our NEOs, the 2018 AIP target payout opportunities and results weightings are shown in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
NEO     AIP Target Opportunity (% of Base Salary)   Consolidated and Business Unit Performance Results   Weighting 
NEO     AIP Target Opportunity (% of Base Salary)   Consolidated and Business Unit Performance Results   Weighting

 Aziz S. Aghili    75%   50% Consolidated; 50% Business Unit results 
 Robert D. Pyle    70%   50% Consolidated; 50% Business Unit results 
[END TABLE]
Following the review of compensation paid within our Peer Group, the Compensation Committee determined that for 2018, Mr. Kamsickas' AIP target opportunity would be increased from 120% of base salary to 125% to better align his AIP award with annual incentive compensation opportunities afforded the chief executive officers of the companies in Dana's Peer Group. Mr. Aghili's target opportunity was increased from 70% to 75% as a result of his promotion to Executive Vice President. No other changes were made to the AIP target opportunities for any other NEO in 2018, as the target opportunity levels were within the competitive pay   range for each position. Leveraging the core is foundational to Dana's Enterprise Strategy in the sharing of capabilities, resources and knowledge across the company. To further emphasize the core, the performance results weightings for Messrs. Wallace, Aghili and Pyle were given equal weighting between the consolidated results and the result of the business units they lead (previously 40% business unit and 60% consolidated for Mr. Wallace to differentiate his global aftermarket responsibilities, and 60% business unit and 40% consolidated for Messrs. Aghili and Pyle). 
The 2018 AIP was based on four key performance metrics and designed to reward the achievement of performance goals at the consolidated, business unit and individual levels. The performance metrics were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Our incentive plans make certain adjustments to our reported results of operations for purposes of calculating incentive awards. Such adjustments are designed to provide a comparable basis from year to year from which incentive awards are calculated to ensure that participants in the plan are incentivized and rewarded properly. 
Adjustments generally include equity grant expense, restructuring expense and other adjustments not related to our core operations (e.g., gains or losses on debt extinguishment, pension settlements, divestitures and impairments). With these adjustments for incentive plan purposes, there is alignment with the Adjusted EBITDA measure used in our publicly reported financial results. An additional adjustment for incentive compensation is made to remove the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may have a significant impact on our financial results given our international footprint, and which is not within management's control. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Company Financial Metrics and Performance   Dana's financial performance makes up 80% of the overall  AIP awards for the NEOs and is measured by three financial metrics: Adjusted EBITDA (weighted 60%), Adjusted EBITDA Margin (weighted 20%) and Free Cash Flow (weighted 20%). These metrics are not only appropriate measures of our underlying earnings,  but also align with our overall business enterprise strategy and our external financial reporting commitments.

These metrics are not only appropriate measures of our underlying earnings,  but also align with our overall business enterprise strategy and our external financial reporting commitments.      
   To determine whether annual  incentive awards are paid, performance for the year is measured against specified target levels for each financial and personal performance metric. The target for 100% annual incentive achievement was based on achieving the levels of the three  financial metrics from Dana's (and each business unit's) annual operating plan reflecting a level of performance, which at the time was anticipated to be challenging but achievable. The threshold level was set to be reflective of  performance at which the Compensation Committee believed a portion of the award opportunity should be earned. The maximum level was set well above the target, requiring significant achievements and reflecting performance at which the Compensation  Committee believed a 200% target award was warranted.

Business Unit AIP Performance 
For Mr. Wallace, 50% of his AIP award is based on the weighted payout of the three performance metrics described above for the Commercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies business unit for which he is responsible. The weighted payout for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow in the Commercial Vehicle Driveline Technologies business unit was 67% of Target. 
For Mr. Aghili, 50% of his AIP award is based on the weighted payout of the three performance metrics described above for the Off-Highway Drive and Motion Technologies business unit for which he is responsible. The weighted payout for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow in the Off-Highway Drive and Motion Technologies business unit was 136% of Target. 
For Mr. Pyle, 50% of his AIP award is based on the weighted payout of the three performance metrics described above for the Light Vehicle Driveline Technologies business unit for which he is responsible. The weighted payout for Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Free Cash Flow in the Light Vehicle Technologies Driveline business unit was 54% of Target. For all individual business units, goals are not disclosed due to competitive harm concerns.

The performance and payout range (threshold, target and maximum incentive opportunity) of annual cash incentives for reaching 2018 performance goals under the 2018 AIP for each of our NEOs is provided in the table titled "Grants of Plan-Based Awards." The actual award paid, as shown in the table above, is also provided in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Long-Term Incentive Program 
We believe that Dana's long-term performance is driven through an ownership culture that rewards executives for creating and maximizing shareholder value. Our Long-Term Incentive Program (LTIP) provides participants, including our NEOs, with incentive awards that serve an important role by balancing short-term goals with long-term shareholder value creation while minimizing risk-taking behaviors that could negatively affect long-term results. 
The Compensation Committee approves the amount of the long-term incentive award, which is based on a percentage of the NEO's base salary. Each NEO's award opportunity is based on a target dollar value (determined prior to the beginning of the performance period) assigned to his or her position based on market comparisons for similar positions, using both Peer Group and general industry market data. For 2018, following its market data review, the Compensation Committee approved an increase in Mr. Kamsickas' LTIP target opportunity to better align with long-term compensation opportunities afforded chief executive officers of the companies in Dana's Peer Group. No other changes were made to the 2018 target LTIP opportunities for any of our other NEOs that fall within the competitive range for our Peer Group. 
50% of the total value of the target long-term incentive opportunity is delivered through performance share awards (PSAs) and the other 50% through restricted stock units (RSUs). We believe both PSAs and RSUs are forms of performance-based incentive compensation because PSAs provide direct alignment with shareholder interests and the value of RSUs fluctuates based on stock price performance. 
In addition to requiring achievement of performance criteria in respect of the performance shares, PSAs and RSUs require the NEO to remain employed with Dana for three years from the grant date, unless the NEO attains retirement age (age 60 with at least 10 years of service, or age 65 regardless of service) whereby a prorated award is paid. The value of performance share awards and RSUs granted to each of our NEOs in 2018 is shown in the "Summary Compensation Table" below. 
Performance Shares 
The LTIP is designed to provide PSAs for a select group of senior executives, including our NEOs. PSAs are tied to the achievement of two performance measures, each of equal weight: Adjusted EBITDA Margin and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). Each metric is based on a three-year performance period (2018-2020) with a performance range that can result in PSAs of 0% to 200% of the target opportunity.  The inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA Margin drives our long-term expansion commitments and emphasizes shareholder return. It also drives profitable sales growth and optimization of our cost structure. ROIC ensures management allocates Dana's capital in an effective manner that further drives returns for our shareholders. The value of performance shares is also tied to Dana's stock price performance, which aligns the executives' interests with those of shareholders. The target opportunities of PSAs for the NEOs are shown in the table below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 James K. Kamsickas      94,464   
 Jonathan M. Collins      25,299

 Robert D. Pyle      17,951   
[END TABLE]
Restricted Stock Units 
The other 50% of the LTIP design consists of RSU awards. RSUs incent and reward executives for improving long-term stock value and serve as a retention tool. RSUs are generally granted in February to approximately 160 senior management employees, including our NEOs, and cliff vest on the third anniversary of the grant, provided the recipient remains employed by Dana. The RSUs awarded in 2018, based on the target opportunities, for the NEOs are shown in the table below:

2016 LTIP Performance (Three-year performance period ending December 31, 2018) 
December 31, 2018 marks the end of the three-year performance period of the 2016 LTIP awards. The performance metrics, targets and performance-payout ranges for such awards were set and approved by the Compensation Committee in March 2016. 
For the 2016-2018 performance period, our share price underperformed relative to the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials Index, which we use as our TSR index, and fell below the threshold level for payout set in 2016. With improvements realized in financial performance driven by profitable growth and effective capital allocation, Dana's ROIC performance exceeded target levels resulting in an award of PSAs from the 2016 LTIP.

Other Elements of Compensation 
To remain competitive with other companies and to retain, attract and motivate highly talented executives, we offer perquisites and a benefits package. 
Executive Perquisites Plan 
We have adopted an Executive Perquisites Plan that provides an annual cash allowance to eligible employees (including our NEOs) in lieu of individual executive perquisites. We provide a fixed cash allowance as part of a competitive pay package to assist in retaining and recruiting talented executives. A cash-based program is preferred over programs such as car allowances, club memberships, and tax and financial planning typically provided in a company-managed executive perquisite program, which can be administratively burdensome and costly. In addition, our cash perquisite program is a taxable benefit paid on a semi-monthly basis and, unlike some managed perquisite programs, we do not provide tax gross-up payments to cover applicable taxes on the allowance. Our CEO is entitled to $50,000 annually under the plan, and the remaining NEOs are each entitled to $35,000 annually. 
International Assignment Benefits 
We maintain an International Assignment Policy for certain employees who accept an international assignment at the request of Dana. The benefits under this program generally include some or all of the following benefits as needed: cost of living allowance, location premium, relocation allowance, housing allowance, transportation allowance, tax preparation, assignment completion payment, repatriation allowance and annual home leave. Mr. Aghili received benefits under this program in 2018. 
For more information on the benefits provided to Mr. Aghili, see the "Summary Compensation Table" and related footnotes below. 
Health & Welfare—Wellness Benefits 
We also provide other benefits such as medical, dental, life insurance, accidental disability and dismemberment insurance, short-term disability and long-term disability to our NEOs, which are also provided to   all eligible U.S.-based salaried employees. Eligible employees can purchase additional life, dependent life and accidental death and dismemberment coverage as part of their employee benefits package. Our NEOs and certain other manager-level employees may also purchase supplemental long-term disability insurance. 
As part of our employee health and wellness benefit initiative, we provide an executive physical program to certain executives, including Messrs. Kamsickas, Collins, Wallace, Aghili and Pyle. The benefit provides an annual routine wellness examination and physical at a cost to Dana not to exceed $2,600 per executive.
Retirement Benefits 
We maintain a tax-qualified, "safe harbor" 401(k) plan for our employees, including the NEOs. Eligible participants may make voluntary contributions to the plan up to Internal Revenue Code limits. Dana makes both matching contributions and a fixed contribution to each eligible employee's 401(k) plan account. We match 100% of the employee's contributions up to 3% of compensation and 50% of the employee's contributions from 3% to 5% of compensation, providing a maximum employer match of 4% of compensation to an employee. We provide a company fixed contribution equal to 3.5% of each eligible employee's compensation. 
We maintain a non-qualified savings plan (restoration plan), to which we credit amounts to participants, including our NEOs, that we would have otherwise provided as matching and fixed contributions under the 401(k) plan if IRS statutory limits on 401(k) plan contributions had not been applicable. 
We maintain a non-qualified defined contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP) for certain executives, including our NEOs. We believe that the SERP enables us to provide our NEOs with a competitive retirement program in line with our peers. A portion of the SERP benefit is based on our performance. 
We maintain a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees, including our NEOs, to defer base salary and/or incentive pay to be paid at a future date. For more information regarding our non-qualified retirement programs, see the narrative following the "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation" table. 
How Compensation Decisions are Made 
Role of the Compensation Committee and CEO 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors assists the Board in fulfilling its obligations related to the compensation of Dana's executive officers and, in general, with respect to compensation and benefits programs relating to all employees. Our current Compensation Committee consists of a chairman and independent directors who are appointed annually by the Board. Under its Charter, the Compensation Committee must have a minimum of three members who meet the requirements for independence as set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and our Standards of Director Independence. Members of the Committee must also qualify as "non-employee directors" within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule 16b-3 and as "outside directors" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
The Compensation Committee members during 2018 were: Keith E. Wandell (Chairman), Virginia A. Kamsky, Michael J. Mack, R. Bruce McDonald and Diarmuid B. O'Connell. 
The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include, but are not limited to: review of our executive compensation philosophy and strategy; participating in the performance evaluation process for our CEO; setting base salary and incentive opportunities for our CEO and other senior executives; establishing the overarching pay philosophy for Dana's management team; establishing incentive compensation and performance goals and objectives for our executive officers and other eligible executives and management; and determining whether performance objectives have been achieved. The Compensation Committee also recommends employment and   severance agreements for our CEO and other senior executives to the Board. Executive sessions are held by the Compensation Committee without the participation of any member of executive management, including the NEOs, typically to discuss compensation matters germane to the CEO. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews the performance and total compensation package of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee reviews and establishes each NEO's total target and actual compensation for the current year, which includes base salary, annual bonus opportunities and long-term incentive awards. 
Our CEO is responsible for making recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding base salary and incentive opportunities for the NEOs other than with respect to his own compensation. 
Compensation decisions are made by the Compensation Committee using its sole judgment. The Compensation Committee focuses primarily on each NEO's performance against his or her financial and strategic objectives, Dana's overall performance, and a business unit's performance where applicable, while reserving discretion to reflect the overall business performance. No discretion was used in 2018 to change pay outcomes. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Compensation Committee's charter states the Compensation Committee may retain outside compensation consultants, legal advisors or other advisors. The Compensation Committee retains an independent compensation consultant, Mercer (US) Inc. (Mercer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. (MMC), to advise it on certain compensation matters. The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain, compensate and terminate any independent compensation consultants of its choosing. 
In connection with the Compensation Committee's engagement of Mercer, the Compensation Committee considered factors relevant to Mercer's independence, including six factors specified by NYSE rules, and determined that Mercer's work does not raise any conflict of interest. The Compensation Committee requested Mercer's advice on a variety of issues, including compensation strategy, market comparisons, review of our Peer Group, pay and performance alignment versus industry peers, executive pay trends, stock ownership guidelines, compensation best practices and potential compensation plan designs and modifications. 
Mercer provided the Peer Group and general industry compensation data to management and the Compensation Committee, and it was used as a frame of reference for establishing compensation targets for base salary, annual bonus and long-term incentives for all of the NEOs at the beginning of 2018. 
In addition to its services for the Compensation Committee, separate and distinct from executive and director compensation consulting services, Mercer provided select services for Dana in various other capacities in 2018. Those services included other global compensation consulting where Mercer data was most relevant in a given country. Mercer's fees for executive compensation consulting in fiscal year 2018 were $144,908. During the fiscal year, Dana retained Mercer (and its MMC affiliates) to provide services unrelated to executive compensation. The aggregate fees paid for these other services were $40,022. These other services were not approved by our Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee because they relate to broad-based compensation and benefit plans. Our management used Pay Governance LLC (Pay Governance) for executive compensation advice. 
Compensation Policies & Practices 
Dana's Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The Compensation Committee adopted stock ownership guidelines for our NEOs to encourage executives to own a significant number of shares of our common stock. The stock ownership guidelines are calculated based on a multiple of the executive's annual base salary and the average stock price during the prior calendar year.  We require the NEOs to achieve the required percentage of the targeted stock ownership levels on a schedule from two to five years of being promoted or named to the applicable executive position. In determining if our NEOs have satisfied the ownership requirements, we generally include RSUs that have been granted and any shares owned outright by the NEO. Stock options and unearned performance shares are not counted in determining stock ownership for this purpose. 
The table below shows the schedule for attaining the targeted amount of stock ownership: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 President and Chief Executive  Officer     5 x Base Salary       40%      80%      100%  
 Other  NEOs     3 x Base Salary       40%      80%      100%  
[END TABLE]
All NEOs met or exceeded the ownership requirements according to the above schedule as established under our guidelines. 
Clawback Provisions 
To mitigate risk to Dana of paying either annual or long-term incentives based on faulty financial results, we have a policy (Clawback Policy) regarding adjustment of performance-based compensation in the event of a restatement of our financial results. It provides that the Compensation Committee will review all bonuses and other compensation paid or awarded to our executive officers based on the achievement of corporate performance goals during the period covered by a restatement. If the amount of such compensation paid or payable to any executive officer based on the originally reported financial results differs from the amount that would have been paid or payable based on the restated financial results, the Compensation Committee will make a recommendation to the independent members of the Board as to whether to seek recovery from the executive officer of any compensation exceeding that to which he or she would have been entitled based on the restated results. In the case of Mr. Kamsickas, his executive employment agreement sets forth clawback provisions in addition to the Clawback Policy described above. These additional clawback provisions are described below under "CEO Employment Agreement." 
Hedging & Pledging of Dana Stock 
Under the terms of our "Insider Trading Policy," no employee, officer or director is permitted to engage in securities transactions that would allow them either to insulate themselves from, or profit from, a decline in Dana's stock price. Similarly, no employee, officer or director may enter into hedging transactions in Dana's stock. Such transactions include, but are not limited to, short sales as well as any hedging transactions in derivative securities (i.e., puts, calls, options, swaps, forward contracts or collars) or other speculative transactions relating to Dana's stock. Pledging of Dana's stock is also prohibited. 
Equity-Based Grant Practices 
Under our equity-based grant practices, we make regular equity-based grants to eligible employees, including NEOs, in the first quarter of the calendar year at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee. Under our current practice, the exercise price, in the case of any stock options, is the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date of the grant. We also may award equity-based grants during the year to newly-hired executive officers as part of their compensation package or to executives based on a promotion during the year. In the case of equity-based grants to newly-hired employees who may be covered employees within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, or officers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act, including NEOs, the grants are authorized by the Compensation Committee.  Mitigation of Potential Risk in Pay Programs 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed our compensation policies and practices and determined that there are no risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Dana. To avoid excessive risk-taking behaviors, Dana has put in place several mechanisms, including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock ownership guidelines;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Caps on annual incentive payouts;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial performance-based annual incentive program;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use of multiple metrics to determine annual and long-term incentive payouts; and

[END TABLE]
CEO Employment Agreement 
Our Compensation Committee determined it is market practice to offer an executive employment agreement to the President and Chief Executive Officer. Terms of the employment agreement for Mr. Kamsickas can be found in the "CEO Employment Agreement" section below. No other NEO has an employment agreement. 
Severance Arrangements 
We have adopted both an executive severance plan (Executive Severance Plan) and a change in control severance plan (Change in Control Severance Plan). Each of our current NEOs participates in these plans. The Change in Control Severance Plan provides severance benefits as a result of a qualifying termination of employment after a change in control. These arrangements provide certainty to both Dana and the former executive as to their rights and obligations to each other, including restrictive covenants and non-compete agreements. 
Executive Severance Plan 
The Executive Severance Plan provides severance compensation to eligible executives, including each of our NEOs (other than the CEO whose severance compensation is provided in his employment agreement) whose employment is involuntarily terminated other than by reason of death, disability or cause prior to a change in control. 
Change in Control Severance Plan 
We have also adopted the Change in Control Severance Plan to provide severance benefits to eligible executives whose employment is involuntary terminated as a result of a change in control. Each of our current NEOs is eligible to participate in the plan. We believe that such a plan helps to both retain and attract executives by reducing the personal uncertainty that arises from the possibility of a future business combination or restructuring. Dana believes that the Change in Control Severance Plan helps to increase shareholder value by encouraging the executives to consider change in control transactions that are in the best interest of Dana and its shareholders, even if the transaction may ultimately result in termination of their employment. The plan contains a "double-trigger" provision (i.e., termination of employment after a change in control) in vesting of equity awards and for distributing severance payments in the event of any change in control. No excise tax gross-up is provided under this plan. 
Additional information on the terms and conditions of these plans as they relate to our NEOs is described in the section entitled "Potential Payments and Benefits upon Termination or Change in Control" below.  Impact of Accounting and Tax Treatments 
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) 
The exemption from Section 162(m)'s deduction limit for performance-based compensation was repealed effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to our covered executive officers in excess of $1 million is no longer deductible absent qualification for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements entered prior to November 2, 2017 and which are not materially amended thereafter. 
Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation 
We account for stock-based payments under our equity-based plans in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC Topic 718. Further information about this accounting treatment can be found in Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Dana's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) with management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in this Proxy Statement and incorporated by reference into our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Retirement Plans 
Dana maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan for certain executives, including the named executive officers. Under the terms of the supplemental executive retirement plan, Dana established unfunded notional defined contribution accounts subject to the claims of Dana's general creditors. Each participant account is credited on an annual basis as follows: (a) fixed employer credits – equal to 3.5% of compensation; and (b) discretionary employer credits – based on Dana's sole discretion and company performance not to exceed 4% of compensation. For the period of January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018, interest was credited on the accumulated balance of each account with an annualized compounded rate of return of 5%. For periods on or after May 1, 2018, the earnings rate for each participant is based on the rates of return (positive or negative) earned by the measurement funds selected by the participant as offered for the purposes of the plan. Participants are fully vested after five (5) years of service or upon death, disability or Change in Control. 
Dana also maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan that allows certain executives to defer base pay and/or incentive pay into unfunded notional accounts subject to the claims of Dana's general creditors.

[END TABLE]
Pursuant to his employment agreement and in lieu of his participation in the Executive Severance Plan, if Dana involuntarily terminates Mr. Kamsickas' employment without cause (as defined below) and not due to disability, or he voluntarily terminates his employment for good reason (as defined below), subject to his execution and non-revocation of a release of claims, he would be entitled to (i) severance in an amount equal to twenty-four (24) months of base salary, payable in regular payroll installments over the twenty-four (24) month period commencing on the date of termination, (ii) a bonus for the year of termination based on actual performance under the annual incentive program and a bonus for the calendar year after termination at the target amount, both payable when annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives, (iii) medical, dental, prescription drug, basic life insurance and employee assistance program benefits for twenty-four (24) months following the date of his termination subject to his payment of any required employee contributions consistent with those contributions required of active employees of Dana (and which benefits shall be coterminous with his entitlement to COBRA health benefits continuation), and (iv) outplacement benefits (having a cost not exceeding $50,000). 
Pursuant to Mr. Kamsickas' employment agreement, "cause" generally means (i) a willful and material misappropriation of any monies or assets or properties of Dana; (ii) a willful and material breach by him of the terms of his employment agreement that is demonstrably injurious to Dana and that, if capable of cure, has not been cured within thirty (30) days after written notice to him; or (iii) the conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere by him to, a felony or to any criminal offense involving his moral turpitude. 
Pursuant to Mr. Kamsickas' employment agreement, "good reason" generally means the occurrence of any of the following without his consent: (i) any material adverse change by Dana in his title, position, authority or reporting relationships with Dana; (ii) Dana's requirement that he relocate to a location in excess of fifty (50) miles from Dana's current office location or from any future office location acceptable to him; or (iii) any material breach by Dana of the employment agreement which is not cured within thirty (30) days after written notice by Mr. Kamsickas to Dana, which notice shall specify the breach and the nature of conduct necessary to cure such breach. 
For a period of twenty-four (24) months following his termination of employment, Mr. Kamsickas is prohibited from competing against Dana, soliciting its customers or employees, and working for a competitor. Mr.  Kamsickas has also agreed that he will not disclose Dana's confidential information. 
POTENTIAL  PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS 
UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
As discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section above, Dana maintains both an Executive Severance Plan and Change in Control Severance Plan that apply to certain senior executives, including our named executive officers. 
Set forth below is a description of each plan (applicable to eligible executive officers, including named executive officers). This is followed by tables relating to Messrs. Kamsickas, Collins, Aghili, Wallace and Pyle. 
Executive Severance Plan 
In the event any eligible executive officer, except our CEO (as he is entitled to payments under his employment agreement), is involuntarily terminated by Dana without cause (as defined below) and other than   due to death or disability and such termination occurs prior to a Change in Control, Dana will pay the executive an amount equal to twelve (12) months of base salary, the cost of COBRA premiums for twelve (12) months, and an annual incentive plan (AIP) payment equal to a full year, subject to actual performance results. Additionally, the executive will receive payment or receive reimbursement for reasonable costs of outplacement services, subject to a maximum amount of $25,000. 
Change in Control Severance Plan 
The Change in Control Severance Plan (CIC Plan) is designed to provide severance benefits to all eligible executive officers whose employment is terminated as a result of a change in control of Dana. Each of Dana's current named executive officers is eligible to participate in the CIC Plan. Under the CIC Plan, any participant who incurs a qualifying termination (as defined below) will be entitled to receive two times the sum of the individual's salary and target bonus (three times the sum of his or her salary and his or her target bonus, in the case of the CEO and CFO) for the year in which termination occurs. As of the termination date, each named executive officer will be entitled to: (i) the full amount of any earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination plus a cash payment for all unused vacation time accrued; (ii) a pro rata portion of his or her annual target bonus for the year in which termination occurs; (iii) all equity awards vesting in full (with the target number of performance shares, if applicable) and becoming fully exercisable; (iv) a lump sum cash amount to allow, but not require, the employee to purchase additional coverage equal to a total of two years (three years for the CEO) of subsidized COBRA; and (v) reasonable costs of outplacement services not to exceed $25,000 ($50,000 for the CEO). 
The CIC Plan does not provide for any excise tax gross-up payments to executive officers in connection with a change in control and instead includes provisions requiring a cutback of the benefits payable under the plan if it would result in the executive receiving a greater payment on an after-tax basis (after accounting for any excise taxes that would otherwise be triggered). Payments under the CIC Plan are payable in a lump-sum subject to execution of a release of claims against Dana. 
For purposes of the CIC Plan, "qualifying termination" generally means (i) an executive's involuntary termination of employment with Dana during the 24-month period following a change in control other than a termination by reason of death, disability or for cause or (ii) an executive's resignation of employment with Dana during such period for good reason. 
Equity Award Provisions 
Pursuant to the award agreements for the RSUs, if the recipient's employment is terminated without cause or by reason of death, disability or normal retirement, all outstanding RSU awards are prorated based on the number of full months of employment on the termination date within each vesting period. In the event of a change in control and the recipient is still employed with Dana, RSUs become nonforfeitable and payable to the recipient. Pursuant to the award agreements for the performance shares, if the recipient's employment is terminated without cause or by reason of death, disability or normal retirement all outstanding performance awards are prorated based on the number of full months of employment on the termination date within each vesting period and actual performance during the performance period. If, during the performance period, but before the payment of any performance shares, a change in control occurs and the recipient is still employed with Dana, then the recipient will be entitled to receive a prorated number (based on the number of full months the recipient is employed by Dana on the award date and ending on the date of the change in control) of the target number of performance shares. 
The following tables set forth the potential payments that would have been due to our named executive officers upon termination or a change of control as of December 31, 2018.  James K. Kamsickas

CEO PAY RATIO 
We had no significant changes to our compensation practices or employee demographics in 2018. Consistent with the regulation guidelines, we evaluated our employee population that we excluded in 2017 and determined that including these employees would have no significant impact on the determination of the median employee. As a result, we used the same median employee for our 2018 disclosure. 
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act disclosure requirement of the ratio of the CEO's annual total compensation to that of Dana's global median employee, Dana has determined that the pay ratio for 2018 is 255:1. This is based on the annual total compensation (determined in accordance with the Summary Compensation Table definition) of $40,510 which Dana paid in 2018 to its median employee, serving in a plant production line role in Guiscard, France (COLA not applied) and the CEO's total compensation for 2018 of $10,349,940 (in accordance with the same definition). If the one-time new hire equity grant awarded to our CEO   was excluded from such total compensation measure, the resulting revised ratio is 212:1. We have converted the median employee's salary to U.S. dollars consistent with the prior year, using the applicable exchange rate as of December 31, 2018. Had we applied the exchange rate used in 2017, the ratio would be 243:1 and 202:1, respectively. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Given the rule's flexibility, the method Dana used to determine the median employee and compensation measure may be different from its peers such that the pay ratio of its peers may not be comparable. 
In 2017, identification of the median employee was based on reference to our global employee population of approximately 21,928, of which 15,661 were employed outside of the U.S. We excluded non-U.S. locations reflecting approximately 1,103 employees in China and 51 employees in Ecuador, and such exclusions reflected 5% of our total employee population. Further, we excluded employees from acquisitions completed in 2017 including the acquisition of 80% ownership interests in Brevini Fluid Power S.p.A. and Brevini Power Transmission S.p.A. from Brevini Group, S.p.A. (2,050 employees) and all of the company units of Warren Manufacturing LLC, the owner of certain assets and liabilities related to the former Warren, Michigan production unit of U.S. Manufacturing Corporation (738 employees). Such employee population was evaluated as of October 31, 2017. 
We established a compensation measure that was applied consistently across such employee population comprised of actual compensation paid from January 1, 2017 through October 31, 2017, inclusive of base salary, bonuses, incentives, vacation and holiday pay and estimates of such components of pay for the remainder of the year. For new hires that did not provide services to Dana during the entire measurement period, compensation was annualized. Our compensation measure was then analyzed and tested at year-end based on year-end compensation data. All non-U.S. compensation was converted to U.S. dollars based on applicable exchange rates as of December 31, 2017. 
TRANSACTIONS OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WITH DANA 
None of the executive officers of Dana or members of their immediate families or entities with which they have a position or relationship or had any transactions with Dana since January 1, 2018. 
For information on procedures and policies for reviewing transactions between Dana and its executive officers, their immediate family members and entities with which they have a position or relationship, see "Director Independence and Transactions of Directors with Dana—Review of Transactions with Related Persons."  PROPOSAL I SUBMITTED FOR YOUR VOTE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Under our Bylaws, each director will hold office on the Board until the election and qualification of a successor at an annual meeting of shareholders or until his or her earlier resignation, disqualification, removal, death or other cause. 
The members of our Board are elected by the holders of shares of common stock at each meeting of shareholders held for the purpose of electing directors. Our Board currently consists of eight directors. Based on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has nominated the following current Directors for election: Rachel A. Gonzalez, James K. Kamsickas, Virginia A. Kamsky, Raymond E. Mabus, Jr., Michael J. Mack, Jr., R. Bruce McDonald, Diarmuid B. O'Connell, and Keith E. Wandell. Each of the nominees has consented to his or her nomination and has agreed to serve as a director of Dana, if elected. 
The Board has adopted Director Selection and Retention Guidelines. Under these Guidelines, the Board identifies individuals qualified to become members of the Board and elects candidates to fill new or vacant positions. Potential candidates for Board positions are identified through a variety of means, including individuals identified by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the use of search firms, recommendations of Board members, recommendations of executive officers and properly submitted shareholder recommendations. Potential candidates for nomination as director candidates must provide written information about their qualifications and participate in interviews conducted by individual Board members. Candidates are evaluated using the guidelines described below to determine their qualifications based on the information supplied by the candidates and information obtained from other sources. 
The Board will consider shareholder recommendations for directors that meet the criteria set forth below. The Board makes no distinctions in evaluating nominees for positions on the Board based on whether or not a nominee is recommended by a shareholder. Shareholders who wish Dana to consider their recommendations for nominees for the position of director should submit their recommendations in writing to Dana Incorporated, 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio 43537, Attention: Corporate Secretary, using the same deadline for nominations under our advance notice bylaw set forth in the 'Questions and Answers' section above. 
Neither Dana's Board nor the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a specific diversity policy with respect to identifying nominees for director. However, Dana has established criteria it considers when it is evaluating a potential candidate. Criteria for assessing nominees include a potential nominee's ability to represent the long-term interests of Dana. Minimum qualifications for a director nominee are experience in those areas that the Board determines are necessary and appropriate to meet the needs of Dana, including leadership positions in public companies, large or middle market businesses, or not-for-profit, governmental, professional or educational organizations. For those proposed director nominees who meet the minimum qualifications, the Board assesses the proposed nominee's specific qualifications, evaluates his or her independence (including, but not limited to, independence related to Dana, other Board members and shareholders), and considers other factors, including skills, business segment representation, geographic location, diversity, standards of integrity, memberships on other boards (with a special focus on director interlocks), and ability and willingness to commit to serving on the Board for an extended period of time and to dedicate adequate time and attention to the affairs of Dana as necessary to properly discharge his or her duties. Additionally, the Board considers whether each nominee would be considered a "financial expert" or "financially literate" as described in applicable listing standards, legislation and our Audit Committee guidelines. 
Additionally, our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Standards of Business Conduct for Members of the Board of Directors, Related-Party Transactions Policy and the Director Independence Standards are considered prior to making a recommendation to the Board for approval of a nominee. Each of these documents is available on Dana's website at www.dana.com. 
DANA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR.  INFORMATION ABOUT THE NOMINEES 
Our Board currently has seven non-management directors and one management director. All of our directors are elected annually serving a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The following section provides information as of March 4, 2019 about each nominee for election as a Director. The information provided includes the age of each individual; the individual's principal occupation and special qualifications; employment and business experience during the past five years, including employment with Dana; other public company or registered investment company directorships held during the past five years; and the year in which the director became a director of Dana.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Our Board of Directors has established guidelines that it follows in matters of corporate governance. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines describe our corporate governance practices and address corporate governance issues such as Board composition and responsibilities, compensation of directors and executive succession planning. The following summary provides highlights of those guidelines. A complete copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines is available online at http://www.dana.com. 
Role of Board 
The business of Dana is conducted by its employees, managers and corporate officers led by our CEO, with oversight from the Board. The Board selects the CEO and works with the CEO to elect/appoint other corporate officers who are charged with managing the business of Dana. The Board has the responsibility of overseeing, counseling and directing the corporate officers to ensure that the long-term interests of Dana and its shareholders are being served. The Board and the corporate officers recognize that the long-term interests of Dana and its shareholders are advanced when they take into account the concerns of employees, customers, suppliers and communities. 
Responsibilities of the Board 
The basic responsibility of our directors is to exercise their reasonable business judgment on behalf of Dana. In discharging this obligation, directors rely on, among other things, Dana's corporate officers, outside advisors and auditors. 
Pursuant to the Board's general oversight responsibilities, among other things, the Board: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluates the CEO's performance and reviews Dana's succession plan for the CEO and other officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reviews the long-range business plans of Dana and monitors performance relative to achievement of those plans;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Considers long-range strategic issues and risks to Dana; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approves policies of corporate conduct that continue to promote and maintain the integrity of Dana.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Sessions of the Board 
Executive sessions of our non-management directors are held, without Dana management, in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Board meeting and between such Board meetings as requested, from time to time, by our Chairman or other non-management directors. These sessions are chaired by our Chairman. 
Access to Management and the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Our non-management directors may meet with senior management, other employees and the independent registered public accounting firm at any time, either separately or jointly, as they deem appropriate. Senior personnel of Dana and of the registered public accounting firm regularly attend portions of our Board and Committee meetings, and other personnel may be invited to attend particular meetings where appropriate. 
Board Performance Assessment 
The Board conducts an annual self-evaluation to determine whether it and its committees are functioning effectively. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews the self-evaluation process. An annual report is made to the Board on the assessment of the performance of the Board and its committees. The assessment evaluates the contribution of the Board and its committees to Dana and specifically focuses on areas in which the Board believes it or its committees could improve.  Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board has separated the role of Chairman of the Board and the role of CEO since 2011. Currently, Mr. Wandell has served as our independent Chairman since October 2016. Mr. Kamsickas has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer since August 2015. The Board's current view is that separating the Chairman and CEO positions provides an efficient and effective leadership model for Dana. Separating the Chairman and CEO positions: i) has allowed Mr. Kamsickas to devote his full attention to focusing on Dana's business, leveraging his vast business and industry experience, without the additional responsibilities of Chairman, ii) has created mentoring opportunities, and iii) takes advantage of the business synergies created by two dynamic leaders. 
Our Board recognizes that no single leadership model is right for all companies and at all times. Our Board believes that, depending on the circumstances, other leadership models, such as a combined Chairman of the Board and CEO role, might be appropriate. It is our Board's intention to periodically review our leadership structure. 
Succession Planning 
A key responsibility of our Board is ensuring that an effective process is in place to provide continuity of leadership over the long term at all levels of Dana. Each year, succession planning reviews are held at every significant organizational level of Dana, culminating in a full review of senior leadership talent. During this review, the Board discusses future candidates for senior leadership positions, succession timing for those positions and development plans for the highest-potential candidates. This process ensures continuity of leadership over the long term, and it forms the basis on which Dana makes ongoing leadership assignments. 
RISK OVERSIGHT 
Dana maintains a risk management program overseen by our Executive Leadership Team. In particular, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as well as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary have responsibility for this area. In addition, our Business Unit Presidents and functional leads oversee strategic and operational risks. Risks are identified and prioritized by our management, and each of these risks is reviewed by the Audit Committee or the entire Board. For example, strategic risks are overseen by the entire Board and financial risks are overseen by our Audit Committee. Management regularly reports on each such risk to our entire Board or Audit Committee. Additional review or reporting on risks is conducted as needed or as requested by the Board or any committee. Also, our Compensation Committee periodically reviews the most important risks to ensure that compensation programs do not encourage excessive risk-taking and has implemented several mechanisms to avoid such risk-taking behavior, as detailed in the "Mitigation of Potential Risk in Pay Programs" and "Clawback Provisions" sections above.  COMMITTEES AND MEETINGS OF DIRECTORS 
The Board has several committees, as set forth in the following chart and described below. The names of the directors serving on the committees and the committee chairs are also set forth in the chart. The current terms of the various committee members expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

[END TABLE]
Audit Committee. As provided in its Board-adopted written charter, this committee consists solely of members who are outside directors and who meet the independence and experience requirements of applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC with respect to audit committee members. This committee is responsible, among other things, for providing assistance to the Board by overseeing: (i) the integrity of Dana's financial statements; (ii) Dana's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence; (iv) the performance of Dana's internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm; and (v) the preparation of the "Audit Committee Report" found in this proxy statement. The Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Audit Committee are independent within the meaning of those independence requirements established from time to time by the Board and the SEC and the listing standards of the NYSE (see "Director Independence and Transactions of Directors with Dana" section in this proxy statement). Our Board has determined that Messrs. Mack and McDonald are each an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. A current copy of the charter of the Audit Committee is available to security holders on Dana's website at www.dana.com. The Audit Committee met six times in 2018. 
Compensation Committee. This committee establishes and evaluates Dana's executive compensation policies and programs, administers Dana's 401(k), stock, incentive and retirement plans and monitors compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the documentation and administration of Dana's employee benefit plans, among other things. The Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Compensation Committee are independent, pursuant to independence requirements established from time to time by the Board and the listing standards of the NYSE (see the "Director Independence and Transactions of Directors with Dana" section in this proxy statement). A current copy of the charter of the Compensation Committee is available to security holders on Dana's website at www.dana.com. The Compensation Committee met five times in 2018. See the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section above for more information. 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. This committee monitors the effectiveness of the Board and oversees corporate governance issues. Among its various other duties, this committee reviews and recommends to the full Board candidates to become Board members, develops and administers performance criteria for members of the Board, and oversees matters relating to the size of the Board, its committee structure and assignments and the conduct and frequency of Board meetings. The Board of Directors has determined that all of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent, pursuant to independence requirements established from time to time by the Board and the listing standards of the NYSE (see the "Director Independence and Transactions of Directors with Dana" section in this proxy statement). A current copy of the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is available to security holders on Dana's website at www.dana.com. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met seven times in 2018. 
Board and Committee Meetings. There were thirteen meetings of the Board and eighteen meetings of the various committees of the Board. All directors attended at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the aggregate   number of meetings held by the Board and all the committees of the Board on which the respective directors served. Dana expects all of its directors to attend the Annual Meeting except in cases of illness, emergency or other reasonable grounds for non-attendance. All members of our Board of Directors attended our Annual Meeting last year. 
NON-MANAGEMENT DIRECTORS AND COMMUNICATION WITH THE BOARD 
The non-management directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions without management. Mr. Wandell is the Chairman at such sessions. Interested parties may communicate directly with Mr. Wandell or with the non-management directors as a group by sending written correspondence, delivered via United States mail or courier service, to: Corporate Secretary, Dana Incorporated, 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio, 43537, Attn: Non-Management Directors. Alternatively, shareholders may send communications to the full Board by sending written correspondence, delivered via United States mail or courier service, to: Corporate Secretary, Dana Incorporated, 3939 Technology Drive, Maumee, Ohio, 43537, Attn: Full Board of Directors. The Board of Directors' current practice is that the Secretary may relay proper communications received to the Chairman of the Board. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE AND TRANSACTIONS OF DIRECTORS WITH DANA 
Independence and Transactions of Directors 
The Board of Directors has determined that the seven non-management directors are independent within the meaning of the listing standards of the NYSE. Our Board determines whether each director qualifies as an "independent director" when first elected to the Board and annually thereafter. To assist in making these determinations of independence, Dana adopted categorical standards set forth in our Director Independence Standards, a current copy of which is available to security holders on Dana's website at www.dana.com. 
Under our Director Independence Standards, if a director has a relationship with Dana (either directly or as a partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Dana), the Board considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining whether the relationship will interfere with the exercise of the director's independence from Dana and our management, taking into account, among other things, the significance of the relationship to Dana, to the director, and to the persons or organizations with which the director is affiliated. 
The Board has affirmatively determined that the following directors, constituting a majority of our Board of Directors, meet the categorical standards for independence and that such directors have no material relationship with Dana (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with Dana) other than as a director: Rachel A. Gonzalez, Virginia A. Kamsky, Raymond E. Mabus, Jr., Michael J. Mack, Jr., R. Bruce McDonald, Diarmuid B. O'Connell, and Keith E. Wandell. 
Review of Transactions with Related Persons 
Dana has procedures and policies for reviewing transactions between Dana and its directors and executive officers, their immediate family members and entities with which they have a position or relationship. These procedures are intended to determine whether any such transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director or executive officer. 
Annually, each director and executive officer is required to complete a director, director nominee and executive officer questionnaire, and each non-management director is required to complete an independence certification. Both of these documents elicit information about related person transactions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors annually review the transactions and relationships disclosed in the questionnaire and certification, prior to the Board of Directors making a formal determination   regarding the directors' independence. To assist them in their review, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board of Directors use the categorical standards found in Dana's Director Independence Standards, as discussed above. 
In order to monitor transactions that occur between the annual reviews, the independence certification also obligates the directors to immediately notify our General Counsel in writing if they discover that any statement in the certification was untrue or incomplete when made, or if any statement in the certification becomes subsequently untrue or incomplete. Likewise, under our Standards of Business Conduct for the Board of Directors, any situation that involves, or may involve, a conflict of interest with Dana is required to be promptly disclosed to the Chairman of the Board, who will consult with the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Executive officers are bound by the Standards of Business Conduct for Employees. 
Our Board has adopted a Related-Party Transactions Policy that sets forth standards with respect to related party transactions with Dana or our subsidiaries. A current copy of this policy is available to shareholders on Dana's website at www.dana.com. 
Under the Related-Party Transactions Policy, (i) a director, nominee for director or executive officer of Dana (since the beginning of the last fiscal year), (ii) any beneficial holder of greater than five percent (5%) of Dana's voting securities or (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing, are required to seek the prior approval of the Audit Committee of any transaction, arrangement or relationship or series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) in which (i) the aggregate amount involved will or may reasonably be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (ii) Dana, or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and (iii) any related party has or will have a direct or indirect interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). 
In making its determination, the Audit Committee considers such factors as (i) the extent of the related party's interest in the interested transaction, (ii) if applicable, the availability of other sources of comparable products or services, (iii) whether the terms of the interested transaction are fair to Dana and no less favorable than terms generally available in unaffiliated third-party transactions under like circumstances, (iv) whether the interested transaction would impair the independence of an outside director, (v) the benefit to Dana, and (vi) whether the interested transaction is material, taking into account: (a) the importance of the interest to the related party, (b) the relationship of the related party to the interested transaction and of the related parties to each other, (c) the dollar amount involved, and (d) the significance of the transaction to Dana's investors in light of all the circumstances. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, our Board may determine certain interested transactions deemed to be pre-approved, even if the aggregate amount involved will exceed $120,000. Those pre-approved transactions are described in the Related-Party Transactions Policy. 
All interested transactions, except certain pre-approved transactions, must be disclosed in Dana's applicable SEC filings as, and to the extent, required by applicable SEC rules and regulations. 
The questionnaire, certification, Standards of Director Independence, Standards of Business Conduct for the Board of Directors, Standards of Business Conduct for Employees, and Related-Party Transactions Policy are all in writing.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
Messrs. Wandell, Mack, McDonald, O'Connell, as well as Ms. Kamsky, served as members of the Compensation Committee. No such member of the Compensation Committee is, or was during 2018, an officer or employee of Dana or any of its subsidiaries, nor was any such member formerly an officer of Dana or any of its subsidiaries. Moreover, no such member is an officer of a company in which an executive officer of Dana is a member of its compensation committee.  COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for making recommendations to our Board of Directors regarding the form and amount of non-employee director compensation. In determining the recommendation for director compensation, the Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of our Chairman, CEO and Senior Vice President, Human Resources, as well as information provided by Mercer. 
The table below illustrates the compensation structure for non-employee directors in 2018. Employee directors receive no additional compensation for their Board service. In addition to the compensation described below, each director is reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred for travel and attendance related to meetings of the Board of Directors or its committees.

Deferred Compensation. Each non-employee director has the opportunity to elect to defer a percentage of the annual cash retainer into restricted stock units. The RSUs are credited as of the last day of each quarter based on the quotient obtained by dividing (i) the dollar amount of the retainer for that quarter which is being deferred by (ii) the closing price per share on the last trading day of that quarter (with the result being rounded down to the nearest whole number of RSUs). The RSUs are fully vested on the date of grant and each RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock (or, at our election, an equivalent cash amount) on the earlier of (i) the first business day of the calendar month coincident with or next following the date that the director terminates service as a non-employee director or (ii) the date on which a change in control occurs. 
The following table provides information on the compensation of our non-employee directors for 2018.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that Dana's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent (10%) of a registered class of Dana's equity securities file reports of stock ownership and any subsequent changes in stock ownership with the SEC and the NYSE not later than specified deadlines. Based solely on its review of the copies of such reports received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons, Dana believes that, during the year ended December 31, 2018, each of its executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent (10%) shareholders complied with all such applicable filing requirements.  PROPOSAL II SUBMITTED FOR YOUR VOTE 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 enables our shareholders to vote on an advisory (non-binding) basis on our compensation policies and practices and the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SEC's rules. Since 2011, our Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of Dana's shareholders, has elected to hold an annual advisory vote on Dana's executive compensation practices. 
As discussed in Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) above, the overall objectives of Dana's executive compensation program are to attract, motivate, reward and retain talent. We believe that in order to achieve our objectives, our compensation and benefits must be competitive with executive compensation arrangements generally provided to other executive officers at similar levels at other companies where we compete for talent. The various components of Dana's executive compensation program are designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align management incentives and shareholder interests;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Motivate executive management and employees to focus on business goals over short and long-term horizons; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that Dana's executive compensation programs have been effective at incentivizing the achievement of positive results, appropriately aligning pay and performance and in enabling Dana to attract and retain very talented executives within our industry. We encourage you to read our CD&A contained within this proxy statement for more detailed discussion of our compensation policies, practices and procedures. 
As required by Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our shareholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation policies and practices as described in this proxy statement. This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives you as a shareholder the opportunity to express your views on our fiscal year 2018 executive compensation policies and procedures for our named executive officers. This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the policies and procedures described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the shareholders of Dana Incorporated (Dana) approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Dana's named executive officers, as disclosed in Dana's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission as set forth in Item 402 of Regulation S-K (including the Compensation Discussion & Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion). 
Although this is an advisory vote which will not be binding on the Compensation Committee or the Board, we will carefully review the results of the vote. The Compensation Committee will consider our shareholders' concerns and take them into account when designing future executive compensation programs.

RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of Dana has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), an independent registered public accounting firm, to audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and recommends that the shareholders vote for ratification of such appointment. PwC has served as our independent registered public accounting firm since 1915. 
As a matter of good corporate governance, the selection of PwC is being submitted to the shareholders for ratification. In the event of a negative vote on such ratification, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection. Even if PwC is ratified as the independent registered public accounting firm by the shareholders, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of Dana and its shareholders. Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders and will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire. The representatives also are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions from shareholders.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
Our Audit Committee pre-approves the audit and non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair PwC's independence. The Audit Committee annually determines which audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other permissible non-audit services to pre-approve and creates a list of the pre-approved services and pre-approved cost levels. Unless a type of service to be provided by PwC has received general pre-approval, it requires specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chairman or a member whom he or she has designated. Any services exceeding pre-approved cost levels also require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee. Management monitors the services rendered by PwC and the fees paid for the audit, audit-related, tax and other pre-approved services and reports to the Audit Committee on these matters at least quarterly. We did not approve the incurrence of any fees pursuant to the exceptions to the pre-approval requirements set forth in applicable SEC disclosure rules.  The information contained in the Audit Committee Report is not deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed for purposes of the Exchange Act, will not be deemed incorporated by reference by any general statement incorporating the document by reference into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act except to the extent that Dana specifically incorporates such information by reference, and will not be otherwise deemed filed under such acts. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee oversees Dana's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors and is comprised of all outside directors who are independent within the meaning of, and meet the experience requirements of, the applicable rules of the NYSE and the SEC. In addition to its duties regarding oversight of Dana's financial reporting process, including as it relates to the integrity of the financial statements, the independent auditors' qualifications and independence and the performance of the independent auditors and Dana's internal audit function, the Audit Committee also has sole authority to appoint or replace the independent auditors and is directly responsible for the compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditors as provided in Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In conducting its annual evaluation of the independent auditors and deciding to re-appoint the independent auditors, the Audit Committee considered, in addition to the firm's independence and integrity: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The independent auditors' competence and its compliance with regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The business acumen, value-added benefit, continuity and consistency, and technical and core competency provided by the engagement team;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The effectiveness of the independent auditors' processes, including its quality control, timeliness and responsiveness, and communication and  interaction with management; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The firm's efforts toward efficiency, including with respect to process improvements and fees.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee periodically considers whether an independent auditor change would be advisable. Pursuant to this review, the Audit Committee believes that PwC's continuous relationship with Dana provides PwC with valuable institutional knowledge about Dana's operations, policies, and practices and that changing audit firms would require significant time commitments and potentially distract Dana's management from its focus on financial reporting and internal controls. Because of PwC's lead audit partner rotating every five years, as presently required, along with other customary auditor staffing changes, the Audit Committee believes that PwC provides fresh audit perspective without the incremental costs associated with a change in audit firms. 
The Audit Committee is involved in the selection of the independent auditor's lead audit partner every five years, including in identification of candidates, review of qualifications, candidate interviews and review of plans for successor partner transition. 
The Audit Committee Charter, which was adopted and approved by the Board, specifies the scope of the Audit Committee's responsibilities and the manner in which it carries out those responsibilities. Management has primary responsibility for the financial statements, reporting processes, and system of internal controls. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, among other things, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements included in Dana's annual report on Form 10-K with management and the independent auditors, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, reasonableness of significant judgments, and clarity of disclosures in the financial statements and a discussion of related controls, procedures, compliance, and other matters. 
Audit Committee discussions with the independent auditors included those required under auditing standards generally accepted in the United States, including Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301, Communications With Audit Committees. Further, the Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB   for independent auditor communications with Audit Committees concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence from management and Dana, and reviewed and considered whether the provision of non-audit services and receipt of certain compensation by the independent auditors are compatible with maintaining the auditors' independence. In addition, the Audit Committee reviewed with the independent auditors all critical accounting policies and practices to be used. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above and such other considerations as the Audit Committee determined to be appropriate, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in Dana's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.

February 12, 2019  PROPOSAL IV SUBMITTED FOR YOUR VOTE 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL 
The following shareholder proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting if properly presented by or on behalf of the shareholder proponent. Approval of this proposal would require the affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. John Chevedden of 2215 Nelson Ave., No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, who indicated he holds at least 300 shares of Dana stock, submitted this proposal. 
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "AGAINST" this proposal. 
Proposal [4]—Special Shareholder Meetings 
Resolved, Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders in the aggregate of 10% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting (or the closest percentage to 10% according to state law). This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting. 
Special shareholder meetings allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison. This proposal topic, sponsored by William Steiner, also won 78% support at a Sprint annual meeting with 1.7 Billion yes-votes. 
Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN) shareholders gave 94%-support in February 2018 to a rule 14a-8 proposal calling for 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting. This proposal topic also received 48%- support at our 2018 annual meeting. This 48% support would likely translate to more than 51% support if all shareholders had equal access to independent proxy voting advice. 
It is important that our company goes the extra mile and adopts an ownership threshold of 10%. Some companies have adopted an ownership threshold of 20% which can be unrealistic. An ownership threshold of 20% can mean that more than 50% of shareholders must be contacted during a short window of time to simply call a special meeting. Plus many shareholders, who are convinced that a special meeting should be called, can make a small paperwork error that will disqualify them from counting toward the ownership threshold that is needed for a special meeting. 
Any claim that a shareholder right to call a special meeting can be costly—may be largely moot. When shareholders have a good reason to call a special meeting—our board should be able to take positive responding action to make a special meeting unnecessary. 
Calling a special meeting is a means to elect a director who could focus on the wisdom of stock repurchases such as the 2018 authorization of increasing the share repurchase program to $200 Million. Stock buybacks can be a sign of short-termism for executives—sometimes boosting share price without boosting the underlying value, profitability, or ingenuity of the company. A dollar spent repurchasing a share is a dollar that cannot be spent on new equipment, an acquisition, entry into a new market or anything else.

Special Shareholder Meetings—Proposal [4]  Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition 
We are committed to corporate governance policies and practices that enhance returns and that protect and are in the best interests of all shareholders. After careful consideration, our Board continues to believe that the existing special meeting threshold requirement is appropriate for the reasons stated below. Our Board therefore opposes the proposed resolution to reduce our special meeting threshold requirement and recommends that shareholders vote "AGAINST" this proposal: 
Dana provides shareholders with a meaningful right to call a special meeting while also protecting the interests of Dana and all of our shareholders. 
After careful consideration, our Board believes that the shareholder proposal to lower the threshold for holders of our common stock to call a special meeting is not in the best interests of Dana and its shareholders. 
Dana already permits shareholders holding in the aggregate 20% or more of Dana's capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to call special meetings, with procedural safeguards designed to protect the best interests of Dana and all of our shareholders, but which in our view are not overly restrictive and allow shareholders to exercise this right in a meaningful way. By way of comparison to market practices, approximately 77% of the S&P 500 companies that allow shareholders to call special meetings have a threshold that is equal to or higher than that of Dana. In addition, approximately 35% of S&P 500 companies do not permit shareholders to call special meetings at all. In sum, Dana's shareholders have a right that is more expansive than most S&P 500 companies. 
The Board believes that a 20% ownership threshold for the right to call special meetings strikes a reasonable and appropriate balance between enhancing shareholder rights and protecting against the risk that a small minority of shareholders, including shareholders with special interests, could call special meetings. Allowing a small minority of shareholders to call special meetings for any reason could be detrimental to the interest of a majority of our shareholders and other stakeholders. Special meetings of shareholders should be extraordinary events that only occur when fiduciary obligations or strategic concerns require that the matters to be addressed cannot wait until the next annual meeting. 
Dana's ownership threshold avoids wasting corporate resources to address narrowly supported, special interests. 
Our company and our Board take shareholder meetings seriously. As a result, our Board, officers and employees devote significant attention and resources whenever a shareholder meeting is called. If the shareholder meeting is devoted to issues that are not supported by a significant portion of our shareholder base, this means that the Board, our officers and employees must divert their focus from meeting our business objectives and enhancing shareholder value to these other issues. Our special meeting ownership threshold seeks to ensure that shareholders who have limited support for the action intended to be proposed do not disadvantage other shareholders by causing Dana to incur the unnecessary expense or disruption that can be associated with a special meeting, especially as there are other avenues for shareholders to communicate with the Board and the company outside of calling a special meeting. 
Dana has an excellent record in governance and responsiveness to shareholder concerns. 
We are committed to sound corporate governance principles and long-term shareholder value as shown by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ability of shareholders to elect new directors annually, and the strong shareholder support for Dana's directors in each of the past 10 years.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The elimination of supermajority voting provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The adoption of shareholder proxy access by Dana.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The inclusion of clawback provisions in Dana's compensation plans.  
[END TABLE]
 Our Board believes that Dana's existing special meeting shareholder right should be considered in the context of Dana's overall corporate governance, including the shareholder rights available under its Bylaws and Certificate of Incorporation, applicable law, and our Board's demonstrated commitment to shareholder engagement and responsiveness to shareholder concerns. 
Dana's shareholders rejected the same proposal introduced by the same individual shareholder last year. 
The proponent submitted the same proposal at our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which shareholders voted against. Given this result just a year ago, the current threshold appropriately reflects the position of Dana's shareholders on this matter. 
DANA'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "AGAINST" THIS SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL.  ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS 
Dana mailed the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K to shareholders, containing financial statements and other information about the operations of Dana for the year ended December 31, 2018, to you with this Proxy Statement on or about March 14, 2019. 
OTHER MATTERS 
The Board is not aware of any other additional matters to be presented at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The Board does not currently intend to submit any additional matters for a vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, and no other shareholder has provided the required notice of the shareholder's intention to propose any matter at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. However, under Dana's Bylaws, the Board may, without notice, properly submit additional matters for a vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. If the Board does so, the shares represented by proxies in the accompanying form will be voted with respect to the matter in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons voting the shares.
