March 8, 2019 
Dear Fellow Stockholders:
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Celanese Corporation to be held at 7:00 a.m. (Central Daylight Saving Time) on Thursday, April 18, 2019. This year's Annual Meeting will be held at  The Westin Irving Convention Center at Las Colinas, 400 West Las Colinas Blvd., Irving, Texas 75039.
The following Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement includes information about the matters to be acted upon by stockholders. Celanese also has made available with this Proxy Statement a copy of our 2018 Annual Report. We encourage you to read our Annual Report, which includes our audited financial statements and additional information about the business. Celanese has made the proxy materials available via the internet. The Company believes that providing internet access to our proxy materials increases the ability of our stockholders to review important Company information, while reducing the environmental impact of our Annual Meeting.
At Celanese, we are committed to effective corporate governance.  To that end, both management and our board of directors regularly evaluate matters relating to our corporate governance profile.  Based on our ongoing assessment of governance best practices and discussions with our stockholders, in February 2016, we made two major changes – our board of directors proactively adopted "proxy access" amendments to the Company's by-laws to enable eligible stockholders to include qualifying director nominees in the Company's proxy materials for its annual meeting of stockholders, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the by-laws.  In addition, our board of directors recommended, and stockholders approved, a proposal to transition to an annually elected board of directors.  Beginning with the 2019 Annual Meeting, all directors will be elected annually.  We will continue to monitor, and assess the value of, corporate governance developments to the Company and to you.
We hope that you will participate in the Annual Meeting, either by attending and voting in person or by voting through the other acceptable methods described in the Proxy Statement. You may submit your proxy via the internet, by phone, or by signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card (or voting instruction form, if you hold shares through a broker). If you decide to attend the Annual Meeting, you will be able to vote in person, even if you have previously submitted your proxy. Please review the instructions on each of your voting options described in this Proxy Statement as well as in the Notice you received in the mail or via email.
On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to express our appreciation for your continued support of Celanese.  I look forward to seeing you at the Annual Meeting.
Sincerely,
Mark C. Rohr
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

       A letter from Edward G. Galante, our Lead Director   
[END TABLE]
March 8, 2019 
Dear Fellow Stockholders:
As the Lead Independent Director of your board of directors, I am honored to have the opportunity to write to you, our stockholders, as part of this year's Proxy Statement.  The Proxy Statement affords us the opportunity to reach out to all of Celanese' stockholders to review, among many other things, where the Company has been and where we are going.  Our board is committed to executing its governance responsibilities and providing appropriate oversight of the Company's operations, long-term strategy and risk exposure.
Over the past few years, we have enhanced our proxy statement to make it clearer, simpler and more straightforward with a focus on what matters most to stockholders.  This includes providing a better understanding of our strategy, corporate governance and executive compensation.  We hope the following pages will help you better understand the Company and how our governance and compensation practices are linked to performance and accountability in a manner that drives long-term stockholder value.  As overseers of the Company, it is the board's responsibility to remain highly engaged in the Company's strategic approach to creating value for our share owners and, correspondingly, to actively manage the Company's enterprise risks.  We appreciate your feedback and look forward to a meaningful engagement on issues that are important to all of us.
Over the last few years, Celanese also has enhanced its stockholder outreach program.  Throughout the period, the Company held multiple meetings with stockholders and proactively reached out to stockholders on an individual basis to solicit their feedback on topics of importance to stockholders.  During 2018, we held meetings with stockholders owning collectively more than 50% of our stock.  The board remains very focused on the Company's strategic initiatives to strengthen financial performance, which in turn will foster long-term sustainable growth for our stockholders.
The board has also been focused on governance and board composition.  As noted by our Chairman, during 2016 our board of directors proactively adopted proxy access and, based on stockholders' comments and vote in April 2016, we have phased out our classified board structure.  In addition to these developments, we continue to maintain our focus on key governance practices that we understand are important to stockholders.  Notably, almost one-half of our directors have joined our board in the past five years, bringing with them fresh perspectives and a diversity of experiences, and one-third of our directors are female. These new directors have allowed us to rotate directors among committees.  As of the 2018 Annual Meeting, 75% of our standing committees were chaired by directors new to Celanese in the last five years.
On behalf of the board of directors, I would like to express our sincere appreciation for the trust you have placed in us, and we look forward to serving you throughout the upcoming year.
Sincerely,
Edward G. Galante
Lead Independent Director

ITEM 1: Election of Directors
Background
Based on the recommendation of our independent nominating and corporate governance committee, our board of directors has nominated nine directors, Jean S. Blackwell, William M. Brown, Edward G. Galante, Kathryn M. Hill, David F. Hoffmeister, Dr. Jay V. Ihlenfeld, Mark C. Rohr, Kim K.W. Rucker and John K. Wulff, to serve a one-year term expiring at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. These director nominees have consented to be elected to serve as directors for the next year. 
At the Annual Meeting, you will have the opportunity to elect these nominees.  Unless otherwise instructed, the proxy holders will vote the proxies received by them for these nine nominees. If any of our nominees is unable or declines to serve as a director as of the time of the Annual Meeting, the board may designate a substitute nominee or reduce the size of the board. Proxies will be voted for any nominee who shall be designated by the board of directors to fill the vacancy.
The name of each of our nominees for election and certain information about them, as of the date of this Proxy Statement (except ages, which are as of the date of the Annual Meeting), is set forth below. Included in the information below is a description of the particular qualifications, attributes, skills and experience that led the board to conclude that each person below should serve as a director of the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Composition and Refreshment           
Ensuring the board is composed of directors who bring diverse viewpoints and perspectives, exhibit a variety of skills, professional experience and backgrounds, and effectively represent the long-term interests of our stockholders, is a principle priority of the board and the nominating and corporate governance committee. The board and the committee also understand the importance of board refreshment, and strive to maintain an appropriate balance of tenure, turnover, diversity and skills on the board. The board believes that new perspectives and new ideas are critical to a forward-looking and strategic board, as is the ability to benefit from the valuable experience and familiarity that longer-serving directors bring.       BOARD REFRESHMENT   
    Under Mark Rohr's leadership of the board since 2012 
• Six new directors elected 
• Rotation of all board committee chairs

Qualifications Required of All Directors 
The board and the nominating and corporate governance committee require that each director be a recognized person of high integrity with a proven record of success in his or her field and have the ability to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities to the Company. Each director must demonstrate innovative thinking, familiarity with and respect for corporate governance requirements and practices, a willingness to assume fiduciary responsibilities, an appreciation of diversity and a commitment to sustainability and to dealing responsibly with social issues. In addition, the board conducts interviews of potential director candidates to assess integral qualities, including the individual's ability to ask difficult questions and, simultaneously, to work collegially.
The board does not have a defined diversity policy, but considers diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, cultural background and professional experience in evaluating candidates for board membership. The board believes that diversity results in a variety of points of view and, consequently, a more effective decision-making process.

Director Elections
[BEGIN TABLE]
As a result of the removal by stockholders of our classified board structure, commencing with the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, all directors will be elected annually.  We currently have one class of directors whose term expires in 2019.  The remainder of our directors are unclassified and their terms expire at the Annual Meeting.   To ensure that the board remains composed of high-functioning members capable of keeping their commitments to board service, the corporate governance and nominating committee evaluates the qualifications and performance of each incumbent director before recommending the nomination of that director for an additional term.   In February 2016, our board proactively adopted a by-law, which  permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning at least three percent of the Company's outstanding Common Stock continuously for at least three years, to submit director nominees for up to the greater of two directors or 20 percent of the number of directors currently serving on the board, subject to a phase-in and the terms and conditions specified in the by-laws.

Majority Voting Standard
Our by-laws provide that, in an election of directors where the number of nominees does not exceed the number of directors to be elected, each director must receive the majority of the votes cast with respect to that director.  This means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director. The board believes this majority vote standard appropriately gives stockholders a greater voice in the election of directors than the traditional plurality voting standard. If an incumbent director does not receive a majority vote, he or she has agreed that a letter of resignation will be submitted to the board. The corporate governance and nominating committee will make a recommendation to the board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The board will act on the resignation within 90 days of the certification of the vote, taking into account the recommendation of the corporate governance and nominating committee, which will include consideration of the vote result, the director's contributions to the Company during his or her tenure, the director's qualifications, and any relevant input from stockholders. Only independent directors will participate in the deliberations regarding a tendered resignation.
Composition of the Board of Directors
Our certificate of incorporation provides that the number of members of the board of directors shall be fixed by the board, but shall be no less than seven and no more than fifteen. Our board may fill vacancies and increase or, upon the occurrence of a vacancy, decrease the board's size between annual stockholders' meetings. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, we have, and the board has established the size of the board to be, nine directors.  Our board of directors is and shall be comprised of a majority of independent directors. See "Director Independence and Related Person Transactions" for additional information.
In addition, the Company has a director retirement guideline, the full text of which is set forth in our corporate governance guidelines. The guideline provides that a director should retire from the board of directors no later than the annual meeting of stockholders following such director's 72nd birthday; provided, however, the retirement guideline may be waived by a majority of uninterested directors upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee.

Board Evaluation Process
Each year, the members of the board and each committee conduct a self-assessment. The process for the self-assessment is approved by the board each year based on a recommendation from the nominating and corporate governance committee. Under the process used in 2018, the nominating and corporate governance committee develops a thorough list of topics to be considered by the directors, including board and committee structure, oversight, information, and culture, which are approved by the board. The chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee has a teleconference with each independent director and finally with the Chairman to discuss the topics and to gather any other feedback a director has as they relate to the full board and each of the committees. The chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee elicits comments from the directors concerning improvements for the board, the committees, the lead independent director, the committee chairs, the CEO and management. The chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee then confers with the Chairman and the lead independent director to ensure that they understand any concerns that were raised, and summarizes the input from the conversations and presents it to the full board (and to the independent directors as to the Chair / CEO) at the October board meeting. Each committee chair also conducts a similar self-assessment with respect to their committee based on (i) a subset of the board discussion topics, (ii) comments made to the chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee or the committee chair and (iii) discussion during executive sessions of committee meetings. Also, the nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates directors who are nominees for re-election to the board as part of the nomination process.
Board Leadership Structure
The Company's governance framework provides the board with flexibility to select the appropriate leadership structure for the Company. In making leadership structure determinations, the board considers many factors, including the specific needs of the business and what is in the best interests of the Company's stockholders. The current leadership structure is comprised of a combined chairman of the board ("Chairman") and chief executive officer, a lead independent director, board committees comprised exclusively of independent directors and active engagement by all directors. The board believes the structure provides an effective balance between strong company leadership and appropriate safeguards and oversight by independent directors.

[END TABLE]
Leadership Structure Determination – Details and Rationale
Consistent with the board's commitment to corporate governance practices that are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, at least one executive session of the directors each year includes a review of the board's leadership structure and consideration of whether the position of chairman of the board should be held by the chief executive officer or an independent director. This section describes the details and the board's rationale for its current leadership structure.
Under the Company's by-laws, the Chairman presides over meetings of the board, presides over meetings of stockholders, consults and advises the board and its committees on the business and affairs of the Company and performs such other duties as may be assigned by the board. The chief executive officer is generally in charge of the affairs of the Company, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the board and its committees and subject to such powers as reserved by the board. Mark Rohr serves as both Chairman and chief executive officer.
In November 2011, the Company's presiding director role was transitioned to a lead independent director role and, in connection with this transition, the independent directors expanded the role of the lead independent director (see above). In February 2019, the independent directors re-elected Edward Galante to serve as lead independent director beginning at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The duties and responsibilities of the lead independent director are described above and are set forth in the Company's corporate governance guidelines. Although annually elected, the lead independent director is generally expected to serve for more than one year, although generally not more than three - five years.
Importantly, all directors play an active role in overseeing the Company's business both at the board and committee levels. As set forth in the Company's corporate governance guidelines, the core responsibility of the directors is to exercise their business judgment to act in what they reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The board currently consists of one member of management (our CEO) and eight non-employee directors. The non-employee directors are skilled and experienced leaders in business. Many currently serve or have served as chief executives or members of senior management of Fortune 1000 companies. In these roles, the non-employee directors have been called upon to provide solutions to various complex issues and are expected to, and do, ask hard questions of management. As such, the non-employee directors are well-equipped to oversee the success of the business and to provide advice and counsel to the chief executive officer and Company management.
As part of each regular scheduled board meeting, the non-employee directors meet in executive session without the chief executive officer present. These meetings allow non-employee directors to discuss issues of importance to the Company, including the business and affairs of the Company, as well as matters concerning management, without any member of management present. All of the board committees, which are described below, are chaired by, and comprised of, independent directors.
The board believes that leadership of both the board and the Company by Mr. Rohr is the optimal structure to guide the Company and maintain the focus required to achieve the Company's long-term business goals. The Company's 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 18 
        Governance   
[END TABLE]
business is complex and it has operations in 18 countries around the world. Given the complex global reach of our business, the board believes the chief executive officer is in the best position to focus directors' attention on critical business matters and to speak for and lead both the Company and the board.
The board believes that the current leadership structure – a combined Chairman of the Board and chief executive officer, a lead independent director, board committees comprised exclusively of independent directors and active engagement by all directors – is effective and currently serves the business and stockholders well.
Board Meetings in 2018    
Each of our directors is expected to devote sufficient time and attention to his or her duties and to attend all board meetings and committee meetings on which he or she serves. The board of directors held seven meetings during 2018 and committees of the board held a total of 20 meetings. Overall attendance at such meetings was over 95%. All incumbent directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of (i) meetings of the board and (ii) meetings of the board committees on which they served during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the board expects directors to attend the annual meeting of stockholders absent special circumstances. All of our directors who were members of the board as of the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders attended the annual meeting.
Committees of the Board
The board of directors has four standing board committees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• audit committee; 
• compensation and management development committee; 
• nominating and corporate governance committee; and 
• environmental, health, safety, quality and public policy committee.

Board Oversight    
Stockholders elect the board to oversee management and to serve stockholders' long-term interests. Management is responsible for delivering on our strategy, creating our culture, creating and delivering innovative products and services, establishing accountability, and controlling risk. The board and its committees work closely with management to balance and align strategy, risk, corporate social responsibility, and other areas while considering feedback from stockholders. Essential to the board's oversight role is a transparent and active dialogue between the board and its committees, and management. To support that dialogue, the board and its committees have access to, receive presentations from, and conduct regular meetings with the senior leadership team, other business and function leaders, subject matter experts, the Company's enterprise risk management and internal audit functions, and external experts and advisors. 
Board oversight of strategy 
One of the board's primary responsibilities is overseeing management's establishment and execution of the Company's strategy. As Celanese continues to transform and expand its business, the board works with management to respond to a dynamically changing environment. At least quarterly, the CEO, the senior leadership team, and leaders from across the Company provide detailed business and strategy updates to the board. At least annually, the board conducts an even more in-depth review of the Company's overall strategy, including critical issues and opportunities. At all of these reviews, the board engages with the senior leadership team and other business leaders regarding business objectives, the competitive landscape, economic trends, public policy and regulatory developments and other critical issues. At meetings occurring throughout the year, the board also assesses acquisitions, the Company's operating and capital plan, and performance for alignment to our strategy. The board looks to the focused expertise of its committees to inform strategic oversight in their areas of focus. Members of senior management are available to discuss the Company's strategy, plans, results and issues with the board committees and the board, and regularly attend such meetings to provide periodic briefings and access. In addition, the audit committee regularly holds separate executive sessions with the lead client service partner of the independent registered public accounting firm, the chief financial officer, the internal auditor, the chief compliance officer and other members of management as appropriate.
Board oversight of risk 
Effective risk management is critical to Celanese's ability to achieve its strategy. The board oversees management in exercising its responsibility for managing risk, considering our robust framework of policies, procedures, and processes to anticipate, identify, assess, prioritize, and mitigate risks across the Company.  Risk management is considered a strategic activity within the Company and responsibility for managing risk rests with executive management while the committees of the board and the board as a whole participate in the oversight of the process. Specifically, the board has responsibility for overseeing the strategic planning process, reviewing and monitoring management's execution of the strategic and business plan, and selected risk areas, including cybersecurity. Each board committee is responsible for oversight of specific risk areas relevant to their respective committee charter. The oversight responsibility of the board and the board committees is enabled by an enterprise risk management model and process implemented by management that is designed to identify, assess, manage and mitigate risks. In addition, the board recognizes that risk management and oversight comprise a dynamic and continuous process and reviews the enterprise risk model and process periodically. On a regular basis, the board and its committees engage with management on risk as part of broad strategic and operational discussions which encompass interrelated risks, as well as on a risk-by-risk basis.  The board executes its oversight responsibility directly and through its committees, who regularly report back to the board. Some examples of risks overseen by committees are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The audit committee oversees the enterprise risk process that management implements, and reviews and assesses the Company's processes to manage financial reporting risk and to manage internal audit, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, tax, investment, and other financial risks, as well as the Company's financial position and financial activities. It also reviews the Company's  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 22 
        Governance   
[END TABLE]
policies for risk assessment and steps management has taken to control certain risks not otherwise delegated by the board to other committees. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The compensation and management development committee oversees compensation programs and policies and practices and their effect on risk-taking by management. See "Compensation Risk Assessment" for additional information.  
• The nominating and corporate governance committee manages risk by overseeing the governance framework and structure as well as other corporate governance matters, including oversight of the annual board and committee assessment process, and is charged with developing and recommending to the board corporate governance principles and policies and board committee structure, leadership and membership. 
• The environmental, health, safety, quality and public policy committee oversees the Company's operational risks, including those risks associated with employee, environmental, process and product safety and quality, public policy and reputation. 
• The full board addresses risks associated with cybersecurity. 
• The full board and the compensation and management development committee address issues and risks associated with diversity and inclusion and human capital management.  
[END TABLE]
Each of the board committees is required to make regular reports of its actions and any recommendations to the board with respect to risk management, including recommendations to assist the board with its overall risk oversight function. This approach to risk oversight does not affect the board's leadership structure. 
Each of our directors have substantial experience managing and overseeing risk for complex, international organizations that they leverage while serving on our Board. For example, Mr. Wullf's experience leading Hercules International as its chairman, necessitated risk management and oversight on a daily basis, while Mr. Brown continues to do so as president and the chief executive officer Harris Corporation.  The extensive chemicals leadership histories shared by Mr. Galante and Dr. Ihlenfeld, as well as Ms. Hill's leadership experience in technology, allow each of them to understand and address key risk-related issues unique to our industry and the Company.  Risk management was an active component of Mr. Hoffmeister's responsibilities as chief financial officer for Life Technologies and Mr. Wulff's responsibilities as chief financial officer for Union Carbide. Finally, the management, leadership and legal backgrounds of Ms. Blackwell and Ms. Rucker cause them to be especially in-tune with recognizing and advising on a broad array of issues affecting corporate risk.
Highlight on oversight of human capital management 
The board, the compensation and management development committee, and the environmental, health, safety, quality and public policy committee engage with the senior leadership team and human resources executives on a regular basis across a broad range of human capital management issues. Celanese is focused on creating a respectful, safe, rewarding, diverse, and inclusive work environment that allows our people to build meaningful careers. The success of these human capital management objectives is essential to the fulfillment of our strategy, and the board works with management to provide oversight on matters including culture, succession planning and development, compensation, benefits, employee recruiting and retention, diversity and inclusion and respectful workplace. Additionally, each year, the compensation and management development committee evaluates management's annual assessment of risk related to our compensation policies and practices.  The board and the compensation and management development committee work with the CEO and our head of Human Resources to review CEO and senior executive succession plans, considering the qualifications and experience of potential leadership candidates. 
Highlight on oversight of cybersecurity risk and data privacy
The board and the audit committee are each involved in oversight of the Company's management of cybersecurity risk. Cybersecurity protection is vital to maintaining our proprietary information and the trust of our customers and employees.  We must secure our data and systems from potential breach. Management provides regular updates, including information about cybersecurity governance processes, the status of projects to strengthen internal 
[BEGIN TABLE]

        Governance   
[END TABLE]
cybersecurity, and the results of security breach simulations. The board and its committees also discuss recent incidents throughout the industry and the emerging threat landscape.  
Highlight on oversight of strategic acquisitions 
The board provides oversight of Celanese's strategic acquisition and integration process, which supports alignment with our strategic objectives, provides accountability across acquisitions, and enables insight for future acquisitions. Our board includes eight members with extensive negotiation, acquisition, integration, and other business combination experience. That depth of experience allows the board to constructively engage with management and effectively evaluate acquisitions for alignment with our strategy and culture. Celanese views strategic acquisitions as an important element in delivering long-term stockholder value. While management is charged with identifying potential acquisition targets, executing transactions, and managing integration, our board's oversight extends to each phase. Management and the board regularly discuss potential acquisitions and their role in the Company's overall business strategy. These discussions include acquisitions in process and potential future acquisitions, focusing on valuation, strategic risk, and potential synergies with our businesses and strategy. When management considers potentially significant acquisitions, the board receives updates and discusses with management a broad range of matters, including negotiations, due diligence findings, valuation, tax impacts, integration planning, talent retention, risk, and regulatory impacts. Throughout the acquisition process, the board has access to the senior leadership team, appropriate business leaders, subject matter experts, and external advisors. As part of the entire strategic acquisition lifecycle, the board also receives regular updates and provides feedback on ongoing integration, operational success, and financial performance of our acquisitions, which allows the board to provide oversight across transactions and over time. 
Additional Governance Features
Stockholder Engagement
The board believes accountability to stockholders is a mark of good governance and critical to the Company's success. To that end, the Company maintains dedicated resources to actively engage with stockholders. The Company regularly engages with stockholders on a variety of topics throughout the year to ensure we are addressing their questions and concerns, to seek input and to provide perspective on Company policies and practices. Topics include corporate strategy, cash deployment, executive compensation plan design and practices, governance and social responsibility.
During 2018, we met with stockholders holding more than 50% of our Common Stock, through in-person meetings and telephone calls. In addition, we attended 9 investor conferences and 15 non-transaction roadshows. In November 2015, we held an investor day with more than 140 participants.  We hosted another similar event in May 2018 with more than 196 participants.
In addition to this direct engagement, the Company has instituted a number of complementary mechanisms that allow stockholders to effectively communicate a point of view with the board, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the ability to attend and voice opinions at the annual meeting of stockholders (see page 88); 
• a dedicated annual meeting page on our website (see page 89); 
• a majority voting standard (see page 16); 
• the annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation (see page 35); 
• annual election of directors (beginning in 2019) (see page 16); 
• commitment to thoughtfully consider stockholder proposals submitted to the Company (see page 90); and 
• the ability to direct communications to individual directors or the entire board (see page 90).

Social Responsibility and Political Engagement
Corporate Social Responsibility
The environmental, health, safety, quality and public policy committee assists the board in guiding our comprehensive corporate social responsibility initiatives. These initiatives reflect strategic business imperatives and our core belief that we should be a responsible corporate citizen in the communities where we live and work. Our policies and business practices, including our diversity and inclusion efforts, philanthropy and community investment, safety and environmental sustainability, foster relationships that demonstrate our commitment and values.
The primary goal of our diversity and inclusion efforts is to create a work environment that is compatible with, and respectful of, all of our employees and maximizes employee engagement in accomplishing our mission and business objectives. Examples include our employee resource groups located in facilities and locations where we operate in Asia, Europe and the Americas.
The primary goal of our philanthropy initiative is to provide support through volunteer service, participation in and employee-led giving to local organizations, and community collaboration with institutions, organizations and good works that enhance the sustainability of the host communities in which we principally operate. This is brought to life through national partnerships and local initiatives in support of needy families, primary education and safe places to live and grow. We formed the Celanese Foundation in 2012. The Foundation matches employee gifts to recognized 501(c)(3) charities and provides grants to employee-selected charities based on employee volunteerism and alignment with our focus areas. Since its inception, the Celanese Foundation has provided grants totaling over $10,000,000 to organizations. In addition, our employees are encouraged to contribute their money, and their time, volunteering over 200,000 hours in 2018 alone.
The primary goal of our safety initiative is to assure that employees and contractors remain injury free. At Celanese, safety is considered a value, which holds fast against changing priorities. Leaders are committed to creating the best working environment where employees and contractors are engaged in training and procedures that minimize hazards and prevent injuries. In 2018, we continued with industry leading safety performance. Recognized with numerous industry safety awards, including the American Chemistry Council Responsible Care Company of the Year, we are committed to continuous improvement in eliminating injuries.
In addition to preserving the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities, Celanese is committed to protecting the environment, and ensuring the safe operations of our processes. Our process safety strategy continues to provide exemplary results in reducing loss of primary containment incidents. We are strengthening the process safety culture by focusing on leadership commitment to process safety, developing competencies and learning from incidents. This data-driven approach led to improvements through our award winning Walk the Line program, where workers conduct a thorough safety review before starting a process.
We consider protecting the environment a fundamental responsibility. We treat the communities where we do business as our own by protecting the energy, air and water supplies and minimizing waste. Many times, our capital investments help us substantially reduce our environmental emissions. Examples include boiler conversions from coal and fuel oil to natural gas in the U.S. and Mexico. Our latest construction projects also include the best technology to improve efficiency and environmental performance.
We believe that chemistry plays an integral role in solving many of the world's challenges. This belief means we are committed to advancing safe, effective and sustainable products and technologies that unlock the untapped potential of humankind. This potential is at work at Celanese where each employee has taken measures to be a steward of the earth's natural resources and of each other. We are committed to continuing our significant progress in meaningful areas of our business, including energy use, protecting sensitive air and water ecosystems, continued emissions reductions, meaningful safety measures, and a people-centered culture, all while growing Celanese products, customers and technologies to new heights.

Political Engagement Policy
The Company believes in responsible corporate governance and actively participates in the political process to support the needs of our business and our 7,500 employees.  The Company seeks to responsibly use our resources to advance public policy that is consistent with the Company's values, the sustainability of our business and long-term stockholder values.  The Company does not provide any direct political contributions.  The Company does, however, sponsor a voluntary, nonpartisan political action committee called the Celanese Political Action Committee ("CELPAC").  CELPAC supports candidates for federal, state and local office in the U.S. that advocate and pursue government policies that promote the Company's interests. CELPAC allows eligible employees to pool their personal funds on a voluntary basis with other employees to help elect candidates who appreciate and understand the issues important to Company.  Participation in CELPAC is entirely voluntary.  At least annually, Celanese posts to its website, www.celanese.com (under "Company Info"; "Political Engagement Policy"), a list of all political contributions made during the prior calendar year, including CELPAC's contributions.
Anti-Hedging, Anti-Short Sale and Anti-Pledging Policies
The Company's hedging policy prohibits directors, executive officers and other employees from purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Common Stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds. Directors and executive officers are also prohibited from engaging in short sales related to Common Stock. The Company's pledging policy prohibits directors and executive officers from pledging Common Stock, including holding Common Stock in a margin account. In addition, directors and the Company's executive officers are required to obtain pre-approval from the Company's Deputy General Counsel before pledging shares of Common Stock. Such approval will only be granted if the individual can clearly demonstrate the financial capacity to repay the loan without resorting to the pledged securities.
Code of Conduct
The Company has adopted a code of business conduct applicable to directors, executive officers and all other employees. Our employees, suppliers and customers can ask questions about our code of conduct and other ethics and compliance issues, or report potential violations, through Navex, a global Internet and telephone information and reporting services company. The code of conduct is available on our compliance website, http://compliance.celanese.com, by clicking "Business Conduct Policy". In the event the Company amends or waives any of the provisions of the code of conduct applicable to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer or controller that relates to any element of the definition of "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the 1934 Act, the Company intends to disclose these actions on the Company's website.

Director Compensation
Director Compensation Processes 
Our director compensation program is intended to enhance our ability to attract, retain and motivate non-employee directors of exceptional ability and to promote the common interest of directors and stockholders in enhancing the value of our Common Stock.
The board reviews director compensation at least annually based on recommendations by the nominating and corporate governance committee.  The nominating and corporate governance committee has the sole authority to engage a consulting firm to evaluate director compensation and since 2017 has engaged Willis to assist in setting director compensation.  The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews director compensation taking into account multiple factors, including pay practices at publicly traded companies, continued expansion of director, committee chair and lead director responsibilities, and the growing time commitment.  The nominating and corporate governance committee and the board base their determinations on director compensation on recommendations from Willis and on market practices and reviewing trends at other S&P500 companies and our compensation comparator companies (outlined below).  Based on that review, the board did not approve any changes in the level or mix of director compensation when reviewed in July 2018. Willis also serves as the independent consultant to the compensation and management development committee on executive compensation.
Director Compensation in 2018 
The Company uses both cash and equity-based compensation to attract and retain qualified directors to serve on our board of directors, as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Compensation Component Amount   
Annual Awards   
Annual cash retainer (paid quarterly) $105,000   
Annual time-based restricted stock units ("RSU")(one-year vesting) $150,000   
Incremental Awards for Board Leadership

Annual cash fee for chair: (i) audit committee, and (ii) compensation and management development committee $20,000   
Annual cash fee for lead independent director $25,000   
[END TABLE]
Newly-elected directors receive a pro-rata equity award. Non-management directors are entitled to participate in the Company's 2008 Deferred Compensation Plan ("2008 Deferred Plan"), which is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows directors the opportunity to defer all or a portion of their cash compensation and RSUs in exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferments plus or minus certain amounts (including dividend equivalents) based on the market performance of specified measurement funds selected by the participant.

(1)  Mr. Fowler resigned during 2018.  Therefore, the information above reflects his service on the board from his election to the board through the date of his resignation.  Mr. Rohr is not included in this table because he was an employee of the Company during 2018 and received no compensation for his services as a director.  
(2)  Includes amounts earned for the annual retainer and committee chair and lead independent director fees for the respective directors, as applicable. 
(3)  Represents the grant date fair value of 1,372 RSUs granted to each non-management director in April 2018 (790 RSUs for Ms. Rucker, granted in October 2018, which represents a prorated amount of RSUs for time served from her election through April 2019) under the Company's 2009 Global Incentive Plan (for Ms. Rucker, under the 2018 Global Incentive Plan) computed in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, Compensation – Stock Compensation. For a discussion of the method and assumptions used to calculate such expense, see Notes 2 and 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, each non-management director listed in the table owned 1,372 RSUs, except Mr. Fowler, who held no RSUs, and Ms. Rucker, who held 790 RSUs.  
(4)  The Company has not granted stock options to directors since 2007. As of December 31, 2018, no persons serving as a non-management director held any stock options. 
(5)  Deferrals by directors under the 2008 Deferred Plan, including deferrals of RSUs, do not receive above-market earnings and therefore no amount with respect to those deferrals is included in the Table. 
(6)  Directors are reimbursed for expenses incurred in attending board, committee and stockholder meetings. Directors are also reimbursed for reasonable expenses associated with other business activities that benefit the Company, including participation in director education programs. We generally do not provide perquisites to our directors, other than small gifts provided at board meetings and upon retirement. Occasionally, a director may use Company-provided aircraft for travel to board meetings.  Also, a director's spouse may accompany him or her on Company business at our request. For example, spouses are invited to some of the board dinners we hold during the year in connection with board meetings. This policy involves a de minimus or no incremental cost to us, and we believe it serves a legitimate business purpose. The board does not provide any tax gross-ups on any director perquisites. No director received perquisites at or exceeding a total value of $10,000 in 2018.  For Mr. Galante, represents the matching of a charitable contribution to a local charity.

Director Stock Ownership Guidelines
The board of directors considers Common Stock ownership by directors to be of utmost importance. The board believes such ownership enhances the commitment of directors to our future and aligns their interests with those of our other stockholders. The board has therefore established minimum stock ownership guidelines for non-employee directors that require each director to own Common Stock having a value of at least five times his or her base annual cash retainer of $105,000. Each newly elected director has five years from the year elected to reach this ownership level. As of the computation date, December 31, 2018, all of our then current independent directors had attained the minimum stock ownership levels based on holdings except for Ms. Rucker, who joined the board in 2018, who is on-track for compliance and is not required to meet the minimum stock ownership guidelines until 2023.
Director Independence and Related Person Transactions
Director Independence
The listing standards of the NYSE require companies listed on the NYSE to have a majority of "independent" directors. As noted below, all of our directors, other than our Chairman and chief executive officer, are independent.
The board of directors has adopted standards of independence for directors that are set forth in Exhibit A to the Company's corporate governance guidelines. The board reviews and determines the independence of each of the directors in accordance with these standards. The full text of the corporate governance guidelines is available on our website, investors.celanese.com, by clicking "Corporate Governance". These standards incorporate all of the requirements for director independence contained in the NYSE listing standards. The NYSE listing standards generally provide that a director is independent if the board affirmatively determines that the director has no material relationship with the Company directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company. In addition, a director is not independent if certain other relationships exist.  
The board, based on the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee, affirmatively determined that eight of our current directors, Messrs. Brown, Galante, Hoffmeister, Ihlenfeld and Wulff, and Ms. Blackwell, Ms. Hill and Ms. Rucker are independent of the Company and its management under the NYSE listing standards and the Company's director independence standards. Mr. Rohr, our Chairman and CEO, is the only current director who is not independent.
The Company in the normal course of business has been a party to transactions with other entities (or their subsidiaries) where certain of our directors are themselves either directors or officers. When making the board's director independence determination, the board was aware of, and considered, the relationships listed below.  All the business relationships noted below were entered into on standard pricing and terms as arose in the ordinary course of our business.  The amounts involved in each relationship did not exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or two percent of such other company's consolidated gross revenues.  As a result, each qualified under a categorical standard of independence that the board previously approved and, therefore, none of the relationships were deemed to be a material relationship that impaired the director's independence.

[END TABLE]
The board of directors has adopted a written policy regarding related person transactions (the "Related Party Transaction Policy"). For purposes of SEC rules and such policy, an interested transaction is a transaction or relationship in which the aggregate amount involved exceeds or may reasonably be expected to exceed $120,000 since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year, the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a participant, and any related party will have a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction or relationship. A related party is any person who is or was during the last fiscal year an executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director; a greater than 5 percent beneficial owner of Common Stock; or an immediate family member of any of these persons.  Compensation paid to our named executive officers is not treated as an interested transaction under the Related Party Transaction Policy to the extent that it is disclosed as compensation in this Proxy Statement. In addition, a related party would not be deemed to have a "material interest" in a transaction simply due to such person's position as an officer or director of the other party in the transaction or, in the case of simply being an employee of the other party to the transaction, if the aggregate amount involved in the subject year does not exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or two percent of that party's annual revenues.
The audit committee reviews the material facts of all interested transactions that meet the requirements discussed above and therefore require the audit committee's approval and either approves or disapproves of the entry into the interested transaction. In determining whether to approve or ratify an interested transaction, the audit committee 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 30 
        Governance   
[END TABLE]
takes into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction.
In addition, the audit committee has delegated to the chairman of the audit committee the authority to pre-approve or ratify (as applicable) any interested transaction with a related party in which the aggregate amount involved is expected to be less than $2,000,000. In connection with regularly scheduled meetings of the audit committee, the Company provides the audit committee for its review a summary of each new interested transaction that was pre-approved by the chairman of the audit committee. No director may participate in any discussion or approval of an interested transaction for which he or she is a related party, except that the director is to provide all material information concerning the interested transaction to the audit committee.
No interested transactions were approved or ratified or, to our knowledge, required to be approved or ratified, during 2018.
None of our directors are adverse to the Company in any pending litigation.

ITEM 2: Advisory Approval of Executive Compensation    
The Company's compensation program for our named executive officers was designed by our compensation and management development committee to meet our compensation philosophy and objectives. The principles of the program have contributed to our strong performance and rewarded executives appropriately. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Executive Summary" for a summary of our compensation philosophy, 2018 performance, pay decisions and additional compensation information.
We are presenting this "say-on-pay" proposal, which gives you, as a stockholder, the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive compensation program through an advisory vote on the following resolution:
"Resolved, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative disclosure, contained in this Proxy Statement." 
The board of directors recommends that stockholders endorse the compensation program for our named executive officers by voting FOR the above resolution. We believe that executive compensation for  2018 was reasonable, and justified by our performance. Our compensation program is the result of a carefully considered approach and takes into account advice received from the compensation and management development committee's independent compensation consultant. 
Advisory Vote
This vote is mandated by Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and SEC regulations. As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company. In addition, the non-binding advisory vote described in this proposal will not be construed as overruling any decision by the Company, the board of directors, or the compensation and management development committee, relating to the compensation of the named executive officers, or creating or changing any fiduciary duties or other duties on the part of the board of directors, or any committee of the board of directors, or the Company.
Vote Required
The voting on this proposal is advisory. Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote. In 2017, our stockholders voted to have this advisory vote each year.  In 2023, we will have another vote to determine the frequency of this advisory vote. 
Recommendation of the Board
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS
VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

Compensation Discussion and Analysis    
Our Compensation Discussion and Analysis describes the objectives and elements of our executive compensation program, its alignment with performance, the 2018 compensation decisions regarding our named executive officers and other actions of the compensation and management development committee.
Executive Summary
Overview
Our compensation program for named executive officers:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• supports the execution of our business strategy and the achievement of our long-term financial objectives; 
• attracts, motivates and retains a talented team of executives who will provide leadership for our success in dynamic, competitive markets and products, using balanced performance metrics; 
• aligns performance with long-term stockholder value creation; and 
• rewards executives' contributions at a level reflecting Company performance and their individual performance. 
[END TABLE]
Our compensation and management development committee has designed our executive compensation program based on principles that reflect these objectives. These principles have contributed to our strong performance and have rewarded executives commensurately.
Our strategic plan is designed to enhance and sustain the overall growth of the Company. This strategic plan builds upon the Company's differentiated business models in the Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials.  In the Acetyl Chain, the business focuses on optimizing profitability by leveraging the flexibility in its operations and an expansive global asset base. In Engineered Materials, a unique combination of one of the broadest materials portfolios in the industry and a project pipeline management system has differentiated Celanese's ability to deliver customer value.
In 2018, we continued our focus on improving our models in the Acetyl Chain and Engineered Materials, which showed resilience in 2018 despite underlying market conditions and growth.  These economic models are paired with our unwavering commitment to social responsibility, safety and environmental stewardship, to drive stockholder value.  
The Company's performance has been strong relative to the ambitious goals that we outlined in 2015, and we delivered on the objectives that we established for 2018. We exceeded our 3-year plan commitments in adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBIT growth, share repurchaes and free cash flow. At our Investor Day in May 2018 we outlined a new 3-year plan to continue our growth trajectory based on our models.  One of our key long-term objectives is to deliver annualized earnings and cash flow growth such that we consistently rank among the top tier chemical companies. We adhere to a balanced approach of preferentially investing in high return new opportunities and continuing to return cash to stockholders via dividends and share repurchases.  We believe achieving these objectives will continue to significantly increase stockholder value.

2018 Performance Highlights 
We anticipated headwinds coming into 2018 from acetate tow. These headwinds did materialize, as well as other unexpected challenges, including Hurricane Florence and an inflationary environment in raw materials, logistics and supply chain.  Nevertheless, we overcame these challenges through rigorous planning and responsive actions that offset these headwinds and, as noted below and in the accompanying charts, we delivered strong financial results in 2018 with growth in both Engineered Materials and the Acetyl Chain.
The Acetyl Chain anticipated and positioned itself well through the optionality provided by its global network and business model in an industry that saw continued periodic disruptions in 2018. 
Engineered Materials grew by commercializing more than 3,250 projects, a 47% increase year over year, and through the Omni acquisition which closed in the first quarter. 
During 2018 we announced a number of organic investments in both Engineered Materials and the Acetyl Chain. We also announced the acquisition of Next Polymers in India, which closed in January 2019. Our strong overall growth and commitment to maximizing stockholder value have contributed to these results.  Productivity gains across businesses and in support functions also contributed to earnings growth.

(1)  Adjusted earnings per share or Adjusted EPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, Certain Items, and refinancing and related expenses, divided by the number of basic common shares and dilutive restricted stock units and stock options calculated using the treasury method. See "Exhibit A" to this Proxy Statement for additional information concerning this performance measure and a reconciliation of this measure to diluted earnings per share, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure. 
(2)  Total stockholder return or TSR is cumulative stock price appreciation plus dividends, with dividends reinvested. 
(3)  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net cash provided by (used in) operations, less capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment, and adjusted for capital contributions from or distributions to our partner in our methanol joint venture. Free cash flow amounts noted above are net of pension contributions of $316 million and $300 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.

[END TABLE]
We believe the performance goals underlying our compensation program for the named executive officers were instrumental in helping us achieve strong financial performance in 2018.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our net sales were $7.2 billion in 2018, up 16.5% from 2017, primarily due to increases in price and volume in 2018. 
• We generated net earnings of $1.2 billion in 2018, up 42.9%, primarily due to increases in price and volume, while Adjusted EBIT(4) was $1.85 billion in 2018, up 36.6% from 2017. 
• GAAP diluted earnings per share were $8.95, up 44.6% from 2017, while adjusted earnings per share(1) for 2018 was $11.00, an increase of 46.5% over 2017, both a record, primarily due to an increase in product pricing, volume growth, productivity initiatives and a reduction in outstanding share count through share repurchases, facilitated by our strong cash generation. 
• Cumulative total stockholder return(2) over the prior 1-, 3- and 5-year periods was (14.3)%, 41.7% and 78.5%, respectively.  Our 1-year TSR(2) was in the middle of our compensation comparator group (described below), just slightly below the Dow Jones Chemical Index performance of (14)%, and lower than the S&P500 Index at (4.4)%.  However, our 3- and 5-year TSR of 41.7% and 78.5%, respectively, exceeded the S&P500 Index and the Dow Jones Chemical Index for the same periods, and our TSR was performing in line with the S&P500 Index through the 3rd quarter of 2018.  During the fourth quarter of 2018, several external factors suddenly impacted the equity markets negatively, including (but not limited to) significant declines in crude oil prices and trade tensions between the US and China.  These events impacted certain sectors of the S&P more negatively, including the materials sector.  As a result of this fourth quarter volatility, our 1-year TSR for 2018 lagged the broad S&P500 Index. 
• Our cash flow from operations was $1.56 billion, up 94.0% from 2017, while our free cash flow(3) was $1.20 billion, up 135.4% from 2017.  This record level of free cash flow and a portion of our balance sheet cash allowed us to execute on our cash deployment priorities in 2018 by investing in our existing businesses, executing prudent M&A, and returning cash to our stockholders, all designed to enhance returns. 
• During 2018, we returned a record $1.1 billion to stockholders: 
◦ We increased the rate of our quarterly cash dividend per share by 17.4% and paid an aggregate of $280 million in cash dividends. We have paid cash dividends for 55 consecutive quarters and the compound rate of increase in the dividend per share has been approximately 33.5% since 2009. 
◦ We repurchased $817 million of our Common Stock under our announced share repurchase program.  
◦ We have returned $3.9 billion to stockholders since 2012 in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases.

(4)  Adjusted EBIT is a non-GAAP financial measure ("Adjusted EBIT") that we define as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense and taxes, and further adjusted for Certain Items. See "Exhibit A" to this Proxy Statement for additional information concerning this performance measure and a reconciliation of this measure to net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.

We achieved these results with a highly engaged and dedicated workforce, which we pay competitively for their contributions  An example of recognizing our employees' contributions to our success is our 2018 Global Equity Award, which provided for an equity grant to almost 7,000 employees in 31 countries.  Our global leadership team has been charged with accelerating the Company's growth plans through accountability for our business objectives as well as to continue to shape our culture.  For these reasons, during 2018, we continued development of our global career framework to provide our employees with clearer insight into the career opportunities at Celanese for both personal and professional development as we execute our growth plans.  To further engage our employees, we provide support for our employees through numerous employee resource groups that work together for the common good of our company and our communities.  Our employees continued their support of local communities, volunteering over 200,000 hours worldwide.
Performance Goals for 2018
In February 2018, we established our 2018 annual incentive plan, as described more fully below, which is our annual cash performance bonus plan, and which uses Adjusted EBIT as the primary financial performance measure, as well as working capital and three stewardship performance measures. Also, in 2018, we implemented a long-term incentive plan, as described more fully below (the "2018 LTIP"), under which we awarded time-vesting restricted stock units to the CEO and Mr. Oliver and performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs") to each of our other active named executive officers. The PRSUs will become earned based on our achievement of Adjusted EPS growth and return on capital employed goals for a three-year performance period (2018-2020).  See "CEO 2018 Compensation Decisions" and "2018 Compensation Decisions" below.
When the compensation and management development committee set the performance hurdles for the 2018 annual incentive plan and the 2018 LTIP, they considered our strategic plan, our annual operating plan and the headwinds facing the Company.  It was anticipated that these headwinds would only partially be balanced by anticipated benefits to Engineered Materials from the pipeline model, new acquisitions and productivity efforts.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 39 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
Taking these considerations into account, the compensation and management development committee set aggressive Adjusted EBIT hurdles for the Company under our 2018 annual incentive plan as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2017     Percentage Y-o-Y Improvement for 2018 Annual Incentive Plan Payout     
Metric   Actual     Threshold   Target   Superior     
Adjusted EBIT(1)   $1,356 million     0%   8%   15%     
[END TABLE]
(1)  See "Exhibit A".
The working capital as a percentage of net sales level required to achieve a superior level of performance was set at a level on par with the top quartile of chemical companies in the Dow Jones Chemical Index.  The required level for threshold and target performance was maintained from the prior year because it is substantially higher than median performance of other chemical companies in the index. How we treat acquisitions was made more difficult – the closing date working capital amount for in-year acquisitions was excluded as compared to an eight-quarter exclusion used in the 2017 plan.
As part of our continued commitment to environmental, social and governance issues, we have included stewardship metrics in our annual incentive programs for the last 12 years. For 2018, the stewardship metrics were made more difficult to achieve than the prior year due to the integration of our SOFTER, Nilit and Omni acquisitions into the incident calculations for employee/contractor injuries, and process safety and environmental releases. 
The compensation and management development committee reviewed our strategic plan and forecasts and set the target Adjusted EPS hurdle for the 2018 LTIP (a combined level of Adjusted EPS for 2018, 2019 and 2020) at a level that reflects growth over the prior year consistent with our external projections.
2018 Payouts Aligned to Performance
Annual Incentive Plan.  As summarized in the table below and described more fully below, our Adjusted EBIT for 2018 represented 36% growth over the prior year, our working capital as a percent of net sales was below our target at 18.1%, and our aggregate performance on the stewardship metrics exceeded target.  The compensation and management development committee approved an overall annual incentive (bonus) plan payout of 161.4% of target under the plan.

CEO 2018 Compensation Decisions
Our CEO, Mr. Rohr, has been a director of the Company since 2007 and our CEO since 2012. For  2018, the compensation and management development committee made no changes to the level of his base salary or target annual performance bonus potential.  In light of Mr Rohr's eligibility for retirement, the compensation and management development committee deliberated on how best to set his long term incentive award for 2018, and the type of award was changed to a time-vesting restricted stock unit (RSU).  The committee determined to use this vehicle, rather than PRSUs, to encourage his retention during a likely period of succession planning and management transition. The committee increased the award value slightly over the prior year to reflect the competitive positioning of Mr. Rohr's total compensation considering his contributions and performance and the fact that time-vesting RSUs, unlike PRSUs, cannot be earned at greater than target. The award vests annually over 3 years, and will continue to vest if Mr. Rohr retires, ensuring that he has a continued interest in the success of the Company after his retirement.
Mr. Rohr's total direct compensation for 2018 taking into account company and individual performance and, for comparison purposes, his total direct compensation for 2017, are displayed in the table below.

Our Response to the 2018 Advisory Vote and Stockholder Feedback
In 2018, stockholders continued their strong support of our executive compensation programs with 98.3% of the votes cast for approval of the "say-on-pay" proposal at the  2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Nevertheless, consistent with its strong interest in stockholder engagement, communication and transparency, the compensation and management development committee continued to examine our executive compensation program to assure alignment between the interests of our senior executives and stockholders.  The compensation and management development committee considered the outcome of the 2018 vote and will consider the results of future say on pay votes when making future compensation decisions for named executive officers.
Beyond consideration of the annual "say-on-pay" vote, the Company regularly engages with stockholders to better understand their perspectives. During 2018, we held one on one or group discussions in person or by telephone with stockholders collectively owning more than 50% of our shares on topics such as corporate strategy, cash deployment, executive compensation plan design and practices, governance and social responsibility. These discussions provided valuable insights into our stockholders' views on executive compensation programs and corporate governance practices. We continue to actively seek feedback from our investors, listen to their concerns, and make appropriate changes to our compensation plans.  Additional information about stockholder engagement is included on page 24.

Compensation Philosophy and Elements of Pay
Compensation Philosophy
Our focus is to deliver continued earnings growth and superior value creation for our stockholders. To that end, we have adopted a pay-for-performance compensation program that is designed to reward executives for superior company and individual performance through awards of annual and long-term incentives. At the same time, these programs are intended to be sufficiently competitive with our compensation peer companies so as to also attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We believe that our current compensation program is both attractive to our executives and aligned with the best interests of our stockholders.  Our compensation and management development committee has designed our executive compensation program based on principles that reflect these objectives. These principles have contributed to our strong performance and rewarded executives appropriately.
Compensation Objectives
The objectives of our compensation program are to provide pay that is competitive, performance-based, aligned with the interests of our stockholders, and focused on attracting, rewarding and retaining talent as described below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Competitive – pay should be set at a level for the role that is competitive to our peers with whom we compete for talent, is equitable among our executive officers, and recognizes the knowledge, skills and attributes of our executive officers; 
• Performance-based – pay should reward individual and Company performance when pre-established short- and long-term goals are met or exceeded and provide for consequences when such targets are not met; 
• Aligned with Stockholders – incentive plans should encourage long-term increases in stockholder value; and 
• Focused on Talent – pay should be designed to attract, motivate and retain key executives.

[END TABLE]
Setting Total Compensation
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Our compensation-setting process consists of establishing overall target total compensation for each named executive officer and then allocating that compensation among base salary, annual incentive plan awards, and long-term incentive awards. While no specific formula is used to determine the allocation between cash and equity-based compensation, when allocating these compensation elements, we generally utilize a compensation mix more heavily weighted towards variable and incentive compensation. The compensation and management development committee believes that the CEO's compensation should be the most heavily weighted towards variable and long-term incentive awards to align his compensation with stockholder interests relative to other named executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
To establish the appropriate target level of compensation for the CEO and each named executive officer, each compensation element is reviewed by the compensation and management development committee against market data for the role for our compensation comparator group provided by the compensation and management development committee's independent compensation consultant. The compensation and management development committee's philosophy is to target each executive officer's compensation to be generally at the median of, and also competitive with, members of our comparator group for target total annual cash compensation (base salary plus target annual incentive plan award) and target total direct compensation (total annual cash compensation plus the grant value of long-term incentive awards). General industry compensation survey data was also presented by the independent compensation consultant and considered. To the extent that the total compensation of our executive officers is performance-based and, therefore, "at risk", actual compensation is determined by Company performance and, with respect to the annual incentive bonus plan, individual performance against pre-established objectives. To the extent that we exceed our annual performance targets and an executive officer significantly exceeds individual performance objectives, our compensation program is designed to reward such executive officer by paying total compensation greater than the median level of the comparator group. To the extent that we do not achieve our annual performance targets or an executive officer's individual performance does not meet expectations, our compensation program is designed to reduce the amount of total compensation received by such executive officer.
Setting compensation targets based on comparative market and industry data is intended to ensure that our compensation practices are competitive in terms of attracting, rewarding and retaining executives. In addition, because each executive officer's target compensation is set by reference to persons with similar duties at companies in our comparator group and/or general industry, the compensation and management development committee does not establish any fixed relationship between the compensation of the CEO and that of any other executive officer. Internal pay equity among the other executive officers is also considered when setting compensation targets. The level of responsibility, scope of role and impact to the organization are all taken into consideration.
Although the compensation and management development committee strives to set executive compensation at levels that are competitive with the comparator companies, it does not rigidly adhere to a particular target in determining executive compensation. Any executive officer's total compensation may vary from the targets due to various other factors, including exceptionally strong or weak Company performance, or particularly strong or weak

       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
individual performance, over the prior year. The compensation and management development committee also takes into account additional individual factors when establishing total executive compensation levels, including an executive's position within the Company, level of experience, tenure and need for retention.
Our Compensation Comparator Group
As noted above, the compensation and management development committee's independent compensation consultant provided an analysis of compensation data and practices from a select group of peer companies in the chemical industry. The compensation and management development committee, with the assistance of the independent compensation consultant, identified the companies to be included in the comparator group.

2018 Compensation Decisions 
Base Salary
The compensation and management development committee reviews and approves at least annually the base salaries for the CEO and each of the other named executive officers. In making a determination of the appropriate level of an executive officer's base salary, the compensation and management development committee considers a number of factors, including (i) the scope, complexity, and financial or business impact of the executive's position, (ii) the executive's level of expertise, experience and individual performance, (iii) how the executive's base salary compares to that of the Company's other executives, and (iv) how the executive's base salary compares to the base salary of similarly-situated executives at companies in our peer group or in compensation surveys we review. As a result of these factors, base salaries may actually be set higher or lower than the median level of similarly-situated executives at companies in our comparator group, when appropriate.
Certain of our named executive officers received base pay increases effective in March 2018, in amounts ranging from 0% to 11%, based on the compensation and management development committee's application of the above factors and expansions in roles for the new year.  Mr. Richardson was appointed chief financial officer in February 2018.  The Company's pay philosophy is that, in general, the pay for individuals new to a role should work toward the desired competitive pay positioning (e.g., median) over time as they gain experience in the role. In most cases, the individual's pay is expected to reach the desired competitive positioning within 1-3 years upon taking the role. At the time of his appointment as CFO, Mr. Richardson's salary was increased $50,000, from $450,000 to $500,000 to reflect his new role.  As part of the plan to bring Mr. Richardson closer to market median and reflecting his continued development and performance as CFO, his base salary was adjusted to $580,000 in September 2018.
Annual Incentive Plan Awards
Plan Summary
A target annual incentive plan award, expressed as a percentage of annual base salary, is set for each named executive officer based on the market data for his or her position and his or her level within the organization. Target bonus percentages for each named executive officer are shown in the chart below. For  2018, the actual annual incentive plan award that an executive officer could receive ranged from 0% – 300% of his or her target annual incentive plan award based on our achievement of certain business, financial and stewardship performance targets and the achievement by the executive officer of personal objectives established for him or her at the beginning of the year. Each performance measure has a threshold, target and superior level, and failure to achieve threshold performance on any performance measure produces a zero payout for that measure, regardless of the individual results. See page 50 for the detailed performance measures and performance levels for 2018. An individual performance modifier for each executive officer (other than the CEO) is recommended to the compensation and management development committee by our CEO after the end of the fiscal year, based on his assessment of the satisfactory completion of the various individual objectives. The formula for determining the actual payout for each executive officer is as follows:
Eligible earnings is defined as either the actual amount of base pay that is earned for the year, or an annualized base salary rate, depending on the situation. This amount includes any base salary adjustments that might have been

made throughout the year.  The annual incentive plan award is paid in March of the year following the performance period. 
For 2018, the target annual performance bonus award expressed as a percentage of base salary for each of the named executive officers was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]

Company Goals and Objectives
[BEGIN TABLE]
The 2018 annual incentive plan awards were based on our achievement of incremental levels of Adjusted EBIT, a working capital component, and stewardship goals relating to occupational and process safety and the environment. Within each of these performance metric areas, there are three incremental performance levels, which are referred to internally as threshold, target and superior. The target level for all metrics is set at amounts that generally reflect our internal, confidential business plan at the time the awards are established, and take into account known headwinds / tailwinds and economic conditions. These goals require a high level of performance over the one-year performance period to be achieved. Threshold and superior levels are set as a percentage of target (except for the stewardship goals, which for 2018 are set in absolute incidents) and are designed to provide a smaller award for lower levels of acceptable performance (threshold) as well as to reward exceptional levels of performance (superior).   Rewarding Performance that Drives Business Success   The annual incentive plan encourages executive officers to focus on financial performance for the fiscal year by basing 85% of the award on the following metrics:• Adjusted EBIT• Working Capital

The 2018 annual incentive plan awards were based on our achievement of incremental levels of Adjusted EBIT, a working capital component, and stewardship goals relating to occupational and process safety and the environment. Within each of these performance metric areas, there are three incremental performance levels, which are referred to internally as threshold, target and superior. The target level for all metrics is set at amounts that generally reflect our internal, confidential business plan at the time the awards are established, and take into account known headwinds / tailwinds and economic conditions. These goals require a high level of performance over the one-year performance period to be achieved. Threshold and superior levels are set as a percentage of target (except for the stewardship goals, which for 2018 are set in absolute incidents) and are designed to provide a smaller award for lower levels of acceptable performance (threshold) as well as to reward exceptional levels of performance (superior).   Rewarding Performance that Drives Business Success   The annual incentive plan encourages executive officers to focus on financial performance for the fiscal year by basing 85% of the award on the following metrics:• Adjusted EBIT• Working Capital

Performance Assessment
The compensation and management development committee believes that individual performance goals are appropriate instruments for measuring individual contributions to strategic corporate initiatives and therefore the individual performance modifier is a key component to the annual incentive plan decision.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, the CEO and the compensation and management development committee jointly set the annual, individual performance objectives for the CEO. Performance against goals is reviewed throughout the year on a periodic basis.  The principle individual performance objectives for the CEO during 2018 included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Manage capital expenditures while thoughtfully funding incremental expansion; 
• Further develop pipeline management for Engineered Materials; 
• Engage gender diversity across the Company and engage women in leadership roles; 
• Continue efforts in making employee engagement a defining element of our culture building a diverse and inclusive organization; and

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continue strong support of  community outreach and volunteerism. 
[END TABLE]
At the end of the fiscal year, the CEO submits to the compensation and management development committee and the full board a performance self-assessment. The performance assessment is based on factors such as achievement of company and individual objectives and contributions to our financial performance. Individual performance of the CEO is used by the compensation and management development committee in consideration of merit increases in base salary and the individual performance modifier on the annual incentive plan.
At the beginning of each fiscal year, each named executive officer (excluding the CEO) jointly sets his or her annual, individual performance objectives with the CEO, subject to review and approval by the compensation and management development committee. Individual performance objectives for the other named executive officers in 2018 included specific objectives related to execution against critical corporate initiatives and our strategic plan, cost reduction, human resource development and leadership alignment. At the end of the fiscal year, the CEO conducts a final review with each of his direct reports, including each named executive officer, and rates their performance. The CEO then submits to the compensation and management development committee a performance assessment and compensation recommendation for each of the named executive officers. The performance evaluations are based on factors such as achievement of company and individual objectives and contributions to our financial performance. Individual performance of the named executive officers is used by the CEO and the compensation and management development committee in consideration of merit increases in base salary and the individual performance modifier on the annual incentive plan award.
The compensation and management development committee reviews and evaluates the CEO's self-assessment of performance against objectives and, with input from the full board and the independent compensation consultant, determines in executive session the individual performance modifier assigned to the CEO for the recently completed year and base salary adjustments for the new year. The compensation and management development committee reviews and approves the base salary adjustments and the individual performance modifiers for the other named executive officers, based in part on recommendations by the CEO. The compensation and management development committee's assessment of each named executive officer's performance relative to Company and personal objectives was communicated to the executive.
In setting the CEO's individual performance modifier for 2018 at 127.15%, the compensation and management development committee considered a number of the CEO's accomplishments in 2018, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Executed on all aspects of the financial plan, which led to record setting levels of adjusted earnings per share and Adjusted EBIT, including more that $1 billion of Adjusted EBIT in the Acetyl Chain; 
• Grew pipeline closes by 47% to more than 3,250 in the Engineered Materials segment; 
• Returned $1.1 billion to stockholders through dividends and repurchases of shares;  
• Rewarded employees worldwide by granting a stock award in order to reinforce engagement and alignment towards the Company's 3 year strategic plan; 
• Onboarded  a new chief financial officer; 
• Added a new director to the board, increasing the diversity of the board; 
• Substantially integrated one acquisition; 
• Increased the number of women in executive positions and grew the bench of diverse talent at every level of the organization; 
• Employed various tactics to increase internal mobility and expanded our global career framework to include all non-exempt employees, allowing for a more fungible talent pool; 
• Personally led efforts to build leadership capability in support of a respectful workplace for all employees; 
• Substantially improved safety performance of acquired businesses and maintained high-performing stewardship results in the areas of process safety and environmental events;

• Granted more than $2,500,000 to a number of non-profit organizations recommended by employees through the Celanese Foundation. 
[END TABLE]
Based on the compensation and management development committee's evaluation of company and individual performance, it awarded annual incentive plan awards for 2018 for the CEO and the remaining executive officers, which are shown in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" below under the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column. The CEO also recommended a discretionary bonus for Ms. Jurecka, based on extraordinary individual performance in the areas of advancing company culture, building our company's talent, and driving diversity and inclusion.  Based on that recommendation, the compensation and management development committee approved a discretionary bonus for such executive officer, which is shown in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table" below under the "Bonus" column.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation
Philosophy 
In furtherance of our long-term compensation strategy, we offer a compensation mix that provides appropriate incentives to meet our objectives of providing competitive pay packages for talented executives, delivering compensation that is performance-based, and aligning management's interests with those of stockholders. As described above in the "Elements of Compensation" table, long-term incentives in the form of equity awards support our compensation objectives and are consistent with our overall strategy to attract, motivate, reward and retain top performers. Since 2009, the compensation and management development committee has annually granted (except in 2012) long-term incentive awards to our executive officers with overlapping performance periods to provide them with personal financial motivation to help us reach our longer-term goals. In addition to providing the officer with a long-term stake in our success, we believe these awards serve as a significant retention tool to dissuade them from leaving the Company. The Company makes these awards under our stockholder-approved 2009 Global Incentive Plan (the "2009 GIP") or, beginning in April 2018, the stockholder-approved 2018 Global Incentive Plan (the "2018 GIP").
As discussed under "Setting Total Compensation" above, the total award value for the long-term incentives is determined by the compensation and management development committee each year in its discretion as part of setting total annual compensation, taking into account market data from our comparator group and, where the comparator group did not have corresponding executives with similar roles, then from survey data. The award value is then divided by the grant date fair value of the award to determine the number of units actually awarded. The starting value for the award, however, does not represent the actual compensation the named executive officer will realize. These awards are intended to focus the named executive officers on future company performance, and the actual value realized by a named executive officer will depend on our performance over time and the named executive officer's continued employment with the Company. See "2018 Grants of Plan–Based Awards Table" for additional information.

The following summarizes long-term incentive awards that had performance periods concluded during 2018 or that were awarded in 2018.
Awards Granted in 2016
Annual Performance Award. A portion of our long-term incentive award granted in February 2016 was a PRSU based on Adjusted EPS Growth and Return on Capital Employed, earned over the three-year period 2016-2018, as described above and in earlier proxy statements ("2016 LTIP").  As noted in the table below, the level of Adjusted EPS achieved superior performance and the level of Return on Capital Employed was slightly below superior. After a review of the actual performance compared to the PRSU performance metrics, the compensation and management development committee determined that the award should pay out at 199.2% of the target amount upon the vesting date in February 2019.  The Company's three-year relative total stockholder return was above the bottom quartile of the S&P 500 Index and, therefore, there was no reduction in the earned level of the Adjusted EPS component.
Performance compared to target is shown below:

Awards Granted in 2018
Annual Performance Award. For 2018, the compensation and management development committee approved a long-term incentive plan design (the "2018 LTIP") under the 2009 GIP pursuant to which awards of PRSUs were made to our named executive officers, other than the CEO. The design of the 2018 LTIP was substantially similar to the 2016 LTIP and 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan ("2017 LTIP").  PRSUs granted on February 8, 2018 facilitate stock ownership and will vest on February 15, 2021, subject to adjustment (0-200% of targeted amount) based on the Company's achievement of target levels of adjusted earnings per share and return on capital employed during a three-year performance period (2018-2020) as described in the following table:
[BEGIN TABLE]

(4)  The payout on the adjusted earnings growth measure will be limited if the Company's three-year relative total stockholder return is in the bottom quartile of the S&P 500 Index. 
[END TABLE]
Other Awards.  As noted above, for 2018, the compensation and management development committee determined to make our CEO's (Mr. Rohr's) long-term incentive award in the form of time-vesting RSUs, vesting annually over 3 years, rather than PRSUs as for the other named executive officers. The compensation and management development committee determined to use this vehicle, rather than PRSUs, to reflect a shift in the CEO's focus to succession planning and transition.  See "CEO 2018 Compensation Decisions" for more information about Mr. Rohr's RSU award.
In addition to a PRSU award under the 2018 LTIP, Mr. Oliver also received time-vesting RSUs in February 2018 (like the prior year) along with other senior leaders who are not named executive officers.  These RSU awards vest over 3 years from the grant date. In light of his interim status as acting CFO, the compensation and management development committee decided not to adjust his historical long-term award mix.
In addition, in connection with Mr. Edwards' decision to retire as an officer of the Company effective December 31, 2018, and in order to encourage his continued employment in a non-officer capacity through January 31, 2019 to facilitate a smooth transition of his role, the management and compensation committee agreed to permit pro rata vesting of the final tranche of a time-vesting RSU award originally granted to him in 2017 when he was first hired.  As required by SEC rules, the incremental fair value of this modified award appears as additional 2018 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table and as an additional grant in the Grant of Plan-Based Awards Table.
Executive Pay Parity
The disparities in Mr. Rohr's total compensation as compared to that of the other named executive officers exist because his responsibilities are greater and his ability to impact the future of the Company is greater. The average total direct compensation (base salary, actual annual incentive plan award and grant date fair value of long-term incentives) awarded to the named executive officers was 32.7% of the total compensation of the CEO. Mr. Richardson's, Mr. Sutton's, Mr. Edwards', Ms. Jurecka's, and Mr. Oliver's total compensation consisted of     18.8%, 36.3%, 23.1%, 14.9% and 9.6% of Mr. Rohr's total compensation, respectively. The compensation and management 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 53 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
development committee believes that these compensation relationships effectively reflect each named executive officer's level of responsibility and our core compensation philosophy.
Compensation Governance
Compensation and Management Development Committee Oversight
The compensation and management development committee is responsible for establishing compensation policies and programs that are consistent with our business strategy and aligned with our stockholders' interests. Specifically, the compensation and management development committee is responsible for:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving the corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of the CEO and our other named executive officers; 
• evaluating the performance and compensation of the CEO and our other named executive officers in light of their established goals and objectives; 
• reviewing and approving both target and actual pay levels of the CEO and our other named executive officers; and 
• reviewing and approving incentive and equity-based compensation plans, including our annual incentive plan award and our long-term incentive plans, and all grants of awards under such plans to our executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Our compensation and management development committee is comprised entirely of independent directors (as defined under NYSE listing standards) who are also non-employee directors (under SEC rules) and outside directors (under IRS rules).
Role of the Compensation Consultant in Making Decisions
Pursuant to its charter, the compensation and management development committee has the sole authority to retain and terminate any compensation consultant. 
During 2018, the compensation and management development committee retained Willis Towers Watson PLC ("Willis") as its independent outside compensation consultant to advise it in connection with executive compensation matters.  Representatives of Willis regularly attend compensation and management development committee meetings as requested by its chair, and report directly and exclusively to the compensation and management development committee on matters relating to compensation for the named executive officers. In 2018, Willis provided the following services to the compensation and management development committee:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• analyzed and benchmarked incentive plan targets; 
• reviewed and provided guidance on compensation plan design; 
• reviewed the composition of our compensation comparator group and recommended modifications; 
• conducted an analysis of our compensation for the CEO and the other named executive officers, and assessed how target and actual compensation aligned with our philosophy and objectives; and 
• provided market data, historical compensation information, internal equity comparisons, share usage and dilution, competitive practice information, and recommendations regarding compensation trends, compensation strategy and our proxy statement. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, Willis analyzed and benchmarked non-employee director compensation at the request of the nominating and corporate governance committee.
In addition to the executive compensation services provided by Willis to the compensation and management development committee, and the director compensation services provided to the nominating and corporate governance committee, specialized teams at Willis and affiliates provided certain services to the Company in 2018 at the request of management consisting of (i) pension valuation services for broad-based defined benefit plans that 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 54 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
we sponsor; (ii) total rewards consulting services, including advice in connection with union negotiations, annuity purchases, and analysis for M&A activity; (iii) non-customized executive and non-executive compensation survey data, and (iv) insurance procurement services for directors' and officers' and other specialized insurance coverages. In fiscal 2018, the Company paid $198,937 to Willis for its executive compensation services to the compensation and management development committee and approximately $1,813,524 to Willis for its other services to the Company.
The compensation and management development committee believes that, given the nature and scope of these services, the provision of these additional services did not raise any conflict of interest pursuant to applicable SEC and NYSE rules and did not impair Willis's ability to provide independent advice to the compensation and management development committee concerning executive compensation matters and concluded that no such conflicts of interest existed. In making this determination, the compensation and management development committee considered, among other things, the following factors: (i) the types of non-compensation services provided by Willis, noting in particular that many of the services had been provided to the Company by the former Towers Perrin firm since 2003 (pension and compensation) and by the former Willis & Co. firm since 2008 (insurance brokerage), and that the Willis personnel who perform these additional services for the Company operated separately and independently of the Willis personnel that perform executive compensation-related services for the committee, (ii) the amount of fees for such non-compensation services, noting in particular that such fees are negligible when considered in the context of Willis's total revenues for the period, (iii) Willis's policies and procedures that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, (iv) the committee's decision to engage Willis, and the fact that the committee, in its discretion, determines whether to retain or terminate Willis as its executive compensation consultant, (v) Willis representatives who advise the compensation and management development committee do not provide any other services to the Company, (vi) there are no other business or personal relationships between Company management or members of the compensation and management development committee, on the one hand, and any Willis representatives who provide compensation services to the Company, on the other hand, and (vii) neither Willis nor any of the Willis representatives who provide executive compensation services to the Company own any Common Stock or other securities of the Company (except potentially in passive investments where the investment decision is made by external managers).
In compliance with SEC and NYSE requirements regarding the engagement of executive compensation consultants, Willis provided the compensation and management development committee with a letter, considered by the committee, confirming facts regarding the independence of such firm's directors, consultants and employees who advise the committee on executive compensation matters.
Role of Management in Making Decisions
The compensation and management development committee regularly meets with the CEO and the senior vice president and chief human resources officer (CHRO) to receive reports and recommendations regarding the compensation of our named executive officers other than the CEO. In particular, the CEO submits recommendations, as appropriate, to the compensation and management development committee on the base salary, target annual incentive plan award levels, and target levels of long-term incentive plan compensation to be offered to each named executive officer (other than himself). Recommendations are developed in consultation with the senior vice president and CHRO (other than for herself) and the compensation and management development committee's independent compensation consultant and are accompanied by peer company and general market data prepared by such consultant. In addition, the CEO makes recommendations to the compensation and management development committee on the individual performance modifiers used to determine each named executive officer's actual payout under the annual incentive plan award. Although the compensation and management development committee considers the CEO's recommendations, the final decisions regarding base salary, annual incentive plan and long-term incentive plan opportunities and individual performance modifiers are made by the compensation and management development committee after discussion with the board. The CEO does not make any recommendations to the compensation and management development committee regarding his own compensation.

Additional Information Regarding Executive Compensation
Other Compensation Elements
Consistent with providing a total pay program that is sufficiently competitive with the members of our compensation comparator group so as to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, our named executive officers receive or have access to the following benefits. We believe all of these plans have proven useful and, in many cases, necessary for recruiting and retention purposes.
Retirement Benefits
Our named executive officers participate in our various employee benefit plans designed to provide retirement income. Our qualified and non-qualified pension plans provide a retirement income base, and our qualified and non-qualified 401(k) plans permit additional retirement savings. To encourage retirement savings under the qualified and nonqualified 401(k) plans, we provide an employer matching contribution.  We limit eligible compensation for employer contributions under the qualified and non-qualified 401(k) plans to annual base salary for our named executive officers. As a result, the compensation and management development committee's decisions to grant annual incentive awards (whether cash or equity) do not create any additional retirement benefits under these plans for our named executive officers. For more information about these plans, see "2018 Summary Compensation Table", "2018 Pension Benefits Table" and "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table".
Perquisites
Our named executive officers receive health and welfare benefits, such as group medical, group life and long-term disability insurance coverage, under plans generally available to all other U.S.-based salaried employees. Consistent with our pay-for-performance policy, we provide our named executive officers with limited executive fringe benefits and perquisites. For named executive officers who we ask to serve on overseas assignments, we provide benefits under our expatriate assignment program to help offset the additional costs of the assignment, including relocation expenses, housing, car and educational allowances, cost of living differentials, tax preparation expenses, and certain related tax equalization and tax gross-up payments.  These are described in the notes to the "2018 Summary Compensation Table".
Severance Plan
In order to have a competitive benefit that allows for consistent administration without negotiations of special payments, we have an Executive Severance Benefits Plan ("Severance Plan") for our named executive officers. The Severance Plan provides cash payments upon involuntary termination without cause, but is not available in the event of a change in control to individuals that have a change in control agreement as described below. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control" for additional information.
Change in Control Agreements
We have change in control agreements with each of our named executive officers to ensure that management will objectively consider potential transactions that may benefit stockholders without regard to potential impact on their continued employment. The change in control agreements provide for a cash payment to be made following a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the officer with good reason within two years following a change in control. See "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control" for additional information. In approving the form of change in control agreement several years ago, the compensation and management development committee considered the prevalence of such agreements among similarly-situated executives at the companies in our compensation comparator group based on data collected for the Company by the compensation and management development committee's then independent compensation consultant. The compensation and management development committee also determined that the uniform non-compete and non-
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 56 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
solicit clauses contained in such agreements provide a significant benefit to the Company. None of the change in control agreements in effect with our named executive officers contains a tax gross-up.
No Employment Agreements
We do not have any employment agreements with any of our executive officers. All of our executive officers are "at will" employees.
Executive Stock Ownership Requirements
The compensation and management development committee has adopted stringent stock ownership guidelines for our named executive officers. The types of securities that count toward required share ownership include only (i) shares of Common Stock owned outright, whether individually or through beneficial ownership in a trust or partnership, (ii) shares of Common Stock or share equivalents held in a Company-sponsored deferred compensation or retirement plan, and (iii) 60% of unvested RSUs that will vest within one year of the measurement date. Stock options do not count towards the ownership requirements. Failure to meet stock ownership requirements, or failure to make a meaningful effort to do so, may result in the executive officer not receiving future base salary increases or long-term incentive awards, and may also make the executive officer ineligible for promotion.
The following table sets forth, the ownership requirement (expressed as a multiple of base salary) for each of our named executive officers serving at year-end and the shares or equivalents owned (expressed as a multiple of base salary) as of December 31, 2018 under our current ownership guidelines:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Named Executive Officer Minimum Required Ownership   Ownership as of December 31, 2018(1)(2) 
Mark C. Rohr 6 times base salary   43.8 times base salary 
Scott A. Richardson 4 times base salary   4.6 times base salary 
Scott M. Sutton 4 times base salary   11.1 times base salary 
Peter G. Edwards 4 times base salary   0.6 times base salary 
Shannon L. Jurecka 4 times base salary   1.0 times base salary 
(1)  Calculated using $101.10, the average of the 2018 high and low share prices, and total salary paid during 2018. 
(2)  Ms. Jurecka is on track for compliance with the ownership guideline by the October 2022 deadline, based on her promotion date.  Mr. Edwards resigned as an officer effective December 31, 2018 and retired from the Company effective January 31, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Clawback Policy
In order to further align management's interests with the interests of stockholders and support good governance practices, our compensation and management development committee adopted a clawback (also known as a recoupment) policy applicable to long-term incentive plan awards to an employee along with bonuses paid out under our annual incentive plan. The policy prohibits the awardee from (i) disclosing confidential or proprietary information, (ii) competing with us, and (iii) soliciting or hiring employees, former employees or consultants of ours for a period of one year following the termination of the awardee's employment with us for any reason. In the event that the awardee violates the provisions of the recoupment policy, the covered awards will cease vesting and the awardee will forfeit any rights to the covered awards and will be required to deliver to us any amount received from the long-term incentive cash award or gain realized on any stock option exercises or any other transaction relating to an equity award granted by us.
In addition, pursuant to Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, if we are required to restate our financial statements due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements as a result of misconduct, the CEO and chief financial officer will be required to reimburse us for any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-

based compensation received during the 12 months following the first public issuance of the non-complying document, and any profits realized from the sale of securities of the Company during those 12 months.
Tally Sheets
From time-to-time, the compensation and management development committee reviews a summary report, or "tally sheet," prepared by management for each named executive officer. The purpose of a tally sheet is to show the total dollar value of the executive's annual compensation. This includes the executive's base salary, annual incentive award, long-term incentive compensation, and other compensation. The tally sheet also shows (or the committee is separately provided from time to time) holdings of Common Stock and equivalents, and accumulated value and unrealized gains under prior long-term incentive compensation awards. The compensation and management development committee uses tally sheets to estimate the total annual compensation of the named executive officers, and to provide perspective on the value accumulated by the named executive officers from our compensation program.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Tax Deductibility of Compensation Expense
Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of $1 million paid to any one named executive officer in any calendar year.  Under the tax rules in effect before 2018, compensation that qualified as "performance-based" under Section 162(m) was deductible without regard to this $1 million limit.  However, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act") eliminated this performance-based compensation exception effective January 1, 2018, subject to a special rule that "grandfathers" certain awards and arrangements that were in effect on or before November 2, 2017.  As a result, compensation that the committee structured in 2017 and prior years with the intent of qualifying as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) that is paid on or after January 1, 2018 may not be fully deductible, depending on the application of the special grandfather rules.  Moreover, from and after January 1, 2018, compensation awarded in excess of $1 million to our named executive officers generally will not be deductible.  
Although the 2017 Tax Act will limit the deductibility of compensation paid to the named executive officers, the compensation and management development committee will, consistent with its past practice, design compensation programs that are intended to be in the best long-term interests of the Company and our stockholders, with deductibility of compensation being one of several considerations taken into account.

Compensation Risk Assessment
It is our policy to regularly monitor our compensation policies and practices to determine whether our risk management objectives are being met and to adjust those policies and practices to address any incentives that are determined to encourage risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us and any changes in our risk profile. With respect to the compensation of our executives, the compensation and management development committee, with the input of the independent compensation consultant and management, takes into consideration whether any such programs may incentivize excessive risk taking. As part of these considerations and consistent with its compensation philosophy, our compensation program, particularly our annual and long-term incentive plans, are designed to provide incentives for the executives to achieve our objectives without encouraging excessive risk-taking because:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our incentive programs utilize a mix of short-term and long-term performance measures, which provide executives with short-term incentive to improve our results while also providing a significant incentive to maintain those results for the long-term; 
• a significant portion of our named executive officers' incentive compensation consists of long-term incentive or other equity-based compensation, which, when coupled with our stock ownership guidelines, encourages long-term equity ownership of our Common Stock by the executives, aligning their interests with our stockholders; 
• the financial metrics utilized under each of the programs are designed to reflect measures of stockholder value over multiple years or annual operational performance that the compensation and management development committee believes will create long-term stockholder value; 
• various non-financial metrics (such as achievement of environmental, health and safety goals) are used as part of the process of determining compensation; 
• in determining the exact mix of compensation from year to year, the compensation and management development committee intends to grant awards that provide an appropriate level of "market risk" that do not encourage excessive risk taking; and 
• compensation payment opportunities that may be excessive are avoided due to the limits placed on the amount of incentive payments that may be earned. 
[END TABLE]
With respect to the compensation of employees other than the named executive officers, the compensation and management development committee has reviewed our compensation policies and practices to determine whether those policies and practices encourage excessive or inappropriate risk. Our compensation programs for employees other than the named executive officers are designed to incentivize employees to demonstrate the courage to make decisions that benefit the Company as a whole, while accepting personal accountability and avoiding unnecessary risk.

(1)  Principal position as of December 31, 2018. Mr. Richardson was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective February 16, 2018.  Ms. Jurecka was elected Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer in 2017 and was named an executive officer effective October 18, 2017.  Mr. Oliver served as our acting Chief Financial Officer from October 2017 until the appointment of Mr. Richardson, as our new Chief Financial Officer, and remained our Chief Accounting Officer until April 20, 2018, after which he relocated to our Amsterdam Regional Headquarters and serves as our Vice President, Finance, Europe. Information is not provided for years prior to 2018 for Mr. Richardson because he was not an executive officer prior to 2018.  Information is not provided for Mr. Edwards or Ms. Jurecka for years prior to 2017 because neither was an executive officer prior to 2017.

and 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The compensation and management development committee approved a change in the vesting treatment for the RSU award received by Mr. Edwards in 2017 when he joined the company. The approved change provides for pro rata vesting of the final tranche on the original vesting date. Consequently, for 2018, Mr. Edwards' stock award value also reflects the incremental fair value of $410,108 related to the modification. Additional information regarding PRSUs and RSUs granted to the named executive officers during 2018 is set forth in note 8 below and in the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" on a grant-by-grant basis. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  No stock options were granted during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
(5)  Includes 2018 Annual Incentive Plan award cash payouts with respect to 2018 performance. Further information about the Annual Incentive Plan is set forth in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Compensation Decisions – Salary and Incentive Compensation – Annual Incentive Plan Awards" and the "2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table". 
(6)  Consists entirely of the aggregate respective change in the actuarial present value of each individual's pension benefits based on a discount rate of 4.23% for 2018. The discount rate in 2017 was 3.54% and the rate in 2016 was 3.95%. The values shown assume retirement from the CARPP and the CASRSP (as applicable) at age 65 with a life only benefit.  
(7)  The amounts reported in this column with respect to fiscal 2018 consist of the following: 
[END TABLE]
     (a) Aggregate Company contributions, including matching and retirement contributions made for 2018, under the Company's tax-qualified and non-qualified defined-contribution retirement plans, including the Celanese Americas Retirement Savings Plan ("CARSP"), a tax-qualified, defined contribution (401(k)) plan, and the Celanese Americas Supplemental Retirement Savings Plan ("CASRSP"), an unfunded, non-qualified defined contribution plan: Mr. Rohr, $127,050, Mr. Richardson, $56,523, Mr. Sutton, $76,875, Mr. Edwards, $65,365, Ms. Jurecka, $49,585, and Mr. Oliver, $40,745.
The CARSP is available to substantially all of our U.S. employees, including all the named executive officers. The plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA. Eligible participants are entitled to a 6% match of his or her pre-tax and after-tax contributions to the CARSP and an allocation of 5% of his or her salary up to the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit ($275,000 in 2018) in lieu of the former pension plan contribution under the Celanese Americas Retirement Pension Plan ("Retirement Contributions"). The amount contributed to the plan by or on behalf of a participant is limited by Code Section 415 and is credited with earnings based on the earnings rate of an investment fund maintained for investments under the CARSP chosen by the participant.
Each of the named executive officers is entitled to an allocation under the CASRSP equal to (a) Retirement Contributions limited by Code Section 415 and not contributed to the CARSP, and (b) 6% of his or her salary in excess of the compensation limits under the CARSP ("Excess Earnings Contributions"). The amount contributed to the plan on behalf of a participant is credited with earnings based on the earnings rate of an investment fund maintained for investments under the CARSP which is currently the 1-3 year Government/Credit Bond Index Fund. Additional information about the CASRSP is set forth in the "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table" and accompanying text.
     (b) The Company provides the following perquisites to the named executive officers: personal liability insurance, and executive health services. In addition, the compensation and management development committee has authorized Mr. Rohr, as CEO, to travel on Company-provided aircraft for security and safety reasons and to maximize his availability for Company business, and considers travel that is related to Company business or otherwise benefits the Company, including travel to meetings of other boards of directors, as business use. This table includes the incremental cost of the use of Company-provided aircraft and related travel expenses for Mr. Rohr to attend meetings of another public company's and a private foundation's board of directors on which he serves (and not for vacation, commuting or other personal use), of  $22,555 for 2018. The incremental cost was determined using a method that takes into account the variable costs such as landing fees, aircraft fuel charges, taxes, local transportation and catering.  Because our aircraft is used primarily for business-related travel, we do not include fixed costs, such as the acquisition costs of leased aircraft.  The Company also provided certain benefits under our expatriate assignment program to Mr. Richardson (related to his prior assignment in China) and Mr. Oliver (related to his three-year assignment to Amsterdam as our Vice President, Finance, Europe).  For Mr. Richardson, the benefits consisted of $5,400 for tax preparation services.  For Mr. Oliver, the benefits had an aggregate cost of  $271,884, and consisted of relocation expenses, housing, car and educational allowances, cost of living differentials, tax preparation expenses, immigration fees and certain other taxable reimbursements related to the assignment.  Mr. Oliver also received under the program $5,162 in tax gross-ups for certain of the program's taxable benefits. Perquisites and personal benefits were excluded for all of the named executive officers to the extent that the total value of all perquisites and personal benefits for a named executive officer was less than $10,000. In addition, the table does not include any amounts for personal benefits provided to any of the named executive officers for which we believe there is no aggregate incremental cost to us, including use of tickets for certain sporting events.
No tax gross-ups were paid to any named executive officer during 2018 except as noted above for Mr. Oliver under our expatriate assignment program.

The fair value of annual award PRSUs granted under the 2018 LTIP was calculated to be $94.05 per share, as determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model on February 8, 2018, the date of grant, discounted for lack of dividend participation and for implications of the potential performance limitation if cumulative TSR for the performance period is in the bottom quartile, and adjusted for a performance premium.  Payout of such PRSUs can range from a minimum of 0% to a maximum of 200% of target. The target and maximum potential values of the award of PRSUs for the named executive officers using the fair value discussed above, assuming performance at the target and maximum levels of performance conditions, is set forth below. Actual performance, and the stock price at the payout dates, is uncertain.

Actual performance and payout value may vary.  For time-based RSUs (including the 2016 PRSUs that were earned based on performance at 199.2% of target but remain subject to time-based vesting), the market value has been computed based on the number of units awarded that are unvested at the close of business on December 31, 2018 multiplied by the closing stock price on December 31, 2018.  Actual payout value may vary.

(2)   The present value amounts shown in the table above are the amount needed today that, with interest, would provide the named executive officer's future retirement benefit.  Retirement is assumed to occur at age 65 in the CARPP and participants receive their cash balance benefit as a lump sum. 
[END TABLE]
The Celanese Americas Retirement Pension Plan ("CARPP") is a tax-qualified, defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Celanese Americas. This plan covers substantially all of our U.S. employees. The plan is subject to the provisions of ERISA. All of our named executive officers participated in this plan in 2018, with the exception of Mr. Edwards and Ms. Jurecka.
Effective January 1, 2001, the plan began providing benefits for new employees, as defined by the plan, hired after December 31, 2000, based on a different benefit formula ("Cash Balance Plan"). The Cash Balance Plan provides that for each plan year that employees work as defined, we credit 5% of the employee's annual pensionable earnings (up to Internal Revenue Code limits) to a hypothetical plan account that has been established for each employee, and credit that account with interest. For a given year, the plan's interest rate is the annual rate of interest on 30-year United States Treasury Securities for the August before the first day of that year. Effective January 1, 2008, employees vest in their accrued benefit after completing three years of service with us, as defined in the plan. If employees are vested when they leave the Company, they have the option to take their account balance with them, either in a lump-sum payment or as an annuity. Employees also have the choice to leave their account balance in the plan until the normal retirement age of 65. The amount of benefit depends on the employee's pay and any interest earned on the Company contributions. Once vested, survivor benefits are applicable to married participants. Messrs. Rohr, Sutton, and Oliver are covered under the Cash Balance Plan benefit formula.
Under the CARPP, if an employee's employment with us is terminated as a result of a corporate reorganization, layoff or corporate restructuring, including divestiture, that employee will receive an additional year of vesting service.
In connection with amendments to the CARPP in 2013, accrued benefits under the CARPP were frozen as of December 31, 2013, no further contributions will be made to the CARPP other than interest credits for the cash balance participants, Mr. Rohr, Mr. Richardson and Mr. Oliver, and future pension-related contributions ("Retirement Contributions") will be made to the CARSP or the CASRSP, depending on the level of eligible earnings of the participant.

For Mr. Sutton, earnings correspond to the yield on the investment options chosen by him under the 2008 Deferred Plan, which mirror the investment options under the CARSP. Amounts in this column for the 2009 GIP represent changes in our stock price during the year for all outstanding RSUs and/or PRSUs that were previously vested but remain subject to a hold requirement, plus related unpaid cash dividends credited during 2018 on such awards. None of the amounts in this column were reported as compensation in the "2018 Summary Compensation Table".

All of our named executive officers were eligible in 2018 to participate in the CASRSP, an unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution plan sponsored by Celanese Americas that is available only to persons who have a full year base salary in excess of the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit ($275,000 in 2018) or had their Retirement Contributions limited in the CARSP by Code Section 415. If a person is eligible to participate in the CASRSP because their salary exceeded the Code Section 401(a)(17) limit, he or she is entitled to an allocation under this plan equal to 6% of his or her salary in excess of the compensation limits under the CARSP ("Excess Earnings Contributions"). In addition, eligible participants are entitled to an allocation under this plan equal to 5% of his or her qualified earnings in excess of the Retirement Contribution made to the CARSP. The amount contributed to the plan on behalf of a participant is credited with earnings based on the earnings rate of one of the funds maintained for investments under the CARSP, which is currently the 1-3 year Government/Credit Bond Index Fund. The aggregate annualized rate of return for the credited earnings in  2018 was 1.4%. Beginning in 2015, participants will be credited with earnings based on the performance of certain hypothetical investment choices selected by the participant. These investment choices are the same investment choices available under the CARSP (other than the Celanese Stock Fund). Participants may change their investment elections at any time under the same rule that apply under the CARSP. Distributions under the CASRSP are in the form of a lump sum payment which is paid as soon as administratively practicable after termination of employment for most participants. Distributions to participants who are top 50 key employees of the Company must be delayed six months following termination based on Code Section 409A requirements. 
Our 2008 Deferred Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides certain of our senior employees and directors the opportunity to defer a portion of their compensation in exchange for a future payment amount equal to their deferrals plus or minus certain amounts based on the market performance of specified measurement funds selected by the participant. Directors Blackwell, Brown, Galante, Ihlenfeld, Rucker and Wulff, and Mr. Sutton, were the only directors or named executive officers that made contributions to, or had balances in, this plan during 2018.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change In Control
The particular events that trigger payments to our named executive officers are generally defined in our Severance Plan and the individual executives' change in control agreements, deferred compensation agreements, or stock option, PRSU or RSU award agreements. The compensation and management development committee believes that the primary benefits to the Company of employment agreements are the non-competition and non-solicitation provisions found therein. In order to achieve the benefit of these provisions without incurring the generally negative obligations associated with employment agreements, the compensation and management development committee 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 69 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
offers a more limited change in control agreement to each executive officer. However, the deferred compensation agreements, stock option / PRSU / RSU award agreements are still effective and provide for some potential payments upon termination and change in control as described in the tables below.
Severance Plan
Our Executive Severance Benefits Plan ("Severance Plan") applies to all our executive officers and other eligible employees, and provides, upon involuntary termination without cause, for the payment of (i) one year's base salary (one and one-half for the CEO, the COO and executive vice president-level executives); (ii) one year's annual incentive plan bonus award (one and one-half for the CEO, the COO and executive vice president-level executives) based on target Company performance and a 1.0 individual modifier; and (iii) a prorated portion of the annual incentive plan award for the year in which the termination occurs based on actual Company performance and a 1.0 individual modifier. The Severance Plan also provides for the payment of premiums for post-termination health insurance coverage ("COBRA premiums") for a period of one year from the date of termination (eighteen months for the CEO) and out-placement benefits. As a condition to the receipt of any benefits under the Severance Plan, an executive must agree to standard release, non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality provisions. In addition, the Severance Plan provides that the vesting of long-term incentive or other equity awards upon termination without cause will be governed by the terms of the applicable award agreements. Executives who are involuntarily terminated for any other reason (e.g., death, disability, retirement, termination for cause) are not eligible to receive severance benefits under the Severance Plan.
Change in Control Agreements
We have change in control agreements with each of our executive officers. The change in control agreements provide for a payment to be made to these officers following a termination of employment by the Company without cause or by the officer with good reason within two years following a change in control or following the first public announcement of a potential change in control transaction, provided certain conditions are satisfied.  These benefits are in lieu of payments under the Severance Plan. Generally, the change in control agreements provide for each executive officer to receive:

• a lump sum payment equal to up to two times the sum of: 
▪ the names executive officer's then current annualized base salary, and 
▪ the higher of (a) the officer's target bonus in effect on the last day of the fiscal year that ended immediately prior to the year in which the date of termination occurs, or (b) the average of the cash bonuses paid by the Company to the named executive officer for the three fiscal years preceding the date of termination; and 
• group health and dental coverage for the named executive officer and his or her dependents for a period of up to two years following the date of termination. 
[END TABLE]
The Company's current form of change in control agreement, which was executed by all of the named executive officers, does not contain a tax reimbursement provision and requires a cutback of benefits to avoid excise taxes if the after-tax benefit to the executive is greater than without the cutback. Each change in control agreement has a two-year term that is automatically renewed for successive two-year terms unless 90 days' notice of non-renewal is given by either party to the agreement.

  "cause" generally means (i) a willful failure to perform one's duties (other than as a result of total or partial incapacity due to physical or mental illness) for a period of 30 days following written notice by the Company of such failure; (ii) conviction of, or a plea of nolo contendere to, (x) a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or any similar criminal act in a jurisdiction outside the United States or (y) a crime involving moral turpitude; (iii) willful malfeasance or willful misconduct which is demonstrably injurious to the Company or its Affiliates (as defined); (iv) any act of fraud; (v) any material violation of the Company's code of conduct; (vi) any material violation of the Company's policies concerning harassment or discrimination; (vii) conduct that causes material harm to the business reputation of the Company or its Affiliates; or (viii) breach of the confidentiality, non-competition, or non-solicitation provisions of the change in control agreement.   
  "good reason" generally means (i) a material diminution in base salary or annual bonus opportunity; (ii) a material diminution in authority, duties, or responsibilities (including status, offices, titles and reporting requirements); (iii) a material change in the geographic location; (iv) the failure of the Company to pay compensation or benefits when due, or (v) any other action or inaction that constitutes a material breach by the Company of the change in control agreement. 
  "change in control" generally means any one of the following events: (a) any person becoming the beneficial owner of thirty percent (30%) or more of Company's voting securities (other than as a result of certain issuances or open market purchases approved by incumbent directors); (b) the Company's incumbent directors ceasing to constitute at least a majority of the board of directors; (c) the stockholders of the Company approving a reorganization, merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or similar form of corporate transaction, or the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, unless immediately following such transaction, (i) all or substantially all of the beneficial owners of the Company's voting securities prior to such transaction are the beneficial owners of more than 50% of the combined voting power of the securities of the surviving entity in the transaction, (ii) no person is the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the combined voting power of the surviving entity in the transaction and (iii) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the surviving entity are incumbent directors; or (d) approval by the Company's stockholders of a complete liquidation and dissolution of the Company.

Long-Term Incentive Awards
The award agreements under which our stock option, PRSU and RSU awards were issued describe the circumstances under which the awards will vest (or become non-forfeitable), if earlier than the stated date. The following is a general summary of the provisions of awards that are unvested at December 31, 2018. Upon the death or disability of a participant, a prorated portion of the award will generally vest. Upon a termination without cause, a similar prorated portion of the award will generally vest. Also, a participant is eligible for prorated vesting if the participant is at the time of retirement at least 55 years of age and has at least 10 years of service with the Company (for Mr. Rohr, 65 years of age and at least 5 years of service; provided that his 2018 time-based RSU has continued vesting after retirement). For PRSUs, proration upon retirement is based on service over the applicable performance period. Prorated PRSUs remain subject to actual performance results in case of termination without cause or retirement, and are vested at target in case of death or disability. Unvested awards are forfeited upon a termination with cause or voluntary resignation. In the case of a change in control, all awards granted since 2009 are "double trigger" – if a change in control occurs, the award is continued or replaced with an award of comparable value, and the participant is subsequently terminated, then the portion of the award that was unvested at the time of termination will be accelerated. If in connection with a change in control the participant's rights in the award are adversely affected (i.e., such as by the award not being continued) and the award is not replaced with an award of comparable value, then the unvested portion of the award would be accelerated upon the change in control without requiring termination of employment. PRSUs would vest at the greater of target level or estimated actual performance if otherwise payable upon a change in control. 
Long-term incentive awards granted in 2010, 2011 and a portion of 2012 generally have a hold requirement for a portion of the shares received upon vesting of PRSUs or RSUs or upon the exercise of stock options. Under the hold requirement, a specified percentage of the award is held after the applicable vesting date as vested RSUs, to be settled by delivery of shares at the seventh anniversary of the grant date (or earlier in the event of death, disability or change in control). During the hold period, the vested RSUs are credited with cash dividends to be paid (without interest) at the end of the hold period. If during the hold period the participant's employment is terminated by the Company for cause (as defined in the award agreement) or the participant breaches the applicable clawback 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 71 
       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
agreement with the Company, the RSUs subject to the hold requirement are forfeited and canceled without consideration. In the event of a change in control, all shares subject to the hold requirement would be delivered to the participant. In the event of certain other termination scenarios, the hold requirement would survive, and the shares would be delivered on the date they would have otherwise been delivered had the participant remained an employee. The hold requirement was eliminated from future equity awards during 2012.
Under such long-term incentive award agreements, a "change in control" of the Company generally means, in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(5), any of the following: (i) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires ownership of stock of the Company that, together with stock held by such person or group, constitutes more than 50% of the total voting power of the stock of the Company; (ii) a majority of members of the board is replaced during any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by a majority of the members of the board prior to the date of the appointment or election; (iii) any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, acquires (or has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent acquisition by such person or persons) assets from the Company that have a total gross fair market value equal to 50% of more of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to such acquisition or acquisitions; or (iv) certain other business transactions affecting the Company. 
Post-Termination Table
The table below shows an estimate of the amount of additional compensation that each of our named executive officers employed by us at year end would receive in the event of a termination or change in control, taking into consideration the circumstances of the termination and payments that the named executive officer would be entitled to under the various agreements described above. The amounts shown are generally categorized as follows: voluntary termination or termination for cause; involuntary termination without cause or by the executive for good reason; termination due to death or disability; qualified retirement (if eligible); and change in control (with and without termination). The amounts shown assume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, but with reference to stock values on December 31, 2018, the last trading day of the year. On December 31, 2018, the closing price of our Common Stock was $89.97 per share.
The table below includes additional benefits triggered by a termination and change in control only. Please see the following tables for details of the named executives' vested payments and benefits that they would be entitled to receive regardless of the occurrence of a termination or change of control:
• For Stock Options/PRSUs/RSUs – See "Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year 2018 End Table";
• For Pension Benefits – See "2018 Pension Benefits Table"; and
• For Nonqualified Deferred Compensation – See "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table".
The actual amounts that will be paid upon termination can only be determined at the time of the named executive officer's termination from the Company. The following table shows the potential payments to our named executive officers, upon termination or change in control.

(1)  Paid pursuant to the Severance Plan and change in control agreements, as applicable and discussed above. 
(2)  Time-based RSUs vest in full upon a change in control if the award is adversely affected and is not replaced with an award of equivalent economic value. The numbers presented in the change in control scenarios assume that the awards are adversely affected and not replaced with an award of equivalent economic value. To the extent the awards are replaced with awards of equivalent economic value and the executive remained employed following a change in control, the numbers shown in the Change in Control – Without Termination column above would be different.

In the event of other eligible termination events, generally a prorated amount will vest based on the portion of the service period that has lapsed.

(3)  Upon a change in control, 2016 / 2017 / 2018 PRSUs vest at the greater of target or estimated actual performance (200% for 2016 and 2017 and target performance for 2018 has been assumed) if the award is adversely affected and is not replaced with an award of equivalent economic value. The numbers presented in the change in control scenarios assume that the awards are adversely affected and not replaced with an award of equivalent economic value.

In the event of death and disability, a prorated amount will vest based on estimated performance of 200% of target for the 2016 and 2017 PRSUs and at target for the 2018 PRSUs. If the executive is terminated without cause, a prorated amount will vest based on actual performance.  In the event the executive retires (minimum 10 years of service and age 55 or later (5 years of service and age 65 for Mr. Rohr)), a prorated amount of the 2017 and 2018 PRSUs will vest and the full amount of the 2016 PRSUs will vest, in each case based on actual performance.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  None of the named executive officers is entitled to any tax gross-up upon a change-in-control. 
(5)  Represents reimbursement of premiums for 18 months for Messrs Rohr, Sutton and Edwards, 24 months for Mr. Richardson and Ms. Jurecka, and 12 months for Mr. Oliver, of medical and dental coverage continuation upon a change in control as applicable, and the payment of COBRA premiums for a period of one year (18 months for Mr. Rohr) from the date of termination under our Severance Plan, each based on 2019 rates. 
(6)  Upon termination by the Company without cause, each executive is entitled to up to $16,200 in outplacement services. 
(7)  The executives' change in control agreements provide for a "best net" feature which would reduce the parachute payments to the safe-harbor limit if it is more financially advantageous to the executive on an after-tax basis (taking into consideration federal, state and local income taxes, and the imposition of the excise tax). In the event it is more advantageous for the executive's payments to be reduced, the Company shall reduce or eliminate the payments by first reducing or eliminating those payments which are not payable in cash and then by reducing or eliminating cash payments in each case in reverse order of when they would have otherwise been paid.

• Restrictive and Cooperating Covenants:  Mr. Edwards agreed (1) for a period of two years after the Separation Date not to compete with the Company, or to solicit or hire former employees of the Company, and (2) to keep information concerning the Company confidential. Mr. Edwards agreed to cooperate with the Company as necessary after the Separation Date, including being available for conference calls and assisting with pending litigation and claims. 
• Release: The Agreement also provided for a general release by Mr. Edwards of any and all claims that he may have against the Company. 
• Vesting and Settlement of Equity Awards:  Mr. Edwards' outstanding equity awards generally were forfeited in accordance with their terms upon the Separation Date.  However, to facilitate a smooth transition of his role and as consideration for the covenants and release described above, the management and compensation committee agreed to permit pro rata vesting of the final tranche of a time-vesting RSU award originally granted to him in 2017 when he was first hired.  
• Pension, Welfare and Other Benefits:  Mr. Edwards was entitled to continue participation in the Company's welfare benefit plans until January 31, 2019, and was entitled to receive two months of Company-paid health and dental coverage via COBRA.  Mr. Edwards will continue to be entitled to his accrued benefits under the Company's employee benefit and pension plans and policies in which he participates, independent of the Agreement.  Mr. Edwards was entitled to receive the 2018 annual incentive plan bonus which he had earned by virtue of his service through December 31, 2018, payable in March 2019.

       Executive Compensation   
[END TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of SEC Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mark C. Rohr, our chairman, chief executive officer and president.
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our company (other than our CEO), was $81,180; and 
• the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table presented elsewhere in this Proxy Statement, was $12,514,160.  
• based on this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Rohr, our CEO, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 154 to 1.  
[END TABLE]
To identify the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees and as permitted by SEC rules, we used the same median employee for 2018 as we identified for 2017, because there have been no significant changes to our workforce or pay design for 2018 that we believe would significantly change our CEO pay ratio results, excluding for this purpose the employees acquired as a result of the Omni Plastics acquisition that closed on February 1, 2018 (approximately 95 employees).  The following briefly describes the process we used to identify our median employee for 2017, based on our employee population as of November 1, 2017:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We selected November 1, 2017 as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee" to allow sufficient time to identify the median employee given the global scope of our operations. 
• We determined that, as of November 1, 2017, our employee population for pay ratio disclosure purposes consisted of approximately 7,597  individuals.  We did not exclude any employees working outside of the U.S. and we did not use any statistical sampling techniques.  However, we did exclude approximately 349 employees formerly employed by Nilit Plastics, who became our employees as a result of an acquisition that closed on May 3, 2017. 
• To identify the median employee from our employee population, we used total compensation reflected in our payroll records as reported to the various taxing authorities, generally consisting of salary, wages, overtime, bonus, health and welfare benefits, and long-term incentive taxable compensation for those employees. 
• In making these determinations, we annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who were hired in 2017 but did not work for us or our consolidated subsidiaries for the entire fiscal year. We did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the median employee. 
[END TABLE]
The CEO pay ratio reported above is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on the methodologies and assumptions described above, which were chosen from a wide range of permissible methodologies, estimates and assumptions.  As a result, the CEO pay ratios reported by other companies, which may have employed other permitted methodologies or assumptions, and which may have a significantly different work force structure from ours, are likely not comparable to our CEO pay ratio.

AUDIT MATTERS
Audit Committee Report
The audit committee is composed of four independent directors, each of whom satisfies the independence requirement of Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The audit committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the external reporting process and the Company's internal controls. The audit committee serves as the primary communication link between the board, the independent public accounting firm, and our internal auditors.
Company management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of disclosure controls and procedures and the internal control over financial reporting. The independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and expressing an opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
The audit committee reviewed and discussed with the Company's management and KPMG LLP the audited financial statements for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2018. The audit committee also met with KPMG LLP and the internal auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of the auditors' examinations, their evaluation of our internal control, and the overall quality of our financial reporting. The audit committee also discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB"). In addition, the audit committee discussed with KPMG LLP its independence from the Company and management and received from KPMG LLP the written disclosures required by PCAOB Rules regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the audit committee concerning independence.
The audit committee discussed with KPMG LLP and the internal auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The audit committee reviewed and discussed the fees billed to the Company by KPMG LLP for audit, audit-related, tax and other services provided during fiscal 2018, which are set forth under "Item 3: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm", and determined that the provision of non-audit services is compatible with KPMG LLP's independence. Based on the audit committee's reviews and discussions described above, the audit committee recommended to the board of directors that the audited consolidated financial statements for the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
The audit committee evaluates the performance of the independent registered public accounting firm each year and determines whether to re-engage the current firm or consider other audit firms. In doing so, the audit committee considers the quality and efficiency of the services provided by the registered public accounting firm, along with their capabilities, technical expertise, and knowledge of our operations and industry. Based on these evaluations, the audit committee decided to engage KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal 2019. Although the audit committee has the sole authority to appoint the independent registered public accounting firm, the audit committee has continued its long-standing practice of recommending that the board ask our stockholders to ratify the appointment of the registered public accounting firm at our annual meeting of stockholders. This report was submitted by the current members of the audit committee,

The audit committee report does not constitute soliciting material, and shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates the audit committee report by reference therein.
ITEM 3: Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
The audit committee of the board of directors has selected KPMG LLP to audit the Company's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 2019. Since 2004, KPMG LLP has served as our independent registered public accounting firm and also provided other audit-related and non-audit services that were approved by the audit committee.  In addition, the current lead partner assigned to the Company's audit has held such position since 2017 and, unless removed by the audit committee, is expected to continue through 2021, when he would rotate off in accordance with SEC requirements.
Representatives of KPMG LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders.
We are asking our stockholders to ratify the selection of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm. Although ratification is not required by our by-laws or otherwise, the board is submitting the audit committee's selection of KPMG LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. If the appointment of KPMG LLP is not ratified, the audit committee will evaluate the basis for the stockholders' vote when determining whether to continue the firm's engagement.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy    
The audit committee is responsible for appointing, retaining and pre-approving the fees of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee has adopted a Policy for Pre-Approval of Independent Auditor Services ("Pre-Approval Policy") pursuant to which proposed services may be pre-approved through the application of detailed policies and procedures ("general pre-approval") or by specific review of each service ("specific pre-approval"). The audit committee has provided general pre-approval for certain specific types of non-prohibited audit, audit-related and tax services that do not exceed $200,000 per project and $1,000,000 per year in the aggregate and gives detailed guidance to management as to the specific services that are eligible for general pre-approval. The audit committee is to be informed on a timely basis of any services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to general pre-approval. Unless a type of service is included in this general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval. The annual audit services engagement terms and fees must be specifically pre-approved by the audit committee. Requests to provide services that require specific pre-approval must be submitted to the audit committee by both the independent registered public accounting firm and the chief financial officer or corporate controller, and must include detailed back-up documentation and a joint statement as to whether the request or application is consistent with the SEC's rule on auditor independence.
The audit committee may delegate its pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting.
All services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm in 2018 were pre-approved by the audit committee or otherwise under the Pre-Approval Policy.
Vote Required
Although ratification is not required in our by-laws or otherwise, approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote.

       Management Proposal   
[END TABLE]
MANAGEMENT PROPOSAL
ITEM 4: Approval of the Amendment of our Certificate of Incorporation 
Background and Reasons for the Approval
The Proposed Amendment
On February 6, 2019, our board of directors approved and declared advisable an amendment of Article VII, Section 7.3 of our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as it has been previously amended (the "Restated Certificate"), that would:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• eliminate from such Section 7.3 (i) the currently inoperative clause under which the Company's stockholders could remove directors of the Company with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of a majority in the voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors (the "Voting Power") and (ii) the clause that provided that when Blackstone was not the beneficial owner of at least 50.1% of the Voting Power, the stockholders could remove directors "only for cause" and upon an affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power (the "Subject Clauses"); and 
• provide that the stockholders of the Company may remove any or all of the Company's directors without cause, as well as with cause, upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power (collectively, the "Amendment"). 
[END TABLE]
The board has recommended that the Amendment be adopted by the Company's stockholders at the Annual Meeting. The text of the proposed Amendment comparing current Section 7.3 to the proposed amended Section 7.3 by virtue of the Amendment is included as Exhibit B to this Proxy Statement.
Reasons for Amendment
Second 7.3 of the Restated Certificate currently limits the removal of directors to "only for cause"  "if at any time Blackstone no longer is the beneficial owner, in the aggregate, of at least 50.1% in voting power of all shares entitled to vote generally in the election of directors."  Blackstone does not currently own a controlling interest in the Company.  Thus, the "only for cause" removal provision is operative. However, under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), a corporation may not limit the removal of directors to "for cause" only unless the corporation has either a classified (staggered) board of directors or cumulative voting. As of the date of the Annual Meeting, the Company will no longer have a classified board of directors.  The Company does not have cumulative voting. In light of the elimination of the Company's classified board structure and the fact that the Company does not have cumulative voting, our board of directors resolved that it is advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to amend Section 7.3 of the Restated Certificate to eliminate the Subject Clauses, which became unnecessary to Section 7.3 upon Blackstone ceasing to hold at least 50.1% of the Voting Power, and to give the stockholders the right to remove directors without cause upon the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the Voting Power. If the Amendment is adopted by the stockholders and becomes effective, any or all of the members of the board of directors may be removed, with or without cause, by the holders of at least 80% of the Voting Power of the outstanding stock then entitled to vote in an election of directors.
General Effects of the Amendment Proposal
If the proposed Amendment is approved at the Annual Meeting, a certificate of amendment including the provisions of the Amendment conforming to the DGCL will be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and would be effective upon filing with the Secretary of State. Following the filing of the certificate of amendment, the stockholders will be able to remove directors of the Company with, or without, cause as provided in the Amendment. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Celanese 2019  /  Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement  / 81 
       Management Proposal   
[END TABLE]
The Amendment may be viewed as increasing the accountability of the Company's directors to stockholders by providing stockholders with the opportunity to remove directors without cause. 
We do not foresee any risks with respect to the Amendment.  In addition, there will be no U.S. Federal income tax consequences to the Company or stockholders as a result of the Amendment.
No Appraisal Rights
Stockholders have no rights under the DGCL or under our Restated Certificate to exercise dissenters' or appraisal rights with respect to the Amendment.
Vote Required
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80% of the voting power of all shares of the Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company is required to approve the proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Shares of Common Stock represented by properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions indicated thereon. In the absence of specific instructions, properly executed, timely received and unrevoked proxies will be voted "FOR" the proposal.

       Questions and Answers about the Annual Meeting   
[END TABLE]
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
Proxy Materials and Voting Information
1. What is included in the proxy materials? What is a proxy statement and what is a proxy? 
The proxy materials for our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Annual Meeting") include the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report. If you received a paper copy of these materials, the proxy materials also include a proxy card or voting instruction form. 
A proxy statement is a document that SEC regulations require us to give you when we ask you to sign a proxy designating individuals to vote on your behalf. A proxy is your legal designation of another person to vote the Common Stock you own. That other person is called a proxy. 
If you designate someone as your proxy in a written document, that document also is called a proxy or a proxy card. We have designated two of our officers as proxies for the Annual Meeting. These two officers are Scott A. Richardson and James R. Peacock III.
The form of proxy and this Proxy Statement have been approved by the board of directors and are being provided to stockholders by its authority.
2. What is the difference between holding shares as a stockholder of record and as a beneficial owner? 
If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's registrar and transfer agent, Computershare Trust Company, N.A. ("Computershare"), you are considered a stockholder of record with respect to those shares. If your shares are held in a bank or brokerage account, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares.
3. What shares are included on the proxy card?
If you are a stockholder of record, you will receive only one notice or proxy card for all the shares of Common Stock you hold in certificate form and in book-entry form and in any Company benefit plan. 
If you are a Company employee and hold shares of Common Stock in our 401(k) savings plan, it is important that you direct the plan's administrator how to vote your shares. If you hold shares of Common Stock in the Celanese Americas Retirement Savings Plan administered by Empower Retirement or a successor and do not vote your shares or specify your voting instructions on your proxy card, the administrator of the plan will vote your shares in the same proportion as the shares for which they have received voting instructions. To allow sufficient time for voting by the administrators, your voting instructions must be received by April 15, 2019.
If you are a beneficial owner, you will receive voting instruction information from the bank, broker or other nominee through which you own your shares of Common Stock.
4. What different methods can I use to vote? 
See page 3 for additional information about how to vote. 
By Telephone or Internet. All stockholders of record can submit a proxy through the Internet, using the procedures and instructions described on the notice or proxy card, or by touchtone telephone within the U.S., U.S. territories and Canada, using the toll-free telephone number on the notice or proxy card. Beneficial owners may submit a proxy 
[BEGIN TABLE]

       Questions and Answers about the Annual Meeting   
[END TABLE]
through the Internet or by telephone if their bank, broker or other nominee makes those methods available, in which case the bank, broker or other nominee will include the instructions with the proxy materials. The Internet and telephone proxy submission procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to submit their proxies and to confirm that their voting instructions have been recorded properly. 
By Written Proxy. All stockholders of record can submit their voting instructions by written proxy card. If you are a stockholder of record and receive a notice regarding the availability of proxy materials, you may request a written proxy card by following the instructions included in the notice. If you are a beneficial owner, you may request a written proxy card or a voting instruction form from your bank, broker or other nominee. 
In Person. All stockholders of record may vote in person at the meeting. Beneficial owners may also vote in person at the meeting if they have a legal proxy, as described in the response to question 20.
If you have questions or require assistance with voting your shares, or if you need additional copies of the proxy materials, please contact Alliance Advisors, LLC, 200 Broadacres Drive, 3rd Floor, Bloomfield, New Jersey 07003. Stockholders may call toll free: (855) 486-7908.

6. What if I am a stockholder of record and do not specify a choice for a matter when returning a proxy? 
Stockholders should specify their choice for each matter on the proxy card. If no specific instructions are given, proxies which are signed and returned will be voted:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● FOR the election of all director nominees as set forth in this Proxy Statement; 
● FOR the advisory vote to approve executive compensation; 
● FOR the proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as independent registered public accounting firm;  and 
● FOR the proposal to approve an amendment to our certificate of incorporation. 
[END TABLE]
7. What if I am a beneficial owner and do not give voting instructions to my broker?
As a beneficial owner, in order to ensure your shares are voted in the way you would like, you must provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee by the deadline provided in the materials you receive from your bank, broker or other nominee. If you do not provide voting instructions to your bank, broker or other nominee, whether your shares can be voted by such person depends on the type of item being considered for vote.
Non-Discretionary Items. The election of directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation, and the approval of the amendment to our certificate of inccorporation are non-discretionary items and may not be voted on by brokers, banks or other nominees who have not received specific voting instructions from beneficial owners.
Discretionary Items. The ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is a discretionary item. Generally, banks, brokers and other nominees that do not receive voting instructions from beneficial owners may vote on this proposal in their discretion.
8. How are abstentions and broker non-votes counted? 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present, but will not be included with respect to director elections and the advisory vote to approve say on pay vote totals and will not affect the outcome of the vote.  With respect to all other matters, abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as a vote against the particular proposal.
9. What can I do if I change my mind after I vote my shares?
Stockholders can revoke a proxy prior to the completion of voting at the meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
● giving written notice to the Corporate Secretary of the Company; 
● delivering a later-dated proxy; or 
● voting in person at the meeting (if you are a beneficial owner, see the response to question 20). 
[END TABLE]
10. Can I access the proxy materials on the Internet? How can I sign up for the electronic proxy delivery service?

● in the case of a contested proxy solicitation; 
● if a stockholder makes a written comment on the proxy card or otherwise communicates his or her vote to management; or  
● to allow the independent inspector of election to certify the results of the vote. 
[END TABLE]
We also will continue, as we have for many years, to retain an independent tabulator to receive and tabulate the proxies and an independent inspector of election to certify the results.
12. When will the Company announce the voting results? 
We will announce the preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting. The Company will report the final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC shortly after the meeting.
13. Does the Company have a policy about directors' attendance at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders?
The Company has a policy requiring our directors then in office to attend annual meetings of stockholders, absent good reason. All directors at the time and director nominees attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
14. How are proxies solicited and what is the cost? 
We bear all expenses incurred in connection with the solicitation of proxies. We have engaged Alliance Advisors, LLC to assist with the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $6,500. We have also agreed to reimburse Alliance Advisors, LLC for certain expenses and to indemnify Alliance Advisors, LLC against certain losses and expenses. We will reimburse brokers, fiduciaries and custodians for their costs in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners of Common Stock. 
Our directors, officers and employees also may solicit proxies by mail, telephone and personal contact. They will not receive any additional compensation for these activities.

Each beneficial owner residing at the same address will receive a voting instruction form from their bank, broker or other nominee with which to direct how that beneficial owner's shares are to be voted.  It is important that each beneficial owner receiving a voting instruction form, sign, date, and return each voting instruction form received or submit such beneficial owner's voting instructions by internet or phone if their bank, broker or other nominee makes such means of voting available, in each case, in accordance with the instructions appearing on the voting instruction form.

[END TABLE]

Proposals should be sent by mail to the Corporate Secretary, Celanese Corporation, 222 W. Las Colinas Blvd., Suite 900N, Irving, TX 75039.  As described below, separate rules apply to submissions of director nominees under our proxy access provisions.
26. How do I submit a recommendation for a director nominee?
The nominating and corporate governance committee will consider recommendations for director nominees made by stockholders. Stockholder recommendations should be sent to: Celanese Corporation, Board of Directors, 222 W. Las Colinas Blvd., Suite 900N, Irving, Texas 75039, Attn: Corporate Secretary.  Generally, recommended candidates are considered at the first or second board meeting held prior to the annual meeting of stockholders. No candidates were recommended by stockholders during 2018.
The nominating and corporate governance committee considers individuals recommended by stockholders in the same manner and to the same extent as it considers director nominees identified by other means. The chairman of the nominating and corporate governance committee will make exploratory contacts with those nominees whose skills, experiences, qualifications and personal attributes satisfy those that the nominating and corporate governance committee has identified as essential for a nominee to possess, as described above. Then, an opportunity will be arranged for the members of the nominating and corporate governance committee or as many members as can do so to meet the potential nominee. The nominating and corporate governance committee will then select a nominee to recommend to the board of directors for consideration and appointment. Board members appointed in this manner will serve, absent unusual circumstances, until their election by our stockholders at the next annual meeting of stockholders. 
Nominations of up to a specified number of directors may also be made by one or more eligible holders under the "Proxy Access" provisions of our by-laws. See "Board and Committee Governance" on page 16.

[END TABLE]
Exhibit A
Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures
Definitions and Rationale
This Proxy Statement contains information regarding Adjusted EBIT, Operating EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company. These measures are not recognized in U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to U.S. GAAP measures of performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to stockholders, investors, analysts and other parties as the Company believes them to be important supplemental measures for assessing our financial and operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to net earnings (loss), operating profit (loss), cash flow from operating activities, earnings per share or any other GAAP financial measure. The method of calculation of the following non-GAAP financial measures may be different from other companies' methods for calculating measures with the same or similar titles. Investors and analysts should understand how another company calculates such non-GAAP financial measures before comparing the other company's non-GAAP financial measures to any of our own. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive or projections of future results.
Adjusted EBIT is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense and taxes, and further adjusted for Certain Items. We believe that adjusted EBIT provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of unusual, non-operational or restructuring-related activities that affect comparability. Our management recognizes that adjusted EBIT has inherent limitations because of the excluded items. Adjusted EBIT is one of the measures management uses for planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results and as a performance metric in the Company's incentive compensation plan. We may provide guidance on adjusted EBIT but are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted EBIT to a US GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which may be significant, is not practical. Adjusted EBIT by business segment may also be referred to by management as segment income. Adjusted EBIT margin is defined by the Company as adjusted EBIT divided by net sales. Adjusted EBIT margin has the same uses and limitations as Adjusted EBIT.
Operating EBITDA is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for Certain Items, which Certain Items include accelerated depreciation and amortization expense. Operating EBITDA is equal to adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. We believe that Operating EBITDA provides transparent and useful information to investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating our operating performance relative to our peer companies. Operating EBITDA margin is defined by the Company as Operating EBITDA divided by net sales. Operating EBITDA margin has the same uses and limitations as Operating EBITDA.
Adjusted earnings per share is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, Certain Items, and refinancing and related expenses, divided by the number of basic common shares and dilutive restricted stock units and stock options calculated using the treasury method. We believe that adjusted earnings per share provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of the above stated items that affect comparability and as a performance metric in the Company's incentive compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
plan. We may provide guidance on adjusted earnings per share but are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted earnings per share to a GAAP financial measure without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, which may be significant, is not practical.
Note: The income tax expense (benefit) on Certain Items ("Non-GAAP adjustments") is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Non-GAAP adjustments occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit). The income tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share approximates the midpoint in a range of forecasted tax rates for the year. This range may include certain partial or full-year forecasted tax opportunities and related costs, where applicable, and specifically excludes changes in uncertain tax positions, discrete recognition of GAAP items on a quarterly basis, other pre-tax items adjusted out of our GAAP earnings for adjusted earnings per share purposes and changes in management's assessments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets for GAAP. In determining the adjusted earnings per share tax rate, we reflect the impact of foreign tax credits when utilized, or expected to be utilized, absent discrete events impacting the timing of foreign tax credit utilization. We analyze this rate quarterly and adjust it if there is a material change in the range of forecasted tax rates; an updated forecast would not necessarily result in a change to our tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share. The adjusted tax rate is an estimate and may differ from the actual tax rate used for GAAP reporting in any given reporting period. The estimated GAAP rate excludes discrete recognition of GAAP items due to our inability to forecast such items. As part of the year-end reconciliation, we will update the reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate for actual results.
Free cash flow is a liquidity measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by (used in) operations, less capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment, and adjusted for capital contributions from or distributions to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. related to our methanol joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC. We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating the Company's liquidity and credit quality assessment because it provides an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of our business. Although we use free cash flow as a measure to assess the liquidity generated by our business, the use of free cash flow has important limitations, including that free cash flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness, lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or pension and postretirement funding obligations.
The most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP in our consolidated financial statements for adjusted EBIT and operating EBITDA is net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, for adjusted earnings per share is earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation per common share-diluted, and for free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operations.
