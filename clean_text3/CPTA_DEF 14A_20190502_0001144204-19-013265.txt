PROXY STATEMENT 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders
​
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of Capitala Finance Corp. ("Capitala Finance," the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") for use at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on May 2, 2019 at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, at the Company's office located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209 and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. This Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card and the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, are first being sent to stockholders on or about March 18, 2019. 
We encourage you to vote your shares, either by voting in person at the Meeting or by granting a proxy (i.e., authorizing someone to vote your shares). If you properly sign and date the accompanying proxy card or vote through the Internet, and the Company receives it in time for voting at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies will vote your shares in the manner that you specify. If you give no instructions on the proxy card, the shares covered by the proxy card will be voted FOR the election of the nominees as directors and FOR the other matter listed in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
If you are a "stockholder of record" (i.e., you hold shares directly in your name), you may revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised by notifying the proxy tabulator, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC ("AST"), in writing, by submitting a properly executed, later-dated proxy, or by voting in person at the Meeting. Please send your notification to Capitala Finance Corp., c/o American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11219, and submit a properly executed, later-dated proxy or vote in person at the Meeting. Any stockholder of record attending the Meeting may vote in person whether or not he or she has previously voted his or her shares. If your shares are held for your account by a broker, bank or other institution or nominee ("Broker Shares"), you may vote such shares at the Meeting only if you obtain proper written authority from your institution or nominee and present it at the Meeting. All of our directors are encouraged to attend the Meeting. Stockholders have no dissenters' or appraisal rights in connection with any of the proposals described herein. 
Stockholders of record may also vote via the Internet. Specific instructions to be followed by stockholders of record interested in voting via the Internet are shown on the enclosed proxy card. The Internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate the stockholder's identity and to allow stockholders to vote their shares and confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. 
Purpose of Meeting
At the Meeting, you will be asked to vote on the following proposals: 
1.
To elect two directors of the Company, who will each serve for a term of three years, or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified; 
​
2.
To approve a proposal to authorize the Company to sell shares of its common stock at a price or prices below the Company's then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings, in each case subject to the approval of its board of directors and compliance with the conditions set forth in the proxy statement (including, without limitation, that the number of shares issued does not exceed 25% of the Company's then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering); and 
​
3.
To transact such other business as may properly come before the Meeting.
​
​ ​
Voting Securities
You may vote your shares, in person or by proxy, at the Meeting only if you were a stockholder of record at the close of business on February 25, 2019 (the "Record Date"). There were 16,061,817 shares of the Company's common stock outstanding on the Record Date. Each share of the common stock is entitled to one vote. 
Quorum Required
A quorum must be present at the Meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders entitled to cast a majority of the shares of common stock of the Company entitled to be cast on the Record Date will constitute a quorum. Abstentions will be treated as shares present for quorum purposes. Broker Shares for which a nominee has not received voting instructions from the record holder and does not have discretionary authority to vote the shares on certain proposals (which are considered "Broker Non-Votes" with respect to such proposals) are not permitted, under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange, for "non-routine matters". Each of the proposals in this Proxy Statement is considered a "non-routine matter"; accordingly, there will be no Broker Non-Votes at the Meeting. If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, the stockholders who are represented may adjourn the Meeting until a quorum is present. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
Vote Required
Election of Directors.   The election of a director requires the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Meeting in person or by proxy. Stockholders may not cumulate their votes. If you vote "Withhold Authority" with respect to a nominee, your shares will not be voted with respect to the person indicated. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have no effect on this proposal. 
Approval of a Proposal to Authorize the Company to Sell Shares of its Common Stock at a Price or Prices Below the Company's then Current Net Asset Value Per Share in One or More Offerings, in Each Case Subject to the Approval of its Board of Directors and Compliance with the Conditions Set Forth in the Proxy Statement (Including, Without Limitation, that the Number of Shares Issued Does Not Exceed 25% of the Company's then Outstanding Common Stock Immediately Prior to Each Such Offering).   The affirmative vote of  (1) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting; and (2) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Meeting that are not held by affiliated persons of the Company is required to approve this proposal. For purposes of this proposal, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), defines "a majority of the outstanding shares" as: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at the Meeting if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy; or (2) 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, whichever is the less. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. 
Additional Solicitation.   If there are not enough votes to approve any proposals at the Meeting, stockholders who are represented may adjourn the Meeting to permit the further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote those proxies for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against any proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
Also, a stockholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if there are sufficient votes for approval of such proposal(s). ​
Information Regarding This Solicitation 
The Company's board of directors is making this proxy solicitation. The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting, which is estimated to be approximately $40,000, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and proxy card. If brokers, trustees, or fiduciaries and other institutions or nominees holding shares in their names, or in the name of their nominees, which are beneficially owned by others, forward the proxy materials to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, the Company will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing. In addition, the Company will indemnify them against any losses arising out of that firm's proxy soliciting services on the Company's behalf. 
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by the use of the mail, proxies may be solicited in person and/or by telephone or facsimile transmission by directors, officers or employees of the Company and/or officers or employees of Capitala Investment Advisors, LLC ("Capitala Investment Advisors"), the Company's investment adviser. Capitala Investment Advisors and Capitala Advisors Corp. (the "Administrator"), the Company's administrator, are both located at 4201 Congress Street, Suite 360, Charlotte, North Carolina 28209. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or regular employees of the Company or Capitala Investment Advisors for such services. The Company has also retained Morrow Sodali LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting for a fee of approximately $30,000, plus reimbursement of certain out of pocket expenses. 
Stockholders may also provide their voting instructions through the Internet. This option requires stockholders to input the Control Number which is located on each proxy card. After inputting this number, stockholders will be prompted to provide their voting instructions. Stockholders will have an opportunity to review their voting instructions and make any necessary changes before submitting their voting instructions and terminating their Internet link. Stockholders who vote via the Internet, in addition to confirming their voting instructions prior to submission, will also receive an e-mail confirming their instructions upon request. 
If a stockholder wishes to participate in the Meeting, but does not wish to give a proxy electronically, the stockholder may still submit the proxy card originally sent with this Proxy Statement or attend in person. 
Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by notice from the person giving the proxy at any time before it is exercised. Any such notice of revocation should be provided in writing and signed by the stockholder in the same manner as the proxy being revoked and delivered to the Company's proxy tabulator.

PROPOSAL I: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Pursuant to the Company's charter and bylaws, the board of directors is divided into three classes. Directors are elected for a staggered term of three years each, with a term of office of one of the three classes of directors expiring each year. Each director will hold office for the term to which he is elected or until his successor is duly elected and qualified. 
Mr. Joseph B. Alala, III and Mr. H. Paul Chapman have each been nominated for election for a three year term expiring in 2022. Messrs. Alala and Chapman are not being proposed for election pursuant to any agreement or understanding between Messrs. Alala and Chapman and the Company or any other person or entity. 
A stockholder can vote for or withhold his or her vote from the nominees. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote such proxy "FOR" the election of the nominees named below. If either nominee should decline or be unable to serve as a director, it is intended that the proxy will vote for the election of such person as is nominated by the board of directors as a replacement. The board of directors has no reason to believe that the persons named above will be unable or unwilling to serve.

​
Director Independence
In accordance with rules of the NASDAQ Stock Market, our board of directors annually determines each director's independence. We do not consider a director independent unless the board of directors has determined that he has no material relationship with us. We monitor the relationships of our directors and officers through a questionnaire each director completes no less frequently than annually and updates periodically as information provided in the most recent questionnaire changes. 
Our governance guidelines require any director who has previously been determined to be independent to inform the Chairman of the board of directors, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Corporate Secretary of any change in circumstance that may cause his or her status as an independent director to change. The board of directors limits membership on the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee to independent directors. 
In order to evaluate the materiality of any such relationship, the board of directors uses the definition of director independence set forth in the rules promulgated by the NASDAQ Stock Market. Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that a director of a business development company ("BDC"), shall be considered to be independent if he or she is not an "interested person" of the Company, as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. 
The board of directors has determined that each of the directors is independent and has no relationship with us, except as a director and stockholder, with the exception of Joseph B. Alala, III, due to his position as chief executive officer the Company and as the managing partner and chief investment officer of Capitala Investment Advisors, and M. Hunt Broyhill, as a result of his indirect controlling interest in Capitala Investment Advisors.  ​
Board Leadership Structure
Our board of directors monitors and performs an oversight role with respect to the business and affairs of Capitala Finance, including with respect to investment practices and performance, compliance with regulatory requirements and the services, expenses and performance of service providers to Capitala Finance. Among other things, our board of directors approves the appointment of our investment adviser and officers, reviews and monitors the services and activities performed by our investment adviser and executive officers and approves the engagement, and reviews the performance of, our independent public accounting firm. 
Under Capitala Finance's bylaws, our board of directors may designate a chairman to preside over the meetings of the board of directors and meetings of the stockholders and to perform such other duties as may be assigned to him by the board. We do not have a fixed policy as to whether the chairman of the board should be an independent director and believe that we should maintain the flexibility to select the chairman and reorganize the leadership structure, from time to time, based on the criteria that is in the best interests of Capitala Finance and its stockholders at such times. 
Mr. Alala serves as the chairman of our board of directors. Mr. Alala is an "interested person" of Capitala Finance as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act due to his position as chief executive officer of the Company and as the managing partner and chief investment officer of Capitala Investment Advisors. We believe that Mr. Alala's history with us, familiarity with Capitala Finance's investment platform, and extensive knowledge of the financial services industry and the investment valuation process in particular qualify him to serve as the chairman of our board of directors. We believe that Capitala Finance is best served through this existing leadership structure, as Mr. Alala's relationship with Capitala Finance's investment adviser provides an effective bridge and encourages an open dialogue between management and the board of directors, ensuring that both groups act with a common purpose. 
We are aware of the potential conflicts that may arise when a non-independent director is chairman of the board, but believe these potential conflicts are offset by our strong corporate governance policies. Our corporate governance policies include regular meetings of the independent directors in executive session without the presence of interested directors and management, a designated lead independent director, the establishment of audit, nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees comprised solely of independent directors and the appointment of a chief compliance officer, with whom the independent directors meet regularly without the presence of interested directors and other members of management, for administering our compliance policies and procedures. Larry W. Carroll currently serves as designated lead independent director. 
We recognize that different board leadership structures are appropriate for companies in different situations. We intend to re-examine our corporate governance policies on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet Capitala Finance's needs. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our board of directors performs its risk oversight function primarily through (1) its three standing committees, which report to the entire board of directors and are comprised solely of independent directors, and (2) active monitoring by our chief compliance officer and our compliance policies and procedures. 
As described below in more detail under "Committees of the Board of Directors," the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee assist the board of directors in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include overseeing Capitala Finance's accounting and financial reporting processes, Capitala Finance's systems of internal controls regarding finance and accounting, Capitala Finance's valuation process, and audits of Capitala Finance's financial statements. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include selecting, researching and nominating directors for election by our stockholders, developing and recommending to the board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the board and our management. The Compensation Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include reviewing and recommending to our board of directors for approval the Investment Advisory Agreement (the "Advisory Agreement") between  ​
the Company and Capitala Investment Advisors and the Administration Agreement (the "Administration Agreement") between the Company and the Administrator, and, to the extent that we compensate our executive officers directly in the future, reviewing and evaluating the compensation of our executive officers and making recommendations to the board of directors regarding such compensation. 
Our board of directors also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of the chief compliance officer. The board of directors will annually review a written report from the chief compliance officer discussing the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of Capitala Finance and its service providers. The chief compliance officer's annual report will address, at a minimum, (a) the operation of the compliance policies and procedures of Capitala Finance and its service providers since the last report; (b) any material changes to such policies and procedures since the last report; (c) any recommendations for material changes to such policies and procedures as a result of the chief compliance officer's annual review; and (d) any compliance matter that has occurred since the date of the last report about which the board of directors would reasonably need to know to oversee our compliance activities and risks. In addition, the chief compliance officer will meet separately in executive session with the independent directors at least once each year. 
We believe that our board of directors role in risk oversight is effective, and appropriate given the extensive regulation to which we are already subject as a BDC. As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements that control the levels of risk in our business and operations. For example, our ability to incur indebtedness is limited such that our asset coverage must equal at least 200% (or 150% if certain requirements are met) if immediately after each time we incur indebtedness, we generally cannot invest in assets that are not "qualifying assets" unless at least 70% of our gross assets consist of  "qualifying assets" immediately prior to such investment, and we are not generally permitted to invest, subject to certain exceptions, in any portfolio company in which one of our affiliates currently has an investment. 
We recognize that different board roles in risk oversight are appropriate for companies in different situations. We intend to re-examine the manners in which the board administers its oversight function on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet Capitala Finance's needs. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
An Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee have been established by our board of directors. During 2019, our board of directors held four board of directors meetings, eight Audit Committee meetings, one Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting, and one Compensation Committee meeting. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the board of directors and of the respective committees on which they serve. We require each director to make a diligent effort to attend all board and committee meetings as well as each annual meeting of our stockholders. All of our directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
Audit Committee 
The Audit Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our board of directors, a copy of which is available at http://investor.capitalagroup.com/. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee's responsibilities include establishing guidelines and making recommendations to our board of directors regarding the valuation of our loans and investments, selecting the independent registered public accounting firm for Capitala Finance, reviewing with such independent registered public accounting firm the planning, scope and results of their audit of Capitala Finance's financial statements, pre-approving the fees for services performed, reviewing with the independent registered public accounting firm the adequacy of internal control systems, reviewing Capitala Finance's annual financial statements and periodic filings and receiving Capitala Finance's audit reports and financial statements. The Audit Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Chapman, Carroll and Moyer, all of whom are considered independent under the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and are not "interested persons" of Capitala Finance as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. Chapman serves as chairman of the Audit Committee. Our board of directors has determined that Mr. Chapman is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K, as promulgated under the Exchange Act. Mr. Chapman meets the current independence and experience requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act.  ​
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our board of directors, a copy of which is available at http://investor.capitalagroup.com/​. The members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. Chapman, Carroll and Moyer, all of whom are considered independent under the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and are not "interested persons" of Capitala Finance as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Dr. Moyer serves as chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for selecting, researching and nominating directors for election by our stockholders, selecting nominees to fill vacancies on the board of directors or a committee thereof, developing and recommending to the board of directors a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the board of directors and our management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently does not consider nominees recommended by our stockholders. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee seeks candidates who possess the background, skills and expertise to make a significant contribution to the board of directors, Capitala Finance and its stockholders. In considering possible candidates for election as a director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will take into account, in addition to such other factors as it deems relevant, the desirability of selecting directors who: 
 are of high character and integrity; 
​
 are accomplished in their respective fields, with superior credentials and recognition; 
​
 have relevant expertise and experience upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management; 
​
 have sufficient time available to devote to the affairs of Capitala Finance; 
​
 are able to work with the other members of the board of directors and contribute to the success of Capitala Finance; 
​
 can represent the long-term interests of Capitala Finance's stockholders as a whole; and 
​
 are selected such that the board of directors represents a range of backgrounds and experience. 
​
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying director nominees. In determining whether to recommend a director nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and discusses diversity, among other factors, with a view toward the needs of the board of directors as a whole. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee generally conceptualizes diversity expansively to include, without limitation, concepts such as race, gender, national origin, differences of viewpoint, professional experience, education, skill and other qualities that contribute to the board of directors, when identifying and recommending director nominees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee believes that the inclusion of diversity as one of many factors considered in selecting director nominees is consistent with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's goal of creating a board of directors that best serves the needs of Capitala Finance and the interests of its shareholders. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee operates pursuant to a charter approved by our board of directors, a copy of which is available on our website at http://investor.capitalagroup.com/​. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee is responsible for annually reviewing and recommending for approval to our board of directors the Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement. In addition, although we do not directly compensate our executive officers currently, to the extent that we do so in the future, the Compensation Committee would also be responsible for reviewing and evaluating their compensation and making recommendations to the board of directors regarding their compensation. Lastly, the compensation committee would produce a report on our executive compensation practices and policies for inclusion in our proxy statement if required by applicable proxy rules and regulations and, if applicable, make recommendations to the board of directors on our  ​
executive compensation practices and policies. The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage compensation consultants and to delegate their duties and responsibilities to a member or to a subcommittee of the compensation committees. The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Chapman, Carroll and Moyer, all of whom are considered independent under the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and are not "interested persons" of Capitala Finance as that term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Mr. Carroll serves as Chairman of the Compensation Committee.

(1)
For a discussion of the independent directors' compensation, see below. 
​
(2)
We do not maintain a stock or option plan, non-equity incentive plan or pension plan for our directors. 
​
Our independent directors receive an annual fee of  $50,000. They also receive $5,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending each board meeting, and also receive $5,000 plus reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending each committee meeting. In addition, the chairman of the Audit Committee receives an annual fee of  $10,000 and each chairman of any other committee receives an annual fee of $5,000 for their additional services, if any, in these capacities. No compensation is expected to be paid to directors who are "interested persons" of Capitala Finance, as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act.  ​
Compensation of Executive Officers
None of our officers receives direct compensation from Capitala Finance. However, Mr. Alala, through his financial interest in Capitala Investment Advisors, will be entitled to a portion of any investment advisory fees paid by Capitala Finance to Capitala Investment Advisors under the Advisory Agreement. Our other executive officers will be paid by our Administrator, subject to reimbursement by us of our allocable portion of such compensation for services rendered by such persons to Capitala Finance under the Administration Agreement. To the extent that our Administrator outsources any of its functions, we will reimburse our Administrator for the fees associated with such functions without profit or benefit to our Administrator. 
On September 24, 2013, the Company entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement") with Capitala Investment Advisors, which was initially approved by the board of directors of the Company on June 10, 2013. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the Investment Advisory Agreement will remain in effect if approved annually by our board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, including, in either case, by a majority of our non-interested directors. The Investment Advisory Agreement was re-approved by the board of directors of the Company, including by a majority of our non-interested directors, on July 26, 2018. Subject to the overall supervision of our board of directors, Capitala Investment Advisors manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory and management services to us. The Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of its assignment. The Advisory Agreement may also be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days' written notice to the other party. 
Indemnification Agreements
We have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors. The indemnification agreements are intended to provide our directors the maximum indemnification permitted under Maryland law and the 1940 Act. Each indemnification agreement provides that Capitala Finance shall indemnify the director who is a party to the agreement (an "Indemnitee"), including the advancement of legal expenses, if, by reason of his or her corporate status, the Indemnitee is, or is threatened to be, made a party to or a witness in any threatened, pending, or completed proceeding, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law and the 1940 Act. 
Certain Relationships and Transactions
We have entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with the Investment Advisor. Joseph B. Alala, our chief executive officer and chairman of our Board, is the managing partner and chief investment officer of the Investment Advisor, and M. Hunt Broyhill, a member of our Board, has an indirect controlling interest in the Investment Advisor. 
In addition, an affiliate of Capitala Investment Advisors also manages CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund IV, L.P. ("Fund IV"), a private investment limited partnership providing financing solutions to smaller and lower middle-market companies that had its first closing in March 2013 and obtained approval for its Small Business Investment Company license from the U.S. Small Business Administration in April 2013. In addition to Fund IV, affiliates of Capitala Investment Advisors may manage several affiliated funds whereby institutional limited partners in Fund IV have the opportunity to co-invest with Fund IV in portfolio investments. An affiliate of Capitala Investment Advisors also manages Capitala Private Credit Fund V, L.P. ("Fund V"), a private investment limited partnership, and a private investment vehicle (referred to herein as "Capitala Specialty Lending Corp." or "CSLC"), both of which provide financing solutions to lower middle-market and traditional middle-market companies. Capitala Investment Advisors and its affiliates may also manage other funds in the future that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. To the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and interpretation of the SEC staff, Capitala Investment Advisors and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, Capitala Investment Advisors or its affiliates may determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other funds. Any such investments will be made only to the  ​
extent permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, and consistent with Capitala Investment Advisors' allocation procedures. We expect to make, and have made, co-investments with Fund V and/or CSLC given their similar investment strategies. 
On September 10, 2015, we, CapitalSouth Partners Fund II Limited Partnership, CapitalSouth Partners SBIC Fund III, L.P., Fund V, and Capitala Investment Advisors filed an application for exemptive relief with the SEC to permit an investment fund and one or more other affiliated investment funds, including future affiliated investment funds, to participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under the 1940 Act. On June 1, 2016, the SEC issued an order (the "Order") permitting this relief. Pursuant to the Order, we are permitted to co-invest in such investment opportunities with our affiliates if a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including, but not limited to, that (1) the terms of the potential co-investment transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the potential co-investment transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our then-current investment objective and strategies. 
On August 31, 2016, the Company sold assets to CapitalSouth Partners Florida Sidecar Fund II, L.P. ("FSC II") in exchange for 100% of the partnership interests in FSC II. Concurrent with the sale of these assets to FSC II, the Company received cash consideration of  $47.6 million from an affiliated third-party purchaser in exchange for 100% of the partnership interests of FSC II. The Company's board of directors pre-approved this transaction pursuant to Section 57(f) of the 1940 Act. Our Administrator also serves as the administrator to FSC II.
The Company may invest in the same unitranche facility as Capitala Senior Loan Fund II, LLC ("CSLF II") whereby CSLF II provides the first-out portion of the unitranche facility and the Company and other lenders provide the last-out portion of the unitranche facility. Under a guarantee agreement, the Company may be required to purchase its pro-rata portion of first-out loans from CSLF II upon certain triggering events, including acceleration upon payment default of the underlying borrower. As of December 31, 2018, the Company has evaluated the fair value of the guarantee under the guidance of ASC Topic 460 — Guarantees and determined that the fair value of the guarantee is immaterial as the risk of payment default for first-out loans in CSLF II is considered remote. The maximum exposure to credit risk as of December 31, 2018 is $4.3 million and extends to the stated maturity of the underlying loans in CSLF II.
We have entered into a license agreement with Capitala Investment Advisors, pursuant to which Capitala Investment Advisors has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name "Capitala." 
We have entered into the Administration Agreement with our Administrator. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, our Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. Mr. Alala, our chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors, is the chief executive officer, president and a director of our Administrator. 
Board Consideration of the Investment Advisory Agreement
The Investment Advisory Agreement was re-approved by the board of directors of the Company, including by a majority of our non-interested directors, at an in-person meeting held on July 26, 2018. In its consideration of the re-approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement, the board of directors reviewed a significant amount of information and considered and concluded, among other things: 
 The nature, extent and quality of advisory and other services provided by Capitala Investment Advisors, including information about the investment performance of the Company relative to its stated objectives and in comparison to the performance of the Company's peer group and relevant market indices, and concluded that such advisory and other services are satisfactory and the Company's investment performance is reasonable;
​
​ ​
 The experience and qualifications of the personnel providing such advisory and other services, including information about the backgrounds of the investment personnel, the allocation of responsibilities among such personnel and the process by which investment decisions are made, and concluded that the investment personnel of Capitala Investment Advisors have extensive experience and are well qualified to provide advisory and other services to the Company; 
​
 The current fee structure, the existence of any fee waivers, and the Company's anticipated expense ratios in relation to those of other investment companies having comparable investment policies and limitations, and concluded that the current fee structure is reasonable; 
​
 The advisory fees charged by Capitala Investment Advisors to the Company and comparative data regarding the advisory fees charged by other investment advisers to business development companies with similar investment objectives, and concluded that the advisory fees charged by Capitala Investment Advisors to the Company are reasonable; 
​
 The direct and indirect costs, including for personnel and office facilities, that are incurred by Capitala Investment Advisors and its affiliates in performing services for the Company and the basis of determining and allocating these costs, and concluded that the direct and indirect costs, including the allocation of such costs, are reasonable; 
​
 Possible economies of scale arising from the Company's size and/or anticipated growth, and the extent to which such economies of scale are reflected in the advisory fees charged by Capitala Investment Advisors to the Company, and concluded that some economies of scale may be possible in the future; 
​
 Other possible benefits to Capitala Investment Advisors and its affiliates arising from their relationships with the Company, and concluded that any such other benefits were not material to Capitala Investment Advisors and its affiliates; and 
​
 Possible alternative fee structures or bases for determining fees, and concluded that the Company's current fee structure and bases for determining fees are satisfactory. 
​
Based on the information reviewed and the discussions detailed above, the board of directors, including a majority of the directors who are not "interested persons" as defined in the 1940 Act, concluded that the fees payable to Capitala Investment Advisors pursuant to the Advisory Agreement were reasonable, and comparable to the fees paid by other management investment companies with similar investment objectives, in relation to the services to be provided. The board of directors did not assign relative weights to the above factors or the other factors considered by it. Individual members of the board of directors may have given different weights to different factors. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's directors and executive officers, and any persons holding more than 10% of its common stock, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based solely upon review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 (and amendments thereto) furnished to the Company during or in respect of the year ended December 31, 2018 and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our directors, executive officers, and 10.0% or greater shareholders were satisfied in a timely manner during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee and the independent directors of the board of directors have selected Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  ​
E&Y has advised us that neither the firm nor any present member or associate of it has any material financial interest, direct or indirect, in the Company or its affiliates. It is expected that a representative of E&Y will be present at the Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if he or she chooses and will be available to answer questions.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee of our board of directors operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors. The Audit Committee is currently composed of Messrs. Chapman, Carroll and Moyer. 
Management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and the financial reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States and expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. 
Audit Firm Selection/Ratification
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, retention, oversight and termination of the Company's registered independent auditors. 
At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to decide whether to retain such firm on behalf of the Company. E&Y has been the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since September 2013. 
When conducting its latest review of E&Y, the Audit Committee actively engaged with E&Y's engagement partners and considered, among other factors: 
 the professional qualifications of E&Y and that of the lead audit partner and other key engagement members relative to the current and ongoing needs of the Company; 
​
 E&Y's historical and recent performance on the Company's audits, including the extent and quality of E&Y's communications with the Audit Committee related thereto; 
​
​ ​
 senior management's assessment of E&Y's performance; 
​
 the appropriateness of E&Y's fees relative to both efficiency and audit quality; 
​
 E&Y's independence policies and processes for maintaining its independence; 
​
 reports of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") on E&Y; 
​
 E&Y's tenure as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm and its related depth of understanding of the Company's businesses, operations and systems and the Company's accounting policies and practices; 
​
 E&Y's demonstrated professional integrity and objectivity; and 
​
 the relative benefits, challenges, overall advisability and potential impact of selecting a different independent registered public accounting firm. 
​
As a result of this evaluation, the Audit Committee approved the appointment of E&Y for 2019. 
Audit Engagement Partner Selection 
Under SEC rules and E&Y's practice, the lead engagement audit partner is required to change every five years, and a new lead audit partner was appointed in 2018. 
Pre-Approval Policy
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by E&Y. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the auditor's independence. Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval, irrespective of the amount, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to management. The Audit Committee preapproved 100% of services described in this policy. 
Review with Management
The Audit Committee has reviewed the audited financial statements and met and held discussions with management regarding the audited financial statements. Management has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
Review and Discussion with Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with E&Y, with and without management present. The Audit Committee included in its review results of E&Y's examinations, the Company's internal controls, and the quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed the Company's procedures and internal control processes designed to ensure full, fair and adequate financial reporting and disclosures, including procedures for certifications by the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer that are required in periodic reports filed by the Company with the SEC. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Company's internal control system is adequate and that the Company employs appropriate accounting and auditing procedures. 
The Audit Committee also has discussed with E&Y matters relating to E&Y's assessment about the quality, as well as the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting as required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard 16 (Communications with Audit Committees). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with E&Y their  ​
independence from management and the Company, as well as the matters in the written disclosures received from E&Y and required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committee Concerning Independence). The Audit Committee received a letter from E&Y confirming their independence and discussed it with them. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with E&Y the Company's critical accounting policies and practices, other material written communications to management, and the scope of E&Y's audits and all fees paid to E&Y during the fiscal year. The Audit Committee has adopted guidelines requiring review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services performed by E&Y for the Company. The Audit Committee has reviewed and considered the compatibility of E&Y's performance of non-audit services with the maintenance of E&Y's independence as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Conclusion 
Based on the Audit Committee's discussion with management and the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee's review of the audited financial statements, the representations of management and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm to the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee recommended that the board of directors include the audited financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also recommended the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

PROPOSAL II: APPROVAL TO AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY TO SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OR PRICES BELOW THE COMPANY'S THEN CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE PROXY STATEMENT.
The Company is a closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act prohibits the Company from selling shares of its common stock at a price below the then current net asset value ("NAV") per share of such stock, exclusive of sales compensation, unless its stockholders approve such a sale and the Company's board of directors makes certain determinations. Shares of the Company's common stock have traded from time to time at a price below their NAV since they have begun trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on September 25, 2013. 
Pursuant to this provision, the Company is seeking the approval of its common stockholders so that it may, in one or more public or private offerings of its common stock, sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock, not exceeding 25% of its then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering, at a price below its then current NAV, subject to certain conditions discussed below. The Company's board of directors believes that having the flexibility for the Company to sell its common stock below NAV in certain instances is in the best interests of stockholders. If the Company were unable to access the capital markets as attractive investment opportunities arise, the Company's ability to grow over time and continue to pay dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected. 
While the Company has no immediate plans to sell shares of its common stock below NAV, it is seeking stockholder approval now in order to maintain access to the markets if the Company determines it should sell shares of common stock below NAV. These sales typically must be undertaken quickly. The final terms of any such sale will be determined by the board of directors at the time of sale. Also, because the Company has no immediate plans to sell any shares of its common stock below NAV, it is impracticable to describe the transaction or transactions in which such shares of common stock would be sold. Instead, any transaction where the Company sells such shares of common stock, including the nature and amount of consideration that would be received by the Company at the time of sale and the use of any such consideration, will be reviewed and approved by the board of directors at the time of sale. 
There will be no limit on the percentage below net asset value per share at which shares may be sold by the Company under this proposal. However, the Company does not presently intend to sell shares of its common stock at a price that is more than 20% lower than the Company's then current NAV, absent extenuating circumstances, including, but not limited to, circumstances that would require the Company to raise equity capital in order to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations. If this proposal is approved, no further authorization from the stockholders will be solicited prior to any such sale in accordance with the terms of this proposal. If approved, as required under the 1940 Act, the authorization would be effective for securities sold during a period beginning on the date of such stockholder approval and expiring on the earlier of the one year anniversary of the date of the Meeting or the date of the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Stockholders approved a similar proposal in 2017, 2016 and 2015. However, notwithstanding such stockholder approval, since the Company's initial public offering on September 25, 2013, the Company has not sold any shares of its common stock at a price below the Company's then current NAV. 
Generally, common stock offerings by BDCs are priced based on the market price of the currently outstanding shares of common stock, less a small discount of approximately 5% (which may be higher or lower depending on market conditions). Accordingly, even when shares of the Company's common stock trade at a market price below NAV, this proposal would permit the Company to offer and sell shares of its common stock in accordance with pricing standards that market conditions generally require, subject to the conditions described below in connection with any offering undertaken pursuant to this proposal. This Proxy Statement is not an offer to sell securities. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration with the SEC or an applicable exemption from SEC registration requirements. ​
1940 Act Conditions for Sales below NAV
The Company's ability to issue shares of its common stock at a price below NAV is governed by the 1940 Act. If stockholders approve this proposal, the Company will only sell shares of its common stock at a price below NAV per share if the following conditions are met: 
 a majority of the Company's directors who are not "interested persons" of the Company as defined in the 1940 Act, and who have no financial interest in the sale, shall have approved the sale and determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and 
​
 a majority of such directors, who are not interested persons of the Company, in consultation with the underwriter or underwriters of the offering if it is to be underwritten, have determined in good faith, and as of a time immediately prior to the first solicitation by or on behalf of the Company of firm commitments to purchase such securities or immediately prior to the issuance of such securities, that the price at which such securities are to be sold is not less than a price which closely approximates the market value of those securities, less any underwriting commission or discount, which could be substantial. 
​
Board Approval
On February 28, 2019, the Company's board of directors, including a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the directors who have no financial interest in this proposal and a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, approved this proposal as in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and is recommending that the Company's stockholders vote in favor of this proposal to offer and sell shares of the Company's common stock at prices that may be less than NAV. In evaluating this proposal, the Company's board of directors, including a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of the directors who have no financial interest in this proposal and a majority of the directors who are not interested persons of the Company, considered and evaluated factors including the following, as discussed more fully below: 
 possible long-term benefits to the Company's stockholders; and 
​
 possible dilution to the Company's NAV 
​
Prior to approving this proposal, the Company's board of directors met to consider and evaluate information that our management provided on the merits of our possibly raising additional capital and the merits of publicly offering shares of the Company's common stock at a price below NAV. The Company's board of directors considered the objectives of a possible offering, the mechanics of an offering, establishing size parameters for an offering, the possible effects of dilution, common stock trading volume, and other matters, including that the Company's common stock has traded both above and below NAV since the Company's initial public offering. The board of directors evaluated a full range of offering sizes. However, the board of directors has not yet drawn any definite conclusions regarding the size of a contemplated capital raise at this time, to the extent the Company's common stock were to continue to trade below NAV. In determining whether or not to offer and sell common stock, including below NAV, the board of directors has a duty to act in the Company's and its stockholders' best interests and must comply with the other requirements of the 1940 Act. 
Reasons to Offer Common Stock below NAV
The Company's board of directors believes that having the flexibility for the Company to sell its common stock below NAV in certain instances is in the Company's best interests and the best interests of its stockholders. If the Company were unable to access the capital markets when attractive investment opportunities arise, the Company's ability to grow over time and to continue to pay dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected. In reaching that conclusion, the Company's board of directors considered the following possible benefits to its stockholders: 
Current Market Conditions Have Created Attractive Opportunities
Current market opportunities have created, and we believe will continue to create for the foreseeable future, favorable opportunities to invest, including opportunities that, all else being equal, may increase the Company's NAV over the longer-term, even if financed with the issuance of common stock below NAV.  ​
Stockholder approval of this proposal, subject to the conditions set forth in this proxy statement, is expected to provide the Company with the flexibility to invest in such opportunities. We believe that current market conditions provide attractive opportunities to use capital. 
Market conditions also have beneficial effects for capital providers, including reduced competition, more favorable pricing of credit risk, more conservative capital structures and more creditor-friendly contractual terms. Accordingly, we believe that the Company could benefit from access to capital in this constrained credit market and that the current environment should provide attractive investment opportunities. The Company's ability to take advantage of these opportunities will depend upon its access to capital. 
Greater Investment Opportunities Due to Larger Capital Resources
The Company's board of directors believes that additional capital raised through an offering of shares of its common stock may help it generate additional deal flow. Based on discussions with management, the Company's board of directors believes that greater deal flow, which may be achieved with more capital, would enable the Company to be a more significant participant in the private debt and equity markets and to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Management has represented to the Company's board of directors that such investment opportunities may be funded with proceeds of an offering of shares of the Company's common stock. However, management has not identified specific companies in which to invest the proceeds of an offering given that specific investment opportunities will change depending on the timing of an offering, if any. 
Higher Market Capitalization and Liquidity May Make the Company's Common Stock More Attractive to Investors
If the Company issues additional shares, its market capitalization and the amount of its publicly tradable common stock will increase, which may afford all holders of its common stock greater liquidity. A larger market capitalization may make the Company's stock more attractive to a larger number of investors who have limitations of the size of companies in which they invest. Furthermore, a larger number of shares outstanding may increase the Company's trading volume, which could decrease the volatility in the secondary market price of its common stock. 
Maintenance or Possible Increase of Distributions
A larger and more diversified portfolio could provide the Company with more consistent cash flow, which may support the maintenance and growth of its distributions. The Company generally made distributions to its stockholders quarterly from the fourth quarter of 2013 through the third quarter of 2014 and began making distributions to its stockholders monthly in the fourth quarter of 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2018 the Company declared total distributions of  $1.00 per share of its common stock. Although management will continue to seek to generate income sufficient to pay the Company's distributions in the future, the proceeds of future offerings, and the investments thereof, could enable the Company to maintain and possibly grow its distributions, which may include a return of capital. 
Reduced Expenses Per Share
An offering that increases the Company's total assets may reduce its expenses per share due to the spreading of fixed expenses over a larger asset base. The Company must bear certain fixed expenses, such as certain administrative, governance and compliance costs that do not generally vary based on its size. On a per share basis, these fixed expenses will be reduced when supported by a larger asset base. 
Status as a BDC and RIC and Maintaining a Favorable Debt-to-Equity Ratio
As a BDC and a regulated investment company ("RIC") for tax purposes, the Company is dependent on its ability to raise capital through the sale of common stock. RICs generally must distribute substantially all of their earnings from dividends, interest and short-term gains to stockholders as dividends in order to achieve pass-through tax treatment, which prevents the Company from using those earnings to support new investments. Further, for the same reason BDCs, in order to borrow money or issue preferred stock, must maintain a debt to equity ratio of not more than 1:1 (or, after November 1, 2019, 2:1, if certain conditions are met), which requires the Company to finance its investments with at least as much common equity as  ​
debt and preferred stock in the aggregate. Therefore, to continue to build the Company's investment portfolio, and thereby support maintenance and growth of the Company's distributions, the Company endeavors to maintain consistent access to capital through the public and private equity markets enabling it to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise. 
Exceeding the required 1:1 (or, after November 1, 2019, 2:1, if certain conditions are met) debt-to-equity ratio would have severe negative consequences for a BDC, including an inability to pay distributions, possible breaches of debt covenants and failure to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. Although the Company does not currently expect that it will exceed the required 1:1 (or, after November 1, 2019, 2:1, if certain conditions are met) debt-to-equity ratio, the markets the Company operates in and the general economy remain volatile and uncertain. Even though the underlying performance of a particular portfolio company may not indicate impairment or an inability to repay indebtedness in full, the volatility in the debt capital markets may continue to impact the valuations of debt investments negatively and result in further unrealized write-downs of debt investments. Any such asset write-downs, as well as unrealized write-downs based on the underlying performance of the Company's portfolio companies, if any, will negatively impact its stockholders' equity and the resulting debt-to-equity ratio. Issuing new equity will improve the Company's debt-to-equity ratio. In addition to meeting legal requirements applicable to BDCs, having a more favorable debt-to-equity ratio will also generally strengthen the Company's balance sheet and give it more flexibility in its operations. 
Trading History
Shares of BDCs may trade at a market price that is less than the value of the net assets attributable to those shares. The possibility that the Company's shares of common stock will trade at a discount from net asset value, or at premiums that are unsustainable over the long term, are separate and distinct from the risk that the Company's net asset value will decrease. Since the Company's initial public offering on September 25, 2013, its shares of common stock have traded from time to time at a discount to the net assets attributable to those shares. As of February 25, 2019, the Company's shares of common stock traded at a discount equal to approximately (27.5)% of the net assets attributable to those shares based upon its net asset value as of December 31, 2018. It is not possible to predict whether the shares that may be offered pursuant to this approval will trade at, above, or below net asset value. The following table sets forth, for each fiscal quarter within the two most recent fiscal years and the current fiscal year, the range of high and low intraday sales prices for the Company's common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, the premium (discount) of sales price to the Company's net asset value (NAV) and the distributions declared by the Company for each fiscal quarter.

Key Stockholder Considerations
Dilution
Before voting on this proposal or giving proxies with regard to this matter, stockholders should consider the dilutive effect of the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock at a price that is less than the NAV per share and the expenses associated with such issuance on the NAV per outstanding share of the Company's common stock. Any sale of common stock at a price below NAV would result in an immediate dilution to existing common stockholders. This dilution would include reduction in the NAV per share as a result of the issuance of shares at a price below the NAV per share and a disproportionately greater decrease in a current stockholder's interest in the earnings and assets of the Company and voting interest in the Company than the increase in the assets of the Company resulting from such issuance. There will be no limit on the percentage below net asset value per share at which shares may be sold by the Company under this proposal. However, the Company does not presently intend to sell shares of its common stock at a price that is more than 20% lower than the Company's then current NAV, absent extenuating circumstances. The board of directors of the Company will consider the potential dilutive effect of the issuance of shares at a price below the NAV per share and will consider again such dilutive effect when considering whether to authorize any specific issuance of shares of common stock below NAV. 
In addition, stockholders should consider the risk that the approval of this proposal could cause the market price of the Company's common stock to decline in anticipation of sales of its common stock below NAV, thus causing the Company's shares to trade at a discount to NAV. The 1940 Act establishes a connection between common share sale price and NAV because, when stock is sold at a sale price below NAV per share, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares reduces net asset value per share. Stockholders should also consider that they will have no subscription, preferential or preemptive rights to additional shares of the common stock proposed to be authorized for issuance, and thus any future issuance of common stock will dilute such stockholders' holdings of common stock as a percentage of shares outstanding to the extent stockholders do not purchase sufficient shares in the offering or otherwise to maintain their percentage interest. Further, if current stockholders of the Company do not purchase any shares to maintain their percentage interest, regardless of whether such offering is above or below the then-current NAV, their voting power will be diluted. 
The precise extent of any such dilution cannot be estimated before the terms of a common stock offering are set. As a general proposition, however, the amount of potential dilution will increase as the size of the offering increases. Another factor that will influence the amount of dilution in an offering is the amount of net proceeds that we receive from such offering. The board of directors would expect that the net proceeds to us, which is typically 95% of the market price, will be equal to the price that investors pay per share less the amount of any underwriting discounts and commissions. 
As discussed above, it should be noted that the maximum number of shares issuable below NAV that could result in such dilution is limited to 25% of the Company's then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such offering. As a result, the maximum amount of dilution to existing stockholders will be limited to no more than 20% of the Company's then current NAV for each offering, assuming the Company were to issue the maximum number of shares at no more than par value, or $0.01 per share. ​
Examples of Dilutive Effect of the Issuance of Shares Below NAV
The following table illustrates the level of net asset value dilution that would be experienced by a nonparticipating stockholder in four different hypothetical offerings of different sizes and levels of discount from net asset value per share, although it is not possible to predict the level of market price decline that may occur. Actual sales prices and discounts may differ from the presentation below. 
The examples assume that Company XYZ has 1,000,000 common shares outstanding, $15,000,000 in total assets and $5,000,000 in total liabilities. The current net asset value and net asset value per share are thus $10,000,000 and $10.00, respectively. The table illustrates the dilutive effect on nonparticipating Stockholder A of  (1) an offering of 50,000 shares (5% of the outstanding shares) at $9.50 per share after underwriting discounts and commissions (a 5% discount from net asset value); (2) an offering of 100,000 shares (10% of the outstanding shares) at $9.00 per share after offering expenses and commissions (a 10% discount from net asset value); (3) an offering of 200,000 shares (20% of the outstanding shares) at $8.00 per share after underwriting discounts and commissions (a 20% discount from net asset value); and (4) an offering of 250,000 shares (25% of the outstanding shares) at $0.01 per share after underwriting discounts and commissions (a 100% discount from net asset value).

Other Considerations
In reaching its recommendation to the stockholders of the Company to approve this proposal, the board of directors considered a possible source of conflict of interest due to the fact that the proceeds from the issuance of additional shares of our common stock will increase the management fees that we pay to Capitala Investment Advisors as such fees are partially based on the amount of our gross assets, as well as the effect of the following factors: 
 the costs and benefits of a common stock offering below NAV compared to other possible means for raising capital or concluding not to raise capital; 
​
 the size of a common stock offering in relation to the number of shares outstanding; 
​
 the general condition of the securities markets; and 
​
 any impact on operating expenses associated with an increase in capital. 
​
The board of directors, including a majority of the non-interested directors who have no financial interest in this proposal, concluded that the benefits to the stockholders from increasing our capital base outweighed any detriment, including from increased management fees, especially considering that the management fees would increase regardless of whether we offer shares of common stock below NAV or above NAV, or dilution to existing stockholders. 
Potential Investors
The Company has not yet solicited any potential buyers of the shares that it may elect to issue in any future offering in order to comply with the federal securities laws. No shares are earmarked for management or other affiliated persons of the Company. However, members of management and other affiliated persons may participate in a common stock offering on the same terms as others. 
Required Vote
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of  (1) a majority of the outstanding voting securities as of the Record Date; and (2) a majority of the outstanding voting securities as of the Record Date that are not held by affiliated persons of the Company, which includes directors, officers, employees, and 5% stockholders. For purposes of this proposal, the 1940 Act defines "a majority of the outstanding voting securities" as: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at the Meeting if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company are present or represented by proxy; or (2) 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, whichever is less. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against this proposal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE PROPOSAL TO AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY TO SELL SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OR PRICES BELOW THE COMPANY'S THEN CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS, IN EACH CASE SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE CONDITIONS SET FORTH IN THE PROXY STATEMENT. ​
OTHER BUSINESS 
The board of directors knows of no other business to be presented for action at the Meeting. If any matters do come before the Meeting on which action can properly be taken, it is intended that the proxies shall vote in accordance with the judgment of the person or persons exercising the authority conferred by the proxy at the Meeting. The submission of a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion in the Company's proxy statement or presentation at the Meeting unless certain securities law requirements are met. 
DELIVERY OF PROXY MATERIALS
