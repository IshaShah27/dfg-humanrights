PROXY STATEMENT 
For 
2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders To Be Held on February 5, 2019 
This document will give you the information you need to vote on the matters listed on the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Notice of Annual Meeting"). Much of the information in this Proxy Statement is required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and some of it is technical in nature. If there is anything you do not understand, please contact us at (212) 750-6060. 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc. (the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") for use at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Tuesday, February 5, 2019 at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Golub Capital, LLC, located at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York, and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. This Proxy Statement and the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2018 are being mailed to stockholders of the Company of record as of December 12, 2018 (the "Stockholders") on or about December 17, 2018. 
We encourage you to vote your shares, either by voting in person at the Annual Meeting or by voting by proxy, which means that you authorize someone else to vote your shares. Shares represented by duly executed proxies will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you execute a proxy without specifying your voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. If any other business is brought before the Annual Meeting, your shares will be voted at the Board's discretion unless you specifically state otherwise on your proxy. 
You may revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised by notifying the Company's Secretary in writing, by submitting a properly executed, later-dated proxy, or by voting in person at the Annual Meeting. Any Stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting may attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, whether or not he or she has previously voted his or her shares via proxy or wishes to change a previous vote. 
You will be eligible to authorize your proxy electronically via the Internet, telephone, or by mail by following the instructions on the proxy card. 
Purpose of Annual Meeting
At the Annual Meeting, you will be asked to vote on the following proposals: 
1.
To elect two Class III directors of the Company who will each serve until the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company or until his successor is duly elected and qualified; and 
​
2.
To ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. 
​
Voting Securities
You may vote your shares at the Annual Meeting only if you were a Stockholder of record at the close of business on December 12, 2018 (the "Record Date"). There were 8,500,263.562 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") outstanding on the Record Date. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote. ​
Quorum Required
A quorum must be present at the Annual Meeting for any business to be conducted. The presence at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of votes entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. If there are not enough votes for a quorum, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
Votes Required
Election of Directors 
The election of directors requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of Common Stock cast "for" or "against" such nominee at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy (meaning the number of shares voted "for" a nominee must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such nominee). Stockholders may not cumulate their votes. 
Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy is required to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm (meaning that the number of shares voted "for" the proposal must exceed the number of shares voted "against" such proposal). Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have no effect on this proposal. 
Adjournment and Additional Solicitation.   If there appear not to be enough votes to approve the proposals at the Annual Meeting, the chair of the Annual Meeting shall have the power to adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to without notice other than announcement at the meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies. 
A Stockholder vote may be taken on any of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if there are sufficient votes for approval of such proposal. 
Information Regarding This Solicitation
The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting, including the cost of preparing, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, proxy card and the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2018. The Company intends to use the services of GC Advisors LLC ("GC Advisors"), the Company's investment adviser, to aid in the distribution and collection of proxy votes. The Company expects to pay market rates for such services. No additional compensation will be paid to directors, officers or regular employees for such services. 
Stockholders may authorize their proxy through the Internet, by telephone, or by mail by following the instructions on the proxy card. These options require Stockholders to input the Control Number, which is provided on the proxy card. If you authorize your proxy using the Internet, after visiting www.proxyonline.com and inputting your Control Number, you will be prompted to provide your voting instructions. Stockholders will have an opportunity to review their voting instructions and make any necessary changes before submitting their voting instructions and terminating their Internet link. Stockholders who authorize their proxy via the Internet, in addition to confirming their voting instructions prior to submission, will, upon request, receive an e-mail confirming their instructions. 
If a Stockholder wishes to participate in the Annual Meeting but does not wish to authorize a proxy by Internet, the Stockholder may attend the Annual Meeting in person or submit the enclosed proxy card by following the instructions set forth herein. 
Any proxy authorized pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by notice from the person giving the proxy at any time before it is exercised. A revocation may be effected by resubmitting voting instructions via ​
the Internet voting site, by telephone, by obtaining and properly completing another proxy card that is dated later than the original proxy card and returning it, by mail, in time to be received before the Annual Meeting, by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, or by a notice, provided in writing and signed by the Stockholder, delivered to the Company's Secretary on any business day before the date of the Annual Meeting.

PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Company's charter and bylaws, the Board currently has six members. Directors are divided into three classes and are elected for classified terms expiring at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders, with a term of office of one of the three classes of directors expiring each year at the Annual Meeting of the Stockholders of the Company. After this election, the terms of Class I, II and III directors will expire at the 2020, 2021 and 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, respectively. Each director will hold office for the term to which he or she is elected and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. 
A Stockholder can vote for or against, or abstain from voting for, any nominee. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies to vote such proxy FOR the election of each nominee named below. If a nominee should decline or be unable to serve as a director, it is intended that the proxy will be voted for the election of such person as is nominated by the Board as a replacement. The Board has no reason to believe that either Mr. Lawrence E. Golub or Mr. William M. Webster IV will be unable or unwilling to serve. 
THE BOARD, INCLUDING EACH OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES NAMED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT.

​
Corporate Governance
We believe that maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance is a crucial part of our business, and we are committed to having in place the necessary controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 
Director Independence
The 1940 Act requires that at least a majority of the Company's directors not be "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company. On an annual basis, each member of our Board is required to complete an independence questionnaire designed to provide information to assist the Board in determining whether the director is independent under the 1940 Act and our corporate governance guidelines. Our Board has determined that each of our directors, other than Mr. Lawrence E. Golub and Mr. David B. Golub, is independent under the Exchange Act, the 1940 Act and the listing standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC. Our governance guidelines require any director who has previously been determined to be independent to inform the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and our Corporate Secretary of any change in circumstance that may cause his or her status as an Independent Director to change. The Board limits membership on the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to Independent Directors. 
The Board's Oversight Role in Management
The Board's role in management of the Company is one of oversight. Oversight of the Company's investment activities extends to oversight of the risk management processes employed by GC Advisors as part of its day-to-day management of our investment activities. The Board reviews risk management  ​
processes throughout the year, consulting with appropriate representatives of GC Advisors as necessary and periodically requesting the production of risk management reports or presentations. The goal of the Board's risk oversight function is to ensure that the risks associated with our investment activities are accurately identified, thoroughly investigated and responsibly addressed. The Audit Committee of the Board (which consists of all the Independent Directors) is responsible for approving our independent accountants, reviewing with our independent accountants the plans and results of the audit engagement, approving professional services provided by our independent accountants, reviewing the independence of our independent accountants and reviewing the adequacy of our internal accounting controls. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Stockholders should note, however, that the Board's oversight function cannot eliminate all risks or ensure that particular events do not adversely affect the value of investments. The Board's risk oversight responsibilities include reviewing the reimbursement by the Company to the Golub Capital LLC (the "Administrator") of the allocable portion of the cost of the Company's chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs on an annual basis. 
The Board's Composition and Leadership Structure
The 1940 Act requires that at least a majority of the Company's directors not be "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company. Currently, four of the Company's six directors are Independent Directors (and are not "interested persons"). However, Lawrence E. Golub, Chief Executive Officer of Golub Capital, and therefore an interested person of Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., serves as Chairman of the Board. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of investors for Mr. Golub to lead the Board because of his broad experience with the day-to-day management and operation of other investment funds and his significant background in the financial services industry, as described below. The Board does not have a lead independent director. However, William M. Webster IV, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, is an Independent Director and acts as a liaison between the Independent Directors and management between meetings of the Board. He is also involved in the preparation of agendas for Board and committee meetings. The Board believes that its leadership structure is appropriate in light of the characteristics and circumstances of the Company because the structure allocates areas of responsibility among the individual directors and the committees in a manner that enhances effective oversight. The Board also believes that its small size creates a highly efficient governance structure that provides ample opportunity for direct communication and interaction between GC Advisors and the Board.
Information About Each Director's Experience, Qualifications, Attributes or Skills
Below is additional information about each director (supplementing the information provided in the table above) that describes some of the specific experiences, qualifications, attributes and/or skills that each director possesses, and which the Board believes has prepared each director to be effective. The Board believes that the significance of each director's experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience or a factor that is important for one director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the Board level, with no single director, or particular factor, being indicative of Board effectiveness. However, the Board believes that directors need to have the ability to review, evaluate, question and discuss critical information provided to them and to interact effectively with Company management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties. The Board believes that its members satisfy this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a director's educational background, business, professional training or practice (e.g., finance, accounting or law), public service or academic positions, experience from service as a board member (including the Board of the Company) or as an executive of investment funds, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations, and/or other life experiences. To assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the Independent Directors are counseled by their own independent legal counsel, who participates in Board meetings and interacts with GC Advisors, and also may benefit from information provided by the Company's counsel. Both Independent Directors' and Company's counsels have significant experience advising funds, including other business development companies, and fund board members. The Board and its committees have the ability to engage other experts as appropriate. The Board evaluates its performance on an annual basis.  ​
Experience, Qualifications, Attributes and/or Skills that Led to the Board's Conclusion that such Members Should Serve as Directors of the Company
The Board believes that, collectively, the directors have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, which allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Company and protecting the interests of its Stockholders. Below is a description of the various experiences, qualifications, attributes and/or skills with respect to each director considered by the Board.

Committees of the Board
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board of the Company held four Board meetings, four Audit Committee meetings, and one Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees on which they served that were held while they were members of the Board. The Company requires each director to make a diligent effort to attend all Board and committee meetings and encourages directors to attend the Annual Meeting. All directors of the Company attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
Audit Committee 
The members of the Audit Committee are John T. Baily, Kenneth F. Bernstein, Anita R. Rosenberg and William M. Webster IV, each of whom is financially literate and meets the independence standards established by the SEC for audit committees and is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act. William M. Webster IV serves as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Our Board has determined that Mr. Baily, Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Webster are each an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act. 
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to monitor (i) the integrity of the financial statements of the Company, (ii) the independent auditor's qualifications and independence, (iii) the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditors and (iv) the compliance by the Company with legal and regulatory requirements. 
The Audit Committee is directly responsible for approving and overseeing our independent accountants, including review and discussion of material written communications between the independent accountants and management, and reviewing with our independent accountants the plans and results of the audit engagement, including critical accounting policies to be used, alternative treatment of financial information within generally accepted accounting principles that have been discussed with management and, in the future, critical audit matters. As part of its oversight, the Audit Committee is responsible for approving professional services provided by our independent accountants, reviewing the independence of our independent accountants and reviewing and overseeing the adequacy of our internal accounting  ​
controls. The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and discussing with management and our independent accountants our annual audited financial statements, including disclosures made in management's discussion and analysis, and recommending to the Board whether the audited financial statements should be included in our annual report to shareholders. On a quarterly basis, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with management and our independent accountants the Company's quarterly financial statements, including the results of the independent accountants' reviews of the quarterly financial statements. Periodically during each fiscal year, the Audit Committee meets, including private meetings, with our independent accountants and selected executive officers of the Company, as appropriate, for consultation on audit, accounting and related financial matters. At least annually, the Audit Committee reviews a report from the independent accountants regarding the independent accountant's internal quality-control procedures, any material issues raised by internal quality review, or peer review, of the firm or any inquiry or investigation by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years respecting one or more independent audits carried out by the firm and any steps taken to deal with any such issues, as well as all relationships between the independent accountants and the Company. In its consideration of whether to recommend that stockholders ratify the selection of our independent accountants, the Audit Committee considers both the independence of the independent accountants from us and management and whether retaining the independent accountants is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The Audit Committee reviews and approves the amount of audit fees and any other fees paid to our independent accountants. 
The function of the Audit Committee is oversight. The independent accountants are accountable to the Board and the Audit Committee, as representatives of the Company's stockholders. The Board and the Audit Committee have the ultimate authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, where appropriate, replace the Company's independent accountants (subject, if applicable, to shareholder ratification). 
In fulfilling their responsibilities, the members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of the Company or management and are not, and do not represent themselves to be, accountants or auditors by profession. Accordingly, it is not the duty or the responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures, to determine that our financial statements are complete and accurate and are in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or to set auditor independence standards.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee also include compliance oversight, including discussing with management and the independent auditors any correspondence with regulators or governmental agencies and any published reports that raise material issues regarding the Company's financial statements or accounting policies. In addition, the Audit Committee reviews related party transactions and considers any conflicts of interest brought to its attention pursuant to the Company's Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions." 
The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding our Board in fair value pricing debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. The Board and Audit Committee utilize the services of independent valuation firms to help them determine the fair value of these securities. The Audit Committee Charter is attached as Annex A to our definitive Proxy Statement relating to our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed with the SEC on December 15, 2017 (File No. 814-01244). 
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are John T. Baily, Kenneth F. Bernstein, Anita R. Rosenberg and William M. Webster IV, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act. William M. Webster IV serves as Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for selecting, researching and nominating directors for election by our stockholders, selecting nominees to fill vacancies on the Board or a committee of the Board, developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and our management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has adopted a written Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter, which is attached as Annex B to our definitive Proxy Statement relating to our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders filed with the SEC on December 15, 2017 (File No. 814-01244).  ​
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers Stockholder recommendations for possible nominees for election as directors when such recommendations are submitted in accordance with the Company's bylaws, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding director nominations. Our bylaws provide that a Stockholder who wishes to nominate a person for election as a director at a meeting of Stockholders must deliver written notice to our corporate secretary, Joshua M. Levinson, c/o Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., 666 Fifth Avenue, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10103. This notice must contain, as to each nominee, all information that would be required under applicable SEC rules to be disclosed in connection with election of a director and certain other information set forth in our bylaws, including the following minimum information for each director nominee: full name, age and address; principal occupation during the past five years; directorships on publicly held companies and investment companies during the past five years; number of shares of our Common Stock owned, if any; and a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by the Stockholders. In order to be eligible to be a nominee for election as a director by a Stockholder, such potential nominee must deliver to our Corporate Secretary a written questionnaire providing the requested information about the background and qualifications of such nominee and a written representation and agreement that such nominee is not and will not become a party to any voting agreements, any agreement or understanding with any person with respect to any compensation or indemnification in connection with services on the Board and would be in compliance with all of our publicly disclosed corporate governance, conflict of interest, confidentiality and stock ownership and trading policies and guidelines. 
Criteria considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in evaluating the qualifications of individuals for election as members of the Board include compliance with the independence and other applicable requirements of the 1940 Act and the SEC, and all other applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing standards; the criteria, policies and principles set forth in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and the ability to contribute to the effective management of the Company, taking into account the needs of the Company and such factors as the individual's experience, perspective, skills and knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also may consider such other factors as it may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its Stockholders. 
Compensation Committee
The Company does not have a compensation committee because its executive officers do not receive compensation from us. The Board, as a whole, is responsible for reviewing the reimbursement by the Company to the Administrator of the allocable portion of the cost of the Company's Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs on an annual basis and also participates in the consideration of director compensation. Decisions on director compensation are based on a review of data of comparable business development companies. 
Communication with the Board
Stockholders with questions about the Company are encouraged to contact the Company's Investor Relations Department at 666 Fifth Avenue, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10103. However, if Stockholders believe that their questions have not been addressed, they may communicate with the Company's Board by sending their communications to Joshua M. Levinson, Secretary, c/o Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., 666 Fifth Avenue, 18th Floor, New York, New York 10103. All Stockholder communications received in this manner will be delivered to one or more members of the Board. ​

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
We have entered into agreements with GC Advisors, in which members of our senior management and members of GC Advisors' investment committee have ownership and financial interests. Members of our senior management and the investment committee also serve as principals of other investment advisers affiliated with GC Advisors that do and may in the future sponsor or manage accounts with investment objectives similar to ours. In addition, our executive officers and directors and the members of GC Advisors and its investment committee serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same, or related, line of business as we do or of accounts managed or sponsored by our affiliates. These accounts may have investment objectives similar to our investment objective. 
Subject to certain 1940 Act restrictions on co-investments with affiliates, GC Advisors offers us the right to participate in all investment opportunities that it determines are appropriate for us in view of our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other relevant factors. Such offers are subject to the exception that, in accordance with GC Advisors' code of ethics and allocation policies, we might not participate in each individual opportunity but will, on an overall basis, be entitled to participate equitably with other entities sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates over time. 
GC Advisors and its affiliates have both subjective and objective policies and procedures in place that are designed to manage the potential conflicts of interest between GC Advisors' fiduciary obligations to us and its similar fiduciary obligations to other clients. To the extent that we compete with entities sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates for a particular investment opportunity, GC Advisors will allocate investment opportunities across the entities for which such opportunities are appropriate, consistent with (1) its internal conflict of interest and allocation policies, (2) the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the "Advisers Act"), and (3) certain restrictions under the 1940 Act regarding co-investments with affiliates. GC Advisors' allocation policies are intended to ensure that, over time, we may generally share equitably with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates in investment opportunities, particularly those involving a security with limited supply or involving differing classes of securities of the same issuer which may be suitable for us and such other accounts. There can be no assurance that GC Advisors' or its affiliates' efforts to allocate any particular investment opportunity fairly among all clients for whom such opportunity is appropriate will result in an allocation of all or part of such opportunity to us. Not all conflicts of interest can be expected to be resolved in our favor. 
GC Advisors has historically sponsored or managed, and currently sponsors or manages, accounts with similar or overlapping investment strategies and has put in place a conflict-resolution policy that addresses the co-investment restrictions set forth under the 1940 Act. GC Advisors seeks to ensure the equitable allocation of investment opportunities when we are able to invest alongside other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates. When we invest alongside such other accounts, such investments are made consistent with GC Advisors' allocation policy. Under this allocation policy, GC Advisors will determine separately the amount of any proposed investment to be made by us and similar eligible accounts. We expect that these determinations will be made in a similar manner for other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates. If sufficient securities or loan amounts are available to satisfy our and each such account's proposed investment, the opportunity will be allocated in accordance with GC Advisor's pre-transaction determination. Where there is an insufficient amount of an investment opportunity to fully satisfy demand by us and other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates, the allocation policy further provides that allocations among us and such other accounts will generally be made pro rata to us and each other eligible account based on the capital available for investment of each of us and such other eligible accounts, subject to the minimum and maximum investment size limits for each such party. To the extent we do not have available capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratio, we may receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors' allocation policy. In situations in which co-investment with other entities sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, such as when, in the absence of exemptive relief described below, we and such other entities would be making different investments in the same issuer, GC Advisors will need to decide whether we or such other entity or entities will proceed with  ​
the investment. GC Advisors will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on a basis that will be fair and equitable over time, including, for example, through random or rotational methods. 
We expect to co-invest on a concurrent basis with other affiliates of GC Advisors, unless doing so is impermissible with existing regulatory guidance, applicable regulations, the terms of any exemptive relief granted to us and our allocation procedures. On February 27, 2017, GC Advisors and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates, received exemptive relief from the SEC that permits us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our Board determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. We believe that co-investment by us and accounts sponsored or managed by the GC Advisors and its affiliates may afford us additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. Under the terms of this exemptive relief, a "required majority" (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors is required to make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies. 
GC Advisors and its affiliates have other clients with similar or competing investment objectives, including GBDC, GCIC and several private funds that are pursuing an investment strategy similar to ours, some of which may seek new capital from time to time. In serving these clients, GC Advisors may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities. Our investment objective may overlap with such affiliated accounts. GC Advisors' allocation procedures are designed to allocate investment opportunities among the accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates in a manner consistent with its obligations under the Advisers Act. If two or more accounts with similar investment strategies are actively investing, GC Advisors will seek to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and consistent with its allocation policy. The Board regularly reviews the allocation policy of Golub Capital and annually reviews the code of ethics of GC Advisors. 
Our senior management, members of GC Advisors' investment committee and other investment professionals from GC Advisors may serve as directors of, or in a similar capacity with, companies in which we invest or in which we are considering making an investment. Through these and other relationships with a company, these individuals may obtain material non-public information that might restrict our ability to buy or sell the securities of such company under the policies of the company or applicable law. In addition, we have adopted a formal Code of Ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors' officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the Maryland General Corporation Law. 
We have entered into an investment advisory agreement (the "Investment Advisory Agreement") with GC Advisors pursuant to which we pay GC Advisors a base management fee and incentive fee. Our Board approved the Investment Advisory Agreement for an initial two-year term in August 2017. The Investment Advisory Agreement became effective on September 29, 2017. In addition, pursuant to a waiver letter, GC Advisors has irrevocably agreed to waive certain fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement until such time as we complete an initial public offering of shares of our Common Stock or a listing of our Common Stock on a national securities exchange. The incentive fee is computed and paid on income that we may not have yet received in cash. This fee structure may create an incentive for GC Advisors to make certain types of investments. Additionally, we rely on investment professionals from GC Advisors to assist our Board with the valuation of our portfolio investments. GC Advisors' base management fee and incentive fee are based on the value of our investments and there may be a conflict of interest when personnel of GC Advisors are involved in the valuation process of our portfolio investments. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2018, GC Advisors earned a base management fee (net of waivers) of  $0.5 million and an incentive fee (net of waivers) of  $0.5 million.

Audit-Related Fees:   Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 
Tax Fees:   Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance. These services include assistance regarding federal, state, and local tax compliance. 
All Other Fees:   Other fees would include fees billed for products and services other than the services reported above. 
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditor. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve the audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the auditor's independence. While there were no audit-related fees and tax fees incurred in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, if any of these would have been incurred, they would have been approved by the Audit Committee. 
Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee for specific pre-approval, and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management. 
THE BOARD, INCLUDING EACH OF THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. ​
Audit Committee Report(1)
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company's audited statement of financial condition as of September 30, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited statement of financial condition with management and Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, with and without management present. The Audit Committee included in its review results of Ernst & Young LLP's examinations, the Company's internal controls and the quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed the Company's procedures and internal control processes designed to ensure full, fair and adequate financial reporting and disclosures, including procedures for certifications by the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer that are required in periodic reports filed by the Company with the SEC. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Company's internal control system is adequate and that the Company employs appropriate accounting and auditing procedures. 
The Audit Committee also has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP matters relating to Ernst & Young LLP's judgments about the quality, as well as the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting as required by Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communication With Audit Committees). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with Ernst & Young LLP its independence from management and the Company, as well as the matters in the written disclosures received from Ernst & Young LLP and required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3526 (Communication with Audit Committee Concerning Independence). The Audit Committee received a letter from Ernst & Young LLP confirming its independence and discussed it with them. The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the amount of audit fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with Ernst & Young LLP the Company's critical accounting policies and practices, internal controls, other material written communications to management, and the scope of Ernst & Young LLP's audits and all fees paid to Ernst & Young LLP during the fiscal year. The Audit Committee adopted guidelines requiring review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young LLP for the Company. The Audit Committee has reviewed and considered the compatibility of Ernst & Young LLP's performance of non-audit services with the maintenance of Ernst & Young LLP's independence as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
