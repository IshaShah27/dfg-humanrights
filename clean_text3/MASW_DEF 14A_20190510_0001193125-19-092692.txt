Dear Stockholder: 
On behalf of our entire Board of Directors, I am pleased to invite you to attend Masco Corporation's Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Our meeting will be held at 9:30 a.m. on Friday, May 10, 2019 at our corporate office in Livonia, Michigan. Following our formal meeting, management will provide a review of our operations and we will respond to your questions. 
Board Oversight of Our Strategy 
To optimize the effectiveness of our Board, we engage with management throughout the year to understand and oversee our Company's strategic objectives, which focus on driving the full potential of our businesses, leveraging opportunities across our portfolio and actively managing our portfolio. Annually, we hold a strategy session with management to discuss the Company's execution of those objectives and our Company's long-term plans to drive stockholder value. At Board meetings throughout the year, management also provides updates on the progress toward achieving our strategy. The Board also sees our Company's strategy and corporate culture in action when leaders of our businesses present their specific growth objectives to us at Board meetings and when we visit one business unit each year to engage with its broader leadership team. 
Board Composition and Refreshment 
Our Board is comprised of eleven directors who bring a diverse set of skills and experience that promote active and engaged discussions to ensure an effective and highly functioning Board. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee regularly reviews our Board's composition to ensure alignment with long-term strategy, and as a result, has recommended to our Board the appointment of seven new independent directors since 2012. We also have performed an annual self-evaluation for a number of years. This focus on board refreshment and self-evaluation has brought a valued balance of fresh perspectives and deep historical knowledge of our Company to our Board's role as stewards of your investment in Masco Corporation. We will continue to focus on maintaining an appropriate balance of tenure, skills, experience and diversity, along with ensuring our Board continues to conduct itself effectively. 
Commitment to Pay-for-Performance 
We believe that our Organization and Compensation Committee has demonstrated a consistent commitment to developing and overseeing executive compensation programs that align our executive management team's interests with delivering strong financial performance and driving long-term stockholder value. Our efforts to enhance our pay-for-performance practices resulted in 98% of the votes cast last year in favor of the compensation paid to our named executive officers. In 2018, approximately 87% of our CEO's compensation consisted of performance-based pay. In addition, as discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we have incorporated numerous best practices into our executive compensation programs. 
We Value Your Support 
On behalf of our entire Board, I thank you for your continued support of Masco Corporation and your confidence in us as Board members. Your vote is very important to us, and I urge you to carefully read this proxy statement. Voting instructions for the proposals to be presented at our Annual Meeting can be found on the enclosed proxy card. Please submit your vote today by internet, telephone or mail. 
Sincerely, 
J. Michael Losh

BOARD REFRESHMENT 
We have had significant Board refreshment over the past several years. Seven new independent directors have joined our Board since 2012, which, combined with our directors who have experience with us, provides a desirable balance of deep, historical understanding of our Company and new and diverse perspectives. 
STOCKHOLDER OUTREACH 
In determining our executive compensation and corporate governance practices, our Board believes it is important to consider feedback from our stockholders. In 2018, we continued our robust stockholder engagement program and requested the opportunity to engage with stockholders holding approximately 50% of our outstanding shares. We ultimately engaged with stockholders representing 20% of our outstanding shares, and discussed our Board's oversight of our strategy and risk, board composition and refreshment, corporate sustainability and our annual and long-term performance-based compensation programs. We received positive feedback from the stockholders with whom we spoke regarding the structure of our compensation programs and practices, which was reflective of the strong support we received for our say-on-pay proposal over the past years. We provide reports on the feedback we receive to our Organization and Compensation Committee ("Compensation Committee") and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee ("Governance Committee"). 
2019 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY  |  MASCO 2019 
2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
We delivered solid financial results in 2018. Our reported sales for the full year increased 9% to $8.4 billion and we increased our operating profit for the full year 1% to $1.2 billion. Our sales growth was driven by our acquisitions of Kichler Lighting in March 2018 and Mercury Plastics in December 2017, strong consumer demand due to increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the U.S. and net selling price increases. Our operating profit grew despite the rising price of raw materials and logistics costs, Enterprise Resource Planning System costs and a purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of Kichler Lighting, demonstrating our ability to manage our costs. 
In addition to delivering sales and operating profit growth, we continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy. In 2018 we returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing $654 million in shares of our stock and increasing our annual dividend for the fifth year in a row. In addition, we deployed $549 million to complete the acquisition of Kichler Lighting. 
2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Based on our financial performance in 2018, we exceeded the target for our working capital as a percent of sales goal, but we did not achieve our target operating profit goal. 
2018 Annual Performance Program 
Under our annual performance program, we pay cash bonuses and grant restricted stock to our executive officers if we meet our performance goals for operating profit and working capital as a percent of sales. The following tables reflect our 2018 target goals, our performance relative to our target goals and the compensation we paid to our executive officers under our 2018 annual performance program:

During 2018, our Compensation Committee reviewed our compensation programs and practices to ensure our interests and the objectives for our compensation programs are aligned. At our 2018 Annual Meeting, 98% of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation we paid to our executive officers. Although the say-on-pay vote is advisory and non-binding, our Compensation Committee believes this approval percentage indicates strong support for our continued efforts to enhance our pay-for-performance practices, and our Compensation Committee concluded that our stockholders endorse our current executive compensation programs and practices. 
Our compensation practices include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Long-Term Incentives - Our compensation programs are weighted toward long-term incentives. We give approximately  equal weight to performance-based restricted stock, stock options and our three-year incentive program. In 2017, we modified our three-year incentive program by replacing the cash award with performance-based restricted stock units  ("PRSUs").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Five-Year Vesting for Equity Awards - Our performance-based restricted stock and stock option awards vest over five  years, which is longer than typical market practice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Long-Term Performance Program - A significant portion of our executive officers' compensation opportunity is  based on the achievement of a long-term performance goal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Capped Awards - Our annual and long-term incentive compensation plan payouts are limited to 200% of the target  opportunity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Clawback Policy - If we restate our financial statements, other than as a result of changes to accounting rules or  regulations, our clawback policy allows us to recover incentive compensation paid to our executives in the three-year period prior to the restatement, regardless of whether misconduct caused the restatement.  
[END TABLE]
2019 PROXY STATEMENT SUMMARY  |  MASCO 2019 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Stock Ownership Requirements - We have minimum stock ownership requirements for our executive officers, including  requiring our CEO to own stock valued at six times his base salary. As of December 31, 2018, each of our executive officers met his or her stock ownership requirement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Double-Trigger Vesting - We have double-trigger vesting of equity on a change in control.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Tally Sheets and Risk Analysis - Our Compensation Committee uses tally sheets and analyzes risk in setting executive  compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Competitive Analysis - On an annual basis, our Compensation Committee reviews a market analysis of executive  compensation paid by our peer companies and published survey data for comparably-sized companies.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Limited Perquisites - We provide limited perquisites to our executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Our compensation practices do not include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✘  Excise Tax Gross-Ups - We have eliminated the excise tax  gross-up feature on all of the equity grants made since 2012.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✘  Hedging or Pledging - Our policy prohibits executives and directors from hedging our stock and from making future pledges of our  stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✘  Contractual Termination Arrangements - We have no change in control agreements, contractual severance agreements or employment  agreements providing for severance payments with our executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ✘  Option Repricing - Our equity plan prohibits the repricing of options without stockholder approval.

Separation of our Chair of the Board and CEO Roles 
Our Board believes that its leadership structure is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders at this time; however, our Board has no policy with respect to the separation of the roles of CEO and Chair and believes that this matter should be discussed and determined by the Board from time to time, based on all of the then-current facts and circumstances. If the roles of Chair and CEO are combined in the future, the role of Lead Director could become part of our Board leadership structure. 
Communications with our Chair of the Board 
If you are interested in contacting the Chair of our Board, you may send your communication in care of our Secretary to the address specified in "Communications with Our Board of Directors" below. 
Director Independence 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that a majority of our directors qualify as "independent" under the requirements of applicable law and the New York Stock Exchange's listing standards. 
Director Independence Standards 
For a director to be considered independent, our Board must determine that the director does not have any direct or indirect material relationship with us. Our Board has adopted standards to assist it in making a determination of independence for directors. These standards are posted on our website at www.masco.com. 
Assessment of our Directors' Independence 
Our Board has determined that nine of our eleven directors, including all of our non-employee directors other than Mr. Manoogian, are independent. As an employee, Mr. Allman, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is not an independent director. Our independent directors are Messrs. Alexander, Losh, O'Herlihy, Parfet, Plant, Stevens and Turner, Ms. Ffolkes and Ms. Payne. 
In making its independence determinations, our Board reviewed all transactions, relationships and arrangements for the last three fiscal years involving each non-employee director and the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating Mr. O'Herlihy's independence, our Board considered our purchases of goods from Illinois Tool  Works Inc. and its subsidiaries. The aggregate amount of these purchases was approximately $0.4 million in 2018. Illinois Tool Works has reported revenue of $14.8 billion in 2018. Our Board does not believe that Mr. O'Herlihy has  a material interest in these transactions.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating Ms. Ffolkes's independence, our Board considered our purchases of goods from Air  Products & Chemicals, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The aggregate amount of these purchases was approximately $0.6 million in 2018. Air Products and Chemicals has reported revenue of $8.9 billion for its fiscal year ended September  30, 2018. Our Board does not believe that Ms. Ffolkes has a material interest in these transactions.  
[END TABLE]
Our Board also determined that we did not make any discretionary charitable contributions exceeding the greater of $1 million or 2% of the revenues of any charitable organization in which any of our directors was actively involved in the day-to-day operations. 
Committee Member Independence Assessment 
Our Board has determined that each member of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Governance Committee qualifies as independent.  MASCO 2019  |  PART I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board Refreshment 
Our Governance Committee reviews current director tenure, including whether any vacancies are expected on our Board due to retirement or otherwise, and periodically assesses the composition of our Board by reviewing our directors' skills and expertise. Our Board completes a director skills exercise periodically to provide our Governance Committee insight into our Board composition. The Committee uses this information to evaluate the skills and experience represented on our Board and to identify anticipated skills and experience that would be valuable in the future to best support the Company's strategic objectives. In 2017, our Governance Committee and Board focused on director candidate recruitment, which resulted in the appointment of two new independent directors, Ms. Marie Ffolkes and Mr. Charles Stevens. 
Director Refreshment 
Seven new independent directors have joined our Board since 2012, bringing fresh and diverse perspectives. These directors have particular strength in the areas of executive management, finance and accounting, global operations, business and growth strategy, brand management, consumer products, risk management, talent management, corporate governance and government relations. We believe the addition of these new directors, combined with our directors who have experience with us, provides a desirable balance of deep, historical understanding of our Company and new perspectives, resulting in strong guidance and oversight to our executive management team. 
Board Membership and Composition 
Board Membership 
Our Governance Committee believes that directors should possess exemplary personal and professional reputations, reflecting high ethical standards and values. The expertise and experience of directors should provide a source of strategic oversight, advice and guidance to our management. A director's judgment should demonstrate an inquisitive and independent perspective with intelligence and practical wisdom. Directors should be free of any significant business relationships which would result in a potential conflict in judgment between our interests and the interests of those with whom we do business. Each director should be committed to serving on our Board for an extended period of time and to devoting sufficient time to carry out the director's duties and responsibilities in an effective manner for the benefit of our stockholders. Our Governance Committee also considers additional criteria adopted by our Board for director nominees and the independence, financial literacy and financial expertise standards required by applicable law and by the New York Stock Exchange. 
Board Composition 
Neither our Board nor our Governance Committee has adopted a formal Board diversity policy. However, as part of its assessment of Board composition and evaluation of potential director candidates, our Governance Committee considers whether our directors hold diverse viewpoints, professional experiences, education and other skills and attributes that are necessary to enhance our Board's effectiveness. In addition, our Governance Committee believes that it is desirable for directors to possess diverse characteristics of gender, race, national origin, ethnicity and age, and considers such factors in its evaluation of candidates for Board membership. 
Director Candidate Recommendations 
The Governance Committee uses a number of sources to identify and evaluate director nominees. It is the Governance Committee's policy to consider director candidates recommended by stockholders. All Board candidates, including those recommended by stockholders, are evaluated against the criteria described above. Stockholders wishing to have the Governance Committee consider a candidate should  PART I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE  |  MASCO 2019 
submit the candidate's name and pertinent background information to our Secretary at the address stated below in "Communications with our Board of Directors." Stockholders who wish to nominate director candidates for election to our Board should follow the procedures set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. For a summary of these procedures, see "2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders" below. 
Risk Oversight 
Our Board oversees our risk management practices, both directly and through its committees. Our Board exercises its risk oversight through review and discussion of comprehensive analyses prepared by management on material risks facing us and related mitigating activities; updates regarding these risks are presented at Board meetings throughout the year, as necessary. 
Key risk oversight activities of our Board include:

Meeting Attendance 
Each director attended at least 75% of our Board meetings and applicable committee meetings that were held in 2018 while such person served as a director. It is our policy to encourage directors to attend our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, and all of our directors attended our 2018 Annual Meeting.

Annual Governance Committee Chair Cash Retainer (row b): The Governance Committee Chair retainer is not paid if the director who chairs that committee also serves as the Chair of our Board. Currently Mr. Losh serves as both our Chair of the Board and Governance Committee Chair so he does not receive the Governance Committee Chair retainer. 
Meeting Fee (row c): Our Board may approve the payment of meeting fees to directors serving on three or more standing committees or serving as members of a special committee constituted by our Board. No such fees were paid for 2018. 
Other Compensation 
Our non-employee directors may also receive the following benefits, which are available to all of our employees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Matching gifts program under which we will match up to $5,000 of a director's contributions to eligible 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations each year. Non-employee directors may participate in the matching gifts program until December 31 of the year in which their services as a director  ends.  
[END TABLE]

• Employee purchase program under which a director may obtain rebates on certain of our products purchased for their personal  use.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, if space is available, a director's spouse is permitted to accompany a director who travels on Company aircraft to attend Board or committee meetings. 
Annual Review of our Director Compensation Program 
Our Governance Committee reviews our director compensation program annually, including reviewing an analysis of the competitiveness of the program, and recommends any changes to our Board. During 2018, upon the recommendation of our Governance Committee, our Board made the following changes to our director compensation program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased the annual cash retainer and annual equity retainer paid to non-employee  directors each by $10,000, for a total annual retainer of $270,000;

Restricted Stock Awards (column a): In May 2018, we granted 3,680 shares of restricted stock to each non-employee director, except for Ms. Van Lokeren, whose service as a director concluded in May 2018. In addition, we granted Mr. Stevens 770 shares in February 2018, when his service as a director began, as pro-rated equity compensation for the months of February through April 2018. The amounts reported in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of the shares, calculated in accordance with accounting guidance. Directors realize the value of restricted stock awards over time because the vesting of awards occurs pro rata over three years, and one-half of these shares must be retained until completion of their service on our Board. 
All Other Compensation (column b): The amounts reported in this column reflect our contributions in 2018 to eligible tax-exempt organizations under our matching gifts program, as described above, for which directors receive no direct financial benefit.  MASCO 2019  |  PART I - CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Unvested Restricted Stock and Stock Options Outstanding: The following table reports the aggregate number of shares of unvested restricted stock, and the aggregate number of stock options outstanding, held on December 31, 2018 by each director who was serving on that date. Our Board ceased granting stock options to non-employee directors in 2010; however, a portion of the stock options granted before then remained outstanding at December 31, 2018.

Assessing Related Person Transactions 
Our policy requires directors, director nominees and executive officers to provide prompt written notice to our Secretary of any related transaction so it can be reviewed by our Governance Committee. If the Governance Committee determines that the related person has a direct or indirect material interest in the transaction, it will consider all relevant information to assess whether the transaction is in, or not inconsistent with, our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. The Governance Committee annually reviews previously-approved ongoing related transactions to determine whether the transactions should continue. 
Related Persons Transactions for 2018 
There have been no transactions since January 1, 2018 required to be described in this proxy statement that were not subject to review, approval or ratification in accordance with this policy. 
On-Going Related Person Transactions 
Our Governance Committee previously approved the on-going related transaction described below. 
Transactions with Mr. Richard A. Manoogian 
In accordance with the terms of our 2009 agreement with Mr. Manoogian, who transitioned to Chairman Emeritus in 2012, we provide him with an administrative assistant and reasonable equipment and supplies for his personal use, which together aggregated approximately $158,000 for 2018.

The term of office of our Class I Directors, who are Marie A. Ffolkes, Donald R. Parfet, Lisa A. Payne and Reginald M. Turner, expires at this meeting. 
Our Board proposes the re-election of Ms. Ffolkes, Ms. Payne and Messrs. Parfet and Turner to serve as Class I Directors. The term of the Class I Directors elected at this Annual Meeting will expire at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in 2022, or when their respective successors are elected and qualified. 
Our Board expects that the persons named as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote the shares represented by each proxy for the election of each director nominee unless a contrary direction is given. If, prior to the meeting, a nominee is unable or unwilling to serve as a director, which our Board does not expect, the proxy holders may vote for an alternate nominee recommended by our Board, or our Board may reduce its size. 
Information regarding each of our director nominees can be found above in "Director Nominees for Class I." 
Our Board recommends a vote FOR the election to our Board of Directors of each of the following Class I Director nominees:

HOW OUR 2018 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IMPACTED OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' COMPENSATION 
We delivered solid sales and operating profit growth in 2018. Our reported annual sales increased 9% to $8.4 billion and our annual operating profit increased 1% to $1.2 billion. Our operating profit margin decreased to 14.5% from 15.6% due to significant headwinds from increased commodity and logistics costs, Enterprise Resource Planning System costs, and a purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of Kichler Lighting. Based on our financial performance in 2018, our executive officers earned incentive compensation under our performance-based compensation programs, which include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual performance program under which we pay cash bonuses and grant restricted stock to our executive officers if we  meet annual performance goals; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Long Term Cash Incentive Program ("LTCIP") under which we make cash awards to our executive officers if we meet  performance goals over a three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
The following tables reflect our target goals for our 2018 annual performance program and our 2016-2018 LTCIP and our performance relative to those goals. For our annual performance program, we exceeded the target for our working capital as a percent of sales goal, but we did not achieve our target operating profit goal, which reduced the payout to our executive officers.

OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS' PERFOMANCE-BASED TARGET COMPENSATION 
Our target compensation mix for our CEO and our other executive officers reflects our emphasis on long-term, performance-based compensation that incentivizes our executive officers to make strategic decisions that will strengthen our business and create long-term value for our stockholders. In 2018, 87% of our CEO's target compensation and 74% of our other executive officers' target compensation was performance-based, as shown in the graphs below. 
OUR COMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS 
Our compensation practices include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Long-Term Incentives - Our compensation programs are weighted toward long-term incentives. We give approximately  equal weight to performance-based restricted stock, stock options and our three- year incentive program. In 2017, we modified our three-year incentive program by replacing the cash award with performance-based restricted stock units  ("PRSUs").  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Five-Year Vesting for Equity Awards - Our performance-based restricted stock and stock option awards vest over five  years, which is longer than typical market practice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Long-Term Performance Program - A significant portion of our executive officers' compensation opportunity is  based on the achievement of a three-year performance goal.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Capped Awards - Our annual and long-term incentive compensation plan payouts are limited to 200% of the target  opportunity.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Clawback Policy - If we restate our financial statements, other than as a result of changes to accounting rules or  regulations, our clawback policy allows us to recover incentive compensation paid to our executives in the three-year period prior to the restatement, regardless of whether misconduct caused the restatement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  ü    Stock Ownership Requirements - We have minimum stock ownership requirements for our executive officers, including  requiring our CEO to own stock valued at six times his base salary. As of December 31, 2018, each of our executive officers met his or her stock ownership requirement.

[END TABLE]
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, 98% of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation we paid to our executive officers. Although the say-on-pay vote is advisory and non-binding, our Compensation Committee believes this approval percentage indicates strong support for our continued efforts to enhance our pay-for-performance practices, and our Compensation Committee concluded that our stockholders endorse our current executive compensation programs and policies. 
In 2018, we continued our robust stockholder engagement program and requested the opportunity to engage with stockholders holding approximately 50% of our outstanding shares. We ultimately engaged with stockholders representing 20% of our outstanding shares. We received positive feedback from the stockholders with whom we spoke regarding the structure of our compensation programs and practices, which was reflective of the strong support we received for our say-on-pay proposal over the past years. We provide reports on the stockholder feedback we receive to our Compensation Committee and Governance Committee.  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  |  MASCO 2019 
COMPENSATION DECISIONS IN 2018 
Our 2018 Financial Performance 
We delivered solid financial results in 2018. Our reported sales for the full year increased 9% to $8.4 billion and we increased our operating profit for the full year 1% to $1.2 billion. Our sales growth was driven by our recent acquisitions of Kichler Lighting in March 2018 and Mercury Plastics in December 2017, strong consumer demand due to increased repair and remodel activity and new home construction in the U.S. and net selling price increases. Our operating profit grew despite the rising price of raw materials and logistics costs, Enterprise Resource Planning System costs and a purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of Kichler Lighting, demonstrating our ability to manage our costs. 
In addition to delivering sales and operating profit growth, we continued to execute on our capital allocation strategy. In 2018 we returned value to our stockholders by repurchasing $654 million in shares of our stock and increasing our annual dividend for the fifth year in a row. In addition, we deployed $549 million to complete the acquisition of Kichler Lighting. 
How We Performed Against our Performance Compensation Goals 
Our 2018 annual performance program was based on operating profit and working capital as a percent of sales metrics. We exceeded the working capital as a percent of sales goal for this program, but we did not achieve the operating profit target, which resulted in an overall performance percentage of 89%. As a result, consistent with our commitment to pay-for-performance, our executive officers earned cash bonuses and restricted stock awards based on this achievement (see "Our 2018 Annual Performance Program" below). 
Our LTCIP for the three-year performance period of 2016 to 2018 was based on a return on invested capital ("ROIC") metric, and we improved our ROIC over the three-year period. Our adjusted ROIC in 2016, 2017 and 2018 was 14.0%, 15.3% and 15.8% respectively, for an average adjusted ROIC of 15.0% over the three-year performance period. This level of performance exceeded the target ROIC goal for this program, and we achieved a performance percentage of 160% (see "Our Long-Term Incentive Program" below). 
Our 2018 Annual Performance Program 
Program Opportunities 
We provide annual performance-based cash bonus and restricted stock opportunities to our executive officers to emphasize achievement of rigorous annual performance goals, provide incentive to achieve our strategic business objectives, and align our executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders. 
Our Compensation Committee establishes the cash bonus and restricted stock opportunities available to each executive officer as a percent of the officer's annual base salary. Under our annual performance program, if the threshold goal is not achieved, our executive officers do not earn a payout. If the maximum goal is exceeded, the payout percentage is capped at 200% of the target opportunity.  MASCO 2019  |  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Our executive officers had the following target opportunities in 2018 under our annual performance program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Keith J. Allman    150%             167%          
 Richard A. O'Reagan      75%             75%          
 Kenneth G. Cole    65%             65%          
[END TABLE]
In 2018, our Compensation Committee increased Mr. Allman's restricted stock award target opportunity from 150% to 167% of his annual base salary. In making this decision, our Compensation Committee took into consideration a number of factors, including our strong earnings growth, ROIC and total shareholder return relative to our peers as well as Mr. Allman's overall pay positioning. Our Compensation Committee determined to increase Mr. Allman's target equity compensation opportunity to ensure his long-term interests with those of our shareholders. Neither Mr. Allman's annual base salary or cash bonus opportunity increased in 2018. 
Performance Metrics 
Our Compensation Committee selected operating profit and working capital as a percent of sales metrics for our annual 2018 performance program because it believed that improvement in these metrics would continue to reinforce our executive officers' focus on long-term growth and capital efficiency and drive stockholder value. These metrics are easily derived from our audited financial statements, which our Compensation Committee believes provides transparency both for our stockholders (as requested from stockholders when we sought feedback) and our executive officers. Our Compensation Committee gave a 75% weighting to the operating profit metric and a 25% weighting to the working capital as a percent of sales metric. 
Program Targets and Achievement 
In setting our performance targets, our Compensation Committee reviews our operating profit forecast for the year, taking into account general economic and industry conditions. In establishing the 2018 performance targets, it was expected there would be continued improvement in the overall economy, that consumer spending for both large and small home improvement projects and housing starts would increase in 2018 and that there would be improved performance from all of our businesses. Our Compensation Committee also expected that we would incur increasing expenses related to commodity inflation, freight and logistics. 
In 2018, we achieved 72% of our operating profit target and 140% of our working capital as a percent of sales target. After weighting the operating profit metric at 75% and the working capital as a percent of sales metric at 25%, our performance percentage for the 2018 annual performance program was 89% of target.  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  |  MASCO 2019 
To calculate achievement of our operating profit performance target, we adjusted our 2018 reported operating profit from continuing operations of $1,211 million to exclude the effects of expense recognized due a purchase accounting adjustment related to our acquisition of Kichler Lighting ($40 million), rationalization charges ($14 million) and other unusual non-recurring net gains and losses ($7 million). Our operating profit for purposes of the annual performance program was $1,272 million. 
To determine achievement of our working capital as a percent of sales performance target, we define working capital as a percent of sales as a twelve-month average of our reported accounts receivable and inventories, less accounts payable, divided by our reported sales for the year. For 2018, our working capital as a percent of sales was 15.1%. 
Compensation Paid Under the 2018 Program 
We calculated the actual cash bonuses to be paid and restricted stock award values to be granted to our executive officers under the 2018 annual performance program by multiplying the target opportunities for each executive officer, by the 89% performance percentage (except for Mr. Shah; see note below) and multiplying that result by each executive officer's base salary as of December 31, 2018, as follows:

In 2012, our Compensation Committee established a long-term incentive program to provide a meaningful incentive for our executive officers to achieve long-term growth and profitability. Under our 2016-2018 LTCIP, our executive officers had the opportunity to earn a performance award in cash based on our achievement of a performance goal over the three-year period. Under our long-term incentive program, if the threshold goal is not achieved, our executive officers do not earn a payout. If the maximum goal is exceeded, the payout percentage is capped at 200% of the target opportunity. 
Our Compensation Committee established the long-term incentive program opportunity available to each executive officer as a percent of the executive officer's annual base salary at the beginning of each three-year performance period. Our executive officers had the following LTCIP target opportunities under the 2016-2018 LTCIP:

In 2017, to further align our executives' compensation with the interests of our stockholders, our Compensation Committee modified our long-term incentive program by replacing the cash award with performance-based restricted stock units ("PRSUs"). Beginning in 2017, PRSUs have been granted to our executive officers at the beginning of each three-year performance period under the Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP"). The grant of PRSUs may entitle our executive officers to receive shares of our stock based on achieving a performance goal over a three-year period. For 2018, our executive officers continued to have the opportunity to receive a performance award in cash in connection with the 2016-2018 LTCIP performance period. 
Performance Metric 
Our Compensation Committee chose the ROIC performance metric because ROIC reinforces our executive officers' focus on capital efficiency and consistent return on capital and helps ensure our executive officers are encouraged to make new, profitable investments. Additionally, our stockholders continue to provide us feedback that ROIC is a measure of importance to them in their assessment of our long-term stockholder value.

Program Targets and Achievement 
Our Compensation Committee established the following ROIC goals and corresponding payout percentages for the 2016-2018 LTCIP performance period and the 2017-2019 and 2018-2020 LTIP performance periods.

We grant stock options annually to our executive officers. The value of the stock option grants approximates the equity target opportunity for each executive officer with respect to our annual performance program. Our Compensation Committee believes that stock options are an important component of our executive compensation program because they align our executive officers' long-term interests with those of our stockholders by reinforcing the goal of long-term share price appreciation. In 2018, our Compensation Committee awarded to our executive officers the following stock options that vest ratably over five years:

Other Components of our Executive Compensation Program 
Base Salary 
We pay our executive officers a base salary to provide each of them with a minimum, base level of cash compensation. In determining the base salary adjustments for our executive officers, our Compensation Committee conducts a review with our CEO of the performance and contributions of our executive officers in the prior year; considers market survey data in published executive compensation surveys for companies with annual revenues similar to ours and significant changes in the scope and complexity of the executive officer's role; and receives input from Semler Brossy. 
Based on our Compensation Committee's review and analysis, our Compensation Committee approved the following base salary increases in 2018:

Perquisites and Other Compensation 
We offer a limited number of perquisites to our executive officers, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Personal use of our Company aircraft, which we maintain for business purposes. Our Compensation Committee has evaluated our  policies and valuation practices for personal use of these aircraft, and our Board has requested that our CEO use our aircraft for both business and personal travel, with personal travel subject to prior approval by the Chair of our Board. We may  occasionally permit other executive officers to use our aircraft for personal travel.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An estate and financial planning program to assist in financial planning and tax preparation. This program provides up to  $10,000 per year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Relocation benefits, which may include reimbursement for certain moving and temporary living expenses and incidental costs,  and travel allowances.  
[END TABLE]
Retirement Programs 
We maintain the following defined contribution retirement plans for all of our employees, including our executive officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 401(k) Savings Plan: Our 401(k) Savings Plan is a tax-qualified plan that includes  a matching and profit sharing component, if applicable.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benefits Restoration Plan ("BRP"): Our BRP enables all of our highly-compensated employees to obtain the full  financial benefit of the 401(k) Savings Plan, notwithstanding various limitations imposed on the plans under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code").  
[END TABLE]
Our executive officers may also be entitled to receive benefits under the following frozen defined benefit plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Masco Corporation Pension Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• BRP applicable to the Masco Corporation Pension Plan; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"): Mr. Sznewajs is the only current executive officer eligible  to receive benefits under the SERP.  
[END TABLE]
In 2010, we froze accruals in all of these defined benefit plans, as well as in all of our other defined benefit plans offered to our U.S. employees. Consequently, the pension benefits ultimately payable to executive officers are essentially fixed, although Mr. Sznewajs's vesting in the frozen accrued SERP benefit has continued. Mr. Sznewajs will not be fully vested in his frozen SERP benefit unless he continues to be employed with us until he is age 55, or we experience a change in control (see "Payment Upon a Change in Control" below). 
OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS 
We Provide Long-Term Equity Incentives 
We believe that having a significant ownership interest in our stock is critical to aligning the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, restricted stock awards and stock options are important components of our executive officers' compensation. Our equity awards are priced based on the closing price on the date of grant, unless the grant date occurs within ten days prior to the release of our financial results. In that event, the grant is effective at the end of the first trading day after the release of the results and priced based on the closing price of our common stock on that date. Our restricted stock awards and stock options vest in 20% installments over five years. Five-year vesting defers  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  |  MASCO 2019 
the executives' realization of the full benefit of equity-based compensation for a substantial period of time and is longer than typical market practice. The value our executive officers ultimately realize from equity awards depends on the long-term performance of our common stock. Further, upon retirement, equity awards generally continue to vest in accordance with the remaining vesting period. Our executive officers understand that our performance will continue to impact them financially even after they retire, thereby reinforcing their focus on the long-term enhancement of stockholder value. 
We Have a Long-Term Incentive Program 
Through our stockholder engagement we learned that our stockholders strongly support a performance compensation program that measures performance over several years. Based on this feedback, in 2012, we implemented our long-term incentive program, which measures performance over a three-year period. For the 2018-2020 performance period we are measuring performance based on ROIC. As a result, a significant portion of our executive officers' compensation opportunity is based on the achievement of a three-year performance goal. 
In 2017, to further align our executives' compensation with the interests of our stockholders, our Compensation Committee modified our long-term incentive program by replacing the cash award with PRSUs. Beginning in 2017, PRSUs are granted to our executive officers at the beginning of each three-year performance period under the LTIP. The grant of PRSUs may entitle our executive officers to receive shares of our stock if we achieve a performance goal over a three-year period. For 2018, our executive officers continued to have the opportunity to receive a performance award in cash in connection with the 2016-2018 LTCIP performance period. 
We Can Clawback Incentive Compensation 
If we restate our financial statements, other than as a result of changes to accounting rules or regulations, our Compensation Committee may recover from our executives incentive compensation that was paid or granted in the three-year period prior to the restatement, regardless of whether misconduct caused the restatement. 
We Require Minimum Levels of Stock Ownership by our Executives 
We require minimum stock ownership for our executive officers to further reinforce the alignment of their long- term financial interests with the interests of our stockholders. This requirement ensures that our executive officers maintain a substantial investment in our common stock and that a meaningful amount of each executive officer's personal net worth is invested in our Company. Our executive officers are required to achieve the stock ownership necessary to meet the stock ownership requirements within three years of becoming subject to them. 
Our Compensation Committee reviews our executive officers' ownership of our common stock annually to ensure compliance with our stock ownership guidelines. Our executive officers' direct stock holdings and unvested restricted stock awards (but not unvested PRSUs) are counted toward satisfaction of the guidelines. As of December 31, 2018, when the closing price of our common stock was $29.24, each of our executive officers met the stock ownership requirement.

We Adopted Double-Trigger Change of Control Provisions for our Equity Awards 
The terms of our unvested equity awards provide that the awards will vest only if there is both a change in control of our Company and the recipient of the award is terminated from employment at the time of the change in control or within two years after the change in control, or terminates employment for good reason (for example, if his or her job duties have been significantly diminished), or if the recipient's awards are not replaced with comparable awards by the acquiring company. 
Our Compensation Committee Oversees an Annual Compensation Risk Evaluation 
Our Compensation Committee annually oversees a risk assessment of our compensation programs, including our executive compensation programs, focusing on the components of our compensation programs and analyzing whether those components present undue risk to us. In 2018, our Compensation Committee reviewed the risk assessment process to assure it reflects current best practices. As a result of this review, the risk assessment incorporates consideration of our material business risks and their potential impact on our compensation programs. The Compensation Committee has concluded that our programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. While the compensation program is designed to balance short- and long-term rewards, the largest portion of the compensation opportunity for our executive officers is through equity-based long-term incentives. Executive officers are also required to own a substantial amount of our stock to further encourage a long-term perspective. Our annual cash bonus and stock award programs, LTCIP and LTIP have established maximum payout opportunities in line with competitive practice.

We believe several features of our compensation programs, including the terms and conditions of our equity plan, improve our retention of our executive officers and also reduce the potential that executive officers might engage in post-termination conduct that would be harmful to us. Our executive officers generally forfeit unvested awards of restricted stock, stock options and PRSUs when their employment terminates prior to retirement. Additionally, executive officers may only exercise vested options for a limited period of time following termination. The terms of our awards prohibit our executive officers from competing with us for one year after termination. If an executive officer violates this restriction, we can recover the gain the executive officer realized from awards that vested within two years prior to termination. 
We Prohibit Excise Tax Gross-Up Payments 
Our Board has adopted a policy prohibiting excise tax gross-up payments, except for such payments committed to in equity awards and frozen SERP agreements entered into prior to 2012. Specifically, equity awards made in 2012 and thereafter are not included for purposes of determining future excise tax gross-up PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  |  MASCO 2019 
payments. With the exception of tax equalization gross-up payments made to employees in connection with reimbursement of relocation or foreign expatriate expenses incurred at our request, we do not provide any other tax gross-up payments. 
We Prohibit Hedging and Pledging 
Our anti-hedging and anti-pledging policy prohibits our executive officers and our directors from engaging in any hedging transactions (including transactions involving options, puts, calls, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds or other derivatives) that are designed to hedge or speculate on any change in the market value of our equity or debt securities. Additionally, our executive officers and directors are prohibited from making any future purchases of our securities on margin or from pledging our securities as collateral for a loan, unless the arrangement is preapproved by our Governance Committee for any executive or by our Board for any director. 
We Do Not Have Contractual Termination Arrangements 
Our executive officers do not have employment contracts and are "at-will" employees who may be terminated at our discretion. We believe this preserves greater flexibility in our employment arrangements with our executive officers. Our executive officers also do not have change in control or severance contracts, although we have, from time to time, entered into severance arrangements with departing executive officers. For further discussion regarding change in control, see "Payment Upon Change In Control" below. 
OUR ANNUAL COMPENSATION REVIEW PROCESS 
We review and make decisions regarding the amount of eligible annual performance-based restricted stock awards, cash bonus payments and stock option grants in the first quarter of the year. We believe that determining these elements of compensation together at the beginning of the year gives us a better foundation for establishing our performance criteria and opportunity levels for the current year. This practice also better enables our Compensation Committee to determine our executive officers' appropriate compensation mix and to align compensation with ongoing talent review and development in conjunction with our annual management talent review and development process. 
Annual Management Talent Review and Development Process 
Our annual management talent review and development process is used by our Compensation Committee and our CEO in making compensation decisions and for succession planning purposes. As part of this process, our CEO provides our Compensation Committee with an assessment of each executive who reports to him. The assessment includes an evaluation of each executive's performance, development, progress and potential for advancement, and considers market demand for the executive's skill set. Our Compensation Committee also receives information, analyses and recommendations from our Vice President, Chief Human Resource Officer. While our Compensation Committee gives significant weight to the evaluations by our CEO, the final determination of compensation to be paid to our executive officers, including our CEO, rests solely with our Compensation Committee. 
Compensation Data Considered by our Compensation Committee 
Tally Sheets 
Our Compensation Committee reviews a tally sheet that summarizes the various components of total compensation for our executive officers and other members of management. The tally sheet includes base salary, annual performance-based restricted stock and cash bonus, LTCIP awards, stock options,  MASCO 2019  |  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
dividends on unvested shares of restricted stock, and our costs for the foregoing and for perquisites and other benefits, including the annual costs under retirement plans. The tally sheet allows our Compensation Committee to compare an executive officer's compensation with the compensation of our other executive officers as part of its consideration of internal and external pay equity. Amounts actually realized by an executive officer from prior equity grants are not necessarily a factor in establishing current compensation, although the current value of outstanding equity awards may be considered by our Compensation Committee when assessing pay equity. 
Market Data 
Our Compensation Committee also reviews compensation for each of our executive officers with compensation information disclosed in the proxy statements of our peer group and with AonHewitt's and Willis Towers Watson's published compensation surveys for companies with annual revenues between $5 and $10 billion. When we achieve targeted levels of performance, our executive compensation program seeks to provide total target compensation (base salary, target annual bonus and the target value of long-term incentives) at approximately the median compensation level provided to executives in comparable positions at these companies. While our Compensation Committee generally targets total compensation for each executive officer at the median, it considers other factors, such as performance, the officer's roles and responsibilities and the length of time the officer has served in the current position. Our Compensation Committee also reviews actual compensation paid as reported in published surveys and by our peer group to help inform individual pay decisions. We believe understanding market data allows us to attract and retain the talent we need while enabling us to manage our compensation expense. 
The following table shows how our current executive officers' target compensation and actual compensation in 2018 compared to market data published in 2018. Actual compensation is defined as the sum of base salary, actual cash bonuses paid under our annual program and under our LTCIP, and the grant date fair value of restricted stock awards and stock options.

Finally, our Compensation Committee reviews the overall pay-for-performance alignment of our CEO's compensation compared to our peer group over one-year and three-year periods. During 2018, our Compensation Committee reviewed data showing that our total stockholder return was at the 94th percentile of our peers and at the 93rd percentile of the S&P 500 for the three-year period ended December 31, 2017. While our CEO's target compensation approximated the median of our peer group during this three-year period, our CEO's realizable compensation was at the 52nd percentile of our peer  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  |  MASCO 2019 
group. We define realizable compensation as the sum of salary, actual cash bonus, the target value of long-term cash incentives, and the value of restricted stock awards and stock options based on our stock price as of December 31, 2017. 
Our Peer Group 
Given the many and diverse businesses in which we operate, composition of an appropriate peer group is challenging, as historically there have been few companies providing a mix of products similar to ours. Our Compensation Committee annually considers the composition of our peer group and believes that our current peer group listed below reflects the companies with whom we compete for executive talent and that have a range of annual revenues and business and operational characteristics similar to ours.

Our approach to executive compensation emphasizes corporate rather than individual performance, echoing our operating strategy that encourages collaboration and cooperation among our businesses and corporate functions. We believe that the effectiveness of our executive compensation programs requires not only objective, formula-based arrangements, but also the exercise of discretion and sound business judgment by our Compensation Committee. Accordingly, our Compensation Committee retains discretion to adjust the mix of cash and equity compensation, adjust the mix of restricted stock and stock options awarded, and offer different forms of equity-based compensation. With this discretion, our Compensation Committee is best able to reward the individual contributions of each executive officer and to respond to an executive's expanding responsibilities, market practices and our changing business needs. 
In addition to granting performance-based restricted stock based on prior year performance, our Compensation Committee also has the discretion to award shares of time-based restricted stock to our executive officers, other than our CEO, if it determines that an executive officer has made outstanding individual contributions during the prior year. The total value of these awards cannot exceed 20% of the combined annual base salaries of the executive officers (excluding the salary of our CEO). No discretionary awards were made in 2018. 
Outside Compensation Consultant 
Our Compensation Committee has engaged Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC (Semler Brossy) as its compensation consultant. Semler Brossy was chosen by our Compensation Committee based on its deep experience in the area of executive compensation and its creative and proactive approach in analyzing  MASCO 2019  |  PART II - COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
executive compensation practices and programs. During 2018, Semler Brossy attended Compensation Committee meetings, met with our Compensation Committee in executive sessions without our executive officers or other members of management and met individually with our Compensation Committee members and our Compensation Committee Chair. Semler Brossy advised our Compensation Committee on its overall implementation of our compensation objectives, on the Company's peer group, on director compensation practices and on the compensation for our executive officers, including performing a competitive analysis of CEO pay levels within our peer group, as well as for similarly situated companies outside of that group. After considering the factors promulgated by the SEC for assessing the independence of its advisers, our Compensation Committee has determined that the work of Semler Brossy has not raised any conflict of interest. 
TAX TREATMENT 
For tax years beginning before January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limited the deductibility of annual compensation in excess of $1 million paid to certain of our executive officers, unless this compensation qualified as "performance-based." Section 162(m) was amended in December 2017 by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to eliminate the exemption for performance-based compensation, other than for payments that qualify for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. 
Prior to 2018, our stockholder-approved plan permitted our Compensation Committee to grant cash and equity awards intended to qualify under Section 162(m) so that they may be tax-deductible. Because this exemption is no longer available, compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our executive officers generally will not be deductible unless the compensation qualifies for certain transition relief. 
CONCLUSION 
We recognize the importance of attracting and retaining executive officers who can effectively lead our business, and in motivating them to maximize our corporate performance and drive long-term value for our stockholders. We believe in rewarding our executive officers to a significant degree based on our performance. We continue to thoughtfully and thoroughly analyze our compensation practices and programs and to regularly reach out to a significant number of our stockholders to understand their perspectives regarding our compensation programs. We believe our compensation practices and programs strongly align our executive officers' interests with the long-term interests of stockholders, reward our executive officers based on our performance and incentivize them to focus on our strategic business objectives.

Compensation Committee Report 
The Organization and Compensation Committee, which is responsible for overseeing the Company's executive compensation programs, has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on our review and discussion, the Organization and Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in Masco Corporation's proxy statement.

Proposal 2: Advisory Vote to Approve the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
We are seeking your advisory vote approving the compensation paid to our named executive officers (whom we refer to as "executive officers" in this Proposal 2). We believe the structure of our executive compensation programs promotes the long-term interests of our stockholders by attracting and retaining talented executives and motivating them to achieve our critical business objectives and to create long-term value for our stockholders. 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting, we submitted a non-binding advisory proposal to our stockholders to approve the compensation paid to our executive officers (a "say-on-pay proposal"). We also submitted a proposal to our shareholders at our 2018 Annual Meeting, as to the frequency of seeking their non-binding approval of our say-on-pay proposal and determined that such vote will occur annually. Approximately 98% of the votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation paid to our executive officers. We believe that this strong approval resulted from our continued focus on pay-for-performance. 
Our executive officers earned compensation pursuant to the following performance-based compensation programs. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our 2018 annual performance program was based on operating profit and working capital as a percent of sales goals. We  achieved a performance percentage of 89%, and as a result, consistent with our commitment to pay-for-performance, our executive officers earned restricted stock awards  and cash bonuses based on this achievement.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our 2016-2018 Long Term Cash Incentive Program was based on return on invested capital ("ROIC"). For the  three-year period 2016-2018, we exceeded the target ROIC goal and achieved a performance percentage of 160%.  
[END TABLE]
Our executive officers' potential performance-based compensation represents a significant percentage of total annual target compensation. In 2018, the percentage of total target compensation (base salary, target annual cash bonus and restricted stock award and the target value of long-term incentives) that was performance-based was 87% for our CEO and 74% for our other executive officers. 
We believe that having a significant ownership interest in our stock is critical to aligning the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Accordingly, equity grants in the form of restricted stock awards and stock options are an important component of compensation for our executive officers. In 2017, we modified our long-term incentive program by replacing the cash award with performance- based restricted stock units. 
Our Board recommends a vote FOR the following resolution providing an advisory approval of the compensation paid to our named executive officers: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the related materials disclosed in this proxy statement, is hereby approved. 
Although the vote on this proposal is advisory and non-binding, our Compensation Committee and our Board will review and consider the result of the vote when making future determinations regarding our executive compensation programs. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares entitled to vote thereon is required for the approval of the foregoing resolution. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast, and therefore do not affect the approval of the resolution.  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  |  MASCO 2019

• The amounts reflected in the Restricted Stock Awards column above and in the Stock Awards column (c) of the Summary  Compensation Table are the estimated fair value of the restricted stock award opportunity for the applicable performance year, even though the restricted stock award is not granted until the following year. Although the SEC rules require the  estimated fair value to be based on the probable outcome of the performance or service award at the grant date, the Stock Awards column (c) reflects the actual awards for the 2018, 2017 and 2016 performance year, as applicable, since the grant  date for the award occurred when the award was actually determined in early 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The threshold, target and maximum dollar values applicable to 2018 performance are reported in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table  below. Our executive officers do not realize the value of restricted stock awards until those awards vest over the five-year vesting period following the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amounts reflected in the Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units column above and in the Stock Awards column  (c) of the Summary Compensation Table for 2018 are based upon the number of PRSUs granted on March 21, 2018 under our LTIP, which we valued at $41.55 per share, the closing price of our stock that day, and assuming the target award would be  earned at the end of the three-year performance period under our LTIP. If the maximum goal under our LTIP is achieved or exceeded, the payout to each executive officer would be: $4,004,080 for Mr. Allman; $1,024,800 for Mr. Sznewajs;  $787,500 for Mr. O'Reagan; $539,760 for Mr. Shah; and $578,500 for Mr. Cole. The actual number of shares of stock awarded, if any, will be determined after the three-year performance period concludes on December 31, 2020.   
[END TABLE]
As explained in further detail in the footnote "Total (column h)," as a result of the inclusion of the grants of PRSUs for the three-year periods beginning in 2017 and 2018, the compensation paid to our executive officers for 2017 and 2018 appears higher than the amounts decided upon by our Compensation Committee for the respective year. 
Option Awards (column d): This column reports the aggregate grant date fair value of stock options, calculated in accordance with accounting guidance. In determining the fair market value of stock options, we used the same assumptions that can be found in the notes to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the corresponding year. These amounts do not correspond to the actual value the executive officer will realize, which will depend on overall market conditions, the future performance of our common stock and the timing of exercise of the option. 
Non-Equity Plan Incentive Compensation (column e): The amounts reported in this column are based on the achievement of our performance targets, which are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  |  MASCO 2019 
above. In addition to the annual performance-based cash bonuses that were earned for the year indicated, this column includes, in accordance with SEC rules, the performance-based payments under our LTCIP that were earned for the three-year period ending in the year indicated, as follows:

[END TABLE]
As explained in further detail in the footnote "Total (column h)," as a result of the inclusion of LTCIP cash payments for the three-year periods ending in 2017 and 2018, the compensation paid to our executive officers for 2017 and 2018 appears higher than the amounts decided upon by our Compensation Committee for the respective year. 
Change in Pension Value & Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Earnings (column f): This column reports changes in the sum of year-end pension values, which reflect actuarial factors and variations in interest rates used to calculate present values. Increases in pension values do not represent increased benefit accruals, since benefits in our domestic defined benefit plans were frozen effective January 1, 2010. These values were obtained by comparing the present value of accumulated benefits for December 31 of the year indicated (shown for 2018 in the "2018 Pension Plan Table") to the comparable amount for the prior year. We calculated the pension values for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016 using the same assumptions that can be found in the notes to our financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the corresponding years. The executive officers did not have any above-market earnings under any of the plans in which they participate. The 2018 Summary Compensation Table shows no increases for 2018, since all values decreased due to the effect of rising interest rate assumptions used in the calculations. 
All Other Compensation (column g): We provided our executive officers with the following other benefits in 2018:

Total (column h): A significant portion of the increase in total compensation for our executive officers in 2018 and 2017 as compared to 2016 is a result of our transition in 2017 from cash payments awarded under our LTCIP to PRSUs granted under our LTIP. Based on SEC rules, the cash awards paid under our LTCIP are reported in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column following the conclusion of the three-year performance period and the determination of the award. Conversely, we are required to report the grant date fair market value of the PRSUs granted under our LTIP in the Stock Awards column for the year in which the grant was made. For enhanced comparability to 2016 compensation reported in this table, the adjusted total compensation of each executive officer (except Mr. Shah, who was not included in our Summary Compensation Table in 2017 or 2016), excluding the grant date fair market value of the PRSUs granted in 2018 and 2017, is as follows:

[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amounts that correspond to grant date "3/21/2018" reflect the threshold, target, and maximum opportunities  under our LTIP relating to the 2018-2020 performance period. In 2018, our executives received grants of PRSUs under our LTIP, which we valued at $41.55 per share, the closing price of our common stock on the day of the grant, and assuming the target  award would be earned at the end of the three-year performance period under our LTIP. The actual number of shares awarded, if any, will be determined after the three-year performance period concludes on December 31, 2020.

All Other Option Awards (column a): These amounts reflect the number of stock options granted to each executive officer in 2018. The stock options granted vest in equal installments of 20% over a period of five years and remain exercisable until ten years from the date of grant. 
Grant Date Fair Value of Stock and Option Awards (column b): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amounts that correspond to grant date "3/21/2018" are based upon the number of PRSUs granted on March 21,  2018 under our LTIP, which we valued at $41.55 per share, the closing price of our stock on the day of the grant, and assuming the target award would be earned at the end of the three-year performance period under our LTIP.

• The amounts that correspond to grant date "2/7/2018" reflect the grant date fair value of the stock option award  on the grant date, which is determined in accordance with accounting guidance. Regardless of the value placed on a stock option on the grant date, the actual value of the option will depend on the market value of our common stock at a future date  when the option is exercised.

Unvested restricted shares are held in the executive officer's name, and the executive officer has the right to vote the shares and receive dividends on the restricted shares, but may not sell the shares until they vest. The value each executive officer will realize when the restricted shares vest will depend on the value of our common stock on the vesting date.

RETIREMENT PLANS 
This section describes the retirement plans available to our executive officers. 
Defined Contribution Plans 
Our defined contribution plans are the tax-qualified 401(k) Savings Plan and the non-qualified Benefits Restoration Plan ("BRP") applicable to the 401(k) Savings Plan. All of our executive officers participate in both of our defined contribution plans. We offer no other plans of deferred compensation that would permit the election of deferrals of cash compensation by our executive officers. 
401(k) Savings Plan 
Our 401(k) Savings Plan is available to eligible employees, and provides two employer contribution components, if applicable. The first employer contribution component is a matching contribution under which we match a percentage of an employee's compensation deferred into the 401(k) Savings Plan. The second component is a discretionary profit sharing contribution that is guided by the operating profit performance target goal used to determine annual performance-based cash bonuses and restricted stock awards (see "Our 2018 Annual Performance Program" above). Our Compensation Committee has established our maximum contribution percentage at 10% of each participant's annual earnings (base salary and cash bonus). 
Defined Contribution Portion of the BRP 
The defined contribution portion of our BRP is available to our highly compensated employees and is not funded. Under the BRP, we make account allocations reflecting our 401(k) Savings Plan employer match (in 2018, for contributions up to $18,500), profit sharing contribution amounts that exceed the Code's limitations, and earnings (or losses) on participants' accounts. Following a participant's termination of employment, the BRP account is paid by us in a lump sum.  MASCO 2019  |  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

Defined Benefit Pension Plans 
Our defined benefit pension plans are the tax-qualified Masco Corporation Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"), the non-qualified BRP applicable to the Pension Plan and the non-qualified Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"). Our defined benefit pension plans were frozen for future benefit accruals effective January 1, 2010. Consequently, the defined benefit pension benefits accrued for each of our executive officers are essentially fixed. 
The Pension Plan and BRP 
The Pension Plan and BRP provide that at age 65, a participant receives monthly payment for the remainder of his or her life, with five years' payments guaranteed. Employees became 100% vested in their pension benefit after completing five years of employment with us. The benefits paid are reduced for early retirement if commenced prior to age 65. The maximum credited service under the Pension Plan and the defined benefit portion of the BRP was 30 years. A participant who has ten or more years of service with us is eligible to receive a disability benefit equal to the participant's accrued benefit.  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  |  MASCO 2019 
Messrs. Allman, Sznewajs, O'Reagan, Shah and Cole are participants in our Pension Plan, and each is 100% vested in their Pension Plan benefits. Messrs. Allman, Sznewajs and Shah are participants in our BRP applicable to the Pension Plan. 
SERP 
Mr. Sznewajs is the only executive officer that participates in the SERP, which provides that at age 65, he will receive a monthly payment for life of an amount up to 60% of the average of his highest three years' cash compensation (base salary plus annual cash bonus, up to 60% of that year's maximum bonus opportunity) earned on or before January 1, 2010. SERP payments are reduced by certain benefits paid by our other retirement plans or by retirement benefits payable by other employers. The maximum benefit under the SERP accrues after 15 years. When the SERP was frozen on January 1, 2010, Mr. Sznewajs's accrual of 52% was frozen, and he is now 60% vested. Mr. Sznewajs will not be fully vested in his frozen SERP benefit unless he continues to be employed with us until he reaches age 55, or we have a change in control. 
The SERP provides a disability benefit if Mr. Sznewajs becomes disabled while employed by us. The disability benefit is paid until the earlier of death, recovery from disability or age 65; is offset by payments from long-term disability insurance we have paid for; and is equal to 60% of his annual salary and bonus (up to 60% of the maximum bonus opportunity) as of January 1, 2010. At age 65, payments revert to a calculation based on the highest three-year average compensation as of January 1, 2010. Under the SERP, Mr. Sznewajs and his spouse may also receive medical benefits. 
The present value of SERP payments to Mr. Sznewajs is reported in the 2018 Pension Plan Table below. His surviving spouse would receive reduced benefits. 
Pension Plan Table 
The 2018 Pension Plan Table below reports the estimated present values on December 31, 2018 of accumulated benefits for each of our executive officers under the Pension Plan, the defined benefit portion of the BRP and the SERP, as applicable. The amounts payable to Mr. Sznewajs under the SERP have been reduced by amounts payable to him under the Pension Plan and the defined benefit portion of the BRP. Mr. Sznewajs' SERP amount has also been reduced by the January 1, 2010 benefits payable under the profit sharing component of the 401(k) Savings Plan and the defined contribution portion of the BRP.

Number of Years Credited Service (column a): This column reports:

• For the SERP, credited service through January 1, 2010, for years of employment only with us.  
[END TABLE]
We have not granted additional accruals to any of the executive officers in any of these retirement plans, and none of these plans provides for personal contributions or additional income deferral elections. 
Present Value of Accumulated Benefits (column b): Amounts in this column were calculated as of December 31, 2018 using the normal form of benefit payable under each plan using: (a) base pay only for the Pension Plan and BRP, (b) base pay plus cash bonus for the SERP, and (c) the same discount rates and mortality assumptions as described in the notes to financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Although SEC disclosure rules require a present value calculation, none of these defined benefit pension plans (other than the SERP and the BRP, in the event of a change in control) provides benefits in a lump sum. 
PAYMENT UPON CHANGE IN CONTROL 
We do not have employment agreements or change in control agreements with any of our executive officers. If we experienced a change in control, our executive officers would receive lump-sum payments of benefits under the BRP and, for Mr. Sznewajs, the SERP, that otherwise would be paid over time. Additionally, these two plans and our Long Term Stock Incentive Plan provide that participants could receive accelerated vesting and reimbursement (limited, for equity grants, to those made prior to 2012) in the case of imposition of excise tax upon a change in control. Upon a change in control, Mr. Sznewajs' frozen SERP accrual of 52% would not change, but his vesting in this benefit would advance from 60% to 100%. None of our plans provide for additional accrual of benefits in the case of a change in control. 
The following table reports the values of all payments (other than from our tax-qualified retirement plans) assuming a change in control (and a termination of employment under certain conditions) had occurred on December 31, 2018.

[END TABLE]
Equity (column a): A change in control would trigger vesting (assuming a termination of employment under certain conditions had occurred with respect to awards granted beginning in 2013) of unvested restricted stock and stock option awards, the total value of which is shown in this column. This column is comprised of the incremental values for vestings of restricted stock (as shown in the last column of the 2018  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS  |  MASCO 2019 
Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End table above), plus the intrinsic values for vesting of stock options (based on our closing stock price of $29.24 on December 31, 2018): $1,231,730 for Mr. Allman; $432,413 for Mr. Sznewajs; $195,307 for Mr. O'Reagan; $147,027 for Mr. Shah; and $176,650 for Mr. Cole. 
SERP and BRP Payments (column b): Amounts calculated for both the SERP and the BRP utilize the discount rates and mortality assumptions equal to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation discount rates for lump sums in plan terminations, as in effect four months prior to the change in control, and the UP-1984 mortality table (both of which differ from the rates and assumptions used to calculate the lump sums reported in the Pension Plan Table). Amounts in this column also include amounts shown in the 2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table above. 
Excise Tax Reimbursement (column c): Excise tax reimbursements apply only to agreements and equity grants entered into prior to 2012. At December 31, 2018, no individual's payments would have exceeded applicable limits in the Code for parachute payments; therefore, no amounts are shown in this column. 
PAYMENT UPON RETIREMENT, TERMINATION, DISABILITY OR DEATH 
Our executive officers may also be entitled to receive certain benefits upon retirement, voluntary or involuntary termination, disability or death, as described below. The benefits reported in the following tables would be paid on a monthly basis and, other than the BRP defined contribution component, not as lump sum payments. 
Retirement 
Upon retirement at or after age 65, our executive officers would be fully vested in the accumulated pension benefits shown in the table below. Our restricted stock and stock option awards do not vest upon retirement; following retirement, equity awards generally continue to vest in accordance with the remaining vesting period.

Termination 
If voluntary or involuntary termination of employment had occurred on December 31, 2018, our executive officers would be fully vested in the accumulated pension benefits shown in the table below. Absent an agreement for post-termination extended vesting, termination of employment would result in forfeiture to us of all unvested restricted stock awards and unvested stock options. Vested stock options would remain exercisable for 30 days, in the case of voluntary termination, or three months, in the case of involuntary termination, but not beyond the originally-specified exercise period.

SERP Benefit (column a): Mr. Sznewajs would have been 60% vested in his SERP benefit if his employment had terminated on December 31, 2018. 
Disability 
If disability had terminated the employment of any of our executive officers on December 31, 2018, the executive officer would receive the benefits as reported in the table below. In addition, each executive officer would receive a benefit of $144,000 per year, payable from our long-term disability insurance policy. Any disability benefit received would terminate upon the earliest of death, recovery from disability or age 65, at which time the applicable retirement, termination or death benefits would become effective. In addition, all restrictions on restricted shares would lapse and all unvested stock options would become exercisable for the period of time allowed under the original awards.

Other Arrangements 
As noted above in our "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," it is our general policy not to enter into contractual termination arrangements. On an individually-negotiated basis we may enter into severance arrangements or arrangements for an executive officer's services following termination of employment. Such arrangements may include continued vesting of restricted stock or options that would otherwise be forfeited, as well as provisions restricting competitive activities following termination.  MASCO 2019  |  PART III - COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
CEO PAY RATIO 
The median employee we identified for purposes of disclosing our 2017 pay ratio was selected by reviewing annual base salaries for all persons who were employed by us on October 1, 2017, excluding Mr. Allman, our President and CEO. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, seasonal or temporary basis and did not make any estimates, assumptions or adjustments to any annual base salaries. The individual identified in 2017 is no longer employed by us, and, as permitted by the SEC, we are electing to select another employee, whose 2017 annual base salary was substantially similar to the annual base salary of our original median employee. 
We calculated annual total compensation for our median employee using the same methodology we used for our executive officers as set forth in the above 2018 Summary Compensation Table. The total compensation of the median employee was $38,769, including wages, overtime pay, non-equity incentive program pay and company 401(k) match. The annual total compensation of our CEO was $11,636,439. The resulting pay ratio is 300:1. 
As discussed in the note to column h of our Summary Compensation Table, in 2018 we transitioned from cash payments awarded under our LTCIP to PRSUs granted under our LTIP. Based on SEC rules, we are required to include in Mr. Allman's total compensation for 2018 both the cash payment for the 2016-2018 performance period under the LTCIP and the grant date fair market value of the PRSUs for the 2018-2020 performance period under the LTIP, which could, if earned, entitle Mr. Allman to receive shares of our common stock. Excluding the grant date fair market value of the PRSUs for the 2018-2020 performance period, the pay ratio would have been 249:1.  PART IV - AUDIT MATTERS  |  MASCO 2019 
Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee consists of eight members of the Board of Directors, each of whom is independent. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling the Board's responsibility for oversight of the integrity of our financial statements, the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, the qualifications, independence, performance and remuneration of our independent registered public accounting firm ("independent auditors"), the performance of our internal audit function, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and compliance by our employees and officers with our Code of Business Ethics. Management is responsible for the accuracy of our financial statements and our reporting process, including our system of internal controls over financial reporting. In discharging its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management our audited financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and our processes to ensure the accuracy of our financial statements. 
The Audit Committee obtained from our independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the written disclosures and letter required under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, regarding PwC's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC any relationships that may impact PwC's objectivity and independence and satisfied itself as to PwC's independence. The Audit Committee confirmed that PwC's provision of non-audit services to us did not impair their independence. The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed under Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 1301, regarding communication with the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also met with PwC independent of management. 
Based on the reviews and discussions with management and the independent auditors described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. The Audit Committee also reappointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm, which stockholders are being asked to ratify.

Audit Committee Pre-approval Policies and Procedures 
Our Audit Committee has established a policy requiring its annual review and pre-approval of all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be performed by PwC. Our Audit Committee will, as necessary, consider and, if appropriate, approve the provision of additional audit and non-audit services by PwC that are not encompassed by our Audit Committee's annual pre-approval. Our Audit Committee has delegated to our Audit Committee Chair the approval authority, on a case-by-case basis, for services outside or in excess of our Audit Committee's aggregate pre-approved levels, provided that the Chair shall report any such decisions to our Audit Committee at its next regular meeting. All of the services referred to in the table above for 2018 were pre-approved by our Audit Committee or our Audit Committee Chair and none of the services approved by our Audit Committee during 2018 were under the de minimis exception to pre-approval contained in the applicable rules of the SEC.  PART IV - AUDIT MATTERS  |  MASCO 2019 
Proposal 3: Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors 
Our Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, remuneration, retention and oversight of the independent external audit firm retained to audit our financial statements. As part of its oversight, our Audit Committee and its Chair review and evaluate our lead audit engagement partner, and participate in the selection of the new lead audit engagement partner in conjunction with the mandated rotation of that partner. 
Our Audit Committee has selected the independent registered public accounting firm of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC") to audit our financial statements for the year 2019. We have retained PwC (or its predecessor) as our independent auditor since at least 1959, and our Audit Committee believes that the continued retention of PwC to serve as our independent auditor is in the best interests of our Company and our stockholders. 
Representatives of PwC will be present at our Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement and respond to appropriate questions. If the selection of PwC is not ratified, our Audit Committee will consider selecting another independent registered public accounting firm as our independent auditors. 
Our Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditors for the year 2019. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by shares entitled to vote is required for the ratification of the selection of independent auditors. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast, and therefore do not affect the ratification of the selection of independent auditors.

The Board of Directors of Masco Corporation is soliciting the enclosed proxy for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of Masco Corporation to be held at our corporate office at 17450 College Parkway, Livonia, Michigan 48152, on Friday, May 10, 2019 at 9:30 A.M.

 MASCO 2019  |  PART VI - GENERAL INFORMATION 
What is the difference between holding shares as a record holder and as a beneficial owner? 
If your shares are registered in your name with our registrar and transfer agent, Computershare, you are the "record holder" of those shares. If you are a record holder, we have provided these proxy materials directly to you. 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account, or with a bank or other holder of record, you are considered the "beneficial owner" of those shares held in "street name." If your shares are held in street name, these proxy materials have been forwarded to you by your bank or broker. As the beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote your shares. 
What is a broker non-vote? 
If your shares are held in "street name" through a bank, broker or other nominee, you must provide voting instructions to that organization. If you do not provide voting instructions, the organization may vote in its discretion on routine proposals, but not on non-routine proposals, which is called a "broker non-vote." Only Proposal 3, Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditors, is a routine proposal. 
How are abstentions and broker non-votes treated? 
Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast with respect to any of the proposals on the agenda, so they will not have an effect on the outcome of the proposals. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
To conduct business at our Annual Meeting, we must have a quorum of stockholders present. A quorum is present when a majority of the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote, as of the record date, are represented in person or by proxy. Broker non-votes and abstentions will be counted toward the establishment of the quorum. 
How can I submit my vote? 
There are four methods you can use to vote: by internet, by telephone, by mail or in person. Submitting your proxy by internet, telephone or mail will not affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting and change your vote. Unless you are voting in person, your vote must be received by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on May 9, 2019.

 PART VI - GENERAL INFORMATION  |  MASCO 2019 
How many votes are needed for each proposal to pass? 
All of the matters to be considered at our Annual Meeting require the approval of a majority of the votes that are actually cast. 
Our Bylaws provide that, in uncontested elections, directors are elected if the majority of votes cast FOR each nominee exceed the votes cast AGAINST such nominee. Proxies cannot be voted for a greater number of persons than the number of nominees named. Each director nominee will provide to us an irrevocable resignation if the majority of the votes cast are against him or her. The resignation will be effective within 90 days after the election results are certified, if the Board (excluding nominees who did not receive a majority of votes for their election) accepts the resignation, which it will do in the absence of a compelling reason otherwise. 
If you are the stockholder of record, and you sign and return a proxy card without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement, and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting. 
Is my proxy revocable? 
You may revoke your proxy before it is exercised by voting in person at the Annual Meeting, by timely delivering a subsequent proxy or by notifying us in writing of such revocation to the attention of Kenneth G. Cole, Secretary, at 17450 College Parkway, Livonia, Michigan 48152 before your proxy is voted. Unless you revoke your proxy in person at the meeting, your revocation must be received by 11:59 P.M. Eastern Time on May 9, 2019. 
Who is paying for the expenses involved in preparing and mailing this proxy statement? 
We are paying the expenses involved in preparing, assembling and mailing these proxy materials and all costs of soliciting proxies. Our executive officers and other employees may solicit proxies, without additional compensation, personally and by telephone and other means of communication. In addition, we have retained Morrow Sodali LLC, 470 West Avenue, Third Floor, Stamford, Connecticut 06902, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of $12,000, plus expenses. If you have questions about voting your shares, you may call Morrow Sodali LLC, at (877) 787-9239 (for individual stockholders) or (203) 658-9400 (for banks and brokerage firms). We will reimburse brokers and other persons holding our common stock in their names or in the names of their nominees for their reasonable expenses in forwarding proxy materials to beneficial owners. 
What happens if additional matters are presented at the Annual Meeting? 
Other than the items of business described in this proxy statement, we are not aware of any other business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Messrs. Allman and Cole, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If for any reason any of our director nominees is not available as a candidate, Messrs. Allman and Cole may vote your shares for another candidate (or candidates) who may be nominated by the Board, or the Board may reduce its size. 
What is "householding" and how does it affect me? 
The proxy rules of the SEC permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers and banks, to satisfy proxy statement delivery requirements for two or more stockholders sharing an address by delivering one  MASCO 2019  |  PART VI - GENERAL INFORMATION 
proxy statement to those stockholders. This procedure, known as "householding," reduces the amount of duplicate information that stockholders receive and lowers our printing and mailing costs. 
We have been notified that certain intermediaries will use householding for our proxy materials and our 2018 Annual Report. Therefore, only one proxy statement and 2018 Annual Report may have been delivered to your address if multiple stockholders share that address. Stockholders who wish to opt out of this procedure and receive separate copies of the proxy statement and annual report in the future, or stockholders who are receiving multiple copies and would like to receive only one copy, should contact their bank, broker or other nominee or us at the address and telephone number below. 
We will promptly send a separate copy of the proxy statement for the Annual Meeting or 2018 Annual Report if you send your request to webmaster@mascohq.com, call our Investor Relations Department at (313) 792-5500, or if you write to Investor Relations, Masco Corporation, 17450 College Parkway, Livonia, Michigan 48152.

We maintain a website at www.masco.com. The information on our website is not a part of this proxy statement, and it is not incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.  PART VI - GENERAL INFORMATION  |  MASCO 2019

PROXY STATEMENT PROPOSAL 
If you intend to present proposals to be included in our proxy statement for our 2020 Annual Meeting, you must give written notice of your intent to our Secretary on or before December 1, 2019 (120 calendar days prior to the anniversary of our mailing this proxy statement). The proposals must comply with SEC regulations under Rule 14a-8 for including stockholder proposals in a company's materials.

For each matter you intend to bring before the meeting, your notice must include a brief description of the business to be brought before the meeting; the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and, if such business includes a proposal to amend the Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment); the reasons for conducting the business at the meeting and any material interest you may have in such business; your name and address as it appears in our records; the number of shares of our common stock you own; a representation that you are a holder of record of shares of our stock entitled to vote at such meeting and you intend to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such business; and a representation as to whether you are part of a group that intends to deliver a proxy statement or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of our outstanding common stock required to approve or adopt such proposal, or if you intend to otherwise solicit proxies from stockholders in support of your proposal. 
DIRECTOR CANDIDATE NOMINATION 
If you wish to nominate director candidates for election to the Board at the 2020 Annual Meeting, you must submit the following information required by our Certificate of Incorporation to our Secretary no later than February 14, 2020: your name and address and the name and address of the person(s) to be nominated; a representation that you are a holder of record of shares of our common stock entitled to vote at such meeting and you intend to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to nominate the person(s) specified in the notice; a description of all arrangements or understandings between you and each nominee and any other person(s) (naming such person(s)) pursuant to which the nomination(s) is or are to be made by you; other information regarding each nominee you are proposing, as would have been required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to the SEC's proxy rules if the nominee had been nominated by the Board of Directors; and the written consent of each nominee to serve as our director if elected. In addition, our Bylaws require that the notice of intent to make a nomination shall be accompanied by a statement whether each nominee, if elected, intends to tender, promptly following such election, an irrevocable resignation effective upon such person's failure to receive the required vote for re-election at the next meeting at which such person would face re-election and upon the Board of Directors' acceptance of such resignation. Our Bylaws also state that a stockholder seeking to make a nomination before an annual meeting shall promptly provide to us any other information we reasonably request.
