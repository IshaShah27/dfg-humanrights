How do I change or revoke my Vote?

PROPOSAL 1: Election of Directors
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Nominating Committee") has recommended the nine director nominees named below for election as directors at the Annual Meeting. All nine of these director nominees are presently serving on our Board of Directors (the "Board") and each has consented to being named in this proxy statement and to serve if elected for a one-year term. Patrick J. Norton who has served on the Board for the past 15 years, is retiring and not standing for re-election. The size of the Board will be reduced from ten to nine directorships prior to the Annual Meeting by virtue of an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated By-Laws, as amended, that was approved by the Board. All nine of these director nominees were identified and proposed as candidates for service on our Board based on their record of service and individual contributions to the overall mission and responsibilities of the Board. Unless otherwise specified, the shares of Class B Common Stock represented by the proxies at the Annual Meeting will be voted to elect the nine director nominees named below.  In the event that any of these director nominees is unable to serve (which is not anticipated), the persons named in the proxy may vote for another director nominee of their choice. The names and biographies of each of the director nominees for election to the Board of Directors are set forth below.

The Board held six meetings during fiscal 2018 and all directors attended at least 75 percent of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and committees on which he or she served. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors are expected to attend our Annual Meeting. All of the director nominees attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Leadership Structure 
[END TABLE]
Our Board is the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved to or shared with the stockholders. The day-to-day business is conducted and managed by the management of the Company under the direction of the Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). Currently, our Board leadership structure consists of an independent Chairman of the Board who is our former CEO (Mr. Gasser), eight additional independent directors (seven following the Annual Meeting) and a director who is the current CEO (Mr. Watson).
Our Board believes this leadership structure is appropriate for the Company at this time. This structure permits Mr. Watson to primarily focus his time and attention on the business operations, while Mr. Gasser directs his attention on guiding the Board's agenda in setting priorities for the Company to address the risks and challenges faced by the Company. Further, our Board believes that it is in the best interests of the stockholders for Mr. Gasser to serve as Chairman of the Board due to his extensive knowledge of the Company based on his 17 years of experience as the former CEO. While this structure has worked particularly well for our Board, it is not a permanent structure. It is the Board's belief that no single organizational model is best or most effective in all circumstances.  Therefore, although the Board has determined that the current structure works best for the Company at this time, the Board may implement another structure if deemed to be appropriate in the future.
We have adopted various policies to provide for a strong and independent Board, including the following.
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The majority of the Board must be independent of management and have no material relationship with the Company, either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has such a relationship with the Company, and must meet the standards of independence under the applicable rules of the SEC and NYSE listing standards. 
• Only independent directors are members of the Compensation, Audit and Nominating Committees. 
• Independent/non-management directors meet at least four times each year, and during at least one of those meetings, the non-management directors schedule an executive session that includes only independent directors. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Board and the Nominating Committee have assembled a Board that consists of capable and experienced directors, many of whom are currently or have been leaders of companies, who are independent thinkers and have a wide range of expertise and skills. The Board currently does not have a lead director.  However, because of its capable and experienced independent directors, including its Chairman of the Board, and for the reasons described above, along with the above described policies that promote an open discussion among the independent directors, the Chairman of the Board and the CEO, the Board has determined that a lead director is not necessary at this time.

Board's Role in Risk Management Oversight 
[END TABLE]
The Board takes an active role in the oversight of our most significant risks. The Board executes its risk oversight function at the Board level and through delegation to its Board committees.  The Board does not view risk in isolation. Risks are considered in virtually every business decision and as part of our business strategy. The Board recognizes it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Purposeful and appropriate risk-taking is essential for us to be competitive and to achieve our long-term strategic objectives. 
While the Board and its committees oversee risk management, management is responsible for day-to-day management of the various enterprise risks facing the Company. Management has developed and administers a formal enterprise risk management program that is a Company-wide effort involving both the Board and management. Management's role is to identify, mitigate, guide and review the efforts of our business units with respect to risk, consider whether various risks are acceptable, and approve plans to deal with critical business risks that could prevent achievement of our business goals or plans. The Board receives detailed management reports that assess the material risk to us, including strategic, operational, financial, infrastructure, legal, regulatory and other external risks facing the Company and to be certain that management develops and maintains comprehensive risk management policies and procedures to assess, mitigate and monitor risks. The Board and its committees risk oversight responsibilities are summarized below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board of Directors   Audit Committee   Compensation Committee   Nominating Committee 
• Oversees our risk management processes to support the achievement of our long-term strategic objectives• Delegates certain risk management oversight responsibilities to its committees and receives regular reports from each committee• Oversees risks related to financial statements, financial reporting and disclosure process, accounting and legal matters• Oversees the internal audit function• Oversees the enterprise risk management program• Oversees risk related to the integrity of our internal controls process• Oversees the risks related to the design and structure of our compensation and benefits program• Reviews incentive compensation arrangements to confirm incentive pay does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking• Oversees risks associated with corporate governance policies and procedures and Board performance• Oversees risks associated with Board composition and committee structure• Reviews related party transactions

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Executive Sessions of Non-Management Directors 
[END TABLE]
The non-management directors of the Company meet without our management at least four times each year, and during at least one of those meetings, the non-management directors schedule an executive session that includes only independent directors. These meetings are typically held in conjunction with a regularly scheduled Board meeting and at such other times as necessary or appropriate. The chairpersons of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating Committee rotate as chairperson of meetings of the non-management directors.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to NYSE rules, in order for a director to qualify as "independent," the Board must affirmatively determine that the director has no material relationship with the Company that would impair the director's independence. The Board has adopted categorical standards to assist it in making its determination of director independence. 
The Board has determined that all directors and director nominees have no material relationship with the Company and, therefore, are independent, except for Mr. Watson. Mr. Watson is currently the President and CEO of the Company. The Board has determined that Mr. Gunsett is independent because legal fees paid to Baker & Hostetler LLP, where Mr. Gunsett is a partner, are not material to the Company or to that firm and that the nature of the relationship has been properly disclosed to the Board. We do not anticipate that legal fees paid to Baker & Hostetler LLP will be material in fiscal 2019. The Board has determined that Mr. Gasser is independent because more than five years have passed since he retired as an employee of the Company.

Director Compensation Arrangements 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee is responsible for setting the overall compensation strategy and policies for our outside directors. Directors who also serve as employees for the Company or any of its subsidiaries are not compensated for their service as a director. Directors may also receive additional compensation for performing duties assigned by the Board or its committees that are considered beyond the scope of the ordinary responsibilities of a director or committee member. In fiscal 2017, the Compensation Committee, working with its compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, conducted a director compensation market survey. The Compensation Committee determined to increase the compensation of our outside directors beginning on January 1, 2018. The changes to our outside director compensation are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual cash retainer paid to outside directors was increased from $65,000 to $75,000. The additional annual cash retainer paid to the Chairman of the Board was increased from $135,000 to $140,000. 
• The fee of $1,500 for each Board meeting attended remained the same. 
• For our Audit Committee and Compensation Committee, the annual cash retainer paid to each committee chair was increased from $14,000 to $15,000, but the fee paid to other committee members for each committee meeting attended remained at $1,500. 
• For our other committees and special subcommittee, the annual cash retainer paid to each committee chair was increased from $7,000 to $10,000, but the fee paid to committee members for each committee meeting attended remained at $1,250.  
[END TABLE]
Under the terms of the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan, outside directors of the Company may receive options to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock, restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock and/or stock appreciation rights. The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan. For fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee awarded each of the outside directors at the time of the 2018 Annual Meeting of stockholders (held on February 27, 2018) a number of restricted shares of Class A Common Stock under this plan in an amount equal to $135,000, an increase of $10,000 from the prior year, divided by the last reported sale price of a share of Class A Common Stock on the NYSE on February 26, 2018 (the last trading day immediately preceding the date of the 2018 Annual Meeting). All of these shares of Class A Common Stock are not subject to any risk of forfeiture, however, are subject to restrictions on transfer for three years and are fully vested on the award date with eligibility to participate in the receipt of all dividends declared on our shares of Class A Common Stock.
Greif - Proxy Statement     12
[BEGIN TABLE]
Stock Ownership Guidelines for Directors 
[END TABLE]
Each outside director is required to own a minimum of five times his or her annual retainer in shares of Company common stock after five years of service as a director. Restricted shares of Class A Common Stock awarded to an outside director under our 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan and the receipt of which has been deferred at the election of such outside director under the terms of the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan are counted as owned by the deferring outside director for purposes of these stock ownership guidelines. The Board evaluates whether exceptions should be made in the case of any outside director who, due to his or her unique financial circumstances, would incur a hardship by complying with these requirements. All current outside directors are in compliance with these stock ownership guidelines.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Participation in Directors Deferred Compensation Plan 
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors may elect to defer between 25 and 100 percent of their respective retainer fees, regular fees and meeting fees (including committee fees) as well as restricted stock awards granted under the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan. Once made, any such elections (including without limitation the percentage of Board Fees and/or restricted stock to be deferred) shall be irrevocable for all such amounts earned during the calendar year for which the election is made. The participants are fully vested in the value of their account, including investment returns, at all times.
The plan is considered to be an "unfunded" arrangement as amounts generally will not be set aside or held by the Company in a trust, escrow, or similar account. Amounts deferred under the plan are credited to a participant's account under the plan. For cash compensation deferrals, the value of the cash compensation is credited as "Phantom Shares." "Phantom Shares" have a value equal to the market value from time to time of our Class A Common Stock, without par value. The number of Phantom Shares credited to a participant's account is based on the dollar amount of deferral, divided by the then current per share value of our Class A Common Stock, without par value. Restricted stock the receipt of which is to be deferred is held in a so-called "rabbi" trust established by the Company. Dividends paid on shares of restricted stock are contributed to the rabbi trust and are paid from the rabbi trust to the participants and are not accumulated in the rabbi trust.
Each participant will receive his or her account value as retirement benefits under the plan upon termination from Board membership as elected, and all restricted stock deferrals are distributed by one or more stock certificates in a single distribution. However, participants may elect to receive:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cash compensation deferrals (credited as Phantom Shares) in a single lump sum payment or annual installments over a period of five years or ten years or two payments on fixed dates, upon the earlier of termination of Board membership for any reason or a fixed date. 
• Restricted stock deferrals upon termination of Board membership for any reason or a fixed date that is at least three years after the date of the restricted stock award, or the earlier of a fixed date that is at least three years after the date of the restricted stock award and termination of Board membership for any reason.

[BEGIN TABLE]

ü Significant portion of executive total compensation "at risk"  û Hedging or short sales by executive officers or directors

Compensation Committee 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee, whose current members are Daniel J. Gunsett-Chairperson, Vicki L. Avril, Mark A. Emkes, Judith D. Hook and Patrick J. Norton, has primary oversight over the design and implementation of our executive compensation program. In addition, the Compensation Committee has a Special Subcommittee on Incentive Compensation (the "Special Subcommittee") that administers our annual cash incentive bonus plan (the "Short Term Incentive Plan" or "STIP") and our long term incentive plan (the "Long Term Incentive Plan" or "LTIP"). The current members of the Special Subcommittee are Patrick J. Norton - Chairperson, Vicki L. Avril, Mark A. Emkes and Judith D. Hook. All of the members of the Special Subcommittee are "outside directors" as that term is defined in Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").
The Compensation Committee utilizes an outside compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson, to provide it with peer group data and market information. Willis Towers Watson also provides other services to the Company. In determining whether Willis Towers Watson has a conflict of interest that would influence its advice to the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the six factors set forth in the applicable SEC regulations issued under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, namely: the other services provided by Willis Towers Watson to the Company; the amount of fees payable by the Company to Willis Towers Watson as a percentage of that firm's total revenues; the policies and procedures maintained by Willis Towers Watson to prevent or mitigate potential conflicts of interest; any business or personal relationship between any member of Willis Towers Watson's executive compensation team serving the Company and any member of the Compensation Committee; any stock of the Company owned by any member of Willis Towers Watson's executive compensation team serving the Company; and any business or personal relationship between any member of Willis Towers Watson's executive compensation team serving the Company and any executive officer of the Company. The Compensation Committee reviewed information provided by Willis Towers Watson addressing each of these factors.  These SEC regulations retain the principle that the Compensation Committee should have the final say in determining the independence and objectivity of its advisors.  No single factor was considered by the Compensation Committee as more important than any other factor or automatically disqualified Willis Towers Watson from being objective.  After completing its review, the Compensation Committee determined that Willis Towers Watson does not have a conflict of interest that would prevent them from providing objective advice to the Compensation Committee.

Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee's compensation philosophy and objectives are designed to align our executive compensation with  achieving business and financial goals that drive long-term stockholder value. To achieve this "pay for performance" philosophy, the Compensation Committee has the following key objectives:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Designing a competitive executive compensation program that works to attract, recruit and hire executives from other major manufacturing companies and Fortune 500 companies, in addition to retain, incentivize and reward our current executive officers.  
• Offering short-term and long-term incentive bonus plans that work to motivate and incentivize our executive officers by linking compensation to the achievement of targeted financial, business and individual performance goals. 
• Emphasizing at-risk components of an executive compensation program to motivate and incentivize our executive officers to drive stockholder value and to align their interests with the interests of our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Company attempts to achieve its policies and philosophies by establishing performance objectives for its executive officers and by linking compensation to financial performance goals, which may include, but are not limited to, targets for earnings before interest, tax and depreciation, depletion and amortization and return on net assets. The Compensation Committee further believes that a portion of each executive's compensation should be linked to our short-term and long-term performance. In that regard, the Company has the STIP, an annual cash incentive bonus plan that links the annual payment of cash bonuses to the achievement of targeted financial performance goals. See "Elements of Our Compensation Program - Short Term Incentive Plan."  The Company also has the LTIP that links the long-term payment of bonuses to the achievement of targeted financial performance goals. See "Elements of Our Compensation Program - Long Term Incentive Plan." The LTIP aligns long-term stockholder value with compensation by providing for a portion of the payouts in restricted shares, as well as cash. The LTIP is also intended to facilitate compliance with our stock ownership guidelines. See "Elements of Our Compensation Program - Stock Ownership Guidelines" below.
Target Compensation Mix
In determining the award levels for each of the elements in our total compensation program, our philosophy is to "pay for performance." As a result, we place relatively greater emphasis on the variable components of compensation (STIP and LTIP) to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and motivate them to drive stockholder value. These variable components are balanced with retention incentives provided by base salary and, in certain limited cases, restricted stock awards. We look to the experience and judgment of the Compensation Committee to determine what it believes to be the appropriate target compensation mix for each NEO. As shown in the charts below, incentive components accounted for 80% of the CEO's target compensation and approximately 69% of the other NEOs average target compensation in fiscal 2018.

During 2018, management of the Company, with the assistance of Willis Towers Watson, performed an assessment of the risks associated with our incentive plans and determined that the risks associated with such plans are not reasonably likely to cause a material adverse effect on the Company.
Greif - Proxy Statement     19
Peer Group Review
The Compensation Committee, working with Willis Towers Watson, periodically, but at least annually, reviews peer group data and market information for comparable positions in our industry related to our executive officers. The Compensation Committee does not establish targets or benchmarks for executive compensation when assessing peer group data, but rather uses peer group data and other market information to confirm that our compensation targets and awards are comparable and competitive. The information provided by Willis Towers Watson is used by the Compensation Committee and the Special Subcommittee to provide context for their decision making process, but is not used to determine or recommend the amount or form of compensation paid to our executive officers, including our NEOs.
The Compensation Committee, working with its compensation consultant, periodically, but at least annually, also reviews our peer group composition. The selection of peer group companies by the Compensation Committee is based on the nature, composition, geographic scope, complexity and key financial data of potential peer companies in the packaging, paper, manufacturing and industrial businesses. For fiscal 2018, our peer group consisted of the companies listed below. However, due to the consolidation of three companies within our peer group, the Compensation Committee will be reassessing the peer group composition for fiscal 2019.

Elements of Our Compensation Program 
[END TABLE]
During fiscal 2018, in support of our compensation philosophy and objectives, the key elements of our compensation package were:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary 
• Annual performance-based incentive cash bonus under our STIP 
• Long-term performance-based incentive cash bonus and restricted stock awards under our LTIP 
• Retirement benefits under our pension plans, supplemental executive retirement plans and 401(k) plans 
• Opportunity for deferral of compensation under our deferred compensation plan 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews tally sheets for each NEO prepared by the compensation consultant. The purpose of the tally sheets information is to bring together, in one place, all the elements of compensation for our NEOs to assist the Compensation Committee with making compensation decisions for the next calendar year. These tally sheets typically contain the following information: current base salary; STIP payments for the preceding two fiscal years, and the anticipated payment for the fiscal year just ended; LTIP payments for the preceding two fiscal years, and the anticipated payment to be made for the three-year period just ended; the current value of the SERP or the DC SERP, as applicable; and the value of our perquisites (discussed below). 
The Compensation Committee's final compensation determination regarding one element of compensation is independent of all other elements of compensation and does not affect decisions regarding those other elements of compensation, other than to the extent that awards under the STIP and the LTIP are calculated by using a percentage of base salary.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Base Salary 
[END TABLE]
Base salaries are primarily designed to provide competitive levels of compensation that attracts and retains our executive officers.  When determining base salaries for each NEO, the Compensation Committee considers their qualifications, experience, the scope of responsibilities, individual performance and contributions towards our success. Base salaries, which become effective the first pay period of the calendar year, are reviewed annually and are individually determined and may range broadly among our executive officers. The Compensation Committee does not target specific market data for base salaries, but rather compares the compensation levels of other executive officers with equivalent responsibility within our peer group companies and competitive market data to confirm that our base salaries are competitive with the market, as well as to compensation levels of other executive officers within the Company for internal fairness purposes.
Greif - Proxy Statement     20
In December 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the following base salaries for the NEOs for calendar year 2019.  See above "- 2018 Performance Reviews of CEO and Other NEOs" for a discussion of the factors considered by the Compensation Committee in its decision to increase the 2019 base salaries, and the amount thereof, for each NEO.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Short-Term Incentive Plan 
[END TABLE]
The STIP is designed to motivate executive officers and reward achievement of specific and objective performance goals that are linked to the profitability of the Company. For fiscal 2018, compensation paid under the STIP is not intended to be subject to the deduction limitation rules prescribed under Section 162(m) of the Code. See "- Tax Considerations Affecting Compensation Decisions" below.
In administering the STIP, the Special Subcommittee administers establishes performance goals, target amounts, and award opportunities at the beginning of each performance period for each executive officer selected to participate by the Special Subcommittee, including our NEOs.  The target award is based on a percentage of the executive officer's base salary (exclusive of any bonus and other benefits) and is payable in cash upon the achievement of the threshold performance level and capped by the maximum performance level.  Under the STIP, each NEO can be awarded anywhere from 0% to a maximum of 200% of his or her respective target incentive award with 100% as payout for achieving the target performance level. After the end of the performance period, the Special Subcommittee certifies the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved and determines the amount of the award that is payable.
For fiscal 2018, the STIP financial performance goals were based upon the achievement of a targeted level of return on net assets ("RONA"), subject to such adjustments that the Special Subcommittee determines to be necessary to reflect accurately the RONA of the Company for the applicable period. For fiscal years 2017 and 2018, the targeted measure of RONA for all NEOs was based on corporate performance ("Corporate RONA"). For fiscal year 2016, the targeted measure of RONA for all Named Executive Officers was Corporate RONA, except with respect to Messrs. Cronin and Rosgaard. Their awards were based 50% on Corporate RONA and 50% on the RONA of their respective business units.
No incentive bonus is paid if the RONA calculation is below the threshold established for that specific performance period. No additional incentive bonus is paid beyond the established applicable maximum RONA calculation for each performance period. Under the STIP, the maximum payment that could be paid to any participant during any twelve-month period is $3.0 million. The Special Subcommittee establishes the threshold number as being realistic and the maximum as being aggressive for each performance period.
In December 2017, the Special Subcommittee established performance goals for the fiscal 2018 STIP. The table below summarizes the fiscal 2018 STIP performance goals established by the Special Subcommittee. For fiscal 2018, adjusted Corporate RONA of 18.05% was achieved versus 15.97% in fiscal 2017. As a result, the STIP awards for the NEOs were paid out at 181.33% of the target award.

[END TABLE]
In December 2018, the Special Subcommittee established new performance metrics for the STIP for fiscal 2019. The Special Subcommittee selected the paired metrics of operating profit before special items ("OPBSI") and modified simple free cash flow ("MSFCF"), subject to such adjustments as the Special Subcommittee determines to be necessary to accurately reflect the OPBSI and MSFCF of the Company and/or one or more operating groups of the Company as of the award date. The OPBSI and MSFCF are weighted 80% and 20% respectively. These performance metrics were chosen by the Special Subcommittee to better align the interests of our executive officers with those of our stockholders to improve the profitability of, and cash flow generated by, the Company.

Within the parameters of the law and the plan document, the Special Subcommittee may consider, in the event of a material acquisition, adjustments to the target, threshold and maximum levels.  
Each year, the Special Subcommittee reviews the STIP target awards for each NEO based on its judgment of the impact of the position in the Company and what it believes to be competitive against market data while considering internal pay equity for comparable positions. The fiscal 2019 target awards are as follows:

[BEGIN TABLE]
Long-Term Incentive Plan 
[END TABLE]
The LTIP is intended to focus our executive officers on the key measures that drive superior performance over the longer-term. Compensation paid under the LTIP is not intended to be subject to the deduction limitation rules prescribed under Section 162(m) of the Code. See "- Tax Considerations Affecting Compensation Decisions" below. The Special Subcommittee administers the LTIP. Employees who are designated by the Special Subcommittee as "key employees" are eligible to participate in and receive awards under the LTIP. Prior to the beginning of a three-year performance period, which period commences on the first day of first fiscal year for that performance period, the Special Subcommittee selects the award opportunity for all key employees, including each of our NEOs. The incentive compensation award opportunity is based on the Special Subcommittee's reasoned business judgment and subjective review of, based in part on the recommendation of the CEO, the key employee's scope of responsibility and historical performance. The award opportunity for each NEO for the three-year period performance period that ended in fiscal 2018 was:

Mr. Watson 300% $2,910,101 
Mr. Hilsheimer 200% $1,367,462 
Mr. Martz 160% $915,330 
Mr. Cronin (1) 125% $671,345 
Mr. Rosgaard  115% $481,195 
(1) Mr. Cronin's compensation is paid in Euros and has been converted to U.S. Dollars using an exchange rate of 1.136097. 
[END TABLE]
For the three-year performance periods ending in fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018, the performance goals were based on targeted levels of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ("EBITDA"), subject to such adjustments that the Special Subcommittee determines to be necessary to reflect accurately the EBITDA of the Company for the applicable period. This measure was chosen because the Special Subcommittee believes it is the financial measure most aligned with current analyses for maximizing stockholder value.
For each three-year performance period award, participants are to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in restricted shares of our Class A and/or Class B Common Stock, as determined by the Special Subcommittee, with the number of restricted shares awarded being based on the average closing price of such restricted shares during the 90 day period preceding the day that the performance criteria for the applicable three-year performance period was established. The Special Subcommittee believes that awarding restricted shares in lieu of cash better aligns the interests of the NEOs and other key employees with the interests of our stockholders and facilitates compliance with the stock ownership guidelines by participants. See "Stock Ownership Guidelines" below. All restricted stock issued pursuant to the LTIP is fully vested on the date of issuance, with a restriction on the sale or transfer of the restricted shares within a prescribed time period determined 
Greif - Proxy Statement     22
by the Special Subcommittee (typically one year and one day from the date of issuance) that is not impacted in any way upon a change in control of the Company.
The Special Subcommittee may establish a range of performance goals that, if achieved, will result in an incentive award payment that starts at the threshold performance level and is capped at the maximum performance level.  Under the LTIP, our NEOs can be awarded anywhere from 0% to a maximum of 200% of the target incentive award with 100% as payout for achieving the target performance level. The Special Subcommittee establishes the target incentive award for each participant based on a percentage of that participant's average base salary (exclusive of any bonus and other benefits) during the three-year performance period. The Special Subcommittee may also establish a threshold level of performance goal, the achievement below which no awards are paid to any participant. For the three-year performance periods ending in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, the minimum level of performance goal achievement is 33% of the target award.
The Special Subcommittee established the threshold number as being realistic to achieve and set the maximum threshold number as being difficult to achieve for the applicable performance period. After the performance goals are established, the Special Subcommittee aligns the achievement of the performance goals with the award opportunities, such that the level of achievement of the pre-established performance goals at the end of the performance period determines the "final awards" (i.e., the actual incentive compensation earned during the performance period by the participant). In the event of a material acquisition, the Special Subcommittee may consider, within the parameters of the law and the plan document, adjustments to the performance goals. 
For fiscal 2018, NEOs were eligible to receive LTIP award payouts based on performance targets set in December 2015 covering the fiscal 2016-2018 performance period. In December 2018, the Special Subcommittee determined a payout of 168.09% was earned based on the adjusted EBITDA for the performance period shown in the table below, while noting that since fiscal 2015 management had overseen EBITDA improvement of nearly 48% ($325 million in fiscal 2015 to $480.7 million in fiscal 2018).  See "Executive Compensation - Summary Compensation Table" for the amount of the award to the Named Executive Officers under the LTIP for fiscal 2018.

Stock Ownership Guidelines 
[END TABLE]
The Board of Directors has adopted stock ownership guidelines to better align the interests of our executive officers and key employees with the interests of our stockholders. In furtherance of our commitment to sound corporate governance, our executive officers and key employees are required to hold shares of Company stock valued at the following multiple of their annual base salary:
Greif - Proxy Statement     23
[BEGIN TABLE]
Position Ownership Level 
CEO 5X Base Salary 
Executive Officers (other than CEO) 3X Base Salary 
Key Employees 1X Base Salary 
[END TABLE]
Our executive officers and key employees have five years after initial participation in the LTIP or the attainment of a position that requires a higher threshold to meet these stock ownership guidelines.  Our executive officers and key employees are generally required to retain 100% of the shares of their restricted stock awards under the LTIP (all of which shares are fully vested upon issuance) until they have satisfied the stock ownership threshold associated with their position.  Once in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines associated with their position, executive officers and key employees will remain in compliance with these guidelines regardless of decreases in the trading price of our shares, changes to their base salary or immaterial dispositions of shares, until attainment of a position requiring a higher threshold, in which case the five-year compliance period starts again. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews compliance by our executive officers and key employees with these stock ownership guidelines.  The Compensation Committee has determined that each NEO is in compliance with the stock ownership guidelines or within the five-year compliance period associated with their position. Failure to satisfy the requirements of the guidelines may impact participation by an executive officer or key employee in the LTIP in future years, among other matters.   
[BEGIN TABLE]
Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans 
[END TABLE]
Pension Plans
The Greif Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan") is a tax-qualified defined benefit plan meeting the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code. The Pension Plan is designed to provide benefits to those U.S. employees hired prior to November 1, 2007 who have long and continuous service before retirement. Messrs. Watson and Martz are able to participate in the Pension Plan. Messrs. Hilsheimer, Cronin and Rosgaard are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan, although Mr. Cronin is a participant in other pension plans of the Company for non-U.S. employees. The Pension Plan provides for a monthly benefit for the participant's lifetime upon reaching the normal retirement age under the Pension Plan, which is 65. The monthly benefit is calculated by multiplying the participant's annual average compensation (calculated using the five highest complete years of the last ten years of compensation or the final sixty months of compensation, whichever is higher, capped at Code limits) by 35% and by the participant's years of service divided by the years the participant could have worked until his or her normal retirement date divided by 12. Participants are 100% vested in the Pension Plan once they have been credited with five years of service with the Company. Thus, Messrs. Watson and Martz are each 100% vested in the Pension Plan. Once a participant is 100% vested, the participant will have earned a nonforfeitable right to a benefit under the Pension Plan. Benefits commence at the later of age 65 or five years vested in the Pension Plan. The Pension Plan offers early retirement benefits at age 55 on a reduced basis with a required 15 years of service.
Mr. Cronin participates in a pension plan sponsored by a subsidiary of the Company in the Netherlands. This pension plan provides benefits to Mr. Cronin upon his reaching the normal retirement age under the plans, which is 67. Mr. Cronin is currently vested in the pension plan. Mr. Cronin's pension plan does not offer early retirement benefits.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans
The defined benefit Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") provides benefits for a select group of executive officers, including our NEOs  who participate in the Pension Plan. The benefit from the Pension Plan and the SERP is equal to a target percentage (ranging from 40% to 50% depending on job classification) times the executive officer's highest three-year average compensation of the last five years worked by the executive officer and reduced for less than 20 years of continuous service and for receiving benefits prior to the executive officer's normal retirement age. "Compensation" for purposes of the SERP includes base salary and payments under the STIP, and benefits are payable quarterly under the SERP for 15 years. "Normal retirement age" under the SERP is 65. Generally, vesting under the SERP requires 10 years of service or the attainment of the normal retirement age with at least five years of service. Messrs. Watson and Martz are fully vested in the SERP.
Executive officers, including our NEOs who are not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan may participate in the Defined Contribution Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("DC SERP").  Under the DC SERP, we accrue an amount equal to a specified percentage of the executive officer's annual compensation. "Compensation" for purposes of the DC SERP includes base salary and payments under the STIP. This account is also credited annually with interest based on the discount rate used under the Pension Plan. Vesting under the DC SERP requires 10 years of service or the attainment of age 65 with at least five years of service. Vested executive officers are entitled to the payment of a future benefit upon retirement equal to the accrued amounts and credited interest, which is payable in equal installments quarterly over 15 years. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, Mr. Hilsheimer is the only NEO participating in the DC SERP.
Defined Contribution/401(k) Plan
We maintain a tax-qualified defined contribution plan meeting the requirements of Section 401(k) of the Code, commonly called a 401(k) plan. The 401(k) plan is available on the same terms to substantially all of our U.S. employees, including our U.S. based NEOs. Each participant can elect to contribute from 0% to 100% of his or her base salary to the 401(k) plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") 
Greif - Proxy Statement     24
and ERISA limitations. The deferred amount is invested in accordance with the election of the participant in a variety of investment choices, including a Company stock fund. Subject to certain limitations, we have the option to match a participant's contributions to the 401(k) plan. The Company does match a percentage of 401(k) employee contributions and employees not eligible to participate in the Pension Plan are entitled to an additional employer contribution. This additional employer contribution only applies to Messrs. Hilsheimer and Rosgaard.  While a participant is always vested in his or her own salary reduction contributions, the right of a participant to amounts credited to his or her account as company-matching contributions is subject to vesting as provided by the 401(k) plan. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan
We have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan for our executive officers, including our NEOs, which provides a vehicle for our executive officers to elect to defer amounts higher than the IRS limits established for qualified plans. This plan is compliant with the regulations promulgated by the IRS under Section 409A of the Code. The Company has never matched any deferred compensation or provide other discretionary contributions. Base salary, STIP and LTIP payments are all eligible for deferral into this plan. There are no limits on the amounts of compensation eligible for deferral. For example, an executive officer may defer 100% of his or her compensation. The deferred compensation (and Company match or contributions, if any) are deposited into a rabbi trust to protect and segregate the funds. Deferred funds are invested in the same range of investment options as are available in our 401(k) plan discussed above. We distribute the deferred balance upon retirement, termination from employment, death or disability based on a schedule selected by the executive officer. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Perquisites 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the compensation described above, we provide a health and wellness program for our executive officers, including our NEOs, which includes annual physical exams. We offer no other perquisites to our U.S. based NEOs. Mr. Cronin, who is based in Europe, is provided in accordance with customary local practice, a pension contribution gap payment, housing allowance and tax preparation services fee reimbursement.  See Footnote (5) to the "Summary Compensation Table" for information concerning these perquisites.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Tax Considerations Affecting Compensation Decisions 
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m) of the Code imposes a limit on the amount of compensation that we may deduct in any one year with respect to our NEOs unless certain specific criteria are satisfied. "Qualified performance-based compensation", as defined in Section 162(m) of the Code, is fully deductible if the incentive plans are approved by stockholders and meet other requirements. The STIP and LTIP have both been approved by our stockholders and thus are designed to permit us to receive a federal income tax deduction for the awards made pursuant to these incentive plans. However, under the tax reform law passed in December 2017, generally referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the "qualified performance-based compensation" exemption was eliminated. Accordingly, for fiscal year 2018 and after, compensation paid to our NEOs may be subject to the limitations on deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code. While we have generally attempted to tax qualify our compensation program, we also seek to maintain flexibility in compensating our executive officers, and as a result, our Compensation Committee has not adopted a policy requiring all compensation to be deductible. Therefore, the Compensation Committee continues to maintain the flexibility to award compensation under our incentive plans regardless of tax-deductibility, if doing so furthers the objectives of our executive compensation program and is in the best interest of the Company and the stockholders.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
"Say-on-Pay" Advisory Votes 
[END TABLE]
At our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the holders of Class B Common Stock approved a three-year frequency period for holding advisory votes on executive compensation to our NEOs (with a vote in excess of 55% of shares voted). In addition, the holders of Class B Common Stock approved the compensation (by an affirmative vote in excess of 99% of shares voted), as disclosed in the CD&A section and compensation tables, as well as the other narrative executive compensation disclosures, contained in the definitive proxy statement for our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, NEOs identified therein. Based on that vote, the Compensation Committee determined that no changes to our executive compensation program were warranted. The next stockholder advisory votes on approval of executive compensation and the frequency period of such votes will be held during our 2020 and 2023 annual meetings of the stockholders, respectively. The Compensation Committee will continue to review the design of our executive compensation program, particularly in light of our "say-on-pay" votes, executive compensation developments and our pay-for-performance philosophy, to align the executive compensation program consistent with the interests our stockholders.

[BEGIN TABLE]
2018 Performance Reviews of CEO and Other NEOs 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the performance of the CEO and other NEOs based upon certain pre-established performance categories approved by the Compensation Committee. The performance categories were determined by the Compensation Committee to be aligned with our compensation philosophy and objectives.  These categories are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1.    Financial Performance Results 
2.    Strategic Effectiveness and Innovation 
3.    Business Management 
4.    Talent Management 
5.    Personal Effectiveness 
6.    Board Relations (CEO only) 
[END TABLE]
In reviewing Mr. Watson's performance as CEO for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee solicited written comments from all members of the Board of Directors based on the above six categories using the following criteria: exceeds expectations; meets expectations; and needs improvement. The Compensation Committee compiled the written comments. In evaluating fiscal 2018 performance of Mr. Watson with respect to each of the categories of his compensation, the Compensation Committee specifically discussed and recognized the following factors of Mr. Watson's performance during the year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• His intense focus on measurably enhancing customer relations and serving the needs of the Company's customers resulting in improved financial performance and higher gross margins and net income; 
• His leadership in guiding the Company continues to deliver value through improved financial results in 2016, 2017 and 2018, reaping the benefits of the transformation process completed in 2017 and the Greif Business System; 
• His directed efforts to measurably enhance customer relations, drive towards a world-class safety culture, rationalize the footprint of operations, enhance the personnel succession process, and respond to numerous market challenges in areas of tariffs, tax reform, foreign exchange, transportation costs, regional economic shifts, and competitive pressures; 
• His leadership on a Board agreed upon strategic growth plan with a stringent process for evaluating and executing on capital investment opportunities both internally and externally; and 
• His efforts and leadership have positioned the Company to take advantage of opportunities, further optimize operations, and grow the business and stockholder value. 
[END TABLE]
Our CEO, Mr. Watson, reviews the performance of each NEO (other than himself) annually based on the first five performance categories set forth above using three criteria - exceeds expectations, meets expectations, and needs improvement - as well as using other subjective assessments of performance. After completing his performance review, Mr. Watson reports his subjective determinations and recommendations to the Compensation Committee and Special Subcommittee. No single factor is given specific relative weight by Mr. Watson or the Compensation Committee, but all of the factors are considered in the aggregate in their collective experience and reasoned business judgment. The Compensation Committee and Special Subcommittee then consider any proposed adjustments, to the base salary, STIP and LTIP compensation, and award opportunities for those NEOs and determine whether these compensation components are at appropriate levels in light of the salaries and bonuses of other executive officers in equivalent roles in our peer group and market data provided by Willis Towers Watson.
Mr. Watson noted the following factors for the performance of each of the NEOs during the prior fiscal year:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Hilsheimer - His leadership in driving the Company to meet our 2020 performance objectives, his continuing guidance in the implementation of a global ERP system and the improvement of our internal controls environment, his focus on proactive communication with Company stockholders and the investment community, the successful navigation of the Company's tax structure and the creation and implementation of a robust risk management process related to capital allocation strategies.

(1) The amounts of base salary for fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018 reflect actual amounts paid to the respective NEO for each fiscal year ended October 31.  As discussed in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of Our Compensation Program - Base Salary" above, we implement base salary increases on a calendar year rather than a fiscal year basis. 
(2) Amounts represent the restricted share portion of LTIP awards, as described below (see footnote 3 below) and as discussed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Long-Term Incentive Plan" above, based upon the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes during fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, computed in accordance with Accounting Standards Certification ("ASC") 718. For a discussion of the relevant ASC 718 valuation assumptions, see Note 1 in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of the 2018 Form 10-K. For fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 LTIP award amounts were determined by multiplying the closing price of our Class A Common Shares on December 31, 2018 ($37.11), January 4, 2018 ($62.20) and January 11, 2017 ($53.61), respectively, by the number of shares granted.  
(3) Amounts represent the cash awards earned under the  STIP and LTIP. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of  Our Compensation Program - Short-Term Incentive Plan" and "- Long-Term Incentive Plan."  The cash awards earned under the STIP and the LTIP for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

(4) Amounts represent the change in the pension value for each NEO, including amounts accruing under the Pension Plan, other company pension plans, the SERP, the DC SERP. None of the NEOs who participate in the Non-qualified Deferred Compensation Plan receive preferential or above market earnings. During fiscal 2018, the Company accrued above market interest with respect to the DC SERP, a non-qualified defined contribution plan, for Mr. Hilsheimer in the amount of $11,640 which equaled the difference between the interest accrued at 4.59% and that which would have accrued at 3.00% (120% of the long term applicable federal rate for October 2017). 
(5) For NEOs based in the U.S., amounts represent our contributions to the 401(k) plan, subject to Internal Revenue Service and ERISA limitations, premiums paid for life insurance and health insurance premiums, the value of the annual wellness physical and any other perquisites paid by us to or on behalf of such NEO during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(2) In fiscal 2018, each NEO was selected to participate in the STIP. Under the STIP, threshold, target and maximum levels of each individual NEO's award potential are established for each performance period, based on Corporate RONA. Approved target awards for fiscal 2018 are based upon a percentage of each NEO's base salary paid during fiscal 2018. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of Our Compensation Program - Short Term Incentive Plan." The actual payments earned by each NEO in fiscal 2018 and paid in fiscal 2019 are shown in the Summary Compensation Table in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column. 
Stock-based Compensation 
[END TABLE]
Since 2006, we have not issued stock options or made stock awards to its executive officers or employees, other than as a component of the LTIP or in certain circumstances, as a component of compensation packages offered to attract new key employees. Although it is the Compensation Committee's current intention to use only the LTIP for stock-based compensation to executive officers and other key employees, stock option and stock awards could be granted by the Compensation Committee under our 2001 Management Equity Incentive and Compensation Plan (the "2001 Plan"). The 2001 Plan provides for the award of incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted and performance shares of Class A Common Stock to key employees. The maximum number of shares that could be issued each year is determined by a formula that takes into consideration the total number of shares outstanding and is also subject to certain limits. In addition, the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2001 Plan during its term for incentive stock options is 5,000,000 shares. The shares of Class A Common Stock subject to the 2001 Plan have been registered under the Securities Act of 1933. No option may vest less than two years after the grant date and or be exercised greater than ten years after its grant date. In addition, no options granted under the 2001 Plan can be repriced or repurchased by us without stockholder approval. In general, options may not be transferred by the option holder, except that the Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit transfers by the option holder to his or her spouse, children, grandchildren and certain other relatives or a trust for the principal benefit of one or more such persons or to a partnership whose only partners are one or more such persons.

(2) These plans include the 2001 Plan and the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan, under which shares of our Class A Common Stock may be issued, and the LTIP, under which restricted shares of our Class A and Class B Common Stock may be issued. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Elements of Our Compensation Program - Long Term Incentive Plan," "Executive Compensation - Stock-based Compensation," and "Director Compensation for Fiscal 2018 - Director Compensation Arrangements" for a further description of these plans. Stock options are no longer issued under the incentive stock option plan. 
(3) Presently 143,836 shares of Class A Common Stock remain available for future issuance under the 2005 Outside Directors Equity Award Plan. The LTIP does not contain a limit on, or a formula for calculating, the number of shares available for future issuance under the 2001 Plan. The 2001 Plan contains a formula for calculating the number of shares available for future issuance under that 2001 Plan. This formula provides that the maximum number of shares which may be issued each calendar year under the 2001 Plan is equal to the sum of (a) 5.0% of the total outstanding shares as of the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year, plus (b) any shares related to awards under the 2001 Plan that, in whole or in part, expire or are unexercised, forfeited, or otherwise not issued to a participant or returned to the Company, plus (c) any unused portion of the shares available under (a), above, for the immediately preceding two fiscal years as a result of not being made subject to a grant or award in such preceding two fiscal years. The approximate number of shares that may be issued under the 2001 Plan in fiscal 2019 is 3,900,000 shares. The maximum number of shares that may be issued under the 2001 Plan with respect to incentive stock options is 5,000,000 shares 1,072,311 shares remain available for future issuance under this limitation).

[END TABLE]
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of the total annual compensation of our CEO to the total annual compensation of the median employee was 305 to 1. 
To identify the median employee, we first determined our global employee population consisting of full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees as of October 1, 2018. We excluded all employees in India (2), Kazakhstan (1), Morocco (68), Nigeria (22), Poland (68), and Ukraine (481) under the de minimus exception, as the aggregate number of employees in those countries (642) represents less than 5% of our total global employee population of 12,396.  After determining our global employee population, we then used the annual base salary reflected in our internal payroll system, converted into U.S. dollars, as our consistently applied compensation measure. We next annualized the compensation of all permanent employees who joined the Company during the fiscal year. 
Once the median employee was identified, we calculated the median employee's compensation using the same methodology used to calculate the total compensation of the CEO as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table.  The median employee's annual total compensation was $33,407. The annual total compensation of our CEO was $10,187,092 as set forth in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement.

AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing our financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee consists of four independent directors. The Company's Board of Directors has determined that all Audit Committee members are "financially literate" as defined by the NYSE standards and that  Bruce A. Edwards qualifies as an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by applicable SEC regulations. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls and preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed the audited consolidated financial statements in the 2018 Form 10-K with management, including a discussion of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Throughout the year, the Audit Committee also monitored the results of the testing of internal control over financial reporting pursuant to §404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reviewed a report from management and internal audit regarding the design, operation and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and reviewed a report from Deloitte & Touche LLP regarding the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee reviewed with the independent auditors, who are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited consolidated financial statements with GAAP, their judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"). In addition, the Audit Committee received written disclosures regarding the independent auditors' independence from management and the Company, and received a letter confirming that fact from the independent auditors, which included applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and considered the compatibility of nonaudit services with the auditors' independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with our internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit Committee meets separately with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, and separately with management, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our internal controls and the overall quality of our financial reporting.
As discussed above, the Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing our financial reporting process. It is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee to conduct auditing or accounting reviews or procedures. Members of the Audit Committee are not employees of the Company. Therefore, the Audit Committee has relied, without independent verification, on management's representation that the consolidated financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with GAAP and on the representations of the independent auditors included in their report on our consolidated financial statements. The Audit Committee's review does not provide its members with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to assure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions with management and the independent auditors do not assure that our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP, that the audit of our consolidated financial statements has been carried out in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, or that our independent auditors are in fact "independent."
The Audit Committee receives regular reports from our General Counsel with respect to matters coming within the scope of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The CEO and the principal financial officer have each agreed to be bound by the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act mandated Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers. The Company has also implemented and applied the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics throughout the Company. It also has in place procedures for the receipt of complaints concerning our accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing practices, including the confidential, anonymous submission by employees of the Company of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing practices.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the 2018 Form 10-K for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for the 2019 fiscal year.

Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the appointment, compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditors. As part of this responsibility, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent auditors in order to assure that such services do not impair the auditors' independence from the Company. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued rules specifying the types of services that independent auditors may not provide to their audit client, as well as the audit committee's administration of the engagement of the independent auditors. Accordingly, the Audit Committee has adopted a Pre-Approval Policy (the "Policy"), which sets forth the procedures and the conditions under which services proposed to be performed by the independent auditors must be pre-approved.
Pursuant to the Policy, certain proposed services may be pre-approved on a periodic basis so long as the services do not exceed certain pre-determined cost levels. If not pre-approved on a periodic basis, proposed services must otherwise be separately pre-approved prior to being performed by the independent auditors. In addition, any proposed services that were pre-approved on a periodic basis, but later exceed the pre-determined cost level would require separate pre-approval of the incremental amounts by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee for proposed services to be performed by the independent auditors for up to $100,000 per engagement. Pursuant to such Policy, in the event the Chairperson pre-approves services, the Chairperson is required to report decisions to the full Audit Committee at its next regularly-scheduled meeting.
Fees of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Deloitte & Touche LLP served as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2018. It is currently expected that a representative of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if such representative so desires and will be available to respond to appropriate questions from stockholders. Our Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year.  Deloitte & Touche LLP was initially engaged by the Audit Committee as our independent registered public accounting firm in August 2014.
All services to be provided by our independent auditors are pre-approved by the Audit Committee, including audit services, audit-related services, tax services and certain other services. See "Audit Committee Pre-Approval Policy." Aggregate fees billed to the Company for each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2017 and October 31, 2018 by Deloitte & Touche LLP were as follows:

OTHER MATTERS
Communications with the Board
Our Board believes it is important for stockholders to have a process to send communications to the Board. Accordingly, any stockholder or other interested party who desires to make his or her concerns known to the non-management directors or to the entire Board may do so by communicating with the chairperson of the Audit Committee by e-mail to audit.committee@greif.com or in writing to Audit Committee Chairperson, Greif, Inc., 425 Winter Road, Delaware, Ohio 43015. All such communications will be forwarded to the non-management directors or the entire Board as requested in the communication.
Shareholder Recommendations for Director Nominees
The Nominating Committee is responsible for evaluating and recommending candidates to the Board. The Committee's Charter sets forth certain specific, minimum qualifications that must be met by a Nominating Committee recommended nominee for a position on the Board, as well as qualities and skills that Board members must possess. The Nominating Committee determines, and reviews with the Board on an annual basis, the desired skills and characteristics for directors as well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment considers director's qualification as independent, as well as diversity, age, skill and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. The Nominating Committee seeks to achieve diversity of occupational and personal backgrounds and considers diversity as a factor in director nominations. The Nominating Committee views diversity in a broad context to include race, gender, ethnicity, geography, diversity of viewpoint, professional and industry experience, skills, education and personal expertise, among others. At a minimum, directors should share the values of the Company and should possess the following characteristics: high personal and professional integrity; the ability to exercise sound business judgment; an inquiring mind; and the time available to devote to Board activities and the willingness to do so. Ultimately, the Nominating Committee will select prospective Board members who the Nominating Committee believes will be effective, in conjunction with the other members of the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders.
The Nominating Committee identifies potential director candidates through a variety of means, including recommendations from members of the Committee or the Board, suggestions from Company management, and stockholder recommendations. The Committee also may, in its discretion, engage director search firms to identify candidates. Stockholders may recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating Committee by submitting a written recommendation to the Secretary of the Company at 425 Winter Road, Delaware, Ohio 43015 (the "Recommendation Notice"). The Recommendation Notice must contain, at a minimum, the following: the name and address, as they appear on our books, and telephone number, of the stockholder making the recommendation, including information on the number of shares and class of stock owned, and if such person is not a stockholder of record or if such shares are owned by an entity, reasonable evidence of such person's ownership of such shares or such person's authority to act on behalf of such entity; the full legal name, address and telephone number of the individual being recommended, together with a reasonably detailed description of the background, experience and qualifications of that individual; a written acknowledgement by the individual being recommended that he or she has consented to that recommendation and consents to our undertaking of an investigation into that individual's background, experience and qualifications in the event that the Nominating Committee desires to do so; the disclosure of any relationship of the individual being recommended with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates, whether direct or indirect; and, if known to the stockholder, any material interest of such stockholder or individual being recommended in any proposals or other business to be presented at our next annual meeting of stockholders (or a statement to the effect that no material interest is known to such stockholder).
Except for the director nominees recommended by the Nominating Committee to the Board, no person may be nominated for election as a director of the Company during any stockholder meeting unless such person was first recommended by a stockholder for Board membership in accordance with the procedures set forth in the preceding paragraph and the Recommendation Notice was received by us not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the date of such meeting; provided, however, if less than 75 days' notice or prior public disclosure of the date of a stockholders' meeting is given or made to stockholders, then, in order to be timely received, the Recommendation Notice must be received by us no later than the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which such notice of the date of the stockholders' meeting was mailed or such public disclosure was made.
Stockholder Proposals
Proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (scheduled for February 25, 2020) must be received by us for inclusion in the proxy statement and form of proxy on or prior to 120 days in advance of the first anniversary of the date of this proxy statement. If a stockholder intends to present a proposal at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, but does not seek to include such proposal in our proxy statement and form of proxy, such proposal must be received by us on or prior to 45 days in advance of the first anniversary of the date of this proxy statement or the persons named in the form of proxy for the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders will be entitled to use their discretionary voting authority should such proposal then be raised at such meeting, without any discussion of the matter in our proxy statement or form of proxy. Furthermore, stockholders must follow the procedures set forth in Article I, Section 8, of our Second Amended and Restated By-Laws, as amended, in order to present proposals at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
Greif - Proxy Statement     36
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
We have a written policy for the approval of a transaction between the Company and one of its directors, executive officers, greater than 5% Class B stockholders, an entity owned or controlled by such persons, or an immediate family member of such persons, which is generally referred to as a related party transaction.  This policy provides that the Audit Committee must review, evaluate and approve or disapprove all related party transactions involving an amount equal to or greater than $5,000. This policy also requires that all related party transactions be disclosed in our applicable filings as required by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and related rules. In addition, the Nominating Committee, which advises the Board of Directors on corporate governance matters, independently reviews and assesses corporate governance issues related to contemplated related party transactions.
During fiscal 2018, we retained the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP to perform certain legal services on its behalf. Daniel J. Gunsett, a partner in that firm, is a director of the Company and a member of the Compensation, Nominating and Stock Repurchase Committees. We anticipate retaining Baker & Hostetler LLP in the 2019 fiscal year. The Board has affirmatively determined that Mr. Gunsett meets the categorical standards of independence adopted by the Board and is an independent director as defined in the NYSE listing standards. See "Corporate Governance-Director Independence."
Other Information
The proxy card enclosed with this proxy statement is solicited from Class B stockholders by and on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company. A person giving the proxy has the power to revoke it.
The expense for soliciting proxies for this Annual Meeting is to be paid by us. Solicitations of proxies also may be made by personal calls upon or telephone or telegraphic communications with stockholders, or their representatives, by not more than five officers or regular employees of the Company who will receive no compensation for doing so other than their regular salaries.
Management knows of no matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than the above proposals. However, if any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote the proxy in accordance with their judgment on such matters.
