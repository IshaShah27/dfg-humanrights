Additional Information 
[END TABLE]
More detailed information about the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and voting can be found in "Questions and Answers" beginning on page 51.  Governance
Item 1 - Election of Directors
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal 
[END TABLE]
Shareholders are being asked to elect ten Director nominees for a one-year term.  The Board recommends voting FOR the election of each Director nominee.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Role of the Board 
[END TABLE]
The Board's primary role is to oversee the Company's long-term business strategy of creating value for its shareholders.  To effectively execute its responsibilities, members of the Board actively participate in Board and Committee meetings, engage in discussions with the Chief Executive Officer, other Company officers and shareholders, and stay abreast of trends impacting our industry and businesses in general.  The Board also ensures that it is a well-functioning, diverse group of individuals who possess strong business acumen and integrity to properly represent the best interests of shareholders in overseeing the management of the Company.
The Board is committed to good corporate governance practices and continues to make progress against key benchmarks of importance to our investors.  Some of these actions include affording proxy access rights to shareholders, offering an annual advisory vote on say on pay for executive compensation, evaluating the performance of the Board, its Committees, the Chief Executive Officer and other key executive officers and properly planning for the succession of key positions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Composition and Refreshment 
[END TABLE]
Upon consummation of its merger of Hawaiian Telcom Holdings, Inc. ("HTH") on July 2, 2018, the Board was expanded to eleven persons with Meredith J. Ching and Walter A. Dods, Jr., both former directors of HTH, being appointed to fill the newly created positions.  Ms. Ching and Mr. Dods will stand for election for the first time at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
In addition, as previously announced, Mr. Phillip R. Cox is stepping down from his role as Chairman and will not stand for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
While the Board has selected Ms. Lynn A. Wentworth to assume the role as Chairman following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board has determined that the size of the Board shall be reduced to ten persons at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
These changes to the composition of the Board align with the Company's ongoing Board refreshment process which aims to renew the Board with directors who have deep industry expertise and board experience.  The Company's Board refreshment process (whose aim is to add directors with new perspectives and knowledge about the Company's industries/businesses) has already resulted in the addition of four new independent directors in the last five years.
The Company has a long-standing policy that the positions of Chairman of the Board (currently held by Mr. Phillip R. Cox and proposed to be held by Ms. Lynn A. Wentworth) and Chief Executive Officer (currently held by Mr. Leigh R. Fox) should be held by separate persons, as set forth in its Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Company continues to believe that this structure is in the best interest of its shareholders because it facilitates the Board's oversight of management, allows the independent directors to be more actively involved in setting agendas and establishing priorities for the work of the Board, and is consistent with the principles of good corporate governance.
For information on how to obtain a copy of the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, please see page 56.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Membership Criteria 
[END TABLE]
The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee believe there are certain characteristics that every Director should exhibit and other important qualifications and experiences that should be represented on the Board but not necessarily by every individual Director.
Consistent with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Governance and Nominating Committee seeks geographic, age, gender and ethnic diversity among the members of the Board. While the Board has not adopted a formal policy with regard to diversity, the Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board believe that considering diversity is consistent with the goal of creating a Board that best serves the needs of the Company and the interests of its shareholders, and it is one of the many factors that they consider when identifying individuals for Board membership. In addition, we believe that diversity with respect to tenure is important in order to provide for both fresh perspectives and deep experience and knowledge of the Company. 
Required Characteristics
The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee expect every Director to be a person of high integrity with an established leadership reputation in his or her field and to be able to devote the time and effort necessary to properly fulfill their Board and Committee responsibilities.  Directors must also demonstrate ethical behavior, a respect for diverse individuals and cultures, good business judgment, innovative thinking, adherence to corporate governance requirements, and a commitment to responsibly addressing environmental and social issues.
Important Qualifications and Experiences
The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee believe that it is important for the following qualifications and experiences to be represented on the Board: 
• Experience as a director of a large corporate or public company board 
• Experience in business development, mergers and acquisitions, or other investment strategies
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Knowledge of financial markets, financing and funding operations, and accounting and financial reporting processes 
• Expertise in the following industries:  cable, entertainment media, IT services/hardware, network, technology, telecommunications or other related industries 
• General business experience as an executive officer, including insights in human capital, marketing, operations, risk management and/or sales 
[END TABLE]
Each of the current Directors possesses at least 50% of the key qualifications and experiences, and all important qualifications and experiences are represented by at least half of the Directors.  Information on each director, including some of their specific experiences, qualifications, attributes or skills, is set forth in the biographies on pages 7-9 of this proxy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Board Evaluation Process 
[END TABLE]
The Board recognizes that evaluating the effectiveness of the Board and its Committees is a key component of a good corporate governance program.  The annual evaluation process provides an opportunity for Directors to assess the Board's performance, offer insight into areas for improvement and provide general feedback.  Under the oversight of the Chairman and in conjunction with the Board's outside consultant, the evaluation process involves several steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each Director provides feedback through a questionnaire on the Board's composition and structure, effectiveness of Board and Committee meetings and materials, interaction with management, and overall performance of Board and Committees 
• The outside consultant conducts one-on-one interviews with each Director to review his/her questionnaire responses and discuss any additional feedback or perspective 
• The outside consultant prepares a summary of the information provided through the questionnaires and one-on-one interviews to be previewed with the Chairman and then presented to the Board 
• The Board discusses the results of the evaluation process and considers changes in practices or procedures to be implemented as appropriate 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Nominee Selection Process 
[END TABLE]
Director Vacancy Nominees
Any qualified individual or group, including shareholders, incumbent directors and members of senior management, may at any time propose a candidate to serve on the Board. Background information on proposed candidates is forwarded to the Governance and Nominating Committee.  For information on how to propose a candidate to serve on the Board, please see page 56. The Governance and Nominating Committee reviews forwarded materials relating to prospective candidates in the event of a director vacancy. A candidate selected from the review is interviewed by each member of the Governance and Nominating Committee, unless the member waives the interview requirement. If approved by the Governance and Nominating Committee, the candidate will be recommended to the Board for consideration. The Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates shareholder-recommended candidates in the same manner that it evaluates all other candidates.
Annual Meeting Nominees
In 2018, the shareholders approved an amendment to the Company's Amended and Restated Regulations to provide for proxy access ("Proxy Access Regulation").  The amendment allows eligible shareholders to nominate their own candidate(s), along with the Board's nominees, for inclusion in the Company's proxy materials for an annual meeting of shareholders.  For more information on how to nominate a candidate under the Proxy Access Regulation, see page 56.  The Governance and Nominating Committee did not receive and, therefore, did not consider any recommendations for director candidates by any shareholder for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
In considering each director nominee recommended by the Board for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee evaluated each nominee's background, qualifications, attributes and skills to serve as a director. The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee also considered the years of experience many directors have had working together on the Board and the deep knowledge of the Company they have developed as a result of such service. The Board and the Governance and Nominating Committee also evaluated each of the director's contributions to the Board and his or her role in the operation of the Board as a whole. We believe that our director nominees bring a well-rounded variety of experiences, qualifications, attributes and skills, and represent a mix of deep knowledge of the Company and fresh perspectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annual Election of Directors 
[END TABLE]
Annual Election
Directors are elected each year at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders to hold office until the next annual meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualified.  If, at the time of the Annual Meeting, one or more of the nominees should be unavailable or unable to serve as a candidate, the shares represented by the proxies will be voted to elect the remaining nominees, if any, and any substitute nominee or nominees designated by the Board. The Board knows of no reason why any of the nominees will be unavailable or unable to serve.
Majority Vote Requirements; Holdover Directors
A director nominee who receives a majority of the votes cast will be elected to the Board.  If a director nominee is an incumbent director and does not receive a majority of the votes cast, the Company's Amended and Restated Regulations require that such "holdover director" promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board, subject to acceptance by the Board. The Governance and Nominating Committee will make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the holdover director's resignation or whether other action should be taken.  The Board will act on the tendered resignation by the holdover director, taking into account the Governance and Nominating Committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation of the holdover director and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results by the Inspector of Elections.  The Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, may consider any factors or other information that they consider appropriate and relevant.  The holdover director who tenders his or her resignation shall not participate in the recommendation of the Governance and Nominating Committee or the decision of the Board with respect to his or her tendered resignation.
If a holdover director's resignation is accepted by the Board pursuant to the Company's Amended and Restated Regulations, the Board may either fill the resulting vacancy or, if permitted, may decrease the size of the Board in accordance with law and the Company's Amended and Restated Regulations.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
2019 Director Nominees 
[END TABLE]
The Company's Amended and Restated Regulations provide that the Board shall consist of not less than nine nor more than seventeen persons, with the exact number to be fixed and determined by resolution of the Board or by resolution of the shareholders at any annual or special meeting of shareholders. In connection with Mr. Phillip R. Cox's decision to not seek re-election at the expiration of his term, the Board has determined that the Board shall consist of ten persons following the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  As a result, only ten persons have been nominated for election at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
Based upon the recommendations of the Governance and Nominating Committee, the Board has nominated Meredith J. Ching, Walter A. Dods, Jr., John W. Eck, Leigh R. Fox, Jakki L. Haussler, Craig F. Maier, Russel P. Mayer, Theodore H. Torbeck, Lynn A. Wentworth and Martin J. Yudkovitz  to serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Each of the nominees is standing for re-election, except for Ms. Ching and Mr. Dods, who are standing for election for the first time since their appointment to the Board on July 2, 2018.  The Board has determined that all director nominees, other than Mr. Fox and Mr. Torbeck, are independent and have no relationship with the Company other than as a shareholder and director.
Information regarding the business experience of each nominee is provided on pages 7-9.
Vote Required
A director nominee must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected to the Board.  Since neither abstentions nor broker non-votes will be considered as votes cast in the election of directors, they will not have an effect on the outcome of the election.
Our Recommendation
The Board recommends election of each of the nominees. The following are brief biographies of each person nominated for election as a director of the Company.

Board Oversight 
[END TABLE]
Strategy
The Board has a responsibility to the shareholders to ensure the Company's business strategy is well planned and executed.  While overseeing and monitoring the strategy is a continuous activity, the Board dedicates one meeting each year to the strategic planning process.  Throughout the year, the Board and Management engage in discussions on various short- and long-term elements of the strategy, including financial measures and operational performance.
Risk 
Risk oversight is an important responsibility of the Board and it relies on the Audit and Finance Committee and the Company's Chief Security Officer to provide regular updates on the Company's cyber and enterprise risk management program.  The Company also engages external firms to periodically audit the program for effectiveness and provide evaluation reports directly to the Board.
Although the Company takes proactive and reasonable steps to address security risks, including the use of insurance, we understand that cyber security, and security in general, is a fluid issue and that serious security incidents are possible and could have a material effect on our business.  To learn more about risks facing the Company, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report on Form 10-K.  To date, we have not experienced any material security incident and continue to evaluate security risks to our businesses along with the adoption of new control measures to address current and anticipated threats.
Leadership Planning
Another key responsibility of the Board is to ensure the development and retention of senior talent needed to execute the strategy and manage the day-to-day operations of the business.  The Board and the Compensation Committee meet annually and as needed to evaluate the performance of key individuals, discuss potential successors and identify development plans to ensure readiness for future succession opportunities and contingencies.
Environmental and Social Responsibility
The Board recognizes that sustainability is important to our business, our shareholders and our planet.  Investors are increasingly looking to engage with companies that are committed to protecting the environment and making an overall positive impact in the communities in which we serve.

[BEGIN TABLE]
Director Independence 
[END TABLE]
In accordance with the rules and listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board affirmatively evaluates and determines the independence of each director and each nominee for election. Based on an analysis of information supplied by the directors, the Board evaluates whether any director has any material relationship with the Company, either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company, that might cause a conflict of interest in the performance of a director's duties. 
Based on these standards, the Board determined that each of the following persons who served as a non-employee director in 2018 is independent and has no relationship with the Company, except as a director and shareholder:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Phillip R. Cox (a)• Craig F. Maier 
• Meredith J. Ching• Russel P. Mayer 
• Walter A. Dods, Jr.• Martin J. Yudkovitz

[END TABLE]
(a)  Mr. Cox is not standing for re-election this year.

In addition, based on these standards, the Board determined that Mr. Fox was not independent because he currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Mr. Torbeck was not independent because he served as Chief Executive Officer of the Company through May 31, 2017. 
The independent, non-employee directors of the Company meet in executive session without management present at each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board. The Chairman of the Board presides at the meetings of the non-employee directors.

Code of Business Conduct and Codes of Ethics

For information on how to obtain a copy of the Company's Code of Business Conduct, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers or Code of Ethics for Directors, please see page 56.
Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
The Board is committed to upholding the highest legal and ethical conduct in fulfilling its responsibilities and recognizes that related party transactions can present a heightened risk of potential or actual conflicts of interest. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is the Company's preference to avoid related party transactions. Current SEC rules define a related party transaction to include any transaction, arrangement or relationship (i) in which the Company is a participant, (ii) in which the transaction has an aggregate value greater than $120,000, and (iii) in which any of the following persons has or will have a direct or indirect material interest: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an executive officer, director or director nominee of the Company;  
• any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's common and preferred shares;  
• any person who is an immediate family member (as defined under Item 404 of Regulation S-K) of an executive officer, director or director nominee or beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's common or preferred shares; or  
• any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person, together with any other of the foregoing persons, has a 10% or greater beneficial ownership interest.   
[END TABLE]
The Company's Code of Business Conduct, the Company's Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and the Company's Code of Ethics for Directors require directors, officers and all other members of the workforce to avoid any relationship, influence or activity that would cause or even appear to cause a conflict of interest. The Company's Code of Business Conduct, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers and Code of Ethics for Directors generally require (i) a director to promptly disclose to the Governance and Nominating Committee any potential or actual conflict of interest involving him or her and (ii) an employee, including the executive officers, to promptly disclose a conflict of interest to the General Counsel. The Governance and Nominating Committee (and, if applicable, the General Counsel) determines an appropriate resolution to actual or potential conflicts of interest on a case-by-case basis. All directors must recuse themselves from any discussion or decision affecting their personal, business or professional interests. 
All related party transactions shall be disclosed in the Company's applicable filings with the SEC under the SEC rules.  In 2018, there were no related party transactions requiring disclosure.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
Annual Compensation Program 
[END TABLE]
The Company uses a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and retain qualified candidates to serve on the Board. In setting director compensation, the Company considers the significant amount of time that Directors spend in fulfilling their duties to the Company as well as the skill level required. 
Compensation for Employee Directors 
Directors who are also employees of the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) receive no additional compensation for serving on the Board or its committees during the period of their employment. If such directors continue on the Board after their employment ends, such directors may receive additional compensation in connection with such continued service. 
General Compensation Policy for Non-Employee Directors 
Directors who are not employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company ("non-employee directors") while serving as directors of the Company receive compensation from the Company for their service on the Board.

(b) The Annual Board Equity Award for 2018 was granted under the Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2017 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors to all non-employee directors, including the Chairman of the Board, in the form of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $100,000 and a one-year vesting period.  
[END TABLE]
Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors
On May 4, 2017, the shareholders approved the Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2017 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "2017 Directors Plan").  Under this plan, the Company grants its non-employee directors time-based restricted shares, restricted stock units, and/or options to purchase common shares. Pursuant to the current terms of such plan, each non-employee director of the Company, at the discretion of the Board, may be granted a number of restricted common shares, restricted stock units, and/or a stock option for a number of common shares (as determined by the Board) on the date of each annual meeting, if such director first became a non-employee director of the Company before the date of such annual meeting and continues in office as a non-employee director after such meeting.  Currently under the 2017 Directors Plan, up to 350,000 common shares may in the aggregate be the subject of awards granted during the life of the plan, all of which could be subject to stock option awards, restricted stock awards or restricted stock units.  The Company has flexibility regarding the type of awards to issue.  The Board will exercise its discretion in granting such options, time-based restricted shares, or restricted stock units with the intent that such grants, together with other Company equity-based compensation, provide Company equity-based compensation that is competitive with the value of equity-based compensation provided by comparable companies to their non-employee directors.
Each stock option granted to a non-employee director under the 2017 Directors Plan, or a predecessor plan, requires that upon the exercise of the option, the price to be paid for the common shares that are being purchased under the option will be equal to 100% of the fair market value of such shares as determined at the time such option is granted. With certain exceptions provided in the 2017 Directors Plan, a non-employee director of the Company who is granted an option under the plan generally will have ten years from the date of the grant to exercise the option.
In general, each award will require that the restrictions not lapse in full unless the non-employee director (i) continues to serve as a director of the Company for the vesting period after the applicable award grant date, or (ii) ends service as a Company director under special circumstances (e.g., death, disability, or attaining retirement age).
On May 1, 2018, the Company granted restricted stock unit awards that vest after one year and with an aggregate value of $100,000 on the date of grant to each non-employee director under the 2017 Directors Plan.  Awards in 2017 and 2016 were granted under the Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2007 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the "2007 Directors Plan"), which was replaced by the 2017 Directors Plan.  Awards granted in 2017 had an aggregate value of $100,000.  Awards granted in 2016 had an aggregate value of $90,000.  For 2016 and 2017, the awards were also in the form of restricted stock units which vested on the first anniversary of the grant date.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
[END TABLE]
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% shareholders are required by regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports that they file. Such reports are filed on Forms 3, 4 and 5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based solely on the Company's review of the copies of such forms received by it, the Company believes that, during the period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2018, all such persons complied on a timely basis with the filing requirements of Section 16(a).

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (the "CD&A") discusses the elements of our executive compensation program and the reasons why the Compensation Committee selected those particular elements, the performance metrics and goals under certain of those elements, the compensation that the executives might earn, and how each element encourages the Company's achievement of its business objectives and strategy. The Company utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures in order to compensate NEOs.  The reconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Unlevered Operating Cash Flow to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented in the following tables. Certain other adjustments may be made for items not contemplated as part of the target goals, such as the results associated with the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.  All adjustments are approved by the Board.

 Executive Summary 
Our goal is to link the executive compensation program to the Company's strategic plan and the long-term interests of its shareholders.  The Company's long-term strategy is to become a leading technology company with state of the art fiber assets providing end-to-end communications services (high speed data, video and voice solutions) and IT infrastructure and solutions.  The Company's strategic goals are to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• expand our fiber network; and 
• grow our IT services and hardware segment. 
[END TABLE]
Consequently, the Company's executive compensation program ties a significant portion of an executive's realized annual compensation to the Company's achievement of financial and strategic goals.  For 2018, the key financial measures utilized to assess annual performance are revenue and Adjusted EBITDA ("EBITDA"). The key financial measures utilized to assess long-term performance include a combination of strategic revenue, EBITDA, return on invested capital ("ROIC"), operating cash flow and total shareholder return, depending on the year the long-term incentive award was granted.  In addition, for certain long-term incentive awards, the Company will adjust the final long-term performance payout using a total shareholder return ("TSR") factor based on the Company's TSR performance as compared to the Russell 2000 index.  See pages 25 - 29 for a detailed discussion of the payments made under the annual and long-term incentive plans for 2018 performance. 
For 2018, the Company achieved the following financial and operational results:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revenue totaled $1,378 million, an increase of $313 million compared to the prior year  
• Adjusted EBITDA totaled $372 million, an increase of $66 million compared to the prior year 
• Operating income totaled $83 million, up $28 million compared to the prior year 
• Hawaiian Telcom contributed revenue of $175 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $47 million 
• Cincinnati Fioptics revenue totaled $341 million, up 10% from a year ago 
• IT Services and Hardware Adjusted EBITDA totaled $63 million, up $24 million from the prior year 
• Cash provided by operating activities totaled $215 million, up $11 million as compared to the prior year 
• Free cash flow totaled $41 million, up $13 million year-over-year 
• Cincinnati Fioptics internet subscribers increased year-over-year by approximately 12,400 and Hawaiian Telcom added approximately 65,900 Consumer/SMB internet subscribers to the existing base 
• Continued the construction of its fiber network passing an additional 38,800 addresses with Fioptics in Cincinnati, which is now available to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati 
[END TABLE]
As a result of the above achievements, the NEOs earned their annual incentives at target and their long-term performance incentives below target.
We believe that our 2018 results confirm that the Company's executive compensation program effectively focuses our executive talent on achieving our key financial goals over multiple years and aligns executive long-term incentive rewards with the interests of shareholders. The mix of base pay (the "fixed cost" of the program) and both annual and long-term incentive plans promote achievement of current-year goals and longer-term business strategies while driving appropriate business behavior without inducing executives to take undue business risks.  The following chart summarizes the key elements of our compensation program, which are discussed in more detail later in the CD&A.

The Company also provides certain retirement benefits and post-termination compensation to the NEOs, as described in more detail later in this CD&A. Compensation Practices
The Company reviews and modifies its executive compensation program and practices regularly to address changes in the Company's short- and long-term business objectives and strategies, new regulatory standards and to implement evolving best practices.  Listed below are compensation practices that the Company has adopted in support of its compensation philosophy:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance-Based Compensation.  The Company believes that a significant percentage of each NEO's total compensation should be performance-based or "at-risk."  Base salary was only 21% of the Chief Executive Officer's 2018 target compensation and 34% of the other NEOs' 2018 target compensation.   
• Stock Ownership Guidelines.  The Company believes that equity ownership creates alignment between executive and shareholder interests.  In support of this objective, we maintain stock ownership guidelines under which our NEOs are expected to accumulate specified ownership stakes over time.  See page 32 for a more detailed discussion. 
• Compensation Risk Assessment.  The Company conducts annual compensation risk assessments to ensure that our policies and programs do not unintentionally encourage inappropriate behaviors or lead to excessive risk taking.  We have concluded that our compensation plans, policies and practices do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
• Repricing Prohibition.  We maintain prohibitions against the repricing of underwater stock options in the absence of shareholder approval.  The definition of a repricing includes cash buyouts of underwater stock options and stock appreciation rights. This change applies to all grants, including existing grants. 
• Double-Trigger Equity Vesting.  The Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan and the Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan provide that, in the event of a change in control ("CIC"), an employee must be involuntarily terminated without cause by the Company during the 24-month period following a CIC for previously granted equity awards that are continued, assumed or substituted to vest.  
• Executive Compensation Benchmarking.  The Company (i) uses the general industry peer group as the primary source of market data for competitive assessments of executive pay, (ii) uses the telecommunications peer group as a secondary reference for assessing market pay and industry compensation practices, and (iii) each year reviews and modifies, if necessary, the telecommunications peer group to make certain that it is an appropriate peer group for comparisons to Cincinnati Bell.  We target each pay component and total pay at the 50th percentile. 
• Hedging and Pledging Policy.  The Company's Insider Trading Policy expressly prohibits ownership of derivative financial instruments or participation in investment strategies that hedge the economic risk of owning the Company's common stock and prohibits officers and directors from pledging Company securities as collateral for loans. 
• Clawback Policy.  The Company has a clawback policy that allows it to recover incentive payments to or realized by executive officers in the event that the incentive compensation was based on the achievement of financial results that are subsequently restated to correct any accounting error due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the federal securities laws, and such restatement results in a lower payment or award. 
• Independent Compensation Committee.  Each member of the Compensation Committee is independent as defined in the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE, and the Company's director independence standards mirror those of the NYSE. 
• Independent Compensation Consultant.  The Compensation Committee utilizes the services of an outside independent compensation consultant to assist in its duties.  The Compensation Committee's consultant performs no other services for the Company or its management. 
• Elimination of Gross-Ups.  The Compensation Committee has a policy in place that any new or materially amended employment agreement with any NEO will not contain any excise tax gross-up provisions with respect to payments contingent on a CIC. In addition, no current employment agreements contain any excise tax gross-up provisions.

 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote and Shareholder Outreach
The Compensation Committee believes aligning executives' compensation with shareholder return is a key to a balanced approach.  In 2018, the long-term incentive compensation plan awards for executives consisted of a mix of time-based restricted stock units and performance-based stock units.  Having both components linked to Company stock provides greater alignment with shareholders, with the time-based restricted stock units creating an element of retention for key executive talent.
In 2018, approximately 81% of the shares voted with respect to the Company's say-on-pay proposal voted "for" approval of the Company's executive compensation.  The Chairman, the President and CEO, the CFO and other members of senior management held six meetings in 2018 with key investors to reinforce the Company's strategic direction and the Board's refreshment process.  In addition, the CEO, the CFO and other senior managers hosted teleconferences with several of the Company's largest shareholders following each quarterly earnings call to discuss the Company's strategy and financial results.
The Company's outreach program also provides an opportunity for any of its shareholders to request a meeting with one or more of the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, and certain members of senior management to obtain feedback on the Company's strategic direction as well as its executive compensation program. 
Compensation Program Objectives
The executive compensation program's primary objectives are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To attract and retain high-quality executives by offering competitive compensation packages; 
• To motivate and reward executives for the attainment of financial and strategic goals, both short-term and long-term, thereby increasing the Company's value while at the same time discouraging unnecessary or excessive risk-taking; and 
• To align the interests of the executives and the shareholders by attributing a significant portion of total executive compensation to the achievement of specific short-term and long-term performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. 
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation
Base Salary
Base salaries are provided to the Company's NEOs for performing their day-to-day responsibilities.  The base salaries of our NEOs are based on a review of the competitive market median for comparable executive positions, assessment by the Chief Executive Officer (or in the case of the Chief Executive Officer's base salary, by the Compensation Committee and entire Board) of the executive's performance as compared to his or her individual job responsibilities, the salary level required to attract and retain the executive and such other factors as the Chief Executive Officer or the Compensation Committee deems relevant for such executive.  Generally, no one factor is given more weight than another, nor does the Company and the Compensation Committee use a formulaic approach in setting executive pay.  Additionally, while the Company looks at 50th percentile total compensation, it also considers the executive's individual performance as well in determining salary adjustments.
While the Company reviews salary market data for all non-union employees on an annual basis, it follows a practice of only providing merit increases on an 18-24 month basis.  In keeping with this practice, no changes were made to the base salaries of the NEOs in 2018.
Annual Incentives
Annual incentives are intended to motivate and reward senior executives for achieving the short-term business objectives of the Company.  Annual incentives are payable for the achievement of annual financial performance goals established by the Compensation Committee and for individual performance.  For the NEOs, financial performance goals represent 80% of the annual incentive determination and the individual performance evaluation represents 20%. Payouts, if any, can range from 0% to 150% of the total target annual incentive, depending on the level of achievement of financial goals between threshold and superior levels of performance and evaluations of individual performance and contributions for the year.  The Board and Compensation Committee approve financial goals annually which reflect their belief that achievement of these goals drives the Company's strategic success. The Company used the following goals having the indicated weights in 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 60% on Adjusted EBITDA; 
• 20% on revenue; and 
• 20% on individual performance. 
[END TABLE]
The Company has selected Adjusted EBITDA and revenue as its performance measures.  Investors have identified these metrics as key indicators of current financial performance and the Company's ability to execute on its strategy of creating a technology company with state of the art fiber assets servicing customers with data, video, voice and IT solutions to meet their evolving needs.  Adjusted EBITDA is given a significantly higher weighting than revenue and individual performance because it is a key measure of profitability of the Company that eliminates the effects of accounting and financing decisions.  In addition, investors view it as an effective barometer of how well a company can service its debt.
The Board and Compensation Committee review and approve the annual incentive attainment percentages for both Adjusted EBITDA and revenue. In conjunction with such review, they may adjust the actual result or goal amount to reflect a change in business strategy, reallocation of Company resources or an unanticipated event.

[END TABLE]
 The Chief Executive Officer provides the Compensation Committee with his assessment of each other executive officer's individual performance. The Chief Executive Officer reviews, for each executive officer, the performance of the executive's department, the quality of the executive's advice and counsel on matters within the executive's purview, qualitative peer feedback and the effectiveness of the executive's communication with the organization and with the Chief Executive Officer on matters of topical concern. These factors are evaluated subjectively and are not assigned specific individual weights. The Chief Executive Officer then recommends an award for the individual performance-based portion for each of the other NEO's annual incentive, which can range from 0% to 200% of the target award for such portion.
The Compensation Committee meets in executive session to consider the Chief Executive Officer's individual performance. The Compensation Committee evaluates the information obtained from the other directors concerning the Chief Executive Officer's individual performance, based on a discussion led by the Chairman of the Board. Factors considered include: operational and financial performance, succession planning, development of the Company leadership team, development of business opportunities and community involvement/relationships. The Compensation Committee has discretion in evaluating the Chief Executive Officer's performance and may recommend to the full Board a discretionary increase or decrease to the Chief Executive Officer's final annual incentive award as the Compensation Committee believes is warranted.
The table below shows the percentage of target annual incentive earned by each NEO for 2018 for each performance measure and in total as well as the actual award payment:

Performance-Based and Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Awards
Performance-based and time-based awards for 2018 were granted in the form of performance stock units and restricted stock units.
Restricted stock units will be paid in common shares at the end of a three-year vesting period.
As was the practice in 2016 and 2017, the performance-based stock units granted in 2018 are structured to be paid in common shares, equal to the fair market value of common shares at the end of a three-year performance period and are based on the achievement of specific Company quantitative goals over such three-year performance period.  Such awards were granted during the first quarter of each calendar year following finalization and approval by the Board of the financial goals for the next three-year performance period.  For the 2016 awards, performance goal attainment will be based on the achievement of the specific Company quantitative goals for each of the performance periods (2016, 2016-2017 and 2016-2018) as approved by the Board, with a single payout at the end of the three-year performance period.  For the 2017 awards, performance goal attainment will be based on the achievement of the specific Company quantitative goals on a cumulative basis for each of the performance periods (2017, 2017-2018 and 2017-2019) as approved by the Board, with a single payout at the end of the three-year performance period.   For the 2018 awards, performance goal attainment will be based on the achievement of the specific Company quantitative goals for each of the performance periods (2018, 2018-2019 and 2018-2020) as approved by the Board, with a single payout at the end of the three-year performance period. 
For each of the 2016 performance periods (2016, 2016-2017 and 2016-2018) within the three-year performance cycle ending December 31, 2018, and each of the 2017 performance periods (2017, 2017-2018 and 2017-2019), within the three-year performance cycle ending December 31, 2019, respectively, Adjusted EBITDA, strategic revenue and ROIC are equally weighted.  For Adjusted EBITDA and strategic revenue, achievement must be at least 95% of the target goal in order to generate a threshold level payout equal to 50% of the target award for each executive.  For ROIC, achievement must be at least 77% for the 2016 performance periods and 75% for the 2017 performance periods in order to generate a threshold level payout equal to 75% of the target award for each executive.  The final payout calculation for the 2016-2018 performance period and for the 2017-2019 performance period is subject to a +/- 15% adjustment based on the Company's  total shareholder return ("TSR") over the three-year performance period compared to the Russell 2000 Index.  Achievement less than the 35th percentile of the Russell 2000 Index will result in a 15% reduction while achievement greater than the 65th percentile will result in a 15% increase.  For TSR results greater than the 35th percentile and less than the 65th percentile of the Russell 2000 index, the +/- 15% adjustment will be determined based on interpolation.  
For each of the 2018 performance periods (2018, 2018-2019 and 2018-2020) within the three-year performance cycle ending December 31, 2020, 70% of the award payout is based on Adjusted Unlevered Operating Cash Flow ("Adjusted OCF"), with the remaining 30% based on the Company's TSR for each of the 2018 performance periods compared to the Telecommunications Peer Group  (as described on page 58) approved by the Compensation Committee as in effect on the last day of the respective performance period.  For Adjusted OCF, achievement must be at least 95% of the target goal in order to generate a threshold level payment equal to 50% of this component of the target award for each executive.  With respect to the TSR component of the award, the Company's TSR for the respective performance period must be at least in the 20th percentile when compared to the Telecommunications Peer Group in order to generate a threshold level payout equal to 25% of this component of the target award for each NEO (achievement above the 30th percentile is based on a sliding scale, with achievement of the 50th percentile generating a payout at 100% and achievement of the 90th percentile or greater generating payout at 150% of this component of the target award for each NEO).  For purposes of the 2018 performance awards, Adjusted OCF means the Employer's Cash Flows from Operating Activities (as defined by U.S. GAAP) adjusted to exclude expenses related to (1) cash paid for interest on (a) all long-term debt, (b) capital lease obligations, and (c) other financing arrangements for the Performance Period (computed on the basis of the Employer's interest expense for purposes of the Employer's applicable income statements as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, less non-cash items); and (2) transaction and integration costs. 
The threshold, target and superior performance levels are the same for each of the NEOs.  For the 2016-2018 long-term incentive awards, each of the NEOs received 78.3% of their target awards based on the results of the three-year performance cycle ending December 31, 2018 as shown in the table below, adjusted for the TSR results.

Business Value Program
On May 1, 2018, the Board approved a new management incentive program (the "Business Value Award Program") intended to reward key management of the Company  for growing, and creating significant enterprise value through such growth, in the IT Services and Hardware business of the Company ("IT Segment").  The Business Value Award Program will be implemented through an award of Business Value Award "points".  A "point" is a measure used to determine the amount of cash, if any, that could be distributed to a participating employee who receives such an award upon the occurrence of certain events. A form of Business Value Award Agreement (the "BVAP Agreement") for the award of such points was approved by the Committee on May 1, 2018.   A maximum of 1,000 total points may be awarded to all employees participating in this Business Value Award Program.
The BVAP Agreement provides for a specified cash payment to the participating employee in the event that (i) the employee is continuously employed for a two-year period after the date of grant, (ii) a qualifying transaction (as described below) involving the IT Segment is consummated before May 1, 2023, and (iii) the qualifying transaction generates a Net Value Created by the IT Segment (as described below). The value of an award granted to a participating employee is equal to the number of points awarded to such employee multiplied by 0.001 multiplied by the Award Pool Amount (as described below). For purposes of the determining the amount of an award payable: (i) a "qualifying transaction" means a transaction that would result in the Company selling or transferring (including through an initial public offering) and ceasing to own at least 51% of the fair market value of the assets or equity of the IT Segment; (ii) the "Net Value Created by the IT Segment" means the total consideration received by the Company in a qualifying transaction less the cost of acquisitions and investments made by the Company to inorganically grow the IT Segment (including the OnX Holdings acquisition); and (iii) the "Award Pool Amount" means an amount equal to 10% of the Net Value Created by the IT Segment. If a qualifying transaction does not occur before May 1, 2023, unless such date is extended because a qualifying transaction is in progress but has not yet closed, the Agreement terminates with no payment to the participating employee. Moreover, if the participating employee's employment is terminated for any reason (other than a termination for the Employee's retirement, death or disability), prior to the consummation of a qualifying transaction, then the employee will not receive any payment under the BVP Agreement. In addition, if the qualifying transaction is a result of a "change in control" as defined in the Cincinnati Bell Inc. 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "2017 LTIP"), the amount of any award payable pursuant to a BVP Agreement may be reduced by any "change in control" payment received by such participating employee under the 2017 LTIP.  The CEO was awarded 100 points and each of the other NEOs were awarded 50 points. 
Benefits
NEOs hired prior to January 1, 2009 participate in the Cincinnati Bell Management Pension Plan (the "Management Pension Plan") on the same basis as all other eligible salaried and certain non-union hourly employees.  The Management Pension Plan is a qualified defined benefit plan with a nonqualified provision that applies to the extent that eligible earnings or benefits exceed the applicable Internal Revenue Code limits for qualified plans.  The Company makes all required contributions to this plan. However, as described on page 38, the Management Pension Plan is now frozen and no further credits, other than interest, are made to the plan.  The executives, along with all other salaried employees, also participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which includes a Company matching contribution feature that vests 100% of such matching contributions in the employee's account as they are made to the plan.
The value of the Company's retirement program is not considered in any of the compensation decisions made with respect to other elements of NEO compensation, because the Company believes that the alignment of the interests of executives and shareholders is most effectively accomplished through its short- and long-term incentive compensation programs. Compensation Determination Process 
Role of the Compensation Committee and Management in Recommending Compensation
As described in greater detail below, individual base salaries, annual cash incentive awards and long-term incentive grant amounts are determined within the framework of the executive's position and responsibility, individual performance and future leadership potential, as determined by the Chief Executive Officer in consultation with the Compensation Committee, or by the Compensation Committee and the Board in the case of the Chief Executive Officer, as well as with regard to the external marketplace.
The Chief Executive Officer presents compensation recommendations for the senior executives, including the other NEOs, to the Compensation Committee for its review and approval.  The Compensation Committee evaluates the performance of the Chief Executive Officer, determines his compensation, and discusses its recommendation with the Board in executive session before the Board grants its approval.
Determination of the Target Compensation Levels
In determining pay levels, the Company established a philosophy to target each component - base salary, target annual incentive and target long-term incentive - at the market 50th percentile appropriate to the revenue size of the Company.  In implementing this philosophy, the Compensation Committee considers and evaluates the following information:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual study of market compensation practices conducted by Willis Towers Watson, the Company's compensation consultant, at the Company's request, whereby it obtains, compiles and supplies to the Company and the Compensation Committee competitive compensation information as  described below: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay practices for executive officers from Willis Towers Watson's compensation survey, reflecting general industry companies across a broad range of revenue sizes (the "General Industry Survey").  Since executive compensation correlates to a company's annual revenue (i.e., the higher a company's revenue, generally the higher the executive's market compensation), the Company, in consultation with Willis Towers Watson, uses a statistical technique called "regression analysis1" to adjust the survey data to the Company's revenue size.  The Compensation Committee approved the use of the General Industry Survey information as the primary source for market competitive assessments of NEO pay levels for the following reasons: 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ever-changing landscape of the telecommunications industry and the difficulty in assessing year-over-year changes in executive compensation within these companies due to mergers, acquisitions, etc.;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The lack of a sufficient number of suitable telecommunications companies within the Willis Towers Watson database to secure adequate pay survey data, resulting in the need to use proxy data for some telecommunications companies; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The absence of pay data in the proxies for certain NEO positions. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay practices for executive officers of a peer group consisting of 20 telecommunications and IT services companies (the "Telecommunications Peer Group").  Because of the reasons noted above, the Compensation Committee uses the information about the Telecommunications Peer Group as a secondary source for monitoring compensation trends to provide reasonable assurance that using the General Industry Survey data for comparative analysis does not cause an aberration of the Company's executive compensation at the 50th percentile.  The Telecommunications Peer Group used in 2018 is shown in Schedule 1. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee annually reviews and approves the list of companies in the Telecommunications Peer Group.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
1 Regression analysis is a statistical tool for determining the relationship between a dependent variable (in this case, target compensation levels) and an independent variable (in this case, revenue).  The technique correlates median predicted pay for companies by taking into consideration their revenues (i.e., smaller revenue companies would have pay predicted based on their revenues rather than by a simple median of pay for all companies in the General Industry Survey).  For each executive position whose compensation is assessed and set by the Compensation Committee (or the Board in the case of the Chief Executive Officer), Willis Towers Watson produces a predicted level for each pay component at the 50th percentile of companies based on Cincinnati Bell's revenues.  The use of regression analysis allows the Compensation Committee to compare each executive's pay, both by pay component and in total, to the market 50th percentile of similar revenue-sized companies 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To provide additional context for the Compensation Committee in making its decisions, the Compensation Committee reviews "tally sheets" prepared for each of the executives.  Tally sheets provide the Compensation Committee with detailed information, as of a given date, about each executive's current compensation (including the value of any applicable benefit programs) and wealth accumulation, including the value of accrued and vested pay, such as shares of Company stock, vested stock options and other equity awards owned by the executive, the value of any retirement benefits provided by the Company and any pay and benefits triggered under a variety of employment termination scenarios. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Input from the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Mr. Charles J. Mazza. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Input from Company management (primarily the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer) and the Company's independent compensation consultant, Willis Towers Watson. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each NEO's individual performance and current/future potential with the Company. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee considers, as one of the many factors, each component of executive officer compensation compared to the revenue size-adjusted market 50th percentile for two reasons:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benchmarking target compensation at the 50th percentile is consistent with the practice followed by a majority of companies and is considered "best practice," and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Above-median compensation should be on a delivered actual basis, rather than a target basis, for over achievement of target performance goals consistent with the Company's pay-for-performance philosophy. 
[END TABLE]
In determining the appropriate compensation levels in a particular year, the Company evaluates the following from the general industry survey and the industry peer group data:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total target cash compensation - the sum of base salary plus target annual incentive opportunity; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total target direct compensation - the sum of base salary plus target annual incentive opportunity plus target long-term incentive opportunity. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee compares each NEO's pay, both by pay component and in total, to the market 50th percentile of similar revenue-sized companies set forth in the peer groups.  The Company does not review pay levels at individual companies or the specific structure of other companies' short- or long-term incentive plans.  Instead, the Compensation Committee considers the predicted pay levels in both peer groups as an indication of market pay practice relating to each pay component and the relevant mixture among pay components.  Thus, the Compensation Committee is able to validate that each NEO's compensation package is market competitive and that an appropriate portion of it is "at risk;" that is, subject to payment only if the Company attains certain quantitative results and the individual achieves certain qualitative results.
For 2018, the charts below reflect that each executive has a significant percentage of compensation "at risk" as it reflects the allocation of total target direct compensation among base salary, annual incentive compensation and long-term incentive compensation. Based on market practices, combined with the Compensation Committee members' collective experience, the Compensation Committee believes that the foregoing allocation of pay among base salary and short- and long-term incentive compensation provides appropriate motivation to achieve objectives set for the current year while also providing a significant incentive that requires the executives to make decisions that are intended to sustain attainment of business objectives over the longer term.
Role of Compensation Consultants
Both the Compensation Committee and the Company have engaged a consultant to advise on compensation-related matters.  Neither the Compensation Committee nor the Company has identified any conflicts of interest with respect to their respective compensation consultant that would impair the advice provided by such compensation consultant.
The Compensation Committee retains Mr. Charles J. Mazza, an independent compensation consultant, who performs no other services for the Company or its management, to assist in its deliberations regarding executive compensation.  Pursuant to the Committee's instructions, Mr. Mazza analyzes and comments on various compensation proposals made by the Company and on various topics specified by the Committee and opines and reports on these matters in open sessions of Compensation Committee meetings.  In executive sessions of the Compensation Committee meetings, Mr. Mazza addresses subjects of particular interest to the Compensation Committee, such as compensation of the Chief Executive Officer, and presents his analysis of such subjects including the pros and cons of certain compensation elements and his recommendations. Pursuant to the Compensation Committee Chair's request, Mr. Mazza contacts each member of the Compensation Committee annually as part of the Compensation Committee's self-evaluation and reports his conclusions to the Compensation Committee.
The Company retains Willis Towers Watson to assist with various compensation-related projects during the course of the year. Typically, the Company has a discussion with Willis Towers Watson about a project, outlining the project's objectives, and discusses Willis Towers Watson's approach to the project before requesting them to complete the project. The projects range from requests for general compensation data or information to requests for specific guidance and recommendations, such as designing specific incentive plans.
Other Compensation Policies
Stock Ownership Guidelines
The Compensation Committee recognizes that executive stock ownership is an important means of aligning the interests of the Company's executives with those of its shareholders.  Stock ownership guidelines for the NEOs are as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chief Executive Officer - 5 times base salary (as adjusted each year) 
• Other NEOs - 2 times base salary (as adjusted each year) 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has established a time line of five years from the date the individual becomes an NEO to reach the guidelines.  To the extent possible, future long-term incentive awards will be made in shares based on share availability to assist the executives in meeting the guidelines.   Aside from the Company's actual performance from one year to the next, the price of the Company's stock may vary due to the general condition of the economy and the stock market.  Therefore, the Compensation Committee may measure an executive's progress more on the basis of the year-over-year increase in the number of shares owned rather than the overall market value of the shares owned in relation to the executive's ownership goal.  For purposes of measuring ownership, only shares owned outright or beneficially by the executive (including shares owned by the executive's spouse or dependent children and shares owned through the Company's savings plan) are included.  Shares represented by unvested stock options or any other form of equity for which a performance or vesting condition remains to be completed before the executive earns a right to and receives the shares are not counted in determining the executive's level of ownership.
As of March 4, 2019, Mr. Fox has achieved approximately 20% of his ownership goal; Mr. Kaiser has achieved approximately 12% of his ownership goal; Mr. Simpson has achieved approximately 20% of his ownership goal; Ms. Cornette has achieved approximately 21% of her ownership goal; and Mr. Wilson has achieved approximately 56% of his ownership goal.  
Prohibition on Hedging and Pledging
The Company's Insider Trading Policy expressly prohibits ownership of derivative financial instruments or participation in investment strategies that hedge the economic risk of owning the Company's common stock and prohibits officers and directors from pledging Company securities as collateral for loans. Employment Agreements, Severance and Change in Control Payments and Benefits
The Company generally enters into employment agreements with the NEOs for several reasons.  Employment agreements give the Company flexibility to make changes in key executive positions with or without a showing of cause, if terminating the executive is determined by the Company or the Board to be in the best interests of the Company.  The agreements also minimize the potential for litigation by establishing separation terms in advance and requiring that any dispute be resolved through an arbitration process.  The severance, CIC payments and benefits provided under the employment agreements as described in more detail beginning on page 43 are important to ensure the retention of the NEOs.
Depending on the circumstances of their termination, the NEOs are eligible to receive severance benefits in the form of a multiple of annual base salary as a lump sum payment, continued access to Company-provided healthcare benefits for a defined period post-employment, and accelerated vesting of all equity as determined by the provisions in their employment agreements, which are discussed in detail starting on page 43.  Under a dismissal without cause or constructive discharge following a CIC, the Company provides the severance benefits because it serves the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to have executives focus on the business merits of possible change in control situations without undue concern for their personal financial outcome.  In the case of a termination without cause or constructive discharge absent a CIC, the Company believes it is appropriate to provide severance at these levels to ensure the financial security of these executives, particularly in view of the non-compete provisions which state that, for 12 months (24 months in the case of the Chief Executive Officer) following termination, the executive will not compete with the Company or solicit customers or employees of the Company.  Because these potential payments are triggered under very specific circumstances, such payments are not considered in setting pay or other elements of executive compensation.  The Compensation Committee has a policy that the Company will not enter into any new or materially amended employment agreements with NEOs providing for excise tax gross-up provisions with respect to payments contingent upon a CIC, and no NEO has an excise tax gross-up provision.
Adjustments and Recovery of Award Payments and Clawback Policy
The Company is subject to the requirements of Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Therefore, if the Company was required to restate its financial results due to any material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, the Securities and Exchange Commission could act to recover from the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer any bonus or other incentive-based or equity-based compensation received during the 12-month period following the date the applicable financial statements were issued and any profits from any sale of securities of the Company during that 12-month period.
In addition, the Board has adopted an interim executive compensation recoupment/clawback policy with the intention that the policy will be modified when final regulations required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") are adopted by the SEC.  The policy allows the Company to recover incentive payments to, or realized by, certain executive officers in the event that the incentive compensation was based on the achievement of financial results that were subsequently restated to correct any accounting error due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under federal securities laws and such restatement results in a lower payment or award.
Compensation Limitation
Section 162(m) of the Code generally limits to $1,000,000 the available deduction to the Company for compensation paid to any of the Company's NEOs, except for performance-based compensation that meets certain requirements and is paid under a binding agreement that was in effect on or before November 2, 2017.  Under recent U.S. tax reform, the exception to Section 162(m) for performance-based compensation has been repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to certain transition and grandfathering rules.  Although the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment to the Company of its compensation payments, despite the new limits on the deductibility of performance-based compensation, the Compensation Committee continues to believe that a significant portion of an NEO's compensation should be tied to Company performance and continues to determine that it will not limit executive compensation to amounts deductible under Section 162(m) of the Code.  Therefore, it is not anticipated that the changes to Section 162(m) will significantly impact the design of the Company's executive compensation program going forward.

(1) The amounts shown above for long-term cash-settled performance units earned by Messrs. Simpson and Wilson represent the amounts earned in 2016 and paid in 2017 for the 2014-2016 performance cycle related to cash-payment performance awards granted in January 2014.   
(c) The amounts shown in this column for Messrs. Fox, Simpson and Wilson and Ms. Cornette represent the one-year change in the value of their qualified defined benefit plan and nonqualified excess plan for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, projected forward to age 65 for each executive with interest credited at 4.0%, and then discounted back to the respective year at the discount rate (4.2% for 2018, 3.6% for 2017 and 4.0% for 2016) required under Accounting Standards Codification Topic ("ASC") 960. The present value of the accrued pension benefits decreased in 2018 primarily due to an increase in the applicable discount rate. The Company froze participation in its qualified pension plan for management employees in 2009; therefore, Mr. Kaiser is not entitled to any benefits under this plan. None of the executives receive any preferential treatment or above-market interest under the Company's retirement plans. 
(d) For each NEO, the amount represents the Company's 401(k) match. Under the terms of the Cincinnati Bell Inc. Retirement Savings Plan, the Company's matching contribution is equal to 100% on the first 3% and 50% on the next 2% of contributions made to the plan by the participant. Eligible compensation generally includes base wages plus any annual incentive paid to eligible participants. For 2018, the maximum Company matching contribution is $10,800.

Employment Agreements 
During 2018, all of the NEOs were employed pursuant to agreements with the Company.  Each employment agreement sets forth, among other things, the NEO's base salary, annual incentive opportunities, entitlement to participate in the Company's benefit and pension plans and to receive equity awards and post-termination benefits and obligations. 
Based on the agreements in place at December 31, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Fox's employment agreement provides for the employment and retention of Mr. Fox for a one-year term subject to automatic one-year extensions.  Mr. Fox's employment agreement provides for both a minimum base salary of $650,000 and a minimum annual incentive target of $650,000 per year. 
• Mr. Kaiser's employment agreement provides for the employment and retention of Mr. Kaiser for a one-year term subject to automatic one-year extensions.  Mr. Kaiser's employment agreement provides for both a minimum base salary of $400,000 and a minimum annual incentive target of $400,000 per year. 
• Mr. Simpson's employment agreement provides for the employment and retention of Mr. Simpson for a one-year term subject to automatic one-year extensions.  Mr. Simpson's employment agreement provides for a minimum base salary of $450,000 and a minimum annual incentive target of $450,000 per year. 
• Ms. Cornette's employment agreement provides for the employment and retention of Ms. Cornette for a one-year term subject to automatic one-year extensions.  Ms. Cornette's employment agreement provides for a minimum base salary of $380,000 and a minimum annual incentive target of $380,000 per year. 
• Mr. Wilson's employment agreement provides for the employment and retention of Mr. Wilson for a one-year term subject to automatic one-year extensions.  Mr. Wilson's employment agreement provides for a minimum base salary of $368,000 per year and a minimum annual incentive target of $368,000 per year. 
[END TABLE]
Each of the NEOs, except for Mr. Kaiser, has accrued benefits in the Management Pension Plan, which contains both a qualified defined benefit plan and a nonqualified excess benefit provision (the provision for this excess benefit is contained in the qualified defined benefit pension plan document), which applies the same benefit formula to that portion of the base wages and annual bonus payment that exceeds the maximum compensation that can be used in determining benefits under a qualified defined benefit pension plan.
As described below, accruals under the Management Pension Plan are frozen. Except as noted below, prior to the freeze, all eligible salaried employees of the Company participated in the Management Pension Plan on the same basis with benefits being earned after a three-year cliff-vesting period. Covered compensation for purposes of calculating benefits includes base wages including any applicable overtime wages paid plus annual bonus payments.  Upon retirement or other termination from employment, the amount of vested benefits to be paid are generally based on the balance credited to the participant's cash balance account under the plan when the benefit begins to be paid but also subject to certain transition or special benefit formula rules in certain situations.  The vested benefits are payable either as a lump-sum, a single life annuity or, for married participants, a 50% joint and survivor annuity, which provides a reduced benefit for the employee in order to provide a benefit equal to 50% of that amount if the employee dies before his/her spouse. A 2009 amendment to the Management Pension Plan generally provided that only "grandfathered participants" and no other participants would accrue additional plan benefits based on their compensation and service after March 8, 2009. For purposes of the plan, a "grandfathered participant" is a plan participant who has continuously been an employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries since before 2009 and either: (i) was at least age 50 by January 1, 2009; or (ii) had been eligible for and accepted or declined a 2007 early retirement offer of the Company.  Also, the plan was further amended to reduce the benefits accrued by grandfathered participants based on their compensation and service after December 31, 2011 by approximately one-half from the prior accrual rate.  In addition, the Management Pension Plan was amended to stop accruals for grandfathered participants based on compensation paid after June 30, 2013 or services after the pay period ended June 29, 2013.  The Management Pension Plan benefits for the NEO's are shown on page 42.
Each of the employment agreements also provide for payments upon termination of employment as a result of death or disability, termination by the Company without cause or termination upon a CIC. The payments to the NEOs upon termination, including termination following a CIC as of December 31, 2018 are described beginning on page 43. Long-Term Incentives
In 2018, the NEOs long-term incentive grants for the 2018-2020 performance period were awarded as a combination of restricted stock units (50%) and performance-based stock units (50%).  The Compensation Committee believes the use of performance-based stock units provides an opportunity (i) for the NEO to be rewarded based on the Company achieving its more objective quantitative operating results that are consistent with its long-term business strategy and (ii) to more closely align such actions with shareholders' interests.  The Compensation Committee also believes that the time-based restricted stock units serve as an incentive to encourage the retention of the NEOs.  The long-term incentives granted to the NEOs are described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis that begins on page 20.
Salary and Cash Incentive Awards in Proportion to Total Compensation
In 2018, the percentage of total compensation for each NEO represented by the sum of their salary plus annual incentive and non-equity incentive plan compensation as shown in the summary compensation table on page 35 was as follows: Mr. Fox - 42% Mr. Kaiser - 66%, Mr. Simpson - 67%, Ms. Cornette - 75% , and Mr. Wilson - 66%.

Pension Benefits 
[END TABLE]
In February 2009, the Company made significant changes to the Management Pension Plan.  The Company froze pension benefits for plan participants who were not grandfathered participants (as previously described on page 38). Thereafter, the Company amended the Management Pension Plan to stop accruals based upon compensation paid after June 30, 2013 or services after the pay period ended June 29, 2013 for all participants, including grandfathered participants.  Messrs. Fox, Simpson and Wilson are not grandfathered participants and no longer accrue additional benefits under such plan based on current compensation or service.  Ms. Cornette is a grandfathered participant but no longer accrues additional benefits under such plan based on current compensation or service.  In addition, any employee hired on or after January 1, 2009 was not eligible to participate in the Management Pension Plan.  As a result, Mr. Kaiser is not eligible to participate in the Management Pension Plan.
The following table sets forth information regarding pension benefits:

(a) This column reflects the years of credited service under the plans rather than actual years of service with the Company, which are higher for each of the NEOs noted. Participants were no longer credited years of service upon the freezing of pension benefits. 
(b) Amounts in this column represent the accumulated benefit obligations computed using the same assumptions as used for financial reporting purposes, described in more detail in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
(c) If any of the above-identified executive officers had retired on December 31, 2018, they would have been entitled to a benefit based on the balance then credited to them, without any reduction, under the Management Pension Plan (both the tax-qualified defined benefit plan portion and the non-qualified excess plan portion) as of that date. They may elect a lump-sum or equivalent annuity form of payment subject to any payment restrictions in place due to the funding status. 
(d) Management Pension Plan. 
(e) Nonqualified ERISA Excess Provisions of the Management Pension Plan.

In June 2014, the Company changed the benefits under the long-term disability plan to include continuation of benefits for up to 24 months after the date of disability.   
[END TABLE]
 If any of the executives elects to voluntarily terminate employment with the Company, or if they are terminated by the Company for cause, they are entitled to no payments from the Company other than those benefits which they have a non-forfeitable vested right to receive (the "vested amounts"), which include any shares of stock they own outright, vested options which may be exercisable for a period of 90 days following termination and vested amounts under the Company's long-term incentive, pension and savings plans.
In addition to any applicable "vested amounts," an executive will be entitled to receive certain additional benefits if one of the four termination scenarios detailed in the above table and discussed below occurs.  Regardless of the termination scenario, Messrs. Fox, Kaiser, Simpson and Wilson and Ms. Cornette will continue to be bound by the non-disclosure, non-compete and non-solicitation provisions of their employment agreements.
If an executive is terminated by the Company without cause (an involuntary not for cause termination), the executive will be entitled to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A payment equal to 2.0 times the executive's base salary;  
• Access to medical, dental and vision benefits during the two-year period following the executive's termination of employment on an after-tax basis provided any required monthly contributions are made;  
• Continued treatment as an active employee during the two-year period following termination with respect to any outstanding long-term incentive cycles in which the executive may be participating, and any unvested stock options will continue to vest under the normal vesting schedule as though the executive was still an active employee (provided, with respect to awards granted under the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan, that the executive's termination is at least one year after the grant date of the award); and  
• The ability to exercise any vested options for an additional 90 days after the end of the two-year period.  
[END TABLE]
If an executive is terminated within the one-year period following a CIC, the executive will be entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A payment equal to 2.5 times the sum of his or her base salary and annual incentive target in the case of Messrs. Kaiser,  Simpson and Wilson and Ms. Cornette and 2.99 times in the case of Mr. Fox;  
• Access to medical, dental and vision benefits during the two-year period following the executive's termination of employment on an after-tax basis provided any required monthly contributions are made;  
• Full vesting of any options granted under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan and the ability to exercise such options for the two-year period following termination; and 
• Full vesting and payout at target amounts of any other awards granted under long-term incentive plans (in the event an executive is terminated within the two-year period following a CIC) that are continued after a CIC. Awards that constitute deferred compensation under Internal Revenue Code Section 409A shall not be continued in the event of a CIC and will become vested and pay out at target upon a CIC.  The types of outstanding awards that are deferred compensation are restricted stock units and performance-based stock units. 
[END TABLE]
If an executive is "terminated" because of his or her death, the executive's beneficiary will be entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A payment equal to the prorated incentive and payable to the deceased executive for the current year;  
• Full vesting of all options held by the deceased executive and the ability to exercise such options for the one-year period following the date of the executive's death; 
• Full vesting and payout at target amounts of any outstanding performance-based awards granted to the deceased executive under long-term incentive plans; and 
• Prorated vesting and payout from the date of grant through the date of death of any outstanding time-based awards granted to the deceased executive under long-term incentive plans. 
[END TABLE]
 If an executive is terminated by reason of disability, the executive will be entitled to the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A payment equal to the prorated incentive and payable to the disabled executive for the current year;  
• Full vesting of all options held by the disabled executive and the ability to exercise such options for the one-year period following the date of the executive's disabling condition;  
• Continued participation by the disabled executive in any outstanding performance-based awards granted under  long-term incentive plans; 
• Prorated vesting and payout from the date of grant through the date of disability of any time-based awards granted to the disabled executive under long-term incentive plans; and 
• Continued consideration of the disabled executive as an employee for all other benefits so long as the disabling condition that resulted in the disability-based termination is present for up to 24 months after the date of disability.  
[END TABLE]
Under all of the termination scenarios in the preceding table, as of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Fox, Kaiser, Simpson, and Wilson and Ms. Cornette had certain "vested amounts" to which they were entitled as follows: Mr. Fox - $72,238, Mr. Kaiser - $2,466, Mr. Simpson - $63,475, Ms. Cornette - $519,005 and Mr. Wilson - $356,442.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
[END TABLE]
As required by the SEC, we are providing the following information about the relationship between the annual total compensation ("ATC") of our employees and the ATC of Mr. Fox, our President and Chief Executive Officer (the "PEO").  
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year, 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ATC of the median employee of the Company was $75,839; and 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ATC for our PEO was $3,101,489  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018 the resulting pay ratio between the ATC of the PEO to the ATC of the median employee was 41:1.
To identify the median employee, we took the following steps:
[BEGIN TABLE]
1. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 4,300 employees.  Of those employees, approximately 1,100 persons (the "HT Employees") joined the Company with its acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which closed on July 2, 2018.  
2. In determining the employee population, the Company is permitted to, and did, exclude the HT Employees since they joined the Company as a part of an acquisition in 2018.  We used the remaining approximately 3,200 full-time, part-time and temporary employees (except for our PEO, 56 non-U.S. and Canadian-based employees and those employees on leaves of absence).   
3. The median employee was identified from our employee population by comparing our payroll records for such employees as reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form W-2 and to the Canada Revenue Agency on Form T4 for 2018.  We used a December 31, 2018 conversion rate of .73 CAD to 1 USD for our Canadian-based employees.  In addition, since the Company does not widely distribute equity awards to our employees, such awards were excluded from our compensation measure. 
4. We identified our median employee using this compensation measure, which was consistently applied to all our employees included in this calculation.  Since the majority of our employees and our PEO are based in the U.S., we did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying the median employee. 
5. Once we identified the median employee, we determined the ATC for the median employee in the same manner used to determine Mr. Fox's ATC as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 35, resulting in an ATC of $75,839. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Item 2 - Advisory Approval of the Company's Executive Officers' Compensation  
[END TABLE]
As required by the Dodd-Frank Act and pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Company is submitting to its shareholders a vote for the advisory approval of the Company's executive officers' compensation ("say-on-pay vote").  The Board of Directors determined that it would submit a say-on-pay vote to our shareholders annually.  This year's say-on-pay vote addresses our executive officers' compensation as disclosed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section ("CD&A") beginning on page 20 and the Executive Compensation section beginning on page 35.
The guiding principles of the Company's compensation policies and decisions include aligning each executive's compensation with the Company's business strategy and providing incentives needed to attract, motivate and retain key executives who are important to our long-term success.  Consistent with this philosophy, a significant portion of the total compensation for each of our executives is directly related to the Company's revenues, earnings and other performance factors that measure our progress against the goals of our strategic plan as well as performance compared to our peer companies.  The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that our compensation design and practices are effective in implementing our strategic goals.  For the above reasons, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution:
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED."
The say-on-pay vote is advisory and, therefore, not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board.   However, our Board and our Compensation Committee value the opinions of our shareholders, and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the named executive officers' compensation as disclosed in this proxy statement, we will seek to determine the causes of any significant negative voting results in an effort to better understand shareholder issues and concerns with our executive officers' compensation.
Vote Required
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares and 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, voting as one class, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. Under the rules of the NYSE, brokers are prohibited from giving proxies to vote on executive compensation matters unless the beneficial owner of such shares has given voting instructions on the matter. This means that, if your broker is the recordholder of your shares, you must give voting instructions to your broker with respect to this Item 2 if you want your broker to vote your shares on this matter. Proxies submitted without direction pursuant to this solicitation will be voted for the approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed in this proxy statement. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes are not considered shares entitled to vote on this proposal and will have no impact on the outcome of this proposal.
Our Recommendation
The Board recommends that shareholders vote "FOR" the advisory approval of the Company's executive compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed in the CD&A and Executive Compensation sections of this proxy statement.

Audit and Finance Committee Report 
[END TABLE]
The Audit and Finance Committee of the Board has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with the management of the Company and has reviewed a report from management assessing the Company's internal controls. The Audit and Finance Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, "Deloitte & Touche LLP"), the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the matters required to be discussed by the Statement on Auditing Standard No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, and Related and Transitional Amendments to PCAOB Standards and as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB"). The Audit and Finance Committee has also received the written disclosures and letter from the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm required by applicable standards of the PCAOB, has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP their independence with respect to the Company, and has considered the question of whether the auditors' provision of non-audit services was compatible with the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm maintaining its independence. 
Based on its review and discussions referred to in the preceding paragraph, the Audit and Finance Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Company's fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Board has determined that each member of the Audit and Finance Committee satisfies the independence requirements of the rules and regulations of the SEC and the independence and other requirements of the rules and listing standards of the NYSE. The Board has determined that Lynn A. Wentworth and Jakki L. Haussler are audit committee financial experts as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC and that each member of the Committee is financially literate as defined by the rules and listing standards of the NYSE.

Item 3 - Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
[END TABLE]
The Company's Audit and Finance Committee Charter provides that the Committee shall have the sole authority and responsibility to select, evaluate and, if necessary, replace the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.
On January 30, 2019, the Audit and Finance Committee retained Deloitte & Touche LLP as its Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to audit the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
The Company is asking the shareholders to ratify the Committee's appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. If the shareholders do not ratify this appointment, the Audit and Finance Committee will consider the results of the vote and determine whether to appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm to audit the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
One or more members of the firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP will attend the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement and will be available to answer questions.
Vote Required
Ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm of the Company requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the common shares and 6 ¾% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, voting as one class, present or represented at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions will have the effect of a vote against the proposal. Since the Company believes this proposal to be "routine," broker non-votes will likely be voted by the organizations holding such shares in their discretion.
Our Recommendation
The Board recommends a vote "FOR" such ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019.

[END TABLE]
Q: Why am I receiving these proxy materials? 
A: The Company's Board is delivering this proxy statement and the accompanying proxy materials to you in connection with the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which will take place on May 2, 2019. This proxy statement is intended to assist you in making an informed vote on the proposals described in the proxy statement. This proxy statement and the accompanying proxy card and other materials are first being mailed on or around March 19, 2019, in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Company's Board. As a shareholder, you are invited to attend the meeting and are entitled to vote on the proposals described in this proxy statement. 
Q: What information is contained in the package of materials that I received? 
A: The Company's combined proxy statement, Summary 2018 Annual Report and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which includes our 2018 consolidated financial statements, contains information relating to the proposals to be voted on at the meeting, the voting process, the compensation of directors and certain officers and certain other information required by the rules and regulations of the SEC and the rules and listing standards of the NYSE.  Although you are encouraged to vote either by the internet or by telephone, these materials also include a proxy card for your use in voting by mail or at the Annual Meeting. 
Q: What proposals will be voted on at the meeting? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
A1: The election of ten directors to serve a one-year term ending in 2020;

[END TABLE]

[BEGIN TABLE]
• "FOR" each of the Company's nominees to the Board;  
• "FOR" the advisory approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of our executive officers' compensation; and 
• "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to audit the financial statements of the Company for 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials?
A: Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, the Company has elected to provide access to our proxy materials over the internet.  Accordingly, we sent a Notice to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners, which instructs them as to how they may submit their proxy on the internet.  If you would like to receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials in the Notice.  In addition, you may request to receive proxy materials in printed form by mail or by email on an ongoing basis.
Q: How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?
A: Instructions regarding how to view the proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the internet and to instruct the Company to send future proxy materials to you via email or in printed form are included in the Notice and on the website.  If you elect to receive future proxy materials by email, the Company will save the cost of printing and mailing the proxy materials.  You will also receive an email next year with instructions containing a link to those materials and a link to the proxy voting site.  The election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. Q: What shares can I vote?
A: You may vote all Company common shares and 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares that you own (or for which you have been given the right to provide instructions as to how such shares should be voted) as of the close of business on the Record Date, which is March 4, 2019.  This includes: (i) shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record, including common shares purchased through the Cincinnati Bell Employee Stock Purchase Plan; (ii) shares that are held by a trust used in connection with a Company employee or director plan pursuant to which the value of such shares has been credited to your account under such plan; and (iii) shares held for you as the beneficial owner through a broker or other nominee.
Q: What is the difference between holding shares as a shareholder of record and as a beneficial owner?
A: Many Cincinnati Bell shareholders hold their shares through a broker or other nominee rather than directly in their own name.  As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those owned beneficially.
Shareholder of Record
If your shares are registered directly in your name with Cincinnati Bell's transfer agent, Computershare Investor Services, LLC, you are considered the shareholder of record for those shares.  As a shareholder of record, you may grant your voting proxy over the internet, by mail, by telephone or you may vote yours shares in person at the meeting.
Beneficial Owner 
If your shares are held in a stock brokerage account or by another nominee (including a trust used in connection with a Company employee or director plan), you are considered the beneficial owner of shares held in street name, and your broker or nominee is considered to be the shareholder of record. If you are a participant in the Cincinnati Bell Inc. Retirement Savings Plan or the Cincinnati Bell Inc. Savings and Security Plan, you are the beneficial owner of the shares credited to your account. As the beneficial owner, this proxy statement and accompanying form of proxy card were forwarded to you by the shareholder of record. As the beneficial owner, you may direct and provide voting instructions to your broker or nominee to vote the shares held in your account by proxy over the internet or by telephone by following the instructions provided in the Notice or the proxy card.  You can also mail your proxy to the Company by following the instructions provided in the proxy card (if forwarded to you by your broker or nominee).   You are also invited to attend the Annual Meeting. However, since you are not the shareholder of record, you may not vote these shares in person at the meeting unless you obtain a signed proxy from the shareholder of record authorizing you to vote the shares.
Q: How can I attend and vote my shares at the meeting? 
A: Shares held directly in your name as the shareholder of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting.  If you choose to attend the meeting and vote in person, you will need to provide proof of identification (such as a driver's license or passport) and proof of stock ownership as of the Record Date.  You will then be presented a ballot. Beneficial shares, held either in street name or credited to your account under a Company employee or director plan, cannot be voted at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a signed proxy from the shareholder of record authorizing you to vote these shares.
When you arrive, signs will direct you to the appropriate meeting room.  The use of computers, cell phones, pagers, recording or photographic equipment is not permitted in the meeting room at the Annual Meeting. 
Q: How can I vote my shares without attending the meeting? 
A: The methods for voting without attending the meeting are: 
By Internet - If you have internet access, you may submit your vote from any location by following the instructions provided in the Notice or the proxy card. 
By Telephone - If you live in the United States or Canada, you may submit your vote by following the "Vote by Phone" instructions provided in the Notice or the proxy card. 
By Mail - You may vote by mail by completing and signing your proxy card and mailing it in the accompanying enclosed, pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope. 
Q: What happens if I don't give specific voting instructions? 
A: The effect of not providing specific voting instructions depends on if you are the shareholder of record or the beneficial owners of the shares. Shareholder of Record
If you are a shareholder of record and (i) you indicate when voting on the internet or by telephone that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, or (ii) you sign and return a proxy without giving specific voting instructions, then the proxy holders will vote your shares in the manner recommended by our Board on each of the matters presented in this proxy statement for which you did not provide specific voting instructions, and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
Beneficial Owner
If you are deemed to be the beneficial owner of shares and do not provide the broker or nominee that holds your shares with specific voting instructions, the broker or nominee that holds such shares may generally vote on routine matters but cannot vote on non-routine matters, as provided by the rules of the NYSE.  If the broker or nominee that holds such shares does not receive instructions on how to vote on a non-routine matter, the broker or nominee will inform the Inspector of Elections that it does not have authority to vote on such matter with respect to such shares.  This is generally referred to as a "broker non-vote."  The Company encourages you to provide voting instructions to the broker or nominee that holds such shares by carefully following the instructions provided in the proxy card or as described above.
Q:  Which ballot measures are considered "routine" or "non-routine"?
A:     Proposal 1 (election of directors) and Proposal 2 (advisory approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of our executive officers' compensation) are considered non-routine matters, and your broker or nominee cannot vote your shares without your specific voting instructions.  Proposal 3 (ratification of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm) is considered a routine matter, which generally allows your broker or nominee to vote your shares on this matter even if you do not provide specific voting instructions.
Q: How are abstentions treated?
A: Abstentions are counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. For the purpose of determining whether shareholders have approved Proposal 1 (election of directors), abstentions are not treated as votes cast affirmatively or negatively and, therefore, have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. For the purpose of determining whether shareholders have approved Proposal 2 (advisory approval, by non-binding advisory vote, of our executive officers' compensation) and Proposal 3 (ratification of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm), abstentions will have a negative effect on the outcome of such proposals.
Q: Can I change my vote? 
A: Yes. You may change your vote at any time prior to the vote at the Annual Meeting. You may change your vote by either: (i) granting a new proxy or voting instructions bearing a later date (which automatically revokes the earlier proxy or voting instructions) whether made on the internet, by telephone or by mail; (ii) if you are a shareholder of record, notifying the Company's Corporate Secretary in writing that you want to revoke your earlier proxy; or (iii) if you are a shareholder of record attending the Annual Meeting, giving written notice of your proxy revocation in open meeting and voting in person. Please note that in order to revoke your previously granted proxy at the Annual Meeting, you must specifically request the revocation of your previous proxy.
Q: What does it mean if I receive more than one Notice or more than one proxy card? 
A: It means that your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all Notices and proxy cards that you receive.
Q: Where can I find the voting results of the meeting? 
A: We will announce preliminary voting results at the meeting and publish final results in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, which will be filed on or before May 8, 2019. 
Q: What happens if additional proposals are presented at the meeting? 
A: Other than the proposals described in this proxy statement, we do not expect any matters to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If you grant a proxy, the persons named as proxy holders, Lynn A. Wentworth, Jakki L. Haussler and Craig F. Maier, will have the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the meeting.  If for any unforeseen reason any of the nominees are not available as a candidate for director, the persons named as proxy holders will vote your proxy for such other candidate or candidates as may be nominated by the Board. Q: What classes of shares are entitled to be voted? 
A: Each common share and each 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Share outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date is entitled to vote on all proposals being voted upon at the Annual Meeting.  You are entitled to one vote for each common share and one vote for each 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Share you own of record on the Record Date or to provide instructions on how to vote such shares in which you have a beneficial interest.  The 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares will vote with the common shares as one class on each of the proposals described in this proxy statement.  There are no cumulative voting rights for either class of shares.  On the Record Date, we had 50,337,778 outstanding common shares and 155,250 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares outstanding. 
Q: What is the quorum requirement for the meeting? 
A: The quorum requirement for holding the meeting and transacting business is the presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the common and preferred shares issued and outstanding on the Record Date and entitled to vote at such meeting. However, if any particular action requires more than a simple majority because of the law, the NYSE rules, the Company's Amended Articles of Incorporation or the Company's Amended and Restated Regulations, that particular action will not be approved unless the required percentage of affirmative votes has been obtained or the required number of votes has been cast.  If a quorum is not present, the Annual Meeting will not be adjourned until a quorum is obtained.
Abstentions are counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. If a routine matter is to be voted upon, broker non-votes are also counted as present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.
Q: Who will count the votes? 
A: A representative of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") will tabulate the votes and act as the Inspector of Elections.
Q: Is my vote confidential? 
A: Proxy instructions, ballots and voting tabulations that identify individual shareholders are handled in a manner that protects voting privacy.  Your vote will not be disclosed either within the Company or to third parties except (i) as necessary to meet applicable legal requirements, (ii) to allow for the tabulation of votes and certification of the vote, or (iii) to facilitate a successful proxy solicitation by the Board.  Occasionally, shareholders provide written comments on their proxy card, which are forwarded to the Company's management. 
Q: Who will bear the cost of soliciting votes for the meeting? 
A: The Company is making this solicitation and will pay the entire cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and distributing the proxy materials. If you choose to access the proxy materials and/or vote via the internet, you are responsible for any internet access charges you may incur. In addition to the costs of mailing the proxy materials, the Company may also incur costs to provide additional copies of these proxy materials (if requested) and for its directors, officers and employees to solicit proxies or votes in person, by telephone or by electronic communication. Our directors, officers and employees will not receive any additional compensation for such activities. We have hired Broadridge for a fee of approximately $10,000 plus expenses to assist us in facilitating the voting of proxies over the internet and serving as the Inspector of Elections.  We will also reimburse brokerage houses and other nominees for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding proxy and solicitation materials to shareholders.
Q: What percentage of the Company's issued and outstanding voting shares do our directors and executive officers beneficially own? 
A: Our directors and executive officers owned 2.4% of our voting shares as of the Record Date. 
Q: Do any of our shareholders hold more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class of the Company's voting stock? 
A: As of the Record Date or an earlier date, if indicated, each of the following entities (together with their affiliates) indicated that it held more than 5% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company: BlackRock, Inc., Nomura Holdings, Inc. , Ares Management LLC and affiliates, The Vanguard Group, GAMCO Investors, Inc. and affiliates, and Credit Suisse AG/.  See page 19 for more details on the number of shares owned and percentage ownership as of the Record Date or an earlier date, if indicated.  Q: What is householding? 
A: Householding is a process that allows the Company to reduce costs and increase efficiencies by mailing only one copy of Company communications to multiple shareholders who reside at the same household mailing address. If you and other shareholders at the same household mailing address are currently receiving only one copy of Company communications but would like to receive separate copies or are currently receiving multiple copies of Company communications but would like to participate in our householding program, please see the instructions on page 57.
Q: Who can I contact if I have questions or need assistance in voting my shares or if I need additional copies of the proxy materials?
A: Please contact Broadridge, the firm assisting the Company in the solicitation of proxies, toll free at 1-800-579-1639.
