IMPORTANT NEWS FOR SHAREHOLDERS
While we encourage you to read the full text of the enclosed Proxy Statement, we are also providing you with a brief overview of the subject of the shareholder vote.
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q:  What matters am I being asked to vote on?
A:  Shareholders of all the Funds are being asked to elect five Trustees to the Board and vote on any other matter that may be properly come before the meeting of the Shareholders of the Funds (the "Meeting") or any adjournment thereof.
Q:  Why is an election of Trustees being held at this time?
A:   The Board has been (and currently is) comprised of Raj Aggarwal, Donald Lerner, Frank DeFino, Anne Peterson Ogan, and one seat is vacant. The current Trustees, other than Mr. DeFino, will not stand for re-election. Therefore, we are submitting to the Shareholders a proposal to elect five Trustees to the Board effective as of April 30, 2019 (the "Effective Date"): one of the incumbent Trustees, Frank Defino, and four new nominees who are Jennifer Rasmussen, John Micklitsch, Cindy Flynn, and Frank J. Roddy.  Approval of such proposal would fill all Board seats that are currently vacant or will be vacant as of the Effective Date.   
Q: Why am I being asked to elect Trustees?
A: The Trustees serve as representatives of shareholders of the Funds and have an obligation to serve the best interests of the Funds. Election by the Shareholders of the nominees for Trustees at the Meeting would fill all vacancies and reduce the possibility that an additional shareholder meeting would be required solely for the purpose of electing Trustees at a later date.  This possibility exists because, under the 1940 Act, at least a majority of the Trustees must have been elected by the Shareholders.  If all the Trustees standing for election are approved by the shareholders, 80% of the Board will consist of "Non-Interested Trustees" and 100% of the Board will have been elected by the Shareholders.  These percentages meet or exceed applicable legal standards. Q:  How does the Board recommend that I vote?
A:  After careful consideration, the Board recommends that you vote "FOR" each of the Trustees standing for election to the Board listed in Proposal 1.
Q:  Will my Fund pay for this proxy solicitation?
A:  Yes, the Fund will bear these costs.
Q: Why are the proposals for multiple Funds in one proxy statement?
A: The Funds offer a broad range of investment opportunities. Many shareholders own shares of multiple Funds. We have included the proposal for all Funds in this Proxy Statement to reduce costs for the Trust and reduce burden on the Shareholders with more than one proxy statement, which would increase printing and mailing costs and consume more paper. We recognize this Proxy Statement is long and have tried to simplify the contents as much as possible to aid in our review.
Q:  How can I vote?
A: The manner in which your shares may be voted depends on how your shares are held. If you own shares of record, meaning that your shares are represented by certificates or book entries in your name so that you appear as a shareholder on the records of Mutual Shareholder Services, LLC, out stock transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent"), you may vote by proxy, meaning you authorize individuals named in the proxy card to vote your shares. You may provide this authorization by signing and dating the applicable proxy card you receive for the Fund(s) of which you are a shareholder, and return such completed proxy card(s) in the prepaid, self-addressed envelope that is enclosed in this Proxy Statement. You also may attend the Meeting and vote in person. If you own Fund shares of record and you do not return a proxy and do not attend the Meeting in person, your shares will not be voted. If you return your signed proxy card, but do not indicate your voting preferences, Bradley A. Zucker and/or Joseph M. Spidalieri will vote for the proposal on your behalf. Remember to sign, complete an return a separate proxy card for each Fund in which you own shares.
If you own shares in street name, meaning that your shares are held by a bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee, you may instruct that institution on how to vote your shares. You may provide these instructions by voting via the Internet at proxyvote.com (and following the instructions on the website), by telephone by calling 1-800-454-8683 (and following the recorded instructions), or (if you have received paper copies of proxy materials through your bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee) by returning a voting instruction form received from that institution in the prepaid, self-addressed envelope that would be enclosed with the proxy materials. If you own Fund shares in street name and attend the Meeting, you must obtain a "legal proxy" from the bank, brokerage firm, or other nominee that holds your shares in order to vote your shares at the Meeting. Q: Can I change my vote after I mail my proxy card?
A: Yes. If you are a shareholder of record, you may revoke your proxy at any time before the close of voting using one of the following methods:
 You may submit another properly completed proxy card with a later date.
 You may send a written notice that you are revoking your proxy to the Trust's Acting Chairperson at 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 200, Cleveland, Ohio 44124.
 You may attend the Special Meeting of the Shareholders and vote your shares at the Meeting. Simply attending the Special Meeting of the Shareholders will not, by itself, revoke your proxy.
Q: How many votes are needed to approve the proposal?
A: Under Ancora's Declaration of Trust (the "Declaration of Trust"), the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Funds that are voted at the Meeting, voting together in the aggregate as a single class without regard to series or classes of shares, are required to elect a Trustee.
Q: What is the quorum requirement?
A: A quorum of Shareholders is necessary to hold a valid meeting. According to the Declaration of Trust, a quorum will be present if Shareholders holding at least thirty percent (30%) of the issued and outstanding Shares of the Funds are present at the Special Meeting of the Shareholders or represented by proxy. Your Shares will be counted towards the quorum only if you submit a valid proxy or if you vote during the Special Meeting of the Shareholders. If there is no quorum, the chairperson of the Board may adjourn the meeting to another date.
Q:  Whom do I call for more information?
A:  Please call the Trust at 1-866-626-2672. NOTICE OF SPECIAL MEETING

ELECTION OF NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE TRUST
At a Board meeting held on December 28, 2018, the current Trustees of the Board nominated for election the five nominees listed below to serve as Trustees of the Trust. 
At the Meeting, you will be asked to elect each of Frank De Fino, Jennifer Rasmussen, John Micklitsch, Cindy Flynn, and Frank J. Roddy as a trustee of the Trust (each, a "Trustee" and collectively, the "Trustees"). Except for Frank DeFino, none of the other nominees currently serves as a Trustee.  John Micklitsch is deemed to be an "interested person" of the Trust for purposes of the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the rules and regulations proscribed thereunder, as amended (the "1940 Act") and, therefore, serves as an "Interested Trustee" of the Trust.  Each of the other nominees is not an "interested person" of the Trust for purposes of the 1940 Act (each a "Non-Interested Trustee" and collectively, the "Non-Interested Trustees").  Each nominee was nominated by the incumbent Trustees, all of whom are Non-Interested Trustees.  If the Shareholders do not approve of this proposal, the incumbent Trustees will continue to serve in such capacity. If all of the nominees are approved, then the incumbent Trustees will be replaced with the nominees effective as of April 30, 2019. 
The persons named in a proxy card(s) will vote for the election of each of the nominees named above unless authority to vote for any or all of the nominees is withheld in the proxy.  Each Trustee so elected will serve as a Trustee until the election and qualification of a successor or until such Trustee sooner dies, resigns or is removed, as provided in the governing documents of the Trust.  Each of the nominees has indicated that he or she is willing to serve as a Trustee.  If any or all of the nominees should become unavailable for election due to events not now known or anticipated, the persons named as proxies will vote for such substitute nominee or nominees as the Board may recommend.
QUALIFICATIONS OF NOMINEES PRESENTED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT
All incumbent Board members, all of whom are Non-Interested Trustees, determined that the nominees proposed for election through this Proxy Statement are qualified to serve in their capacity as trustees of the Trust based on a review of the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of each Trustee. Information indicating the specific experience, skills, attributes and qualifications of each Trustee which led to the Board's determination that the Trustee should serve in this capacity is provided below.
John Micklitsch. Mr. Micklitsch has served as the Chief Investment Officer of Ancora Advisors since 2011. In addition to such responsibilities, he manages global, multi-asset class separate accounts for the firm's high net worth and institutional clients and serves on the firm's Investment Committee. Prior to joining Ancora, Mr. Micklitsch was lead portfolio manager for the small cap value strategy at Allegiant Asset Management, the institutional money management division of National City Corporation, where he was responsible for managing assets in excess of $1 billion. Frank DeFino. Mr. DeFino has been a Trustee since 2014.  Mr. DeFino has significant business leadership experience, having served as President and owner of AJD Holding Co. (private equity firm) since 1976.  He also has considerable experience in investing through the management of the company's funds for the last 25 years.  
Frank J. Roddy. Mr. Roddy served as the Executive Vice President of Finance and Administration at Swagelok Company from 2012 until the end of 2018. In such capacity Mr. Roddy oversaw the financial, customer service, supply chain, legal, global sourcing and logistics, risk management and information services operations of the organization. Before taking on such role, Mr. Roddy was the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Swagelok from 2000 until 2012.  
Jennifer Rasmussen, Esq. Ms. Rasmussen has been the Chief Operating Officer of FSM Capital Management LLC, a wealth management firm, since July 2007. In such capacity, she has advised clients on succession planning, establishing private foundations, regulatory filings related to investment advisory firms, developed internal control procedures, served as a senior member of the firm's high net worth family practice and provided financial, estate and retirement planning and executive compensation consulting.   
Cindy Flynn. Ms. Flynn is the Past Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer of New York Community Bancorp., Inc., which is currently one of the largest 25 largest bank holding companies in the nation and a leading producer of multi-family loans in New York City. As the Executive Vice President of New York Community Bancorp, Ms. Flynn was responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the bank's consumer banking business, which spans five states with 254 locations in Metro New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Florida, and Arizona. Ms. Flynn joined New York Community Bancorp., Inc. in December, 2009.  Prior to that, she was Chief Marketing Officer for AmTrust/Ohio Savings Bank from 2007 until 2009. 
Generally speaking, the incumbent Trustees believe that, collectively, the nominees have a balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills, which will allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Funds and protecting the interests of stockholders.
In determining that a particular nominee was qualified to serve as a Trustee, the Board considered a variety of criteria, none of which, in isolation, was controlling. Among other attributes and qualifications common to all nominees are their ability to review critically, evaluate, question and discuss information provided to them (including information requested by the Trustees), to interact effectively with Ancora Advisors and other service providers, counsel and the Funds' independent registered public accounting firm, and to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties as Trustees. 
In addition to the foregoing, when evaluating the nominees for election, the incumbent Trustees also took into account the contribution that the candidate would be expected to make to the betterment of our Funds' governance moving forward, their character, integrity and willingness and ability to commit the time necessary to perform the duties of a Trustee.  Each nominee's ability to perform his or her duties effectively is evidenced by his or her experience in one or more of the following fields: management, public accounting, consulting and/or board  experience in the investment management industry, consulting and/or board experience with public companies in other fields, non-profit entities or other organizations; educational background and professional training. 
The specific experience of each nominee is set forth in the tables below.

 BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE AND COMMITTEES
Leadership Structure
The members of the Board currently are: Raj Aggarwal, Donald Lerner, Frank DeFino and Anne Peterson Ogan, none of whom are "interested persons" of the Trust as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. Effective as of April 30, 2019, and assuming all nominees will be elected, the Board will be composed of five Trustees, none of whom are "interested persons", except for John Micklitsch who is an "interested person". Once the new Board is convened, the new Board will elect a new chairperson who will be one of the Non-Interested Trustees. The Chairperson's responsibilities include: coordinating with management in the preparation of the agenda for each meeting of the Board; presiding at all meetings of the Board; and serving as a liaison with other Trustees, the Trust's officers and other management personnel, the Fund advisors and counsel to the Independent Trustees. The Chairperson performs such other duties as the Board may from time to time determine. The principal executive officers of the Trust do not serve on the Board.
The Board meets periodically to review, among other matters, the Funds' activities, contractual arrangements with affiliated and non-affiliated companies that provide services to the Funds and the performance of the Funds' investment portfolios. The Board holds regularly scheduled in-person meetings each year and may hold special meetings, as needed, either in person or by telephone, to address matters arising between regularly scheduled meetings. During a portion of each regularly scheduled in-person meeting and, as the Board may determine at its other meetings, the Board meets without management present.
Audit Committee
The Board has appointed a standing audit committee (the "Audit Committee") comprised solely of Non-Interested Trustees.  The members of the Audit Committee currently are Raj Aggarwal, Donald Lerner, Frank DeFino and Anne Peterson Ogan.  If all of the nominees are approved, then effective as of April 30, 2019, the Board will elect new audit committee members. The Audit Committee meets at least once per year.  In the last fiscal year, the Audit Committee met twice.
The Audit Committee has the responsibility to, among other things: (i) select, oversee and set the compensation of the Trust's independent auditors; (ii) oversee the Trust's accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls and, as appropriate, the internal controls of certain service providers; (iii) oversee the quality and objectivity of the Funds' financial statements and the independent audit(s) thereof; and (iv) act as a liaison between the Trust's independent registered public accountants and the full Board.
The Board has not appointed a standing nominating committee or a standing compensation committee.  The Board believes that it is appropriate for the Trust not to have a nominating committee because of the relatively small size of the Funds and the Board and because such a committee would be an unnecessary expense to the Funds and their respective shareholders.  In addition, the Board believes that the function of a nominating committee can be  served by the Non-Interested Trustees, all of whom participate in the consideration of nominees to the Board.
OTHER BOARD MATTERS
Risk Oversight
The Board oversees risk management for the Trust directly and, as to certain matters, through its Audit Committee.  The Board exercises its oversight in this regard primarily through requesting and receiving reports from and otherwise working with the Trust's senior officers (including the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer), portfolio management and other personnel of the Advisors, the Trust's independent auditor, legal counsel and personnel from the Trust's other service providers.  The Board also relies on regular discussions with the Advisors at Board meetings regarding the sources of risk applicable to the Funds and an understanding of the appropriate level of risk acceptable on behalf of the Funds. The Board has adopted, on behalf of the Trust, and periodically reviews with the assistance of the Trust's Chief Compliance Officer, policies and procedures designed to address certain risks associated with the Trust's activities. In addition, the Independent Trustees meet quarterly to discuss matters of interest, which may include risk oversight.
Mandatory Retirement Age
The Board has adopted a mandatory retirement age of 75 for all Trustees.
Code of Ethics
The Trust and Ancora Advisors has each adopted a code of ethics, under Rule 17k-1 of the 1940 Act, that permit their respective personnel to invest in securities that may be purchased or held by the Funds.
Trustee Nomination Process
We do not have a Nominating and Governance Committee.  Therefore the entire Board, including the Non-Interested Trustees, are responsible for nominating candidates for the Board to the extent consistent with the 1940 Act and rules thereunder. The Board considers recommendations from a variety of sources, including recommendations from current Trustees and others.  The Board reviews the information submitted on the backgrounds and qualifications of those persons recommended.  
Generally speaking, the Board has determined that it should be made up of individuals who can contribute sound business judgment to Board deliberations and decisions, based on their relevant business, management, professional, academic or governmental service experience. Candidates for the Board should be of uncompromised integrity, and be able to fulfill their responsibilities as Trustees without conflict with the Trust and the Funds. Each Trustee should be prepared to devote substantial time and effort to Board duties and should limit the number of his or her other board memberships in order to provide such service to the Trust. Candidates for the  Board should be individuals with a demonstrated ability to work in a constructive manner with other Board members and management.
When seeking to fill a specific opening on the Board, the incumbent Trustees will consider the specific needs of the Board at the time to assure an overall balance and range of specialized knowledge, skills, expertise and diversity to provide the foundation for a successful Board. A candidate for service as an Independent Trustee must not be an "interested person," as that term is defined in the 1940 Act, of the Trust, the Ancora Advisors or their affiliates. Each candidate must provide such information requested by the Trust as may be reasonably necessary to enable the Board to assess the candidate's eligibility.
Number of Meetings of the Board and its Committees
In the last fiscal year, the Board met six times, which number includes regularly scheduled and special meetings of the Board.  None of the Trustees attended fewer that 75% of the aggregate of (i) the total number of meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she served as a Trustee; and (ii) the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board on which he or she served that were held during the period for which he or she served as a Trustee.
Annual Meeting of the Shareholders
The Trust does not hold annual meetings of the shareholders.
 Communicating with the Board
Shareholders can send communications to the Board or to individual Trustees by writing to the Board or Trustee as follows: c/o Ancora Trust, 6060 Parkland Boulevard, Suite 200, Cleveland, Ohio 44124.
BOARD RECOMMENDATION ON PROPOSAL 1
The Board unanimously recommends a vote "For" the election of each of the nominees to the Board.
PROPOSAL 2
OTHER BUSINESS
The Board has not been informed and is not aware that any other business will be brought before the Meeting other than the matters set forth in this Proxy Statement.  However, it is the intention of the persons named as proxies in the enclosed proxy card(s) to vote the shares represented by such proxy card(s) in accordance with their best judgment with respect to any other matter that may be properly presented to the Meeting or any adjournment thereof.  By signing and returning your proxy card(s), you give the persons acting as proxies discretionary voting authority as to any such matters. GENERAL INFORMATION
FAILURE OF SHAREHOLDERS TO APPROVE PROPOSAL 1
If the shareholders of the Funds fail to approve all five nominees presented in Proposal 1, the Board shall meet to consider appropriate action consistent with its fiduciary duties.  Such actions may include nominating a new slate of candidates for Trustees. 
SOLICITATION AND VOTING INFORMATION
Quorum
Thirty percent (30%) of the aggregate number of shares of a Fund, entitled to vote at the Meeting, shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by such Fund at the Meeting.
If the necessary quorum to transact business for any Fund, or the vote required to approve any proposal by any Fund, is not obtained at the Meeting, the persons named as proxies may propose, in their discretion, one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies.  The affirmative vote of the holders of any shares of each Fund present, in person or by proxy, at the Meeting shall be sufficient for adjournment.  The persons named as proxies will vote "For" any adjournment those proxies which instruct them to vote for a proposal and will vote "Against" any adjournment those proxies which instruct them to vote against a proposal.
Required Vote
Under the Declaration of Trust of Ancora Trust (the "Declaration of Trust"), the affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares of the Funds that are voted at the Meeting, voting together in the aggregate as a single class without regard to series or classes of shares, are required to elect a Trustee. For purposes of this Proxy Statement, the term "Funds" means Ancora Income Fund, Ancora/Thelen Small-Mid Cap Fund, Ancora Microcap Fund and Ancora Special Opportunity Fund.
The duly appointed proxies may, in their discretion, vote upon such other matters as may properly come before the Meeting. A proxy may be revoked at any time prior to its use by: (i) written notice of its revocation to the Chairperson of the Board at the above address prior to the Meeting; (ii) the subsequent execution and return of another proxy prior to the Meeting; or (iii) being present and voting at the Meeting and giving oral notice of revocation to the Chairperson of the Meeting.  Attendance at the Meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of your proxy.
For purposes of determining the presence of a quorum for transacting business at the Meeting, abstentions and broker "non-votes" will be treated as shares that are present but which have not been voted with respect to a particular proposal.  Broker non-votes are proxies received by the Trust from brokers or nominees when the broker or nominee has neither received instructions from the beneficial owner or other persons entitled to vote nor has discretionary  power to vote as to a particular proposal.  Accordingly, Shareholders are urged to forward their voting instructions promptly.
Proxy Solicitation
Solicitation of proxies will be conducted principally by the mailing of this Proxy Statement and the accompanying proxy card(s).  Proxies also may be solicited in person, by telephone, or by facsimile.
Expenses in connection with the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Funds.  Upon request, the Funds will reimburse attorneys, brokers, dealers, banks and voting trustees, or their nominees, for reasonable expenses incurred in forwarding copies of the proxy materials to the beneficial owners of shares which such persons hold of record.

INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
The accounting firm of Cohen & Company, Ltd. ("Cohen") has been selected as the independent public accounting firm for the Trust on behalf of each Fund for the current fiscal year.  Cohen, in accordance with Independence Standards Board Standard No. 1, has confirmed to the Audit Committee that they are independent auditors with respect to the Funds.  During fiscal years 2017 and 2018, Cohen also served as the Trust's independent public accounting firm.
Representatives of Cohen are not expected to be present at the Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence.
Audit Fees; Audit-Related Fees; Tax Fees; All Other Fees
Cohen billed the Trust the following aggregate fees for the Trust's fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, and December 31, 2018:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Fiscal Year  Audit Fees  Audit-Related Fees  Tax Fees  All Other Fees  
2017  $45,500  0  $10,000  0  
2018  $43,000  $1,110  $10,000  0  
[END TABLE]
Audit fees include amounts related to the audit of each Fund's annual financial statements.  Audit-related fees include the review of the Funds' semi-annual financial statements and dividend calculations and the review of the Trust's Annual Registration Statement that is filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Tax fees include amounts related to federal, state and excise tax return preparation, and tax advice, planning and compliance. There were no fees, in addition to audit, audit-related and tax fees, billed by Cohen for services rendered to the Trust during the Trust's last two fiscal years.
The Audit Committee has not adopted pre-approval policies and procedures described in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.  The Audit Committee pre-approves all audit and non-audit services provided by any independent auditors engaged by the Trust and any permissible non-audit services provided to its service affiliates, which have an impact on any Fund.  The Audit Committee approves the engagement of the independent auditors, and a majority of the Independent Trustees approves the engagement.
The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of non-audit services to Ancora Advisors, and any other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Ancora Advisors that provides ongoing services to the Trust and the Funds, that were not pre-approved, is compatible with maintaining Cohen's independence and has concluded that the provision of any such non-audit services is compatible with maintaining Cohen's independence.
