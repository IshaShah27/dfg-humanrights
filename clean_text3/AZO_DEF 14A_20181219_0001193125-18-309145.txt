Any business which could have been transacted at the Meeting as originally scheduled can be conducted at the adjourned meeting. 
Corporate Governance Matters 
Independence 
How many independent directors does AutoZone have? 
Our Board has determined that eleven of our current twelve directors are independent: Douglas H. Brooks, Linda A. Goodspeed, Earl G. Graves, Jr., Enderson Guimaraes, J. R. Hyde, III, D. Bryan Jordan, Gale V. King, W. Andrew McKenna, George R. Mrkonic, Jr., Luis P. Nieto, Jr. and Jill A. Soltau. All of these directors meet the independence standards of our Corporate Governance Principles and the New York Stock Exchange listing standards. 
How does AutoZone determine whether a director is independent? 
In accordance with AutoZone's Corporate Governance Principles, a director is considered independent if the director meets the independence requirements of the applicable New York Stock Exchange listing standards, and, with respect to the Audit Committee, the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. 
In determining the independence of our directors, the Board considers relationships involving directors and their immediate family members that are relevant under applicable laws and regulations, the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, and the standards contained in our Corporate Governance Principles. The Board relies on information from Company records and questionnaires completed annually by each director. 
As part of its most recent independence determinations, the Board noted that AutoZone does not have, and did not have during fiscal 2018, significant commercial relationships with companies at which Board members served as officers or directors, or in which Board members or their immediate family members held an aggregate of 10% or more direct or indirect interest. 
The Board considered the fact that Mr. Jordan is the Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of the board of directors of First Horizon National Corporation, parent company of First Tennessee Bank, which 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• participates in one of AutoZone's supplier confirmed receivables programs (under which some AutoZone vendors  are borrowers, but AutoZone is not);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• has established a Daylight Overdraft line which allows AutoZone to make large payments early in the morning  creating a "daylight" overdraft which is rectified at the end of the day;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• acted as Trustee for AutoZone's pension plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• offers brokerage services to AutoZone employees exercising stock options, and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• holds various AutoZone deposit accounts.  
[END TABLE]
During fiscal 2018, First Horizon National Corporation did business with AutoZone in arm's length transactions which were not, individually or cumulatively, material to either AutoZone or First Horizon National Corporation and which did not materially benefit Mr. Jordan, either directly or indirectly.  The Board also considered the fact that Mr. Brooks is a member of the board of directors of Southwest Airlines. During fiscal 2018, AutoZone purchased airline tickets from Southwest Airlines which were not, individually or cumulatively, material to either AutoZone or Southwest Airlines and which did not materially benefit Mr. Brooks, either directly or indirectly. 
The Board also reviewed donations made by the Company to not-for-profit organizations with which Board members or their immediate family members were affiliated by membership or service or as directors or trustees. 
Based on its review of the above matters, the Board determined that none of Messrs. Brooks, Graves, Guimaraes, Hyde, Jordan, McKenna, Mrkonic, or Nieto or Mses. Goodspeed, King, or Soltau has a material relationship with the Company and that all of them are independent within the meaning of the AutoZone Corporate Governance Principles and applicable law and listing standards. The Board also determined that Mr. Rhodes is not independent since he is an employee of the Company. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Our Board believes that having a combined Chairman/CEO, independent members and chairs for each of our Board committees, and an independent Lead Director currently provides the best board leadership structure for AutoZone. This structure, together with our other corporate governance practices, provides strong independent oversight of management while ensuring clear strategic alignment throughout the Company. Our Lead Director is a non-employee director who is elected by the Board. Earl G. Graves, Jr., a director since 2002, currently serves as our Lead Director. 
Our Lead Director: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chairs Board meetings when the Chairman is not present, including presiding at all executive sessions of the  Board (without management present) at every regularly scheduled Board meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Works with management to determine the information and materials to be provided to Board members;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approves Board meeting agendas, schedules, and other information to be provided to the Board;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Consults with the Chairman on such other matters as are pertinent to the Board and the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Has the authority to call meetings of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Is available for direct communication and consultation with major shareholders upon request; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Serves as liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
Board Risk Oversight 
Oversight of risk management is a responsibility of the Board and is an integral part of the Board's oversight of AutoZone's business. AutoZone's management takes a variety of calculated risks in order to enhance Company performance and shareholder value. The primary responsibility for the identification, assessment and management of the various risks resides with AutoZone's management. The Board is primarily responsible for ensuring that management has established and adequately resourced processes for identifying and preparing the Company to manage risks effectively. Additionally, the Board reviews the Company's principal strategic and operating risks as part of its regular discussion and consideration of AutoZone's strategy and operating results. The Board also reviews periodically with the General Counsel legal matters that may have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial statements, the Company's compliance with laws, and any material reports received from regulatory agencies.  The Audit Committee is involved in the Board's oversight of risk management. At each of its regular meetings, the Audit Committee reviews the Company's major financial exposures and the steps management has taken to identify, assess, monitor, control, remediate and report such exposures. The Audit Committee, along with management, also evaluates the effectiveness of the risk avoidance and mitigation processes in place. Such risk-related information is then summarized, reported and discussed at each quarterly Board meeting. 
To assist with risk management and oversight, AutoZone has adopted the concept of enterprise risk management ("ERM") using the framework issued in 2004 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's Vice President of Internal Audit, who reports directly to the Audit Committee, has been charged with leading the Company's ERM processes with the assistance of Company management. The Vice President of Internal Audit presents to the Audit Committee a comprehensive review of the Company's ERM processes annually. This presentation includes an overview of all significant risks that have been identified and assessed and the strategies developed by management for managing such risks. The Vice President of Internal Audit leads open discussions with the Audit Committee members to analyze the significance of the risks identified and to verify that the list is all-inclusive. Company management is also involved in these discussions to ensure that the Board gains a full understanding of the risks and the strategies that management has implemented to manage the risks. 
Other Board committees also consider significant risks within their areas of responsibility. The Compensation Committee considers risk in connection with the design of AutoZone's compensation programs. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees risks related to the Company's governance policies and practices. 
Corporate Governance Documents 
Our Board has adopted Corporate Governance Principles; charters for its Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees; a Code of Conduct for directors, officers and employees of AutoZone; and a Code of Ethical Conduct for Financial Executives. Each of these documents is available on our corporate website at www.autozoneinc.com and is also available, free of charge, in print to any stockholder who requests it. 
Meetings and Attendance 
How many times did AutoZone's Board meet during the last fiscal year? 
During the 2018 fiscal year, the Board held four meetings. 
Did any of AutoZone's directors attend fewer than 75% of the meetings of the Board and their assigned committees? 
All of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and their assigned committees during the fiscal year or such portion of the fiscal year after their election or appointment if they did not serve the entire fiscal year. 
What is AutoZone's policy with respect to directors' attendance at the Annual Meeting? 
As a general matter, all directors are expected to attend our Annual Meetings. At our 2017 Annual Meeting, all directors were present. 
Do AutoZone's non-management directors meet regularly in executive session? 
The non-management members of our Board regularly meet in executive sessions in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Board meeting. Our Lead Director, Mr. Graves, presides at these sessions.  Committees of the Board 
What are the standing committees of AutoZone's Board? 
AutoZone's Board has three standing committees: Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, each consisting only of independent directors.

Audit Committee Report 
The Audit Committee of AutoZone, Inc. has reviewed and discussed AutoZone's audited financial statements for the year ended August 25, 2018, with AutoZone's management. In addition, we have discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, AutoZone's independent registered public accounting firm, the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, Communications with Audit Committees, as amended and as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") in Rule 3200T, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the charter of the Committee. 
The Committee also has received the written disclosures and the letter from Ernst & Young LLP required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and we have discussed with Ernst & Young LLP their independence from the Company and its management. The Committee has discussed with AutoZone's management and the auditing firm such other matters and received such assurances from them as we deemed appropriate. 
As a result of our review and discussions, we have recommended to the Board of Directors the inclusion of AutoZone's audited financial statements in the annual report for the fiscal year ended August 25, 2018, on Form 10-K for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
While the Audit Committee has the responsibilities and powers set forth in its charter, the Audit Committee does not have the duty to plan or conduct audits or to determine that AutoZone's financial statements are complete, accurate, or in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; AutoZone's management and the independent auditor have this responsibility. Nor does the Audit Committee have the duty to assure compliance with laws and regulations and the policies of the Board of Directors.

Director Nomination Process 
What is the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's policy regarding consideration of director candidates recommended by stockholders? How do stockholders submit such recommendations? 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's policy is to consider director candidate recommendations from stockholders if they are submitted in writing to AutoZone's Secretary in accordance with the procedure set forth in Article III, Section 1 of AutoZone's Seventh Amended and Restated By-Laws ("By-Laws"), including biographical and business experience, information regarding the nominee and other information required by said Article III, Section 1. Copies of the By-Laws will be provided upon written request to AutoZone's Secretary and are also available on AutoZone's corporate website at www.autozoneinc.com. 
What qualifications must a nominee have in order to be recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for a position on the Board? 
The Board believes each individual director should possess certain personal characteristics, and that the Board as a whole should possess certain core competencies. Such personal characteristics are integrity and accountability, informed judgment, financial literacy, mature confidence, high performance standards, and passion. They should also have demonstrated the confidence to be truly independent, as well as be business savvy, have an owner orientation and have a genuine interest in AutoZone. Core competencies of the Board as a whole are accounting and finance, business judgment, management expertise, crisis response, industry knowledge, international markets, strategy and vision. These characteristics and competencies are set forth in more detail in AutoZone's Corporate Governance Principles, which are available on AutoZone's corporate website at www.autozoneinc.com. 
How does the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identify and evaluate nominees for director? 
Prior to each annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers incumbent directors and other qualified individuals, if necessary, as potential director nominees. In evaluating a potential nominee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the personal characteristics described above, and also reviews the composition of the full  Board to determine the areas of expertise and core competencies needed to enhance the function of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider other factors such as the size of the Board, whether a candidate is independent, how many other public company directorships a candidate holds, and the listing standards requirements of the New York Stock Exchange. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recognizes the importance of selecting directors from various backgrounds and professions in order to ensure that the Board as a whole has a variety of experiences and perspectives which contribute to a more effective decision-making process. The Board does not have a specific diversity policy, but considers diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, age, cultural background and professional experiences in evaluating candidates for Board membership. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee uses a variety of methods for identifying potential nominees for director. Candidates may come to the attention of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through current Board members, stockholders or other persons. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may retain a search firm or other consulting firm from time to time to identify potential nominees. Nominees recommended by stockholders in accordance with the procedure described above, i.e., submitted in writing to AutoZone's Secretary, accompanied by the biographical and business experience information regarding the nominee and the other information required by Article III, Section 1 of the By-Laws, will receive the same consideration as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's other potential nominees. 
Procedure for Communication with the Board of Directors 
How can stockholders and other interested parties communicate with the Board? 
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board by writing to the Board, to any individual director or to the non-management directors as a group c/o Corporate Secretary, AutoZone, Inc., 123 South Front Street, Dept. 8074, Memphis, Tennessee 38103. The Company's General Counsel and Secretary will review all such correspondence and will forward correspondence that, in her opinion, deals with the function of the Board or that she otherwise determines requires the attention of any member, group or committee of the Board. Communications addressed to the Board or to the non-management directors as a group will be forwarded to the Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and communications addressed to a committee of the Board will be forwarded to the chair of that committee.

Narrative Accompanying Director Compensation Table 
AutoZone's current director compensation program became effective January 1, 2018. 
Annual Retainer Fees.    Non-employee directors receive an annual retainer fee of $215,000 (the "Annual Retainer"). The lead director receives an additional fee ("Additional Fee") of $30,000 annually, the chair of the Audit Committee receives an Additional Fee of $25,000 per year, the chair of the Compensation Committee receives an Additional Fee of $20,000 per year, the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee receives an Additional Fee of $15,000 per year, and the non-chair members of the Audit Committee each receive an Additional Fee of $12,500 per year (such Additional Fees, together with the Annual Retainer, the "Director Compensation"). There are no meeting fees. 
Under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan, which replaced the AutoZone, Inc. 2011 Equity Incentive Award Plan (the "2011 Equity Plan"), non-employee directors receive Director Compensation in the form of Restricted Stock Units, which are contractual rights to receive in the future a share of AutoZone common stock. Upon timely delivery of an election form, a non-employee director may elect to receive $85,000 of the Annual Retainer plus any Additional Fees in the form of cash, paid in quarterly installments, with the remainder of the Annual Retainer paid in the form of Restricted Stock Units. All Restricted Stock Units are granted on January 1 of the applicable calendar year. 
If a non-employee director is elected to the Board, or assumes a different position, after the beginning of a calendar quarter, he or she will receive the Annual Retainer and/or Additional Fees, prorated based on the number of days remaining in the calendar year, for Restricted Stock Units or quarter, for cash, as appropriate. 
Restricted Stock Units become payable on the earlier to occur of (1) the fifth anniversary of the grant date, or (2) the date on which the non-employee director ceases to be a director (the "Payment Date"). Upon timely delivery of an election form, a non-employee director may elect to receive payment on the date on which he or she ceases to be a director. Restricted Stock Units are payable in shares of AutoZone common stock no later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the end of the tax year in which such Payment Date occurs. 
Other Predecessor Plans 
The AutoZone, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Director Compensation Plan was terminated in December 2002 and was replaced by the AutoZone, Inc. First Amended and Restated 2003 Director Compensation Plan (the "2003 Director Compensation Plan") and the AutoZone, Inc. First Amended and   Restated 2003 Director Stock Option Plan (the "2003 Director Stock Option Plan"). The 2003 Director Compensation Plan and the 2003 Director Stock Option Plan were terminated in December 2010 and replaced by the 2011 Equity Plan. The 2011 Equity Plan was terminated in December 2015 and replaced with the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. However, grants made under those plans continue in effect under the terms of the grant made and are included in the aggregate awards outstanding shown above. 
Stock Ownership Requirement
The Board has established a stock ownership requirement for non-employee directors. Each director is required to own AutoZone common stock and/or restricted stock units having a cumulative fair market value in an amount equal to three times the value of the base annual retainer payable pursuant to the Director Compensation Program within five years of joining the Board, and to maintain such ownership level thereafter. Exceptions to this requirement may only be made by the Board under compelling mitigating circumstances. Shares, Stock Units and Restricted Stock Units issued under the AutoZone, Inc. Second Amended and Restated Director Compensation Plan, the 2003 Director Compensation Plan, the 2011 Equity Plan and the Amended 2011 Equity Plan count toward this requirement. The in-the-money value of vested stock options does not count toward this requirement. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, each director meets or exceeds his or her obligations under the requirement.

THE PROPOSALS 
PROPOSAL 1 — Election of Directors 
Eleven directors will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders in 2019. Pursuant to AutoZone's Seventh Amended and Restated By-Laws, in an uncontested election of directors, a nominee for director is elected to the Board if the number of votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the number of votes cast against such nominee's election. (If the number of nominees were to exceed the number of directors to be elected, i.e., a contested election, directors would be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting.) Pursuant to AutoZone's Corporate Governance Principles, incumbent directors must agree to tender their resignation if they fail to receive the required number of votes for re-election, and in such event the Board will act within 90 days following certification of the shareholder vote to determine whether to accept the director's resignation. These procedures are described in more detail in our Corporate Governance Principles, which are available on our corporate website at www.autozoneinc.com. The Board may consider any factors it deems relevant in deciding whether to accept a director's resignation. If a director's resignation offer is not accepted by the Board, that director will continue to serve until AutoZone's next annual meeting of stockholders or until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, or until the director's earlier death, resignation, or removal. 
Any director nominee who is not an incumbent director and who does not receive a majority vote in an uncontested election will not be elected as a director, and a vacancy will be left on the Board. The Board, in its sole discretion, may either fill a vacancy resulting from a director nominee not receiving a majority vote pursuant to the By-Laws or decrease the size of the Board to eliminate the vacancy. 
Broker non-votes occur when shares held by a brokerage firm are not voted with respect to a proposal because the firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and the firm does not have the authority to vote the shares in its discretion. Shares abstaining from voting and shares as to which a broker non-vote occurs are considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but are not considered votes cast or shares entitled to vote with respect to such matter. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 1. 
The Board recommends that the stockholders vote FOR each of these nominees. These nominees have consented to serve if elected. Should any nominee be unavailable to serve, your proxy will be voted for the substitute nominee recommended by the Board, or the Board may reduce the number of directors on the Board. 
With the exception of Gale V. King and Jill A. Soltau, each of the nominees named below was elected a director at the 2017 annual meeting. J. R. Hyde, III is not standing for re-election to the Board.  Nominees

PROPOSAL 2 — Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
Ernst & Young LLP, our independent auditor for the past thirty-one fiscal years, has been selected by the Audit Committee to be AutoZone's independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting to make a statement if they so desire and to answer any appropriate questions.  The Audit Committee recommends that you vote FOR ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as AutoZone's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Under Nevada law and the Company's By-Laws, if a quorum is present, Ernst & Young LLP will be ratified as AutoZone's independent registered public accounting firm if the number of votes cast in favor of the matter exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the matter. Broker non-votes occur when shares held by a brokerage firm are not voted with respect to a proposal because the firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and the firm does not have the authority to vote the shares in its discretion. Shares abstaining from voting and shares as to which a broker non-vote occurs are considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but are not considered votes cast or shares entitled to vote with respect to such matter. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 2. The Audit Committee is not bound by a vote either for or against the firm. The Audit Committee will consider a vote against the firm by the stockholders in selecting our independent registered public accounting firm in the future. 
During the past two fiscal years, the aggregate fees for professional services rendered by Ernst & Young LLP were as follows:

PROPOSAL 3 — Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation — "Say-on-Pay" 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution on the compensation of our Principal Executive Officer, our Principal Financial Officer and our other three most highly paid executive officers (collectively, the "Named Executive Officers") at the Annual Meeting: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to AutoZone's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed in this Proxy Statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative discussion, is hereby APPROVED." 
This advisory vote, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to endorse or not endorse our executive pay program. The Board recommends a vote "FOR" this resolution because it believes that AutoZone's executive compensation program, described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, is effective in achieving the Company's goals of rewarding financial and operating performance and the creation of stockholder value. 
Our Board and Compensation Committee believe that there should be a strong relationship between pay and corporate performance, and our executive compensation program reflects this belief. While the overall level and balance of compensation elements in our compensation program are designed to ensure that AutoZone can  retain key executives and, when necessary, attract qualified new executives to the organization, the emphasis of AutoZone's compensation program is linking executive compensation to business results and intrinsic value creation, which is ultimately reflected in increases in stockholder value. 
AutoZone sets challenging financial and operating goals, and a significant amount of an executive's annual cash compensation is tied to these objectives and therefore "at risk"—payment is earned only if performance warrants it. 
AutoZone's compensation program is intended to support long-term focus on stockholder value, so it emphasizes long-term rewards. At target levels, the majority of an executive officer's total compensation package each year is the potential value of his or her stock options, which yield value to the executive only if the stock price appreciates. 
Our management stock ownership requirement effectively promotes meaningful and significant stock ownership by our Named Executive Officers and further aligns their interests with those of our stockholders. 
We urge you to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, as well as the Summary Compensation Table and related compensation tables and narrative, appearing on pages 20 through 45, which provide detailed information on our compensation philosophy, policies and practices and the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. 
Because the vote on this proposal is advisory in nature, it is not binding on AutoZone, the Board or the Compensation Committee. The vote on this proposal will, therefore, not affect any compensation already paid or awarded to any Named Executive Officer and will not overrule any decisions made by the Board or the Compensation Committee. Because we highly value the opinions of our stockholders, however, the Board and the Compensation Committee will consider the results of this advisory vote when making future executive compensation decisions. 
Under Nevada law and the Company's By-Laws, if a quorum is present, this matter will be approved if the number of votes cast in favor of the matter exceeds the number of votes cast in opposition to the matter. Broker non-votes occur when shares held by a brokerage firm are not voted with respect to a proposal because the firm has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares and the firm does not have the authority to vote the shares in its discretion. Shares abstaining from voting and shares as to which a broker non-vote occurs are considered present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but are not considered votes cast or shares entitled to vote with respect to such matter. Accordingly, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of Proposal 3. 
The Board recommends that the stockholders vote FOR this proposal. 
Other Matters 
We do not know of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those discussed in this Proxy Statement. If, however, other matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, your proxies will be able to vote those matters in their discretion. 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis provides a principles-based overview of AutoZone's executive compensation program. It discusses our rationale for the types and amounts of compensation that our executive officers receive and how compensation decisions affecting these officers are made. It also discusses AutoZone's total rewards philosophy, the key principles governing our compensation program, and the objectives we seek to achieve with each element of our compensation program.  What are the Company's key compensation principles? 
Pay for performance.  The primary emphasis of AutoZone's compensation program is linking executive compensation to business results and intrinsic value creation, which is ultimately reflected in increases in stockholder value. Base salary levels are intended to be competitive in the U.S. marketplace for executives, but the more potentially valuable components of executive compensation are annual cash incentives, which depend on the achievement of pre-determined business goals, and to a greater extent, long-term compensation, which is based on the value of our stock. 
Attract and retain talented AutoZoners.  The overall level and balance of compensation elements in our compensation program are designed to ensure that AutoZone can retain key executives and, when necessary, attract qualified new executives to the organization. We believe that a company which provides quality products and services to its customers, and delivers solid financial results, will generate long-term stockholder returns, and that this is the most important component of attracting and retaining executive talent. 
What are the Company's overall executive compensation objectives? 
Drive high performance.  AutoZone sets challenging financial and operating goals, and a significant amount of an executive's annual cash compensation is tied to these objectives and therefore "at risk"—payment is earned only if performance warrants it. 
Drive long-term stockholder value.  AutoZone's compensation program is intended to support long-term focus on stockholder value, so it emphasizes long-term rewards. At target levels, the majority of an executive officer's total compensation package each year is the potential value of his or her stock options. 
The table below illustrates how AutoZone's compensation program weights the base salary and "at-risk" components of its Named Executive Officers' fiscal 2018 total compensation. See the Summary Compensation Table on page 32 for additional details about fiscal 2018 compensation for all of the Named Executive Officers ("NEOs"). 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 William C.  Rhodes III*     16%       20%       64%       84%   
 All Other NEOs     26%       20%       54%       74%   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
*  Mr. Rhodes' long-term incentive consists of fiscal 2018 stock and option grants, plus one-fifth of the total annualized value of his one-time grant of 50,000 stock options in fiscal 2016. The one-time award vests 50% on  each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
Who participates in AutoZone's executive compensation programs? 
The Chief Executive Officer and the other Named Executive Officers, as well as the other senior executives comprising AutoZone's Executive Committee, participate in the compensation program outlined in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. The Executive Committee consists of the Chief Executive Officer and officers with the title of senior vice president or executive vice president (a total of 13 executives at the end of fiscal 2018). However, many elements of the compensation program also apply to other levels of AutoZone management. The intent is to ensure that management is motivated to pursue, and is rewarded for achieving, the same financial, operating and stockholder objectives.  What are the key elements of the Company's overall executive compensation program? 
The table below summarizes the key elements of AutoZone's executive compensation program and the objectives they are designed to achieve. More details on these elements follow throughout the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and this Proxy Statement, as appropriate.

Base Salary.    Salaries are determined within the context of a targeted total cash compensation level for each position. Base salary is a fixed portion of the targeted annual cash compensation, with the specific portion varying based on differences in the size, scope or complexity of the jobs as well as the tenure and individual performance level of incumbents in the positions. Points are assigned to positions using a job evaluation system  developed by Korn Ferry Hay Group ("Hay Group"), a global management and human resources consulting firm, and AutoZone maintains salary ranges based on these job evaluations. These salary ranges are usually updated annually based on broad-based survey data; in addition to Hay Group survey data, AutoZone also subscribes to survey information from a variety of providers for this purpose, as discussed below. 
The survey data used to periodically adjust salary ranges is broad-based, including data submitted by hundreds of companies. Examples of the types of information contained in salary surveys include summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, 25th percentile, etc.) related to:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• total direct compensation  
[END TABLE]
The salary surveys cover both the retail industry and compensation data on a broader, more general public company universe. Multiple salary surveys are used, so that ultimately the data represent hundreds of companies and positions and thousands of incumbents, or people holding those positions. The surveys generally list the participating companies, and for each position "matched", the number of companies and incumbents associated with the position. Subscribers cannot determine which information comes from which company. 
The salary ranges which apply to the Named Executive Officers, including the Principal Executive Officer, are part of the structure applicable to thousands of AutoZone's employees. AutoZone positions are each assigned to a salary grade. This is generally accomplished at the creation of a position, using the Hay Group job evaluation method, and jobs tend to remain in the same grade as long as there are no significant job content changes. Each grade in the current salary structure has a salary range associated with it. This range has a midpoint, to which we compare summary market salary data (generally median pay level) of the types discussed above. 
Over time, as the median pay levels in the competitive market change, as evidenced by the salary survey data, AutoZone will make appropriate adjustments to salary range midpoints so that on average, these midpoints are positioned at roughly 95% of the market median value as revealed by the surveys. This positioning relative to the market allows for competitive base salary levels, while generally leaving actual average base pay slightly below the survey market level. This fits our stated philosophy of delivering competitive total rewards at or above the market median through performance-based variable compensation. 
In making decisions related to compensation of the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee uses the survey data and salary ranges as context in reviewing compensation levels and approving pay actions. Other elements that the Compensation Committee considers are individual performance, Company performance, individual tenure, internal equity, position tenure, and succession planning. 
Annual Cash Incentive.    Executive officers and certain other employees are eligible to receive annual cash incentives each fiscal year based on the Company's attainment of certain Company performance objectives set by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of the fiscal year. The annual cash incentive target for each position, expressed as a percentage of base salary, is based on both salary range and level within the organization, and therefore does not change annually. As a general rule, as an executive's level of management responsibility increases, the portion of his or her total compensation dependent on Company performance increases.  The threshold and target percentage amounts for the Named Executive Officers for fiscal 2018 are shown in the table below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Chairman,  President & CEO        62.5%       125% 
 Executive Vice President        37.5%       75% 
[END TABLE]
Annual cash incentives for executive officers are paid pursuant to the AutoZone, Inc. 2015 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan ("EICP"), our performance-based short-term incentive plan. Pursuant to the plan, the Compensation Committee establishes incentive objectives at the beginning of each fiscal year. For more information about the EICP, see Discussion of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 35. 
The actual incentive amount paid depends on Company performance relative to the target objectives. A minimum pre-established goal must be met in order for any incentive award to be paid, and the incentive award as a percentage of annual salary will increase as the Company achieves higher levels of performance. 
The Compensation Committee may in its sole discretion reduce the calculated incentive awards paid to Named Executive Officers. Under the EICP, the Compensation Committee may not exercise discretion in granting awards in cases where no awards are indicated, nor may the Compensation Committee increase any calculated awards. Any such "positive" discretionary changes, were they to occur, would be paid outside of the EICP and reported under the appropriate Bonus column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 32; however, the Compensation Committee has not historically exercised this discretion. 
The Compensation Committee, as described in the EICP, may (but is not required to) disregard the effect of one-time charges and extraordinary events such as asset write-downs, litigation judgments or settlements, changes in tax laws, accounting principles or other laws or provisions affecting reported results, accruals for reorganization or restructuring, and any other extraordinary non-recurring items, acquisitions or divestitures and any foreign exchange gains or losses on the calculation of performance. 
The incentive objectives for fiscal 2018 were set during a September 2017 Compensation Committee meeting, and were based on the achievement of specified levels of earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") and return on invested capital ("ROIC"), as are the incentive objectives for fiscal 2019, which were set during a Compensation Committee meeting held in September 2018. The total incentive award is determined based on the impact of EBIT and ROIC on AutoZone's economic profit for the year, rather than by a simple allocation of a portion of the award to achievement of the EBIT target and a portion to achievement of the ROIC target. EBIT and ROIC are key inputs to the calculation of economic profit (sometimes referred to as "economic value added"), and have been determined by our Compensation Committee to be important factors in enhancing stockholder value. If both the EBIT and ROIC targets are achieved, the result will be a 100%, or target, payout. However, the payout cannot exceed 100% unless the EBIT target is exceeded (i.e., unless there is "excess EBIT" to fund the additional incentive payout). Additionally, when the aggregate incentive amount is calculated, if the resulting payout amount in excess of target exceeds a specified percentage of excess EBIT (currently 20%), then the incentive payout will be reduced until the total amount of the incentive payment in excess of target is within that specified limit. 
The specific targets are tied to achievement of the Company's operating plan for the fiscal year. In 2018, the target objectives were EBIT of $2,152 million and ROIC of 27.5%. The 2018 incentive awards for each named executive officer were based on the following performance: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 EICP Target        2,152.0         27.5% 
 Actual (as adjusted)        2,141.6         28.3% 
 Difference        (10.5)        83 bps  
[END TABLE]
Effect of Performance on Total Annual Cash Compensation.    Because AutoZone emphasizes pay for performance, it is only when the Company exceeds its target objectives that an executive's total annual cash  compensation begins to climb relative to the median market level. Similarly, Company performance below target will cause an executive's total annual cash compensation to drop below market median. As discussed below, AutoZone does not engage in strict benchmarking of compensation levels, i.e., we do not use specific data to support precise targeting of compensation, such as setting an executive's base pay at the 50th percentile of an identified group of companies. 
Incentive Compensation Recovery Policy.    During fiscal 2017, AutoZone implemented an incentive compensation recovery, or "clawback", policy. The purpose of the policy is to enable AutoZone's Board, at its discretion, to recover excess incentive compensation in the event that the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement to correct an error that is material to the previously issued financial statements. "Excess" compensation is generally the amount of performance-based compensation paid above what would have been received had the statements in question been accurate. The Company will revise and administer this policy in compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act provisions, once the rules implementing those provisions become effective. 
Stock compensation.    To emphasize achievement of long-term stockholder value, AutoZone's executives receive a significant portion of their targeted total compensation in the form of non-qualified stock options. Although stock options have potential worth at the time they are granted, they only confer actual value if AutoZone's stock price appreciates between the grant date and the exercise date. For this reason, we believe stock options are a highly effective long-term compensation vehicle to reward executives for creating stockholder value. We want our executives to realize total compensation levels well above the market norm, because when they do, such success is the result of achievement of Company financial and operating objectives that leads to growth in the per-share value of AutoZone common stock. 
AutoZone grants stock options annually. Currently, the annual grants are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee in the meeting (typically in late September or early October) at which it reviews prior year results, determines incentive payouts, and takes other compensation actions affecting its executive officers. The Compensation Committee has not delegated its authority to grant stock options; all grants are directly approved by the Compensation Committee. Option grant amounts for the Chief Executive Officer's direct reports and other senior executives are recommended to the Compensation Committee by the Chief Executive Officer, based on individual performance and the size and scope of the position held. AutoZone's practice is to limit the total option shares granted to its employees during the annual grant process to approximately one percent of common shares outstanding. The annual grant is typically made near the beginning of the fiscal year and does not include a limited number of promotional or new hire grants that may be made during the fiscal year. The Compensation Committee reserves the right to deviate from this policy as it deems appropriate. 
Newly promoted or hired officers may receive an option grant shortly after their hire or promotion. New hire or promotional stock options are individually approved at a regularly scheduled meeting of the Compensation Committee, or by unanimous written consent of the Compensation Committee. The grants are recommended to the Compensation Committee by the Chief Executive Officer based on individual circumstances (e.g., what may be required in order to attract a new executive). Internal promotional grants are prorated based on the time elapsed since the officer received a regular annual grant of stock options. 
On October 7, 2015, the Compensation Committee authorized a one-time award of 50,000 nonqualified stock options to Mr. Rhodes. The options, which have an expiration date of October 8, 2025, vest in one-half increments on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant. The purpose of this one-time award is to solidify Mr. Rhodes' commitment to AutoZone as well as to motivate continued high performance in a way that is aligned with both stockholder results as well as AutoZone's leadership team incentives. 
Stock purchase plans.    AutoZone maintains the Seventh Amended and Restated AutoZone, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("Employee Stock Purchase Plan") which enables all employees to purchase AutoZone common stock at a discount, subject to IRS-determined limitations. Based on IRS rules, we limit the annual purchases in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan to no more than $15,000, and no more than 10% of eligible compensation. To support and encourage stock ownership by our executives, AutoZone also established a  non-qualified stock purchase plan. The AutoZone, Inc. Sixth Amended and Restated Executive Stock Purchase Plan ("Executive Stock Purchase Plan") permits participants to acquire AutoZone common stock in excess of the purchase limits contained in AutoZone's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Because the Executive Stock Purchase Plan is not required to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, it has a higher limit on the percentage of a participant's compensation that may be used to purchase shares (25%) and places no dollar limit on the amount of a participant's compensation that may be used to purchase shares under the plan. 
The Executive Stock Purchase Plan operates in a similar manner to the tax-qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan, in that it allows executives to contribute after-tax compensation for use in making quarterly purchases of AutoZone common stock. Options are granted under the Executive Stock Purchase Plan each calendar quarter and consist of two parts: a restricted share option and an unvested share option. Shares are purchased under the restricted share option at 100% of the closing price of AutoZone stock at the end of the calendar quarter (i.e., not at a discount), and a number of shares are issued under the unvested share option at no cost to the executive, so that the total number of shares acquired upon exercise of both options is equivalent to the number of shares that could have been purchased with the contributions at a price equal to 85% of the stock price at the end of the quarter. The unvested shares are subject to forfeiture if the executive does not remain with the company for one year after the grant date. After one year, the shares vest, and the executive owes taxes based on the share price on the vesting date (unless a so-called 83(b) election was made on the date of grant). 
The table below can be used to compare and contrast the stock purchase plans. For more information about our stock-based plans, including the Executive Stock Purchase Plan, see Discussion of Plan-Based Awards Table on page 35. 
How does the Compensation Committee consider and determine executive and director compensation? 
Chief Executive Officer.    The Compensation Committee establishes the compensation level for the Chief Executive Officer, including base salary, annual cash incentive compensation, and stock-based awards. The Chief Executive Officer's compensation is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee in conjunction with a review of his individual performance by the non-management directors, taking into account all forms of compensation, including base salary, annual cash incentive, stock options and other stock-based awards, and the value of other benefits received. 
Other Executive Officers.    The Compensation Committee reviews and approves base salaries for AutoZone's executive officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer) based on each executive officer's  individual performance during the past fiscal year and on the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee approves the annual cash incentive amounts for the executive officers, which are determined by objectives approved by the Compensation Committee at the beginning of each fiscal year as discussed above. The actual incentive amount paid depends on performance relative to the target objectives. 
The Compensation Committee approves awards of stock options to many levels of management, including executive officers. Stock options are granted to executive officers upon initial hire or promotion, and thereafter are typically granted annually in accordance with guidelines established by the Compensation Committee as discussed above. The actual grant is determined by the Compensation Committee based on the guidelines and the performance of the individual in the position. The Compensation Committee considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. Other than grants of stock made pursuant to the stock purchase plans discussed above, from time to time the Compensation Committee has sole authority to approve any other individual awards of stock-based compensation. 
Management Stock Ownership Requirement.    To further reinforce AutoZone's objective of driving long-term stockholder results, AutoZone maintains a stock ownership requirement for all Executive Committee members (a total of 13 individuals at the end of fiscal 2018). Covered executives must attain a specified minimum level of stock ownership, based on a multiple of their base salary, within 5 years of the executive's placement into a covered position. Executives who are promoted into a position with a higher multiple will have an additional 3 years to attain the increased required ownership level. In order to calculate whether each executive meets the ownership requirement, we total the value of each executive's holdings of whole shares of stock and the intrinsic (or "in-the-money") value of vested stock options, based on the fiscal year-end closing price of AutoZone stock, and compare that value to the appropriate multiple of fiscal year-end base salary. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all Executive Committee members exceed the ownership requirement. 
To encourage full participation in our equity plans, all AutoZone stock acquired under those plans is included in the executive's holdings for purposes of calculating his or her ownership. This includes vested stock options and vested shares which have restrictions on sale. 
Key features of the stock ownership requirement are summarized in the table below:

Are there any restrictions on the ability of our executive officers to engage in transactions involving our stock? 
AutoZone has adopted comprehensive and detailed policies that regulate trading in our securities by our officers, directors and employees, including blackout periods when trading in our securities is not permitted.   AutoZone's officers, directors, and employees are strictly prohibited from hedging our securities. Directors, Named Executive Officers and other senior executives are strictly prohibited from pledging our securities as collateral. 
What roles do the Chief Executive Officer and other executive officers play in the determination of executive compensation? 
The Chief Executive Officer attends most meetings of the Compensation Committee and participates in the process by answering Compensation Committee questions about pay philosophy and by ensuring that the Compensation Committee's requests for information are fulfilled. He also assists the Compensation Committee in determining the compensation of the executive officers by providing recommendations and input about such matters as individual performance, tenure, and size, scope and complexity of their positions. The Chief Executive Officer makes specific recommendations to the Compensation Committee concerning the compensation of his direct reports and other senior executives, including the executive officers. These recommendations usually relate to base salary increases, changes to annual incentive targets and stock option grants. The Chief Executive Officer also recommends pay packages for newly hired executives. Management provides the Compensation Committee with data, analyses and perspectives on market trends and annually prepares information to assist the Compensation Committee in its consideration of such recommendations. Annual incentive awards are based on achievement of business objectives set by the Compensation Committee, but the Compensation Committee may exercise negative discretion, and if it does so, it is typically in reliance on the Chief Executive Officer's assessment of an individual's performance. 
The Chief Executive Officer is not a party to the deliberations of the Compensation Committee regarding his own compensation. The Senior Vice President, Human Resources has direct discussions with the Compensation Committee Chair regarding the Compensation Committee's recommendations on the Chief Executive Officer's compensation. The Compensation Committee may seek input from the Chief Executive Officer regarding his compensation; however, Compensation Committee discussions of specific pay actions related to the Chief Executive Officer are held outside his presence. 
Does AutoZone use compensation consultants? 
The Compensation Committee has authority, pursuant to its charter, to hire consultants of its selection to advise it with respect to AutoZone's compensation programs, and it may also limit the use of the Compensation Committee's compensation consultants by AutoZone's management as it deems appropriate. Although historically AutoZone has hired consultants to provide services from time to time, it is not AutoZone's usual practice, and, neither the Compensation Committee nor AutoZone's management regularly engages consultants as part of the annual review and determination of executive compensation. 
What are AutoZone's peer group and compensation benchmarking practices? 
AutoZone reviews publicly-available data from a peer group of companies to help us ensure that our overall compensation remains competitive. The peer group data we use is from proxy filings and other published sources – it is not prepared or compiled especially for AutoZone. 
We periodically review the appropriateness of this peer group. It typically has changed when such events as acquisitions and spin-offs have occurred, and in the event a member company experiences significant performance challenges. The criteria used to select the peer group companies include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Direct competitors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies with which we compete for talent, customers and capital; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Companies with key financial measures within a reasonable range compared to those same measures for AutoZone  (e.g., revenues between 50% and 200% of AutoZone's).

Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("Tax Reform") that was signed into law December 22, 2017, the Compensation Committee considered the provisions of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code which allowed the Company to take an income tax deduction for compensation up to $1 million and for certain compensation exceeding $1 million paid in any taxable year to a "covered employee" as that term is defined in the Code. There was an exception for qualified performance-based compensation, and AutoZone's compensation program was designed to maximize the tax deductibility of compensation paid to executive officers, where possible. The Tax Reform includes substantial changes to Section 162(m), which generally eliminate tax deductions for any compensation in excess of $1 million paid to covered employees. 
The Tax Reform allows certain compensation to be grandfathered, which will enable the Company to continue to take a tax deduction for amounts exceeding $1 million. Fiscal 2018-related payments made pursuant to AutoZone's Executive Incentive Compensation Plan, as well as the stock options granted to the Company's named executive officers through fiscal 2018 under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan, should qualify as performance-based compensation. However, final guidance from the Internal Revenue Service is required for confirmation. Base salaries (less deferred compensation), restricted stock awards, Executive Stock Purchase Plan vested shares, and certain benefits and perquisites do not qualify as performance-based under 162(m). For fiscal 2018, the sum of this compensation for each of AutoZone's "covered employees" did not exceed $1 million; therefore, the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the other "covered employees" was fully deductible. 
Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code was created with the passage of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. These tax regulations create strict rules related to non-qualified deferred compensation earned and vested on or after January 1, 2005. The Internal Revenue Service periodically releases Notices and other guidance related to Section 409A, and AutoZone continues to take actions necessary to comply with the Section's requirements by the deadlines established by the Internal Revenue Service. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "Committee") has reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis ("CD&A"). Based on the review and discussions, the Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the CD&A be included in this proxy statement.  Members of the Compensation Committee: 
George R. Mrkonic, Jr. (Chair) 
Douglas H. Brooks 
Linda A. Goodspeed 
Gale V. King 
W. Andrew McKenna 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The Compensation Committee is composed solely of independent, non-employee directors. The members of the Compensation Committee of the Board during the 2018 fiscal year are listed above. 
Compensation Program Risk Assessment 
AutoZone's management conducts periodic assessments of the compensation plans and programs that apply throughout the Company, including those plans and programs in which our executives participate. The assessments are performed by key members of AutoZone's human resources, finance, operations, and legal teams, and entails thorough discussions of each plan's or program's design and operation. Significant findings are reviewed by senior management prior to being reviewed and discussed with the Compensation Committee. 
Plan elements which are reviewed include participants, performance measures, performance and payout curves or formulas, how target level performance is determined (including whether any thresholds and caps exist), how frequently payouts occur, and the mix of fixed and variable compensation which the plan delivers. The plans and programs are also reviewed from the standpoint of reasonableness (e.g., how target and above-target pay levels compare to similar plans for similar populations at other companies, and how payout amounts relate to the results which generate the payment), how well the plans and programs are aligned with AutoZone's goals and objectives, and from an overall standpoint, whether these plans and programs represent an appropriate mix of short- and long-term compensation. 
The purpose of these reviews is to determine whether the risks related to the design and operation of these plans and programs, if present, are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. We believe that our compensation plans, policies and practices do not encourage excessive risk-taking and are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. The various mitigating factors which support this conclusion include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Oversight of the management incentive plan and all stock-based compensation by the Compensation Committee of the  Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Senior management oversight of key plans and programs, including approving target level payouts, setting  financial and operating goals, and approving payouts;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Administration and oversight of plans and programs by multiple functions within the Company (e.g., finance,  operations, legal and human resources);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Existence of an incentive compensation recovery ("clawback") policy;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Interrelationship between measures (e.g., correlation between economic profit performance and appreciation in the  per-share price of AutoZone's stock);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Vesting and stock ownership requirements for executive officers which encourage long-term perspectives among  participants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A preference for performance measures which result in payments only upon achievement of ultimate financial  results.

Discussion of Plan-Based Awards Table 
Executive Incentive Compensation Plan.    The EICP was designed to be a performance-based compensation plan under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company's executive officers, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board, are eligible to participate in the EICP. At the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee establishes a goal, which may be a range from a minimum to a maximum attainable bonus, based on one or more of the following measures: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Earnings       Return on invested capital 
   Earnings per share       Economic value added 
   Sales       Return on inventory 
   Market share       EBIT margin 
   Operating or net cash flows       Sales per square foot 
   Pre-tax profits       Comparable store sales 
   Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)     
[END TABLE]
The EICP provides that the goal may be different for different executives. The goals can change annually to support our business objectives. After the end of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee must certify the attainment of goals under the EICP and direct the amount to be paid to each participant in cash. The EICP, along with other plans designed in accordance with Section 162(m), will be reviewed for needed changes as guidance is released by the Internal Revenue Service. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on page 20 for more information about the EICP. 
Executive Stock Purchase Plan.    The Executive Stock Purchase Plan permits participants to acquire AutoZone common stock in excess of the purchase limits contained in AutoZone's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Because the Executive Stock Purchase Plan is not required to comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, it has a higher limit on the percentage of a participant's compensation that may be used to purchase shares (25%) and places no dollar limit on the amount of a participant's compensation that may be used to purchase shares under the plan. For more information about the Executive Stock Purchase Plan, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" on page 20. 
Stock Options.    Stock options are awarded to many levels of management, including executive officers, to align the long-term interests of AutoZone's management and our stockholders. During the 2018 fiscal year, 781 AutoZone employees received stock options. The stock options shown in the table were granted pursuant to the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. 
Both incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options, or a combination of both, can be granted under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. Incentive stock options have a maximum term of ten years, and non-qualified stock options have a maximum term of ten years and one day. The stock options subject to Mr. Rhodes' one-time grant in 2015 vest in equal increments on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. All options granted during the 2018 fiscal year vest in one-fourth increments over a four-year period. All options granted under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of AutoZone common stock on the date of grant, which is defined as the closing price on the grant date. Option repricing is expressly prohibited by the terms of the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. 
Each grant of stock options is governed by the terms of a Stock Option Agreement entered into between the Company and the executive officer at the time of the grant. The Stock Option Agreements provide vesting schedules and other terms of the grants in accordance with the Amended 2011 Equity Plan.  Under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan, participants may receive equity-based compensation in the form of stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, dividend equivalents, deferred stock, stock payments, performance share awards and other incentive awards structured by the Compensation Committee and the Board within parameters set forth in the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. 
The aggregate number of shares of AutoZone common stock available for equity grants pursuant to the Amended 2011 Equity Plan will be reduced by two shares for every share delivered in settlement of an award other than (i) a stock option, (ii) a stock appreciation right or (iii) any other award for which the holder pays the intrinsic value existing as of the date of grant (such awards, "Full Value Awards"). To the extent that any award other than a Full Value Award is forfeited, expires or is settled in cash without the delivery of shares to the holder, then any shares subject to the award will again be available for the grant of an award pursuant to the Amended 2011 Equity Plan; if such forfeited, expired or cash-settled award is a Full Value Award, then the number of shares available under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan will be increased by two shares for each share subject to the award that is forfeited, expired or cash-settled. However, shares tendered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an option or in satisfaction of any tax withholding obligations with respect to an award, shares subject to a stock appreciation right that are not issued in connection with the stock settlement of the stock appreciation right on exercise thereof, and shares purchased on the open market with the cash proceeds from the exercise of options, will not again be available for the grant of an award pursuant to the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. Any shares of restricted stock repurchased by AutoZone at the same price paid by the participant, so that such shares are returned to AutoZone, will again be available for awards granted pursuant to the Amended 2011 Equity Plan. The payment of dividend equivalents in cash in conjunction with any outstanding awards will not be counted against the shares available for issuance under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan.  OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS AT FISCAL YEAR-END 
The following table sets forth information regarding outstanding stock option awards under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan, the 2011 Equity Plan, the AutoZone, Inc. 2006 Stock Option Plan the ("2006 Stock Option Plan"), other outstanding equity awards under the Amended 2011 Equity Plan and the 2011 Equity Plan, and unvested shares under the Executive Stock Purchase Plan for the Company's Named Executive Officers as of August 25, 2018:

(2)  The values in this column represent the lump sum payments made to the listed executives during fiscal 2018 in  connection with the termination of the AutoZone, Inc. Associates Pension Plan and the defined benefit portion of the AutoZone, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Prior to January 1, 2003, substantially all full-time AutoZone employees were covered by a defined benefit pension plan, the AutoZone, Inc. Associates Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"). The Pension Plan was a traditional defined benefit pension plan which covered full-time AutoZone employees who were at least 21 years old and had completed one year of service with the Company. The benefits under the Pension Plan were based on years of service and the employee's highest consecutive five-year average compensation. 
AutoZone also maintained a supplemental defined benefit pension plan for certain highly compensated employees to supplement the benefits under the Pension Plan as part of our Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the "Supplemental Pension Plan"). The purpose of the Supplemental Pension Plan was to provide any benefit that could not be provided under the qualified plan due to IRS limitations on the amount of salary that could be recognized in the qualified plan. The benefit under the Supplemental Pension Plan was (a) the amount of benefit determined under the Pension Plan formula but using the participant's total compensation without regard to any IRS limitations on salary that can be recognized under the qualified plan, less (b) the amount of benefit determined under the Pension Plan formula reflecting the IRS limitations on compensation that can be reflected under a qualified plan. 
In December 2002, both the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan were frozen. Accordingly, all benefits to all participants in the Pension Plan were fixed and could not increase, and no new participants could join the plans. 
During fiscal 2018, the Company terminated both the AutoZone, Inc. Associates Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan. Messrs. Rhodes, Graves and Newbern were participants in the Pension Plan and the Supplemental Pension Plan, and each received lump sum payments equal to the present value of their frozen benefits calculated by our independent actuaries.

None of the earnings in this column were included in the Summary Compensation Table  because they were not preferential or above market.  
[END TABLE]
Officers of the Company with the title of vice president or higher based in the United States are eligible to participate in the EDCP after their first year of employment with the Company. As of August 25, 2018, there were 49 such officers of the Company. The EDCP is a nonqualified plan that allows officers to make a pretax deferral of base salary and bonus compensation. Officers may defer up to 25% of base salary and up to 75% of bonus compensation. The Company match is calculated based on 100% of the first 3% of deferred compensation and 50% of the next 2% deferred, less the maximum value of the Company match available generally to participants in AutoZone's 401(k) Plan. Participants may select among various mutual funds in which to invest their deferral accounts. Participants may elect to receive distribution of their deferral accounts at retirement or starting in a specific future year of choice before or after anticipated retirement (but not later than the year in which the participant reaches age 75). If a participant's employment with AutoZone terminates other than by retirement or death, the account balance will be paid in a lump sum payment six months after termination of employment. There are provisions in the EDCP for withdrawal of all or part of the deferral account balance in the event of an extreme and unforeseen financial hardship.  POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL 
Our Named Executive Officers may receive certain benefits if their employment terminates under specified circumstances. These benefits derive from Company policies, plans, agreements and arrangements described below. 
Agreement with Mr. Rhodes 
In 2008, Mr. Rhodes and AutoZone entered into an agreement (the "Agreement") providing that if Mr. Rhodes' employment is terminated by the Company without cause, he will receive severance benefits consisting of an amount equal to 2.99 times his then-current base salary, a lump sum prorated share of any unpaid annual bonus incentive for periods during which he was employed, and AutoZone will pay the cost of COBRA premiums to continue his medical, dental and vision insurance benefits for up to 18 months to the extent such premiums exceed the amount Mr. Rhodes had been paying for such coverage during his employment. The Agreement further provides that Mr. Rhodes will not compete with AutoZone or solicit its employees for a three-year period after his employment with AutoZone terminates. 
Executive Officer Agreements (Messrs. Giles, Graves, Finestone and Newbern) 
AutoZone's executive officers who do not have written employment agreements, including Messrs. Giles, Finestone, Graves and Newbern, have entered into agreements ("Severance and Non-Compete Agreements") with the Company providing that if their employment is involuntarily terminated without cause, and if they sign an agreement waiving certain legal rights, they will receive severance benefits in the form of salary continuation for a period of time ranging from 12 months to 24 months, depending on their length of service at the time of termination. Mr. Giles presently has 12 years of service, Mr. Graves has 25 years of service, Mr. Finestone has 16 years of service and Mr. Newbern has 33 years of service. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Years of Service    Severance Period   
 Less than 2      12 months   
 2 – less than 5      18 months   
 5 or more      24 months   
[END TABLE]
The executives will also receive a lump sum prorated share of their annual bonus incentive when such incentives are paid to similarly-situated executives. Medical, dental and vision insurance benefits generally continue through the severance period up to a maximum of 18 months, with the Company paying the cost of COBRA premiums to the extent such premiums exceed the amount the executive had been paying for such coverage. An appropriate level of outplacement services may be provided based on individual circumstances. 
The Severance and Non-Compete Agreement further provides that the executive will not compete with AutoZone or solicit its employees for a two-year period after his or her employment with AutoZone terminates. 
Equity Plans 
All outstanding, unvested stock options, including those held by the Named Executive Officers, will vest immediately upon the option holder's death pursuant to the terms of the stock option agreements. 
Unvested shares under our Executive Stock Purchase Plan, which normally are subject to forfeiture if a participant's employment terminates prior to the first anniversary of their acquisition, will vest immediately if the termination is by reason of the participant's death, disability, termination by the Company without cause, or retirement on or after the participant's normal retirement date. The plan defines "disability," "cause," and "normal retirement date." 
Life Insurance 
AutoZone provides all salaried employees in active full-time employment in the United States a company-paid life insurance benefit in the amount of two times annual earnings. "Annual earnings" exclude stock   compensation and gains realized from stock option exercises, but include salary and incentive compensation received. Additionally, salaried employees are eligible to purchase additional life insurance subject to insurability above certain amounts. The maximum benefit of the company-paid and the additional coverage combined is $5,000,000. All of the Named Executive Officers are eligible for this benefit. 
Disability Insurance 
All full-time officers at the level of vice president and above are eligible to participate in two executive long-term disability plans. Accordingly, AutoZone purchases individual disability policies for its executive officers that pay 70% of the first $7,143 of insurable monthly earnings in the event of disability. Additionally, the executive officers are eligible to receive an executive long-term disability plan benefit in the amount of 70% of the next $35,714 of insurable monthly earnings to a maximum benefit of $25,000 per month. AutoZone purchases insurance to cover this plan benefit. These two benefits combined provide a maximum benefit of $30,000 per month. The benefit payment for these plans may be reduced by deductible sources of income and disability earnings.  The following table shows the amounts that the Named Executive Officers would have received if their employment had been terminated under specified circumstances on August 25, 2018. This table does not include amounts related to the Named Executive Officers' vested benefits under our deferred compensation and pension plans or pursuant to stock option awards, all of which are described in the tables above.

(2)  Severance Pay, Annual Incentive and Benefits Continuation amounts shown under the "Involuntary Termination  Not for Cause" column reflect payments to Mr. Giles, Mr. Graves, Mr. Finestone and Mr. Newbern under the Severance and Non-Compete Agreements described above. Annual Incentive is shown  at actual annual incentive amount for the 2018 fiscal year; it would be prorated if the triggering event occurred other than on the last day of the fiscal year. Benefits Continuation refers to medical, dental and vision benefits. Unvested stock  options are those outstanding, unvested stock options which will vest immediately upon the option holder's death. Unvested stock awards are share options under the Executive Stock Purchase Plan, which vest upon involuntary termination not for  cause, disability, or death. Disability Benefits are benefits under Company-paid individual long-term disability insurance policy. Life Insurance Benefits are benefits under a Company-paid life insurance policy.

Ratio of the Annual Total Compensation of the Median-Paid Employee to the CEO 
Pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we have conducted an analysis of our global employee population in order to estimate and disclose the total compensation paid to our median paid employee, not including our CEO, as well as the ratio of the total compensation paid to said median employee as compared to the total compensation paid to our CEO. The analysis, which is briefly described below, yielded the following results: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Total compensation for the median employee for fiscal 2018 (not including the CEO):      $ 23,546  
 Total compensation for the CEO (see page 32):      $ 4,220,619  
 Resulting  CEO-to-median employee pay ratio:        179:1  
[END TABLE]
Measurement date.    We identified the median employee from our population as of June 30, 2018. 
Compensation measure.    The regulations require us to use a "consistently applied compensation measure", or CACM, to identify the median employee. Based on an analysis of the AutoZone workforce, we determined that fixed or guaranteed compensation, including overtime and earnings for paid time off, plus variable compensation (e.g., bonus or commission pay) closely approximate the annual total direct compensation of our employees. We converted the earnings paid in local (non-U.S.) currency to U.S. dollars using published exchange rates as of June 30, 2018. We did not apply pay adjustments allowed by the rules in order to ensure a conservative estimate (i.e., it is unlikely that the estimate could have been higher than that calculated). 
Excluded population.    We excluded from the analysis AutoZone employees in Brazil, Canada, China, Germany and the United Kingdom, pursuant to the de minimus exemption under the rules. The 370 employees in these locations represent less than 5% of the total employee population of 87,600 as of June 30, 2018. 
Related Party Transactions 
Our Board has adopted a Related Person Transaction Policy (the "Policy") which requires the Audit Committee of the Board to review and approve or ratify all Related Person Transactions. The Audit Committee is to consider all of the available relevant facts and circumstances of each transaction, including but not limited to the benefits to the Company; the impact on a director's independence in the event the Related Person is a director, an immediate family member of a director or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder or executive officer; the availability of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the transaction; and the terms available to unrelated third parties generally. Related Person Transactions must also comply with the policies and procedures specified in our Code of Conduct and Corporate Governance Principles, as described below.  The Policy also requires disclosure of all Related Person Transactions that are required to be disclosed in AutoZone's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in accordance with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. 
A "Related Person Transaction" is defined in the Policy as a transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships) that occurred since the beginning of the Company's most recent fiscal year in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any Related Person had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. "Related Persons" include a director or executive officer of the Company, a nominee to become a director of the Company, any person known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities, any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons, and any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest. 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct (the "Code of Conduct") that applies to the Company's directors, officers and employees. The Code of Conduct prohibits directors and executive officers from engaging in activities that create conflicts of interest, taking corporate opportunities for personal use or competing with the Company, among other things. Our Board has also adopted a Code of Ethical Conduct for Financial Executives (the "Financial Code of Conduct") that applies to the Company's officers and employees who hold the position of principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller as well as to the Company's officers and employees who perform similar functions ("Financial Executives"). The Financial Code of Conduct requires the Financial Executives to, among other things, report any actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal or professional relationships involving the Company's management or any other Company employee with a role in financial reporting disclosures or internal controls. Additionally, our Corporate Governance Principles require each director who is faced with an issue that presents, or may give the appearance of presenting, a conflict of interest to disclose that fact to the Chairman of the Board and the Secretary, and to refrain from participating in discussions or votes on such issue unless a majority of the Board determines, after consultation with counsel, that no conflict of interest exists as to such matter. 
We have concluded there are no material Related Party Transactions or agreements that were entered into during the fiscal year ended August 25, 2018, and through the date of this proxy statement requiring disclosure under these policies.
