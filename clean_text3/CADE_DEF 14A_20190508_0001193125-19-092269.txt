PROXY STATEMENT 
FOR THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD WEDNESDAY, MAY 8, 2019 
These proxy materials are furnished in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors (the "Board") of Cadence Bancorporation ("Cadence" or the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, of proxies to be voted at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company and at any adjournment of such meeting (the "Annual Meeting"). 
The Company has mailed or e-mailed to its stockholders a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials with instructions on how to access our proxy materials over the Internet and how to vote. If you are a registered stockholder and would like to change the method of delivery of your proxy materials, please contact our transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, 1 State Street 30th Floor, New York, NY 10004-1561, toll-free at (888) 266-6791, or via proxy@continentalstock.com. You may do the same as a beneficial stockholder by calling the broker or nominee where your shares are held. 
The Company completed the initial public offering of shares of its common stock (the "IPO") in April 2017 and is a publicly traded financial holding company with its shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class A Common Stock") listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the ticker symbol "CADE." Since the IPO, Cadence Bancorp LLC, its then controlling stockholder (the "LLC") completed a series of registered secondary offerings of shares of Class A common stock of the Company held by the LLC, gradually reducing its ownership interest in the Company. On September 10, 2018, the LLC completed an in-kind distribution (the "Distribution") of substantially all of the shares of Class A Common Stock held by the LLC to its unitholders (other than a de minimis amount of Class A Common Stock representing the aggregate fractional shares in lieu of which unitholders received cash). The LLC was subsequently dissolved. 
When used in this Proxy Statement, the terms "Cadence," "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to Cadence Bancorporation, a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries, including Cadence Bank, National Association. All references in this Proxy Statement to "Cadence Bank" or "the Bank" refer to Cadence Bank, National Association, our wholly owned bank subsidiary, and all references to the "LLC" refer to Cadence Bancorp LLC, our former controlling stockholder. The term "fiscal year" refers to our fiscal year, which is based on a 12-month period ending December 31 of each year (e.g., fiscal year 2018 refers to the 12-month period ended December 31, 2018). 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE MEETING 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
We are providing these proxy materials to you in connection with the solicitation, by the Board of Directors of Cadence Bancorporation, of proxies to be voted at the Company's Annual Meeting. You are receiving this Proxy Statement because you were a Cadence Bancorporation stockholder as of the close of business on March 19, 2019, the record date for the Annual Meeting. This Proxy Statement provides notice of the Annual Meeting, describes the proposals presented for stockholder action and includes information required to be disclosed to stockholders. 
When and where is the Annual Meeting? 
The Annual Meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2019 at The Westin Galleria, 5060 West Alabama Street, Houston, Texas 77056 at 10:00 a.m., local time. 
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting? 
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will act upon the matters described in the Notice of Annual Meeting that accompanies this Proxy Statement, including (1) the election of J. Richard Fredericks, Virginia A. Hepner and Kathy Waller as Class II directors, each to serve for a three-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, (2) an advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, (3) an advisory vote on the frequency of future votes on the compensation of our named executive officers, and (4) the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. 
Who may vote at the Annual Meeting? 
Only record holders of our Class A common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2019 (the "Record Date"), will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, the Company had outstanding 128,733,745 shares of Class A common stock. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to one vote. 
What constitutes a quorum? 
The Annual Meeting will be held only if a quorum is present. A quorum will be present if the holders of a majority of the shares of Class A common stock outstanding on the Record Date and entitled to vote on a matter at the Annual Meeting are represented, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting. Shares represented by properly completed proxy cards either marked "abstain" or "withhold," or returned without voting instructions are counted as present and entitled to vote for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. If shares are held by brokers who are prohibited from exercising discretionary authority for beneficial owners who have not given voting instructions ("broker non-votes"), those shares will be counted as represented at the Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting. 
How are votes counted? 
Stockholder Voting Generally 
Each stockholder entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by such stockholder as of the Record Date, which has voting power upon the matter in question. 
-2- 
Proposal 1: Elections of J. Richard Fredericks, Virginia A. Hepner and Kathy Waller as Class II Directors 
A plurality of the votes cast are required for the election of J. Richard Fredericks, Virginia A. Hepner and Kathy Waller as a Class II director. This means that the nominees with the highest number of votes will be elected regardless of whether the number of votes received by any such nominee constitutes a majority of the number of votes cast. Abstentions, votes to withhold and broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of this proposal and will not affect the result of the vote. 
Proposal 2: Advisory vote on executive compensation of our named executive officers 
Approval of this proposal requires the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this matter at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted toward a quorum for this proposal, and votes to withhold will have the same effect as "Against" vote. 
Proposal 3: Advisory vote on frequency of future votes on the compensation of our named executive officers 
The frequency (i.e., Every Year, Every Two Years or Every Three Years) that receives the highest number of votes cast by stockholders will be considered by us as the stockholders' recommendation as to the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Abstentions, votes to withhold and broker non-votes will not be counted for purposes of this proposal and will not affect the result of the vote. 
Proposal 4: Ratification of the Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on Proposal 4 is required for the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will have the effect of voting against this proposal. No broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with this proposal.

If you are a stockholder of record, you can vote by:

What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy or voting instruction card? 
It means your shares are registered differently or are in more than one account. Please provide voting instructions for all proxy and voting instruction cards you receive. 
What do I do if I hold my shares through a broker, bank or other nominee? 
If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee, that institution will instruct you as to how your shares may be voted by proxy, including whether telephone or Internet voting options are available.

No cameras or recording equipment will be permitted in the Annual Meeting, and all cell phones must be turned off. If you hold your shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and would like to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you will need to ask the holder for a legal proxy. You will need to bring the legal proxy with you to the Annual Meeting and turn it in with a signed ballot that will be provided to you at the Annual Meeting.

The Company pays all of the costs of preparing, mailing, delivering electronically and soliciting proxies in connection with this Proxy Statement. In addition to soliciting proxies through the mail or electronic delivery by means of this Proxy Statement, we may solicit proxies through our directors, officers and employees in person and by telephone, facsimile, mail or email. The Company asks brokers, banks, voting trustees and other nominees and fiduciaries to forward proxy materials to the beneficial owners and to obtain authority to execute proxies. The Company will reimburse the brokers, banks, voting trustees and other nominees and fiduciaries upon request. 
What are the Board's recommendations as to how I should vote on each proposal?

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent  registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to any other business that may properly come before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment of the Annual Meeting, that is submitted to a vote of the stockholders, including whether or not to adjourn the Annual Meeting, your shares will be voted in accordance with the best judgment of the persons voting the proxies. 
How will broker non-votes be treated? 
A broker non-vote occurs when a broker who holds its customer's shares in street name submits proxies for such shares, but indicates that it does not have authority to vote on a particular matter. Generally, this occurs when brokers have not received any instructions from their customers. In these cases, the brokers, as the holders of record, are permitted to vote on "routine" matters only, but not on other matters. Shares for which brokers have not received instructions from their customers will only be permitted to vote on the following proposal: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered  public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Shares for which brokers have not received instructions from their customers will not be permitted to vote on the following proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To elect J. Richard Fredericks, Virginia A. Hepner and Kathy Waller as Class II directors, each to serve for  a three-year term expiring at the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To approve of the advisory resolution to approve executive compensation; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers.   
[END TABLE]
What if other matters come up during the Annual Meeting? 
If any matters other than those referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting properly come before the Annual Meeting, the individuals named in the accompanying proxy card will vote the proxies held by them in accordance with their best judgment. The Company is not aware of any business other than the items referred to in the Notice of Annual Meeting that will be considered at the Annual Meeting. 
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
Cadence Bancorporation will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish preliminary results, or final results if available, in a Current Report on Form 8-K within four business days of the Annual Meeting.

Your vote is important. 
Because many stockholders cannot personally attend the Annual Meeting, it is necessary that a large number be represented by proxy in order to satisfy that a quorum be present to conduct business at the Annual Meeting. Whether or not you plan to attend the meeting in person, prompt voting will be appreciated. Stockholders of record can also vote their shares via the Internet. Instructions for using these convenient services are provided on the proxy card. Of course, you may still vote your shares on the proxy card. To do so, we ask that you complete, sign, date and return the enclosed proxy card promptly in the postage-paid envelope.

PROPOSAL NO. 1—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Board of Directors 
Our Board currently has ten members, consisting of our Chief Executive Officer and nine other directors who are "independent" under the listing standards of the NYSE. 
In connection with our acquisition of State Bank Financial Corporation ("State Bank"), on January 1, 2019, we increased the size of the Board from six members to nine members and appointed three former State Bank directors to the Board. Upon the recommendation of State Bank, and after reviewing their relevant experiences and background and discussing the same, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board nominated, and the Board, after its own review and discussion, approved the appointment of Virginia A. Hepner, Joseph W. Evans, and J. Thomas Wiley, Jr. to serve on the Board. Ms. Hepner, Mr. Evans and Mr. Wiley will serve, respectively, for terms expiring at the Company's 2019, 2020 and 2021 annual stockholder meetings, subject to prior death, resignation or removal from office as provided by law. 
In addition, on March 7, 2019, the Board appointed Precious Williams Owodunni to the Board. 
In accordance with the terms of our charter, our Board is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving a staggered three-year term, and is divided as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class I directors are Mr. Paul B. Murphy, Jr., Marc J. Shapiro, J. Thomas Wiley, Jr. and  Precious W. Owodunni and their terms expire in 2021;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class II directors are Mr. J. Richard Fredericks, Virginia A. Hepner and Robert K. Steel.  Mr. Steel is not standing for re-election at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Fredericks, Ms. Hepner and Ms. Waller have been nominated for election at the Annual Meeting for a three-year term  expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in 2022; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the Class III directors are Mr. William B. Harrison, Jr., Mr. Scott M. Stuart and Joseph  W. Evans and their terms expire at the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in 2020.  
[END TABLE]
At each annual meeting of stockholders, upon the expiration of the term of a class of directors, the successor to each such director in the class will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following his or her election and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified, in accordance with our charter. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. Advisory members of the Board are not elected by shareholders and do not vote on matters determined by vote by the Board. They are appointed and may be removed by the Board and serve indefinite terms. 
Nominees for Election as a Director at the 2019 Annual Meeting 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board seeks candidates for nomination to the Board who are qualified to be directors consistent with the Company's corporate governance guidelines, as described below under the section entitled "Board Committees—Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee." The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for reviewing the qualifications and independence of the members of the Board and its various committees on a periodic basis as well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment will include members' qualification as independent, as well as consideration of diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, cultural background, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. Accordingly, when evaluating candidates for nomination as directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider, and will ask any search firm that it engages to provide, women and minority candidates in the pool from which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects director candidates. Nominees for directorship will be recommended to the Board by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the policies and principles in its charter. 
-7- 
On the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board has determined that the size and classification of the Board is currently appropriate and has nominated Mr. Fredericks and Ms. Hepner for re-election as directors at the Annual Meeting, each to serve for a three-year term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in 2022, and Ms. Waller for election as a director at the Annual Meeting, to serve for a three-year term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders expected to be held in 2022. 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding Mr. Fredericks, Ms. Hepner and Ms. Waller, the Class II director nominees standing for election at the Annual Meeting.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS, COMMITTEES AND GOVERNANCE 
Overview 
Our Board provides oversight with respect to our overall performance, strategic direction and key corporate policies. It approves major initiatives, advises on key financial and business objectives, and monitors progress with respect to these matters. Members of the Board are kept informed of our business by various reports and documents provided to them on a regular basis, including operating and financial reports and audit reports provided at Board and committee meetings by our Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer and other officers. The Board has four standing committees, the principal responsibilities of which are described below under the section entitled "—Committees of Our Board of Directors." 
Meetings 
The Board held its first meeting on February 6, 2018. The Board met an aggregate of 9 times in 2018. Each member of the Board attended more than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and the committees on which he served. We strongly encourage, but do not require, the members of our Board to attend annual meetings of our stockholders. 
Director Independence 
Under the rules of the NYSE, independent directors must comprise a majority of our board of directors by the one-year anniversary of the time Cadence Bancorp LLC ceases to own a majority of our voting stock. The rules of the NYSE, as well as those of the SEC, impose several requirements with respect to the independence of our directors. Our board of directors has evaluated the independence of its members based upon the rules of the NYSE and the SEC. Applying these standards, our board of directors has determined that, with the exception of Mr. Murphy, each of our current directors is an independent director, as defined under the rules of the NYSE. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Murphy does not qualify as an independent director because he is an employee of Cadence Bancorporation and Cadence Bank. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions." 
Board Leadership Structure and Qualifications 
We believe that our Board should be comprised of qualified individuals and structured in a way that promotes accountability and ensures that interest of directors and management are aligned with stockholder interests. They should have broad experience at the policy-making level in business, government or banking. They should be committed to enhancing stockholder value and should have sufficient time to carry out their duties and to provide insight and practical wisdom based on experience. Their service on boards of other companies should be limited to a number that permits them, given their individual circumstances, to perform responsibly all director duties. Each director must represent the interests of all stockholders. 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board is responsible for reviewing the qualifications and independence of the members of the Board and its various committees on a periodic basis as well as the composition of the Board as a whole. This assessment will include members' qualification as independent, as well as consideration of diversity of race, ethnicity, gender, cultural background, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. Accordingly, when evaluating candidates for nomination as directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider, and will ask any search firm that it engages to provide, women and minority candidates in the pool from which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee selects director candidates. Nominees for Directorship will be recommended to the Board by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in accordance with the policies and principles in its charter. 
The corporate governance guidelines of our Board provide that when the position of Chairman of the Board is not held by an independent director, the independent directors can appoint an independent director to serve as 
-16- 
 Lead Director, who has various duties and responsibilities including (i) facilitating communication between the Chairman of the Board and the independent directors, (ii) convening and presiding over executive sessions of independent directors or over Board meetings if the Chairman is not present and (iii) serving as advisor on Board committees, among other duties and responsibilities. 
Currently, Paul B. Murphy, Jr. serves as our Chief Executive Officer and as the Chairman of our Board, Joseph W. Evans serves as Vice Chairman of our Board, and William B. Harrison, Jr. has been designated to serve as the Lead Director. 
Our Chief Executive Officer is generally in charge of our business affairs, subject to the overall direction and supervision of the Board and its committees, and is the only member of our management team that serves on the Board. Our Board believes that combining the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, having an independent Vice Chairman of the Board and appointing a Lead Director is the most effective board leadership structure for us and that it provides an effective balance of strong leadership and independent oversight. Having one individual serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman contributes to and enhances the Board's efficiency and effectiveness, as the Chief Executive Officer is generally in the best position to inform our independent directors about our operations, the competitive market and other challenges facing our business. Our Board believes that the Chief Executive Officer is in the best position to most effectively serve as the Chairman of the Board for many reasons as he is closest to many facets of our business, and has frequent contact with our customers, regulators and other stakeholders in our business. The Board believes that combining roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board also promotes timely communication between management and the Board on critical matters, including strategy, business results and risks because of Mr. Murphy's direct involvement in the strategic and day-to-day management of our business. 
Board Oversight of Risk Management 
Our Board believes that effective risk management and control processes are critical to our safety and soundness, our ability to predict and manage the challenges that we face and, ultimately, our long-term corporate success. Our Board, both directly and through its committees, is responsible for overseeing our risk management processes, with each of the committees of our Board assuming a different and important role in overseeing the management of the risks we face. 
The Risk Committee of our Board oversees our enterprise-wide risk management framework, which establishes our overall risk appetite and risk management strategy and enables our management to understand, manage and report on the risks we face. Our Risk Committee also reviews and oversees policies and practices established by management to identify, assess, measure and manage key risks we face, including the risk appetite metrics developed by management and approved by our Board. The Audit Committee of our Board is responsible for overseeing risks associated with financial matters (particularly financial reporting, accounting practices and policies, disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting), reviewing and discussing generally the identification, assessment, management and control of our risk exposures on an enterprise-wide basis and engaging as appropriate with our Risk Committee to assess our enterprise-wide risk framework. The Compensation Committee has primary responsibility for risks and exposures associated with our compensation policies, plans and practices regarding both executive compensation and the compensation structure generally. In particular, our Compensation Committee, in conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our management as appropriate, reviews our incentive compensation arrangements to ensure these programs are consistent with applicable laws and regulations, including safety and soundness requirements, and do not encourage imprudent or excessive risk-taking by our employees. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees risks associated with the independence of our Board and potential conflicts of interest. 
Our senior management is responsible for implementing and reporting to our Board regarding our risk management processes, including by assessing and managing the risks we face, including strategic, operational, 
-17- 
 regulatory, investment and execution risks, on a day-to-day basis. Our senior management is also responsible for creating and recommending to our Board for approval appropriate risk appetite metrics reflecting the aggregate levels and types of risk we are willing to accept in connection with the operation of our business and pursuit of our business objectives. 
The role of our Board in our risk oversight is consistent with our leadership structure, with our Chief Executive Officer and the other members of senior management having responsibility for assessing and managing our risk exposure, and our Board and its committees providing oversight in connection with those efforts. We believe this division of risk management responsibilities presents a consistent, systemic and effective approach for identifying, managing and mitigating risks throughout our operations. 
Board Committees 
Our board of directors has established standing committees in connection with the discharge of its responsibilities. These committees include the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Risk Committee. The responsibilities of these committees are described below. Our board of directors also may establish such other committees as it deems appropriate, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations and our corporate governance documents.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
Overview 
2018 was an exceptional year for Cadence Bancorporation and its wholly owned subsidiary, Cadence Bank. It marked our first full year as a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange. We reported record performance results and prepared for our significant merger with State Bank, which occurred on January 1, 2019. Our success in 2018 has been the culmination of a decade of teamwork across our organization, led by a senior leadership team committed to creating long-term value for our stockholders. 
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis reviews the objectives and elements of the Company's executive compensation program and discusses the 2018 compensation earned by our "named executive officers." It also explains the actions the Compensation Committee took based on the Company's unique circumstances as a newly publicly traded company and its ongoing commitment to ensure that our senior leadership team remains strong, stable, and focused on the aggressive growth and operational efficiency goals that will drive our future financial success. 
Our named executive officers with policy-making authority, along with their titles, as of December 31, 2018 are noted below:

Executive Summary 
2018 Compensation Decisions 
In December of 2017, the Company engaged an independent compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer, to advise the Compensation Committee to help ensure that the Company was providing competitive compensation packages for executives. At that time, the analysis revealed, and, the Compensation Committee determined, that while the overall structure of our executive compensation program, which includes stockholder-friendly compensation governance practices and policies, was designed to be competitive with our peers, base compensation for the named executive officers was below the 25th percentile of its peer group. As a result, in February 2018, the Committee approved increases in executive base compensation to levels that were generally in line with the 25th percentile of its peer group and agreed to provide short-term incentives opportunities based on attainment of aggressive goals to provide a level of compensation closer to peer group medians. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to monitor the rate at which the Company was growing and performing relative to its peers. By November of 2018, and after another compensation review by Pearl Meyer, it was determined that the Company's performance exceeded its peer medians while at the same time growing at a higher rate than its peers. Additionally, the Company was in the process of acquiring State Bank. To this end, with support from Pearl Meyer, a new peer group was developed, which placed the Company near the median of the peer group's asset size (including the impact of the State Bank acquisition). Base compensation levels of the Company executives remained well below the peer group's levels, and, including expected short-term cash incentives, the Chief Executive Officer was below peer median total cash compensation for 2018. 
One-Time Cash Awards: Right-Sizing Pay for Performance 
Against this backdrop, the Compensation Committee approved one-time cash awards under the Cadence Bancorporation Executive Bonus Plan ("Bonus Plan") for 2018. The purpose of these one-time awards was to

 help correct the legacy below market-level compensation structure and recognize the significant achievements of the current senior leadership team over that time:

2018 Business Performance Highlights 
Our financial results in 2018 reflect record net income, strong growth in loans and core deposits, and effective expense management. 
Strong Earnings Growth 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Net income for 2018 totaled $166.3 million, a $63.9 million, or 62.4%, increase compared to  $102.4 million for 2017.

Compensation Design and Governance Practices 
The Compensation Committee has formulated our executive compensation program to align with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Below we summarize certain practices we have implemented to drive performance and those we have not implemented because we do not believe they would serve our stockholders' long-term interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We  Do 
[END TABLE]
-26- 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 What We Don't  Do 
[END TABLE]
Our Approach to Executive Compensation 
As of January 1, 2019, the Company no longer qualified as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As a result, in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are required to provide stockholders with the opportunity to approve, in a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (commonly known as "say-on-pay" votes). 
The Compensation Committee believes that compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal 2018 met the objectives of our program, which were to foster long-term business success using a pay-for-performance philosophy intended to encourage performance and growth, to attract and retain experienced executives in a competitive environment and to align our named executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders. 
Although the shareholder vote on executive compensation is advisory, we will take the results of the "say-on-pay" vote into consideration and will continue to engage our stockholders to understand their perspectives on our executive compensation policies and practices, corporate governance practices, and other matters of stockholder interest. 
What Guides Our Program 
Philosophy and Objectives of Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee has established the following compensation philosophy and seeks to make decisions consistent with the following objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• encourage achievement of our long-range objectives by relating compensation to achievement of internal strategic  objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• establish compensation policies, benefit programs, and guidelines that will attract and retain qualified  executives through a level of compensation that is competitive within the banking industry;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• promote a direct relationship between compensation and our performance and to build long-term value for  stockholders by facilitating executive officer stock ownership through restricted stock and other equity-based incentive awards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• plan for, justify, and control total compensation costs.  
[END TABLE]
Elements of Compensation 
Our executive compensation program is designed to support the alignment of pay with performance and encourage the creation of long-term stockholder value with appropriate risk management. Accordingly, our program includes a balance of fixed and performance-based pay, cash and equity compensation, absolute and relative performance goals, and short- and long-term incentive compensation. The primary components of our

 2018 named executive officer compensation, as well as the key features of each component, are included in the table below:

Compensation Mix 
Our executive compensation structure is heavily weighted toward variable pay based on performance and equity grants that also include performance elements. The following chart reflects the breakout of the two major components of compensation for our executive officers.

Process for Determining Executive Officer Compensation 
Role of the Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering our executive compensation program in a manner consistent with our compensation philosophy. Details of the Compensation Committee's authority and responsibilities are specified in its charter, which may be accessed at our website, www.cadencebancorporation.com, by clicking "Investor Relations," followed by "Governance" and then "Board Committees." 
Under the Compensation Committee's charter, it has authority to review and approve the total compensation, including salary, bonus incentive, benefits, and other compensation, of the Chief Executive Officer and all other executive officers of the Company. 
The Compensation Committee conducts an annual evaluation of the Chief Executive Officer's performance and determines his compensation in executive sessions without the Chief Executive Officer present. Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of our other named executive officers and presents his conclusions and recommendations to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee retains absolute discretion as to whether it approves the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer or makes adjustments, as it deems appropriate. 
Role of Management 
Our Chief Executive Officer and other members of executive management and the Compensation Committee work together to establish, review, and evaluate performance goals for our performance-based incentive plans. While these executives provide input into our strategic goals for future performance periods, the Compensation Committee carefully reviews recommended goals before giving its final approval, and it evaluates and determines whether such performance goals have been achieved. We believe this process ensures that goals will be appropriately balanced between short- and long-term incentives and will be motivating and challenging but also attainable. 
Role of Our Compensation Consultants 
The Compensation Committee has the authority under its charter to appoint, select, obtain advice from, retain, terminate, and approve the fees and other retention terms of advisors (including compensation consultants). For 2018, the committee continued its engagement of Pearl Meyer as its independent compensation consultant. In this role, Pearl Meyer provided the Compensation Committee with market data, analysis, and advice regarding the compensation of our independent directors, named executive officers, and our other executive officers, which was used by the Compensation Committee in making the majority of its compensation-related decisions in 2018. Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee and does not provide any additional services to management. The Compensation Committee has conducted an independence assessment of Pearl Meyer in accordance with SEC rules. 
Role of Peer Market Data 
The Compensation Committee considers several factors when determining executive compensation, including peer market data. Pearl Meyer provided the committee with data on market compensation levels for similarly-sized banks based on a peer group and survey data. The peer group included the following 19 companies which are comparable to us in terms of asset size and business model. Cadence's assets were aligned with the median of the peer group. 
-29- 
While the Compensation Committee referenced the market data when evaluating compensation, it is not the only element considered. The Compensation Committee also considers performance for the executives and respective lines of business. 
Our 2018 Executive Compensation Program In Detail 
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee intends for the base salary of our named executive officers to provide a base level of pay for the services they provide that is competitive with comparable financial institutions. 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews each executive officer's base salary and can increase his or her salary based on performance and in compliance with regulatory standards. The Compensation Committee receives market comparison from its compensation consultant. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee established the base salaries of each of the named executive officers for 2018 as shown in the table below. These increases were approved by the Compensation Committee to better align compensation with the 25th percentile of the market: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    2017 Base Salary ($)      2018 Base Salary ($)      Percent Change from 2017 Base Salary

[END TABLE]
Annual Cash Incentive Payments (the "Bonus Plan") 
Annual cash incentive compensation is an integral component of our total compensation program that links executive decision-making and performance with our annual strategic objectives. We use this component to focus management on our most important near-term priorities—financial, operating, compliance, and safety and soundness—that support our overall strategy and build stockholder value. The Bonus Plan is intended to provide an incentive for superior work and to motivate eligible executives of the Company toward even greater achievement and business results, to tie their goals and interests to those of ours and our stockholders, and to enable us to attract and retain highly qualified executives. 
The Compensation Committee (with input from our Chief Executive Officer or his designees) establishes threshold, goal, and above goal performance levels and weights for each selected performance objective under the Bonus Plan. The weight, stated as a percentage, indicates the maximum percentage of the total potential threshold, goal, or above goal incentive payment that can be earned for achieving each performance objective at the set threshold, goal, and above goal performance levels. Threshold represents the minimum level of performance at which, if achieved, a payment is earned on each performance objective. If performance is below the threshold level for any particular performance objective, no payment will be earned; however, payment will be earned for other performance objectives that are achieved at least at a threshold level of performance. Above goal represents the maximum level of performance at which, if achieved, a payment is earned on each performance objective. If performance exceeds the above goal level for any performance objective, no further incentive above the above goal incentive for such performance objective is earned. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Performance    Goal Attainment     Payout Factor

 Goal      100%      100%  
 Above Goal      120%      150%  
[END TABLE]
-30- 
Under the Bonus Plan, the amount of each named executive officer's potential incentive payment that can be earned at the threshold, goal, and above goal levels is determined as a percentage of the named executive officer's base salary. For 2018, each named executive officer's potential incentive payment at the threshold, goal, and above goal levels, expressed as a percentage of their base salary and as a dollar amount, were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name   Target as a% of Base     Threshold (%)     Threshold Incentive Payment ($)     Goal (%)     Goal Incentive Payment ($)      Above Goal (%)     Above Goal Incentive Payment ($)

[END TABLE]
Actual performance between threshold, goal, and above goal performance levels is interpolated to determine the amount of payment based on relative achievement of the performance objectives. 
Under the Bonus Plan, as soon as practicable at the beginning of each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer or his designees, selects key measurable performance objectives, which will be used to determine the actual incentive cash payment to be awarded to our executive officers upon the achievement of the selected performance objectives to include corporate net income (as described below) and other individual goals. Individual goals included individual performance measures relating to transparency in board reporting, overall organizational leadership, maintaining satisfactory relationships with regulators, and overall goals within their direct reporting units. Additionally, Mr. Holmes and Mr. Powell have goals pertaining specifically to their lines of business. Weighting for each executive for the various performance objectives follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Corporate Net Income     Individual Objectives     Line of Business Revenue, Growth     Line of Business Efficiency   
 Paul B. Murphy, Jr.      75%      25%            
 Valerie C. Toalson      75%      25%

 Jerry W. Powell      50%      20%           30%  
[END TABLE]
-31- 
Accordingly, in determining the actual incentive compensation earned by our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee approved awards based on an interpolation between the total potential threshold incentive and the total potential goal incentive. The corporate adjusted net income attainment was 111.6% of the goal. The corporate goal for the adjusted net income was $157.09 million and company performance was $175.26 million, which is 111.6% of target. Messrs. Murphy, Tortorici, and Holmes and Ms. Toalson attained 100% of the target for individual objectives. Mr. Holmes attained 112.6% of goal in relation to his Line of Business objectives, which pertain primarily to revenue and growth factors. Mr. Powell was awarded 90.5% of goal for his Line of Business efficiency objective. The Compensation Committee also adjusted his individual goal attainment to 178% of goal related to successful execution of the merger and secondary offerings. The percentage awarded to each named executive officer for each goal and our named executive officers' annual incentive payments earned for 2018 are noted in the tables below, along with the percentage of the total target incentive each named executive officer achieved.

[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee will, on an annual basis, continue to review its annual cash incentive plans and award measurement methods and update the Bonus Plan as warranted to maintain the effectiveness of the plan as a key performance-based component of our overall executive compensation program. The Compensation Committee expects that the selected objectives, performance measures, and thresholds will continue to evolve based on our strategic objectives, market conditions, new regulations, and the regulatory review process. 
Long-Term Incentive Program 
Our compensation philosophy strongly embraces the concept that management works in the best interests of stockholders when management also has an ownership stake in the Company. We have used the equity grant alternatives under our Amended and Restated Cadence Bancorporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which we refer to as the "2015 Omnibus Plan," to support this philosophy. 
In general, we have implemented equity-based incentives to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• encourage management to continue in the long-term service of the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• give management a more direct interest in the future success of the operations of the Company;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract outstanding individuals for leadership positions; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• retain and motivate those individuals by providing awards for superior performance, increase in responsibilities,  or expansion of roles.  
[END TABLE]
2018 Equity Grants 
In 2018, our named executive officers received restricted stock grants that vest over a three-year period. One-half of the grant will vest ratably over the three years if the executive is employed on the anniversary date of the grant each year. The other half will vest at the end of three years depending on performance against specific objectives ("performance shares"). The performance shares may vest within a range of 0% to 200% of the number of target shares depending upon performance results. 
-32- 
Two objectives were set for the performance factors in the 2018 grant: (i) Cumulative Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and (ii) Return on Average Tangible Common Equity ("ROATCE"). EPS measures the portion of the Company's profit allocated to each outstanding share of common stock. Cumulative EPS will be determined by adding the Company's reported EPS for each year, 2018 through 2020. ROATCE measures net income available to common stockholders as a percentage of average total common equity reduced by intangible assets. ROATCE relative performance will be measured over the entire performance period as compared to the compensation peer group established at the beginning of the performance period. The performance factors and vesting targets are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Cumulative EPS      $5.62        $6.24        $6.86   
 ROATCE       Peer group 25th percentile           Peer group 50th percentile           Peer group 100th percentile     
 Award Value as% of Target Shares      25%        100%        200%   
[END TABLE]
Vesting of Previous Awards 
During 2018, a long-term incentive grant awarded in 2015 vested. One half of the award was equity based and tied to the value of Phantom A Units at vesting. The value of a Phantom A Unit at vesting was $1,691.62. The other half of the grant was tied to a performance factor. This factor was contingent upon attainment of a cumulative three-year adjusted GAAP pre-tax, pre-loan provision income goal of $430 million, with an actual attainment of $444.03 million or 108.15% of goal. Based on performance, the named executive officers received the following payments: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

Other Programs, Policies, and Guidelines 
Retirement Plans 
Cadence Bank 401(k) Plan 
Our named executive officers are each eligible to participate in our 401(k) plan, which is designed to provide retirement benefits to all eligible full-time and part-time employees. Our 401(k) plan provides employees with the opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-deferred basis, and permits employees to defer between 1% and 50% of eligible compensation, subject to statutory limits. Participants who are at least 50 years old are also entitled to make "catch-up" contributions, subject to certain limitations. Under the 401(k) plan, we are permitted to make both discretionary matching contributions and discretionary profit-sharing contributions. Any discretionary matching contributions vest immediately, while any discretionary profit-sharing contributions vest in equal installments over five years, subject to continued employment. Employees are fully vested in any 
-33- 
 contributions they make immediately. During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we made matching contributions to all participants equal to the participant's elective deferrals of up to 100% of the first 3% of their eligible earnings and 50% of the next 2% of their eligible earnings. We also made a one-time discretionary match of 0.05% on 6% of the eligible earnings during 2018 for all employees. 
Cadence Bancorporation Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Cadence Bancorporation Deferred Compensation Plan, which we refer to as our "Deferred Compensation Plan," is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that permits key management officers and employees of the Company and its affiliates to defer income beyond the amounts permitted under the Company's 401(k) plan. Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, a participant may elect to defer an amount not to exceed 25% of his or her basic compensation (i.e., base salary and any commissions) and up to 100% of his or her bonus, subject to certain limitations, until a fixed future date or his or her retirement. In our sole discretion, we may make additional contributions to participants' accounts, which need not be uniform among participants. Any such contributions we make may be subject to vesting and forfeiture. No executives participated in the Deferred Compensation Plan nor did we make any discretionary contributions during fiscal 2018 under the Deferred Compensation Plan. We have also established a rabbi trust with respect to our Deferred Compensation Plan to which we contribute participants' deferred amounts and any amounts contributed by us to the participants' accounts. The Cadence Bancorporation Deferred Compensation Plan does not provide for above-market or preferential earnings. 
Employment Agreements 
As described below under "Executive Compensation—Employment Agreements with Named Executive Officers," we have entered into employment or change of control agreements with our named executive officers. Our employment and change of control agreements are designed to encourage and reinforce the continued attention and dedication of our named executive officers to their assigned duties without undue concern regarding their job security. 
Other Compensation and Benefits 
Perquisites 
The Company does not provide extensive perquisites to its executive officers, and those perquisites offered are business-related and granted to facilitate the efficiency and productivity of our executive officers. The total value of all perquisites provided to each of our named executive officers in 2018 was less than $71,000, except with respect to Mr. Tortorici who received a relocation reimbursement of $90,578 in connection with his relocation to Atlanta, Georgia from Birmingham, Alabama following our acquisition of State Bank, in addition to a relocation bonus of $70,773. 
Health and Welfare Plans 
Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our company-provided benefit plans and programs, including medical, life, and disability plans, on the same basis as other salaried, full-time employees. 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
In 2018, we adopted (and our stockholders approved) the 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which we refer to as the "ESPP," an employee stock purchase plan intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the ESPP on the same basis as other salaried, full-time employees of the Company. 
-34- 
Recovery and Recoupment Provisions 
The 2015 Omnibus Plan provides that all awards granted under the 2015 Omnibus Plan will be subject to any clawback, recoupment, or forfeiture provisions required by applicable law as in effect from time to time, or otherwise adopted by our Board of Directors (or a committee thereof). We intend to adopt a recoupment policy, which will include provisions to comply with the "clawback" provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, after the SEC issues the applicable rules. 
Effect of Compensation Policies and Practices on Risk Management and Risk-Taking Incentives 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews, along with the assistance of members of senior management, our compensation and incentive plans, policies, and programs made available to our named executive officers and to all other employees of the Company to seek to ensure that they do not provide incentives to the Company's employees to take risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In connection with this review, the Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation strategy and risk mitigation components of the incentive plans and policies to ensure the appropriate balance of compensation opportunities and risk. The Compensation Committee also reviews the performance measurements and criteria used for determining the amount of awards earned under the various incentive plans, in addition to general administrative guidelines. None of our incentive plans for our retail or commercial bankers reward employees based on volume of accounts established. Instead, those incentive plans focus on net contribution margin, deposit growth, loan growth, other revenue generated and referrals to other Company lines of business, as appropriate for each employee's roles and responsibilities. 
Based on our review, we believe that our compensation policies and practices are consistent with those of similar bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries and are intended to encourage and reward performance that is consistent with sound practice in the industry. Our incentive plans provide employees with appropriate incentives that balance risk and reward, are compatible with effective controls and risk management, and are supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by management and our Board of Directors. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section contained in this proxy statement with our management. Based upon that review and those discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to our board of directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

For purposes of the employment agreements and the change of control agreement with Mr. Powell, "good reason" generally means the occurrence of any of the following without the written consent of the executive: (a) a material and adverse change in the executive's position or a failure of Cadence to provide the executive with the authorities, responsibilities, and reporting relationships consistent with the executive's position; (b) a material failure of Cadence to provide any compensation and benefits when due pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement; (c) a purported termination of the executive by Cadence other than as provided under the terms and conditions of the employment agreement; (d) a relocation of Cadence's offices at which the executive is principally employed to a location more than 50 miles from such location, subject to certain exceptions for business travel; (e) a failure of the Company to require a successor to assume the employment agreement; or (f) Cadence providing a notice of nonrenewal to the executive under the employment agreement.

Equity Plans 
Outstanding equity awards granted in 2016 and 2017 were granted under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan. These grants will become fully vested and non-forfeitable based on an attainment of the performance goals at "target" level in the event that a participant's employment terminates following a sale of the company. The outstanding equity awards granted in 2018 were granted under the Amended and Restated Cadence Bancorporation 2015 Omnibus Incentive Plan. Upon a change in control, time-based restricted stock units granted in 2018 continue to vest in accordance with their terms and performance-based restricted stock units are converted into time-based restricted stock units, which cliff vest at the end of the performance period at target unless the Compensation Committee deems, at the time of the change in control, that actual performance warrants a higher payout. If an executive is terminated within one year following the change in control, all unvested awards will immediately vest. 
Deferred Compensation Plan 
Upon a change in control, our named executive officers will also be entitled to a lump sum distribution of all balances credited to their respective accounts under the Deferred Compensation Plan, which provides that all amounts deferred under the plan will be distributed to participants upon the occurrence of a change in control, regardless of the payment election made by a participant to the contrary. 
None of our named executive officers have any unvested balances under the Deferred Compensation Plan.

Quantification of Payments 
The following table reflects estimated payments to our named executive officers that may be made upon termination of employment or a change in control. The estimated payments in the table are calculated based on the assumption that the hypothetical termination of employment and the hypothetical change in control each occurred on December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   The calculation as presented assumes no accrued and unpaid base salary or bonus at the time of termination. As  it relates to Messrs. Murphy, Tortorici, and Holmes and Ms. Toalson, such payments are based on base pay at December 31, 2018 and related target bonus. As it relates to Mr. Powell, payments are based on base pay at December 31,  2018 and his average bonus for the preceding two fiscal years.  
(2)   The calculation of the value of any vesting of time-based restricted stock unit awards or performance-based  restricted stock unit awards is based on a per share price of $16.78 (the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on December 31,2018) and $1,787 per Phantom A Unit of the LLC (which was liquidated in 2018).  Because the performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in 2016 were forfeited as of December 31, 2018, no vesting for such awards is shown in this table. Amounts shown for performance-based restricted stock unit awards granted in  2018 are determined based on an assumed performance achievement level at target. Accelerated vesting of restricted stock unit awards only applies for a qualifying termination occurring during the 12-month  period following a change in control.  
(3)   Benefits are based on COBRA health continuation coverage rates for the employee based on the type of coverage  in effect on December 31, 2018 and life insurance monthly rates for continuation of present coverage and multiplied by the number of months over which the amount would be paid.  
(4)   Per the terms of the 2018 restricted stock unit grant, upon the death or disability of the executive, unvested  time-based restricted stock units will vest immediately, and unvested performance-based restricted stock units are forfeited. Grants made under the 2013 Long-Term Incentive Plan do not provide for any vesting upon the death or disability of the  executive.  
(5)   Upon the named executive officer's termination of employment on account of a change in control under the  terms of his or her employment agreement or change in control, the amounts reported could be reduced if such reduced amount would provide a greater value to the named executive officer after taking into account excise taxes imposed under  Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code and other taxes. For purposes of this table, only the maximum amounts are shown.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
In connection with our IPO, we adopted a directors' compensation program that provides compensation to our non-employee directors and was in effect during 2018. Under this program, each of our non-employee directors (other than Scott M. Stuart) receives an annual retainer of $100,000 and the Lead Director receives an additional annual retainer of $15,000, payable quarterly. Mr. Stuart, who is a member of our board of directors and the co-founder of Sageview Capital does not receive compensation for his service as a director. 
Non-employee directors are restricted from transferring, hedging, pledging, or disposing of any shares of our common stock that they receive under the directors' compensation program for one year following receipt of the shares. 
The following table sets forth, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, certain information regarding the compensation for each non-employee director of the Company during the fiscal 2018.

PROPOSAL NO. 2—ADVISORY VOTE ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
As of January 1, 2019, the Company no longer qualified as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As a result, Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to approve, in a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC (commonly known as "say-on-pay" votes). The compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal 2018 is disclosed in this proxy statement, including in the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," the compensation tables and other executive compensation disclosures. 
The Compensation Committee believes that compensation of our named executive officers in fiscal 2018 met the objectives of our program, which were to foster long-term business success using a pay-for-performance philosophy intended to encourage performance and growth, to attract and retain experienced executives in a competitive environment and to align our named executive officers' interests with those of our stockholders. 
Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion is hereby APPROVED." 
Although your vote is non-binding, the views expressed by stockholders are important to management and the Board and, accordingly, the Board and the Compensation Committee intend to consider the results of this vote in making determinations in the future regarding executive compensation arrangements. 
Required Vote 
Approval of this proposal requires the vote of the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this matter at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted toward a quorum for this proposal, and abstentions will have the same effect as "Against" votes. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. 
-48- 
PROPOSAL NO. 3—ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF FUTURE VOTES ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
As of January 1, 2019, the Company no longer qualified as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. As a result, Section 14A of the Exchange Act requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to recommend, in a non-binding advisory vote, whether future "say-on-pay" votes should occur every one, two or three years. Stockholders have the option of recommending a "say-on-pay" vote every year, every two years, or every three years, or abstaining from making a recommendation. 
The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors recognize the importance of receiving regular input from our stockholders on important issues such as executive compensation. As such, we believe that conducting an advisory vote on our executive compensation on an annual basis to be the most appropriate choice for our stockholders. Although your vote is non-binding, we will strongly consider the views of our stockholders when determining how often to hold a "say on pay" vote. 
Required Vote 
The frequency (i.e., Every Year, Every Two Years or Every Three Years) that receives the highest number of votes cast by stockholders will be considered by us as the stockholders' recommendation as to the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes to approve the compensation of our named executive officers. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be included in the total votes cast and will not affect the results. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR A FREQUENCY OF "EVERY YEAR" FOR FUTURE ADVISORY VOTES ON THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
In addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described in "Executive Compensation" above, the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2018, and each proposed transaction in which: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• we have been or are to be a participant;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any of our directors (including nominees for election as director), executive officers or beneficial holders of  more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of or person sharing the household with any of these individuals (other than tenants or employees), had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  
[END TABLE]
Since our IPO, Cadence Bancorp LLC, our then controlling stockholder (the "LLC") completed a series of registered secondary offerings of shares of Class A common stock of the Company held by the LLC, gradually reducing its ownership interest in the Company. On September 10, 2018, the LLC completed an in-kind distribution (the "Distribution") of substantially all of the shares of Class A Common Stock held by the LLC to its unitholders (other than a de minimis amount of Class A Common Stock representing the aggregate fractional shares in lieu of which unitholders received cash). The LLC was subsequently dissolved in December 2018 (the "Dissolution"). 
Set forth below is a summary of our relationship with the LLC as of immediately prior to the Dissolution. 
Registration Rights Agreement 
In connection with our IPO, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the LLC, pursuant to which we granted the LLC and its permitted transferees (including any of its unitholders who are distributed or otherwise transferred shares of our Class A common stock) registration rights with respect to all of the shares of our Class A common stock. These rights include demand registration rights, shelf registration rights and "piggyback" registration rights, as well as customary indemnification. All fees, costs and expenses related to any registration under the agreement would be borne by us, other than stock transfer taxes and underwriting discounts or commissions. If the LLC distributed or otherwise transferred shares of our common stock to holders of its membership units, certain of those unitholders would benefit from the registration rights under the Registration Rights Agreement. The shares of our Class A common stock held by those unitholders of the LLC would then be able to be resold into the public markets in connection with the exercise of those registration rights or in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, in each case after the expiration of certain lock-up periods. In addition, if requested by the LLC, subject to the requirements of any lock-up period then in effect (or waiver thereof), we were required to file a registration statement to permit the LLC to offer to exchange shares of our common stock that it owns for some or all of the membership units of the LLC held by certain of our current and/or former employees. 
Demand Registration Rights. The registration rights agreement granted the LLC and such permitted transferees demand registration rights. We were required, upon the written request of the LLC or such a permitted transferee, to use our commercially reasonable efforts to effect registration of shares requested to be registered as soon as practicable after receipt of the request, subject to certain exceptions. 
Shelf Registration Rights. The registration rights agreement granted the LLC and such permitted transferees shelf registration rights. Under the terms of the registration rights agreement, the LLC or such a permitted transferee could demand that we file a shelf registration statement with respect to those shares requested to be registered. Upon such demand, we were required to use our commercially reasonable efforts to effect such registration. 
-51- 
"Piggyback" Registration Rights. The registration rights agreement granted the LLC and such permitted transferees "piggyback" registration rights. If we registered any of our securities either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, the holders of these shares were entitled to include their shares in the registration. 
As a result of the Distribution and the Dissolution, the registration rights agreement is no longer in effect. 
Ordinary Banking Relationships 
Certain of our officers and directors, as well as their immediate family members and affiliates, are customers of, or have had transactions with, Cadence Bank or the Company in the ordinary course of business. These transactions include deposits, loans, wealth-management products and other financial services related transactions. Related party transactions are made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral (where applicable), as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not related to us, and do not involve more than a normal risk of collectability or present other features unfavorable to us. As of the date of this prospectus, no related party loans were categorized as nonaccrual, past due, restructured or potential problem loans. We expect to continue to enter into transactions in the ordinary course of business on similar terms with our officers and directors as well as their immediate family members and affiliates. 
Policies and Procedures Regarding Related Party Transactions 
Transactions among Cadence Bancorporation, Cadence Bank and any of their other affiliates are subject to a formal written policy, as well as certain regulatory requirements and restrictions. These requirements and restrictions include Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (which govern certain transactions between banks and their affiliates) and the Federal Reserve's Regulation O (which governs certain extensions of credit by banks to the executive officers, directors, principle shareholders (and their related interests) of the bank and its affiliates). We have adopted policies to comply with these regulatory requirements and restrictions. 
In addition, our board of directors has adopted a written policy governing the approval of related party transactions that complies with all applicable requirements of the SEC and the NYSE concerning related party transactions. Related party transactions are transactions in which we are or will be a participant, the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000 and a related party has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. Related parties of the Company include directors (including immediate family members or persons sharing the household with any of these persons (other than tenants and employees)). Our general counsel, in consultation with management and outside counsel, as appropriate, will review potential related party transactions to determine if they are subject to the policy. If so, the transaction will be referred to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee for approval. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the Committee will consider, among other factors, the fairness of the proposed transaction, the direct or indirect nature of the related party's interest in the transaction, the appearance of an improper conflict of interests for any director or executive officer taking into account the size of the transaction and the financial position of the related party, whether the transaction would impair an outside director's independence, the acceptability of the transaction to our regulators and the potential violations of other corporate policies. Our Related Party Transactions Policy is available on our website at www.cadencebancorporation.com, as an annex to our Corporate Governance Guidelines.

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires directors, executive officers and greater than 10% beneficial owners of the Company's common stock to file reports concerning their ownership of and transactions in such common stock. Based on a review of these reports filed by the Company's officers, directors and shareholders, the Company believes that its officers, directors and shareholders complied with all filing requirements under Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during fiscal year 2018, except that a late Form 4 was filed on November 13, 2018 by director Richard J. Fredericks to report an acquisition of Class A common stock that occurred on October 24, 2018.

PROPOSAL NO. 4—RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED 
PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, served as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, and the Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as auditors for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The Board and the Audit Committee recommend that stockholders ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as independent auditors for the Company. The Company's organizational documents do not require that stockholders ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
However, the Board believes such ratification is a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection but may still retain Ernst & Young LLP. One or more representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and afforded an opportunity to make a statement, if they desire to do so, and to be available to respond to questions from stockholders. 
Required Vote 
Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock represented at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote thereon. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against ratification. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND AUDIT COMMITTEE UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP TO SERVE AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee of the Board, which consists entirely of directors who meet the independence requirements of applicable SEC regulations and the NYSE listing standards for audit committee members, has furnished the following report: 
Report of the Audit Committee 
The Company's management is responsible for the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process. The Company's independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements and issuing an opinion on the conformity of those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). The Audit Committee oversees the Company's internal controls and financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors and in accordance with the Audit Committee Charter. 
In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 16, Communications with Audit Committees, as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. These matters include the quality, and not just the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments and the clarity of the disclosures in the financial statements. 
In addition, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence. Further, the Audit Committee has also discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the firm's independence from the Company and its management. In concluding that the registered public accounting firm is independent, the Audit Committee considered, among other factors, whether the non-audit services provided by the firm were compatible with its independence. 
The Audit Committee discussed with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their audit. The Audit Committee meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examination, their evaluation of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. 
In performing all of these functions, the Audit Committee acts only in an oversight capacity. In its oversight role, the Audit Committee relies on the work and assurances of the Company's management, which has the primary responsibility for financial statements and reports, as well as the independent registered public accounting firm who, in its report, expresses an opinion on the conformity of the Company's financial statements to GAAP. The Audit Committee's oversight does not provide it with an independent basis to determine that management has maintained appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles or policies, or appropriate internal controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. Furthermore, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm do not ensure that the Company's financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP, or that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America or that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is "independent." 
-55- 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also has approved, subject to stockholder ratification, the selection of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. The Audit Committee has sole authority, without action by the Board, for the review and approval of such services. The Audit Committee has delegated to its Chair the authority to pre-approve audit and permissible tax and non-audit services.

If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the persons named in the accompanying proxy card intend to vote each proxy, to the extent entitled, in accordance with their best judgment. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS FOR THE 2020 ANNUAL MEETING 
Stockholders who, in accordance with the SEC's Rule 14a-8, wish to present proposals for inclusion in the proxy materials to be distributed by us in connection with our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must submit their proposals by certified mail, return receipt requested, and must be received by the Secretary at our principal offices in Houston, Texas on or before November 30, 2019, to be eligible for inclusion in our proxy statement and proxy card relating to that meeting. In the event that we hold our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders more than 30 days before or after the one-year anniversary date of the Annual Meeting, we will disclose the new deadline by which stockholders' proposals must be received in our earliest possible Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or, if impracticable, by any means reasonably calculated to inform stockholders. As the rules of the SEC make clear, simply submitting a proposal does not guarantee its inclusion. 
In accordance with the Company's Bylaws, proposals of stockholders intended to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (other than director nominations) must be received by the Company's Secretary no later than February 8, 2020 nor earlier than January 9, 2020, provided that if the 2020 Annual Meeting is held more than 30 days before, or 60 days after, May 8, 2020, such notice must be given by the later of the close of business on the date 120 days prior to the meeting and not later than the close of business on the date 90 days prior to the meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of the meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of the meeting, the tenth day following the date the meeting date is first publicly announced or disclosed. 
Furthermore, in order for any stockholder to properly propose any business for consideration at the 2020 Annual Meeting, including the nomination of any person for election as a director, or any other matter raised other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8 of the proxy rules adopted under the Exchange Act, written notice of the stockholder's intention to make such proposal must be furnished to the Company in accordance with, and including such information required by, the Company's Bylaws. A copy of the Company's Bylaws is available on our website at www.cadencebancorporation.com. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee considers nominees recommended by stockholders as candidates for election to the Board using the same criteria as candidates selected by the Nominating and Governance Committee discussed in the section entitled "Proposal No. 1—Election of Directors." A stockholder wishing to nominate a candidate for election to the Board at an annual meeting is required to give written notice to the Company's Secretary of his or her intention to make a nomination in accordance with the requirements contained in the Company's Bylaws. Pursuant to the Company's Bylaws, notice of director nominations to be presented at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders must be received by the Company's Secretary no later than February 8, 2020 nor earlier than January 9, 2020, provided that if the 2020 Annual Meeting is held more than 30 days before, or 60 days after, May 8, 2020, such notice must be given by the later of the close of business on the date 120 days prior to the meeting and not later than the close of business on the date 90 days prior to the meeting, or, if the first public announcement of the date of the meeting is less than 100 days prior to the date of the meeting, the tenth day following the date the meeting date is first publicly announced or disclosed. If the number of directors to be elected to the Board is increased and there is no public announcement by the Company naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors at least 100 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, notice of any stockholder nominees to serve as directors for any newly created positions resulting from the increased size may be delivered to the Company's Secretary no later than the close of business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is first made by the Company.
