Proxy Materials Are Available on the Internet 
In accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), we are furnishing proxy materials to our stockholders primarily via the Internet instead of mailing printed copies of those materials to each stockholder.

Unless you elected to receive printed copies of the proxy materials in prior years, you will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Internet Notice") by mail, or if you so elected, by electronic mail. The Internet Notice will tell you how to access and review the proxy materials and how to vote your shares after you have reviewed the proxy materials. If you received the Internet Notice by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions included in the Internet Notice. 
The Internet Notice is first being sent, and the proxy statement and form of proxy relating to the Annual Meeting are first being made available, to stockholders on or about March 29, 2019.

2     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
PROXY STATEMENT 
We are not aware of any other matters that will be brought before the stockholders for a vote. If other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, all shares validly represented by proxies will be voted in accordance with the discretion of the appointed proxies. 
Record Date and Quorum 
The Board has fixed the close of business on March 19, 2019 as the record date for determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were 411,997,198 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. The presence, in person or by proxy, of holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will constitute a quorum. Abstentions, withheld votes, and broker non-votes are included in determining whether a quorum is present for the Annual Meeting. Abstentions include shares present in person but not voting and shares represented by proxy but with respect to which the holder has abstained. Broker non-votes occur when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power on that item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. Although brokers have discretionary power to vote your shares with respect to "routine" matters, they do not have discretionary power to vote your shares on "non-routine" matters. As discussed in more detail below, we believe the following proposals will be considered non-routine and, therefore, your broker will not be able to vote your shares with respect to these proposals unless the broker receives appropriate instructions from you: Proposal No. 1 (Election of Directors) and Proposal No. 2 (Advisory Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation). 
Required Vote 
Each Director standing for election at the Annual Meeting in Proposal No. 1 must be elected by a majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election, meaning that the number of votes cast "for" the Director-nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that Director-nominee. See "The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance — Majority Voting for Directors" below in this proxy statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes, as applicable, are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on Proposal No. 1. Any incumbent Director-nominee who is not elected by majority vote shall promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board (the "Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee"), or such other Board committee designated by the Board, will make a recommendation to the Board on whether to accept or reject the resignation, or whether other action should be taken. In such a situation, the Board will act on the resignation, taking into account the committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose its decision and, if the resignation is rejected, the rationale behind its decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly cast on that item at the Annual Meeting is required to approve Proposal No. 2 (Advisory Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation) and Proposal No. 3 (Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm). Abstentions and broker non-votes, as applicable, are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on Proposal Nos. 2 and 3. 
Your broker is NOT able to vote on your behalf in any director election without specific voting instructions from you. In addition, your broker is not able to vote on your behalf on Proposal No. 2. Accordingly, if your shares are held in "street name" and you cannot attend the Annual Meeting in person, we encourage you to vote your shares on all proposals by promptly instructing your broker as to how to vote on these matters so that your shares will be voted at the Annual Meeting. 
Revocation of Proxies 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised by submitting to our Secretary a written notice of revocation or a properly executed proxy bearing a later date or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     3 
MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS 
Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors 
Each Director stands for election annually. Once elected, Directors hold office until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until the earlier of their death, resignation, or removal. Each Director will be elected at the Annual Meeting to serve for a term expiring at the annual meeting in the year 2020. Each of the nominees has agreed to serve as a Director if elected by the stockholders. 
The Board has determined that nine of ten members of our Board are independent according to the applicable rules of the Commission and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Global Select Market ("Nasdaq"), including each of the following current Directors and nominees: Atsushi Abe, Alan Campbell, Curtis J. Crawford, Ph.D., Gilles Delfassy, Emmanuel T. Hernandez, Paul A. Mascarenas, Daryl A. Ostrander, Ph.D., Teresa M. Ressel, and Christine Y. Yan. 
Transactions and Relationships Considered in Independence Determinations. Consistent with Nasdaq listing standards, in making its independence determinations, the Board considered transactions occurring since the beginning of 2016 between the Company and the Directors, members of their immediate family, and entities associated with the Directors or members of their immediate family. The Board determined that no "categorical" bars to independence under Nasdaq listing standards applied to any of the non-employee Directors ("Outside Directors"). In making its determination that no relationships exist that, in the opinion of the Board, would impair the Outside Director's independence, the Board considered the following transactions, relationships, or arrangements: (i) the transactions, relationships, or arrangements under the headings "Relationships and Related Transactions — Related Party Transactions" and "Management Proposals — Proposal 1: Election of Directors" included in our annual meeting proxy statements filed with the Commission on April 11, 2018 and April 12, 2017; and (ii) the associations certain of our Outside Directors have with other companies, including other companies in the semiconductor industry, as disclosed in their biographies and discussed further below. 
Under Commission rules for "related party transactions," in situations where the Outside Director's interest was only related to his or her service as a director of the other company, an indirect material interest does not exist for such Outside Director. In each other transaction where a determination was required, the Outside Director was determined not to have a direct or indirect material interest that would be deemed a "related party transaction" under Commission rules. Such determination included a consideration of any equity (or derivative rights) owned by the Outside Director in such other company. 
In making independence determinations, the Board considered a category of transactions occurring since 2016 which involved the Company doing business with organizations in our industry that have an Outside Director serving in a board or management position. In each applicable instance, the amounts paid to and received from each company (and ON Semiconductor) were below the "categorical" bar to independence set forth in Nasdaq listing standards, which uses a threshold of 5% of consolidated revenue of the recipient entity. Each of the below commercial relationships arose during the ordinary course of business for ON Semiconductor and the other companies involved and were on terms and conditions available to similarly situated customers and suppliers. In particular, the Board considered the following transactions and relationships with respect to the independence of certain Outside Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating the independence of Mr. Abe, the Board considered purchases from and sales to Fujitsu Limited and its  consolidated subsidiaries, as well as the Company's investment in ON Semiconductor Aizu Co., Ltd., which is a manufacturing joint venture between the Company and Fujitsu Limited and also a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Mr. Abe  joined the board of directors of Fujitsu Limited in 2015. Sales to Fujitsu Limited consisted generally of component semiconductor devices used in electronic product assembly and purchases consisted of foundry services and capital expenditures,  manufacturing equipment, hardware, software, and other services and products.

Management Proposals 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the independence of Dr. Crawford, the Board considered purchases of manufacturing spares and  facilities construction work from Xylem, Inc., on whose board of directors Dr. Crawford currently serves. The Board also considered the use of certain products and services of XCEO, Inc. ("XCEO") in 2017 and 2018. The Company  discontinued the use of all services of XCEO in 2018. Dr. Crawford is the Chief Executive Officer of XCEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating the independence of Mr. Delfassy, the Board considered certain minor transactions with certain companies  on whose boards he has served as a director, including Imagination Technologies Group plc, a UK-based technology research and development company, on whose board Mr. Delfassy served until 2017. The  Company made minor sales to Imagination Technologies Group plc in 2017 for kit parts. The Board also considered sales to a company that is a strategic investor in Cavendish Kinetics, Inc., on whose board Mr. Delfassy serves.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the independence of Mr. Mascarenas, the Board considered transactions with certain companies on whose  boards he has served as a director, including purchases of engineering design and manufacturing and other support services and supplies from Mentor Graphics Corporation ("Mentor Graphics"), of which Mr. Mascarenas served as a director  from 2015 until March 2017, at which time Mentor Graphics was acquired by Siemens AG. The Board also considered sales made to Borg Warner Inc., on whose board of directors Mr. Mascarenas has served since July 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating the independence of Dr. Ostrander, the Board considered certain transactions with RF Micron, Inc.  ("RF Micron"), on whose board of directors Dr. Ostrander serves, including an intellectual property licensing and buy/sell agreement and a joint development agreement for radio frequency identification ("RFID") reader  integrated circuit technology.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In evaluating the independence of Ms. Ressel, the Board considered that Ms. Ressel serves as independent trustee  to the Invesco Ltd. ("Invesco") mutual fund complex (the "Invesco Mutual Fund Complex"), comprised of Delaware statutory trusts and individual mutual funds. The Invesco Mutual Fund Complex is advised by Invesco Advisers, Inc., an  independent investment management company with more than $900 billion in assets under management and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Invesco. The Board also considered that Invesco is the parent company of investment funds that are currently  lenders under the Term Loan "B" credit facility governed by the Company's existing credit agreement providing, in the aggregate, approximately 4.74% of the total loan amount and that certain investment companies in the Invesco Mutual  Fund Complex manage or are advised by certain investment funds that collectively owned approximately 0.13% of the Company's outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With respect to the independence of Ms. Yan, the Board considered transactions with certain companies with which she  is involved, including minor sales and purchases of products to and from Stanley Black and Decker, Inc. ("Stanley") made by the Company from 2016 through 2018. Ms. Yan served as Vice President of Integration at Stanley until November  2018.  
[END TABLE]
Unless you withhold your vote or indicate otherwise on your proxy card, and except in a case of a broker non-vote, proxies will be voted FOR the election of the nominees. The Board has no reason to believe that any of the following nominees for Director will be unable to serve. If, however, any one of them should become unavailable, the Board may reduce the size of the Board or designate a substitute nominee. If the Board designates a substitute nominee, shares represented by proxies will be voted for the substitute nominee. 
Set forth below is information concerning our Director-nominees, including their business experience and outside public company directorships for at least the past five years. In the biographies and related information, we describe certain of the experiences, qualifications, attributes, or skills that caused the Board to determine that the person should serve as a Director as of the date of this proxy statement. In addition to the specific qualifications described below, we believe that each Director has the business acumen and sound judgment that we believe are required for the proper functioning of our Board and the integrity, honesty, and adherence to high ethical standards necessary to set the "tone at the top" for our Company. Most of our Directors also have significant other public company board experience that broadens their knowledge of board processes, issues, and solutions.

Required Vote. To be elected, each of the Director-nominees must receive the affirmative vote of the majority of votes cast, meaning that the number of votes cast "for" a Director-nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that Director-nominee. See "The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance — Majority Voting for Directors" below in this proxy statement. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the proposal to elect Directors. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "for" election of each of the Director-nominees in Proposal No. 1.

Proposal No. 2: Advisory Resolution to Approve Executive Compensation 
As required by Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we are asking for stockholder approval of the compensation of our Named Executive Officers identified in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Overview" section of this proxy statement (the "Named Executive Officers" or "NEOs"). The Board of Directors recommends that our stockholders approve such compensation by approving the following advisory resolution: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of ON Semiconductor Corporation approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers identified in the Summary Compensation Table included in this proxy statement as such compensation is described pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K in this proxy statement (which disclosure includes the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the compensation tables and accompanying footnotes and narratives under the heading "Compensation of Executive Officers" in this proxy statement). 
The principal objective of our compensation programs is to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented individuals who will deliver competitive financial returns to our stockholders and accomplish our short-term and long-term plans and goals. The Company seeks to accomplish this goal by rewarding performance, both individual and corporate, in a way that is aligned with the short- and long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. Consistent with this philosophy, the majority of the total compensation opportunity for each of our Named Executive Officers is incentive-based, and a significant portion of such compensation is dependent upon the Company's or the individual's achievement of specified and predetermined financial goals. The Company believes that its executive compensation program satisfies the Company's compensation objectives. We describe our compensation policies and programs in more detail below in this proxy statement, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this proxy statement (the "CD&A"). 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding upon the Company. However, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"), which is responsible for designing and administering the Company's executive compensation program, values the opinions expressed by stockholders. If there are a significant number of negative votes, we will seek to understand the concerns that influenced the voting and will consider whether any actions are necessary to address those concerns. 
The Board has previously adopted a policy providing for an annual advisory vote to approve executive compensation. Unless the Board modifies its current policy, the next advisory vote will be at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
Required Vote. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly cast on this item is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on this proposal. 
The Board of Directors recommends a vote "for" the advisory (non-binding) resolution to approve executive compensation in Proposal No. 2.

Management Proposals 
Proposal No. 3: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee"): (a) has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PricewaterhouseCoopers") as the independent registered public accounting firm to (i) audit our consolidated financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2019 and (ii) render other services as required of them, including to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019; and (b) is seeking ratification of this appointment from the stockholders of the Company. 
In determining whether to retain PricewaterhouseCoopers as our 2019 independent auditor, the Audit Committee considered, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the historical and recent performance of PricewaterhouseCoopers on our audits;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the breadth of knowledge of PricewaterhouseCoopers with respect to our industry and business, our accounting policies and  practices, and our internal control over financial reporting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the capability and expertise of PricewaterhouseCoopers in handling the breadth and complexity of our worldwide operations;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• external data on audit quality and performance, including recent Public Company Accounting Oversight Board reports on  PricewaterhouseCoopers and its peer firms;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appropriateness of PricewaterhouseCoopers' fees for audit and non-audit  services; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence and tenure as our independent auditor.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this evaluation, the Audit Committee believes that the retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent auditor for 2019 is in the best interest of the Company and our stockholders. 
A representative of PricewaterhouseCoopers is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting. If present, the representative will have an opportunity to make a statement, if such representative desires to do so, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions by stockholders. 
Stockholder ratification of the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by the bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") or otherwise. Nonetheless, the Audit Committee is submitting the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers to the stockholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice and because the Audit Committee values stockholders' views on our independent auditors. 
If the stockholders fail to ratify the selection, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such an appointment would be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders. 
Required Vote. The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes duly cast on this item is required to approve this proposal. Abstentions are not treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on this proposal. 
The Audit Committee and the Board of Directors recommend a vote "for" approval of Proposal No. 3.

Audit and Related Fees 
The Audit Committee reviews and approves audit and permissible non-audit services performed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, our independent registered public accounting firm, as well as the fees charged by PricewaterhouseCoopers for such services. In its review of non-audit services and fees and its appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee considered whether the provision of such services is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence. 
Fees Billed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. The table below sets forth the aggregate fees for audit and other services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers for 2018 and 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Fee Type         2018 (in millions)       2017 (in millions)    
   Fee Type         2018 (in millions)       2017 (in millions)    
   Fee Type         2018 (in millions)       2017 (in millions)    
 Audit Fees (1)       $  7.2         $  7.4   
 Audit-Related Fees (2)       $  0.0         $  0.4   
 Tax Fees (3)       $  1.5         $  1.3   
 All Other Fees       $  0.0         $  0.0   
 Total Fees       $  8.7         $  9.1

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Includes fees billed for each of 2018 and 2017 for professional services rendered in connection with tax consulting, tax  compliance, tax audit assistance, tax planning, and transfer pricing.  
[END TABLE]
Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services. Under the Audit Committee charter, the Audit Committee must pre-approve all audit and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm, except for any de minimis non-audit services which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit and which qualify for the de minimis exception under federal securities laws and regulations. The Audit Committee may delegate to one or more members of the Audit Committee the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that such decisions shall be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
The Audit Committee pre-approval policy (the "Pre-Approval Policy") requires the Audit Committee to pre-approve certain audit, audit-related, tax, and other services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. With certain exceptions, the term of pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval. The Audit Committee periodically revises the list of pre-approved services. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members, who must report any pre-approval decisions to the full Audit Committee, but may not delegate such decisions to management. In granting any such pre-approvals, the Audit Committee considers the extent to which approved services could impact the independence of the auditor. With respect to each proposed pre-approved service, the auditor must provide the Audit Committee, upon request, with detailed back-up documentation regarding the specific services to be performed. 
During 2018 and 2017, all audit and permissible non-audit services were pre-approved by the Audit Committee pursuant to the Pre-Approval Policy and its charter. 
The Audit Committee has determined that the provision of services described above is compatible with maintaining PricewaterhouseCoopers' independence.

Pursuant to its charter, the Compensation Committee also prepares an annual report required by the rules of the Commission for inclusion in our proxy statement. This report is included in this proxy statement immediately following the CD&A. 
The ON Semiconductor Corporation Amended and Restated Stock Incentive Plan (the "Amended and Restated Plan"), together with the Amended and Restated Guidelines on the Delegation of Authority to the Chief Executive Officer to Make Certain Awards, contemplate that pursuant to a specific written delegation of authority by the Compensation Committee, the CEO may grant awards to individuals who are not subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to expedite the hiring process and retain talented employees. We describe the role of executive officers in determining or recommending the amount or form of executive compensation 
22     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance in the CD&A under "Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation — Role of Senior Management in Determining Executive Compensation." The role that officers play in determining or recommending the amount or form of director compensation is generally consistent with that description. 
The Compensation Committee has regularly and directly engaged a compensation consultant to assist in recommending the form and amount of executive and director compensation. In May of 2012, the Compensation Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC ("Pearl Meyer") as its primary compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee has reviewed the performance of Pearl Meyer annually since that date. Among other things, with respect to our 2018 compensation programs, Pearl Meyer was requested to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perform an executive compensation review, including a peer group review and competitive pay assessments;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• perform a short-term incentive plan and equity grant review;

[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide additional assistance, as requested, in analyzing and determining senior executive compensation.   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has considered the independence of Pearl Meyer in light of Commission rules and Nasdaq listing standards regarding compensation consultants and has concluded that Pearl Meyer's work for the Compensation Committee has not raised any conflict of interest. Additional information regarding the Compensation Committee's retention and use of its consultants can be found in the CD&A in "Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation — Role of Compensation Consultants" as well as other sections of the CD&A. 
The Board has determined that each member of the Compensation Committee during 2018 and each current member of such Committee is independent within the meaning of applicable Commission rules and the listing standards of Nasdaq. The Compensation Committee met 9 times in 2018. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has a formal written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at www.onsemi.com. The adequacy of this charter is reviewed at least annually.

[END TABLE]
As noted above, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is required to develop and periodically review criteria for Director-nominees, which may include specific skills, experience, diversity, and other qualifications. We have no formal policy on the consideration of diversity in identifying Director-nominees, but we endeavor to have a board representing diverse experiences in areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities. When the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considers diversity, it may consider diversity of experience, skills, and viewpoints, as well as traditional diversity concepts such as race or gender, as it deems appropriate. We value international business experience and, as such, our directorships mix reflects that emphasis. 
Among other matters, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may consider the following nomination criteria regarding Board membership: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appropriate size of the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a nominee's knowledge, skills, and experience, including, without limitation, experience in finance and accounting,  general business management, the semiconductor industry and semiconductor technology, international business, sales and marketing, corporate governance and compliance, and intellectual property;  
[END TABLE]
24     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the needs of the Company with respect to particular skills and experience;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a nominee's experience leading and supporting environmental, social, and governance criteria and civic responsibility;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a nominee's independence as defined in Nasdaq and Commission rules and regulations;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• diversity, which fosters diversity of thinking;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a nominee's age and tenure; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the desire to balance the benefit of continuity with the periodic injection of the fresh perspectives provided by new Board  members.  
[END TABLE]
The Company's goal is to assemble a Board that brings together a variety of perspectives and skills derived from high-quality business and professional experiences. In doing so, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will also consider candidates with appropriate non-business backgrounds. Directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to carrying out their duties and responsibilities effectively and should be committed to serve on the Board for an extended period of time. See also "Corporate Governance Principles — Qualifications" for a further discussion about qualifications for our Board members. Other than the foregoing, there are no stated criteria for Director-nominees, although the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that it is appropriate for more than one member of the Board to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by Commission rules, and to have past employment experience in finance and accounting sufficient to meet the financial sophistication rules under Nasdaq listing standards. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also believes it is appropriate for certain key members of the Company's management to participate as members of the Board. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee identifies nominees by first evaluating the willingness of current members of the Board to continue service on the Board. Current members of the Board with skills and experience that are relevant to the Company's business and who are willing to continue in service are considered for re-nomination. If any member of the Board does not wish to continue in service, if the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee decides not to re-nominate a member for re-election, or if the Board considers increasing the size of the Board, the Board then identifies the desired skills and experience for a new nominee in light of the criteria above. Current members of the Board are polled for suggestions as to individuals meeting the criteria described above. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may engage in research to identify qualified individuals, which may include engaging a professional search firm from time to time. In 2018, the Company retained Heidrick & Struggles International Incorporated, a professional search firm ("Heidrick & Struggles"), to identify Director-nominees for consideration by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. During the year, Heidrick & Struggles identified Christine Y. Yan as a potential candidate for Director-nominee. After careful consideration of Ms. Yan's credentials and qualifications, the Board, upon recommendation from the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, elected Ms. Yan as a Director on October 1, 2018. Pursuant to its charter, if a stockholder complies with the Director nomination procedures described in the Bylaws, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider that nomination. In such case, it will evaluate the stockholder nomination in the same manner as it evaluates other nominees. For a description of the procedure for stockholder nominations, see "Miscellaneous Information — Stockholder Nominations and Proposals" below. 
The Board has determined that each member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee during 2018 and current member is independent within the meaning of applicable Commission rules and the listing standards of Nasdaq. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee met 9 times in 2018. 
Executive Committee. The Executive Committee of the Board (the "Executive Committee") has a formal written charter, a copy of which is available on our website at www.onsemi.com. The Executive Committee 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     25 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance has the specific purpose under its charter to exercise between meetings of the Board all the delegable powers and authority of the Board regarding the management of the business and affairs of the Company to the extent not expressly prohibited and not separately delegated to other committees of the Company, and subject to applicable restrictions and limitations. 
As set forth in its charter, the Executive Committee does not have the power, among other things, to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• amend or repeal any resolution of the Board which, by its express terms, is not so amendable or repealable;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appoint other committees of the Board or the members of such committees or amend or revise their duties and  responsibilities or their charters (the Executive Committee may, however, appoint and delegate to subcommittees as permitted under applicable law);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appoint or remove the Chair of the Board, the President, or the CEO;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• authorize any single purchase or related series of purchases of assets, or an acquisition of a business or businesses, with  an aggregate purchase price in excess of $50 million;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• authorize any single sale or related series of sales of assets, or a disposition of a business or businesses, with an  aggregate sales price in excess of $50 million; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• authorize any single investment or series of related investments in other businesses or ventures with an aggregate dollar  amount of such investment in excess of $50 million.  
[END TABLE]
The Executive Committee met 4 times in 2018. 
Other Committees. The Science and Technology Committee of the Board (the "Science and Technology Committee") advises the Board as to the scope, health, direction, quality, investment levels, and execution of the Company's technology strategies. The Science and Technology Committee met 4 times in 2018. The Integration Oversight Committee of the Board (the "Integration Oversight Committee") oversees integration activities of acquisitions for which Board approval is required and any other acquisition for which the Board deems this level of oversight appropriate. The Integration Oversight Committee did not meet in 2018. 
The Board, from time to time, has deemed it desirable and in the best interest of the Company to form various special committees and other independent committees. 
Self-Evaluation. The Board believes that certain governance principles and practices have a direct effect on the effectiveness of the Board and correlate to the creation of stockholder value. To measure its own operation against such principles and practices and to identify areas for improvement, the Board and its committees perform an annual self-evaluation. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is charged with overseeing the self-evaluations, and in 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee used the following process to conduct the Board's self-evaluation: 
26     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
In the Board self-evaluation process, topics and questions for 2018 were grouped into seven categories: 
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board reconsider the tools, processes, topics, and questions for the self-evaluation as warranted, including consideration of whether to retain an independent third party to facilitate the Board's self-evaluation. The Board and its committees may perform the annual self-evaluations using different tools and processes in future years. 
Each of the Board's committees also performs an annual self-evaluation to assist the committees and the Board in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of such committees, and in 2018, the self-evaluation of the committees generally followed the process used by the Board, except that results were sent to committee chairs (as opposed to the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee), and committee chairs led the discussions for their respective committees with the Board in executive session. The Integration Oversight Committee did not meet during 2018, and, accordingly, it did not perform a self-evaluation for the year. 
During 2018, the Board decided to implement an annual peer-to-peer evaluation to obtain information about each Director's performance, contributions, and effectiveness during the previous year.

Equity Compensation. Under the Outside Director Compensation Program, each Outside Director receives an annual award of fully-vested stock with a value equal to approximately $205,000, rounded up such that only whole shares are issued. The 2018 annual grant was based on the closing price of our stock on June 4, 2018 ($26.20), the grant date, and resulted in a grant of 7,825 shares to each person serving as an Outside Director on the grant date. The 2018 grants were made under the Amended and Restated Plan. Under the Outside Director Compensation Program, if an Outside Director is appointed after the date of the annual grant, the award amount is prorated based on the period of the year during which the Outside Director serves.

Other. We reimburse Outside Directors for reasonable expenses incurred to attend Board and Committee meetings and to perform other relevant Board duties. Employee Directors do not receive any additional compensation for their services as a member of the Board. 
Majority Voting for Directors 
Except as otherwise provided in the Bylaws, each Director is elected by the vote of the majority of the votes cast with respect to that Director's election at any meeting for the election of Directors at which a quorum is present. However, if, as of the tenth day preceding the date we first deliver the notice of such meeting to our stockholders, the number of nominees exceeds the number of Directors to be elected (a "Contested Election"), the Directors shall be elected by the vote of a plurality of the votes cast. A majority of votes cast means that the number of votes cast "for" a Director's election exceeds the number of votes cast "against" that Director's election (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast either "for" or "against" that Director's election). 
In the event an incumbent Director fails to receive a majority of the votes cast in an election that is not a Contested Election, the incumbent Director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, or such other committee designated by the Board for this purpose, shall make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation of such incumbent Director, or whether other action should be taken. The Board must act on the resignation, taking into account such committee's recommendation, and publicly disclose (by a press release and filing an appropriate disclosure with the Commission) its decision regarding the resignation and, if such resignation is rejected, the rationale behind the decision, within 90 days following certification of the election results. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee in making its recommendation and the Board in making its decision each may consider any factors and other information that it considers appropriate and relevant. 
If the Board accepts a Director's resignation pursuant to these provisions, or if a nominee for Director is not elected and the nominee is not an incumbent Director, then the resulting vacancy may be filled by vote of a majority of the Directors then in office pursuant to Article NINTH, Section 2 of our Certificate of Incorporation. 
Other Board Matters 
Board Leadership Structure. We currently separate the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board to align the Chair role with our Outside Directors and to further enhance the independence of the Board from management. Our Chair works closely with our CEO and General Counsel to set the agenda for meetings, facilitate information flow between the Board and management, and gain the benefit of the CEO's Company-specific experience, knowledge, and expertise. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight. While management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, the Board plays an ongoing and active role in the oversight of risk. The Board, both directly and through its committees, carries out its oversight responsibilities by regularly reviewing and discussing with management areas of material risk to the Company, which may include financial risks, legal and regulatory risks, operational risks, and strategic risks, along with key risk areas within each of those risk categories. The Board also reviews with management, as appropriate, mitigation measures being taken to address such risks. While the Board has primary responsibility for risk oversight, the Board's committees support the Board by regularly addressing risks in their respective areas of oversight. Specifically, the Audit Committee charter requires the Audit Committee to discuss with management the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies as they relate to the Audit Committee's responsibilities. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee charter requires it to oversee the Company's risk management program and provide guidance to the Board regarding its risk oversight responsibilities. In designing our compensation programs and structuring awards, the Compensation Committee considers the likelihood of undue risk-taking and the impact that such compensation decisions may have on the Company's risk profile. Its charter requires it to consider and discuss with management whether compensation 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     29 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance arrangements for Company employees incentivize unnecessary and excessive risk-taking. The charters for the Science and Technology Committee and the Integration Oversight Committee also require those committees to review the Company's risk exposure relating to their respective functions. The Chair of the relevant committee then reports on risk discussions to the full Board to the extent appropriate. This dual track of direct Board oversight and oversight through its committees provides a modest degree of overlap but is designed to foster a fulsome discussion of risks facing the Company. The Board's role in risk oversight has not affected its leadership structure. 
As part of its review of the Company's material areas of risk, the Board has semi-annual strategy and planning meetings at which business plans and proposals for the Company and various units or groups within the Company are presented and discussed. Comprehensive risk analysis is a significant part of such planning. At quarterly Board meetings, business unit leaders and the heads of certain administrative function groups provide status reports to the Board or the appropriate committee. These reports include risk evaluation and assessment as a matter of course. For example, internal audit presents quarterly reports to the Audit Committee that include analysis of financial and regulatory risk. Management and the Board consider and evaluate from time to time the risk of cybersecurity breaches and vulnerabilities and how best to mitigate such risks. Most recently, in November 2018, the Audit Committee, acting pursuant to authority delegated from the Board, approved amendments to ON Semiconductor's Insider Trading Policy that allow the Company's Securities Compliance Officer to impose a black-out on securities trading in the event of a cybersecurity breach or attack. Under such circumstances, as a further measure to promote compliance with the trading black-out, the amendments also impose a duty upon the Securities Compliance Officer to notify the CEO and our Chief Financial Officer (the "CFO") of the black-out at or before the time it is imposed. Other specific risks are also addressed appropriately as and when they are identified. At least annually, the Board reviews how risk is being managed and reported to the Board and its committees, along with areas where the Board would like additional analysis or discussion. 
The oversight and management of risk within the Company is guided through a continuously evolving and maturing ERM Program. The goal of ON Semiconductor's ERM Program is to systematically, consistently, and effectively identify, evaluate, prioritize, and manage key risks affecting the Company. The ERM Program framework is designed to ensure that executive management and the Board of Directors have a thorough understanding of risks and opportunities associated with the execution of ON Semiconductor's strategic plans within the business environment in which the Company operates. Following the appointment of a Chief Risk Officer and ERM Program leader in late 2014, the Company dedicated more resources to ERM, including the training of "Risk Champions" across all functional areas. Risk Champions serve as subject matter experts and liaisons between the individual groups and ERM Program governance. The Board and management now regularly review the ERM Program framework, the Company's risk appetite, and the top risks facing the Company. The CEO reports annually to the Board on the overall ERM Program status and development and more frequently as to the progress of ongoing enhancements to the ERM Program. During 2018, the Company continued and expanded its cross-functional scenario analysis activities, executing its second annual Emerging Risk Assessment session while also adding a new Risk Table-Top Planning exercise to the ERM Program. The Company continued its ongoing efforts in driving individual functional and organization Risk Assessment Workshops, completing workshops at the remaining facilities within its worldwide manufacturing footprint. Risk assessments, table-top exercises, emerging risk scenario planning sessions, risk workshops, and executive risk reporting will continue throughout the upcoming year as the Company continues its efforts to implement ERM principles throughout the organization and promote a culture of risk-aware decision making. 
Corporate Governance Principles 
Our Corporate Governance Principles (the "Principles"), which were originally adopted by the Board in 2003 and last amended as of January 1, 2018, provide guidance for all types of corporate governance matters and are available on our website at www.onsemi.com. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviews the Principles annually and recommends amendments to the Board as appropriate.

The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Below is a summary of certain of our corporate governance practices, many of which are addressed in the Principles and our Bylaws: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 ✓  World-Class Culture for  Ethics: In February 2019, the Company was recognized as a Worlds Most Ethical Company® for the fourth consecutive year.     ☒   No Classified  Board: All of our Directors are elected by our stockholders on an annual basis using a majority voting standard for uncontested elections. 
 ✓  Independent Board  Chair: We separate the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board to ensure that the Board is independent from management.     ☒   No Burdensome Director  Removal Restrictions: Our stockholders have the authority to remove any Director from office without cause by a majority vote. 
 ✓  Annual Committee, Board, and  Peer-to-Peer Director Evaluations: Each committee and the Board as a whole conducts an annual self-evaluation, and each Directors individual performance is evaluated annually by other Directors.     ☒   No Overboarding:  We generally expect our Directors to limit the number of boards of public companies on which they serve (including our Board) to four for Outside Directors and two for our CEO. 
 ✓  Stockholder Right to Call  Special Meeting: We allow special meetings of our stockholders to be called upon the written request of stockholders who hold at least 25% of the outstanding voting stock.     ☒   No Poison Pills:  We do not have a poison pill or stockholder rights plan that might prevent stockholders from receiving fair value for their shares in the event of a change in control of the Company. 
 ✓  Stock Ownership  Guidelines: In order to align the interests and objectives of our Directors, Named Executive Officers, and stockholders, we have established competitive guidelines for our stock ownership and retention.     ☒   No  Single-Trigger Change in Control Arrangements: None of our Named Executive Officers will receive payments solely on account of a change in control of the Company. 
 ✓  Clawback Policy: We have a clawback policy  that allows the Company to recoup compensation awards paid to Named Executive Officers who engage in certain acts detrimental to the Companys interests or in the event that the Company is required to prepare a financial statement  restatement.       ☒   No Hedging or Pledging: Our Named  Executive Officers and Directors are prohibited from engaging in hedging transactions with our stock and from pledging our stock as collateral for a loan. Other employees are also encouraged to adhere to these rules.

[END TABLE]
The Role of Board and Management. Our business is conducted by our employees and officers, under the direction of the CEO and the oversight of the Board, to enhance the long-term value of the Company for its stockholders. Both our Board and management recognize that the long-term interests of stockholders are advanced by responsibly addressing the concerns of other stakeholders and interested parties, including employees, recruits, customers, suppliers, creditors, ON Semiconductor communities, government officials, and the public at large. 
Functions of the Board. The Board has at least four regularly scheduled meetings per year at which it reviews and discusses reports by management on our performance, plans and prospects, and immediate issues facing the Company. The Board may choose to schedule additional meetings in accordance with our Bylaws. In addition to general oversight of management, the Board, acting directly or through its various committees, also performs specific functions, including, among other things: (i) selection, evaluation, and compensation of the CEO and other senior management and overseeing CEO succession planning; 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     31 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
(ii) reviewing, monitoring, and, where appropriate, approving fundamental financial and business strategies and major corporate actions; (iii) providing oversight for the Company's ERM Program, including the establishment of corporate risk appetite parameters and overseeing management's implementation of processes for assessing and managing risks affecting the Company; (iv) ensuring that processes are in place for maintaining the integrity of the Company, financial statements, compliance with law and ethics, relationships with customers and suppliers, and relationships with other stakeholders; and (v) performing such other functions as are prescribed by law or our Bylaws. 
Qualifications. Directors should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values, and be committed to serving on the Board for an extended period of time. They must also have an inquisitive and objective perspective, practical wisdom, and mature judgment. We endeavor to have a Board representing diverse experiences in areas that are relevant to the Company's global activities. See "The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance — Committees of the Board — Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee" above for additional information regarding the qualifications we seek in our Directors. 
Directors are expected to limit the number of boards of public or private companies on which they serve (including our Board, but excluding non-profits and subsidiaries of such companies) to no more than four for Outside Directors and no more than two for Directors holding management positions at the Company, taking into account a Director's attendance, participation, and effectiveness on such boards. The number of audit committees on which the members of the Audit Committee may sit concurrently shall be reviewed from time to time by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. In addition, after a Director reaches the age of 75, the Board shall not, under any circumstances, nominate such Director for re-election, and such Director shall not stand for re-election. 
Independence of Directors. We will have, at a minimum, a sufficient number of independent Directors to comply at all times with relevant and applicable Commission, Nasdaq, and other rules and regulations. 
Board Committees. See "The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance — Committees of the Board" above for information regarding committees established by the Board. 
Self-Evaluation. The Board performs an annual self-evaluation in order to provide its assessment of the effectiveness of the Board. Each of the Board's committees also performs an annual self-evaluation to assist the committees and the Board in evaluating the performance and effectiveness of such committees. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee is charged with overseeing the evaluation of the Board and its committees. 
Compensation of the Board. The Compensation Committee has the responsibility for recommending to the Board compensation and benefits for Outside Directors. The Board has delegated responsibility for determining Outside Director compensation to the Compensation Committee, and such responsibility is codified in the Compensation Committee charter. In determining compensation and benefits for our Directors, the Compensation Committee is guided by three goals: (i) to fairly pay Outside Directors for work required in a public company of our size and scope; (ii) to align Outside Directors' interests with the long-term interests of stockholders; and (iii) to structure the compensation in a way that is simple, transparent, and easy for stockholders to understand. Generally, the Compensation Committee believes that these goals are served by compensating Outside Directors with a balance of cash and equity-based awards.

 Remedy for Failure to Comply with  Guideline    If an Outside Director other than the Chair of the Board fails to comply with the ownership and retention guidelines, the Chair of the Board will meet with the relevant Outside Director to formulate an individualized and structured  plan to ensure compliance. If the Chair of the Board fails to comply with such guidelines, the Compensation Committee will meet with the Chair of the Board to formulate an individualized and structured plan to ensure compliance. Notwithstanding the  foregoing, if the Outside Director fails to comply with the terms of the individualized plan within the allotted time, the Outside Director will not be eligible to stand for re-election at the next annual  stockholder meeting. In addition, at any time that the guideline is not met, the Outside Director is expected to retain all of the net shares of Company stock or equity-based awards received until the guideline is met. With respect to an  equity-based award, net shares are those shares that remain after shares are sold or netted to pay the exercise price of options, if applicable, and withholding taxes or are sold to pay income taxes on the equity-based award.

The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Other Matters. The Principles include a discussion of Board size and selection, the determination of the Board agenda, the process available for reporting concerns to the Audit Committee relating to our accounting and auditing matters, access to senior management and independent advisors, and other matters typical of boards of directors of other publicly-traded semiconductor or peer companies. 
Corporate Social Responsibility 
Our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability ("CSR")—built on a strong foundation of transparency, governance, and ethics — creates value for ON Semiconductor and our stockholders by helping us mitigate risks, reduce costs, build brand value, and identify new market opportunities. We set ambitious goals for our Company and have made strategic investments in the areas of environmental sustainability, supply chain responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and social impact that benefit the environment and society. 
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has the responsibility under its charter to review and oversee matters related to CSR. A foundational element of our approach to CSR is our commitment to transparency. For more information on our CSR efforts, please see our most recent CSR Report, which is available on our website at www.onsemi.com. 
Environmental Sustainability. We are committed to a greener world. We keep sustainability at the forefront of our operations by reducing and minimizing our carbon emissions, consumption of energy and water, chemical usage, and waste generation. We have invested in our goal of sustainability excellence by improving our engineering and administrative controls related to environmental pollution control, using state-of-the-art technology to treat air and industrial wastewater emissions, and offering extensive training to our employees who are charged with carrying out our sustainability objectives. In 2018, we implemented over 100 individual projects focused on energy conservation, waste reduction, chemical recycling, material optimization, and water conservation allowing the Company to save an estimated $7.3 million. 
Responsible Business Alliance. We are a full member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), an industry organization comprised of electronics, retail, auto, and toy companies committed to supporting the rights and well-being of workers throughout global supply chains. We have adopted the RBA Code of Conduct covering labor, environment, health and safety, ethics, and management systems (the "RBA Code") within our own operations and actively uphold it in our supply chain. 
Supply Chain Responsibility. Actively managing our supply chain creates business value for ON Semiconductor and our customers by helping us reduce risks, improve product quality, achieve environmental and social goals, and raise the overall performance of our suppliers. At least every three years, we complete supplier audits or assessments on our major corporate or manufacturing site suppliers using the RBA Code standard. Additionally, we ask our major suppliers to sign a statement of commitment to the RBA Code and the ON Semiconductor Code of Business Conduct and offer expanded training and capacity-building programs with our suppliers. We actively collaborate with others and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as advancing responsible minerals sourcing, addressing risks of forced and bonded labor, and improving transparency around climate and water impacts in the global supply chain. 
Diversity and Inclusion. Building an inclusive workforce, industry, and ecosystem is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent needed to advance innovation and drive our business forward. As a company, we celebrate differences and promote an inclusive environment by valuing the contributions of all employees, and we support the diversity of thinking that results from the differences in experiences, knowledge, culture, customs, and background of all of our employees. Diversity of thinking helps us continue to encourage the creativity and innovation necessary for ON Semiconductor to maintain a competitive advantage in the global marketplace. As part of our commitment to promote the importance of our racial and gender diversity, in 2018 and 2019, we linked a portion of executive pay to certain performance measures related to the hiring and promotion of women and underrepresented minorities. 
Human Rights Policy. We have adopted a Human Rights Policy that formalizes our commitment to preserving and promoting the fundamental rights of others, as reflected in the RBA Code, the Universal 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     35 
The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance 
Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations (the "UN") Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and the UN Global Compact (the "Human Rights Policy"). The Human Rights Policy applies to all of our employees, joint ventures, major suppliers, and select service providers and contractors and to all of our products and services. The Human Rights Policy lays out certain of our commitments relating to diversity and non-discrimination, anti-harassment, prevention of human trafficking and forced labor, child labor prevention, minimum wage and working hours, freedom of association, workplace safety, environmental stewardship, product responsibility, anti-corruption, and privacy. We communicate these principles to our suppliers, offer training, and periodically assess and audit compliance of major suppliers. We also provide training to our employees and encourage them to report concerns and grievances. We have established a cross-functional committee to manage the Human Rights Policy and conduct due diligence on human rights risks. The Human Rights Policy is reviewed annually and updated as necessary. 
Social Impact. Empowering people through technology and advancing social impact initiatives helps build trust with key external stakeholders and engages and supports the interests of our employees. One way in which ON Semiconductor has operationalized its mission of being socially responsible is through the Company's Global Corporate Giving ("GCG Program"). The GCG Program is administered by 26 committee members based in Asia, Europe, and North America who represent each of our sites globally and serve as ambassadors for the program. Through the GCG Program, we provide charitable organizations and educational institutions the opportunity to apply for grants that are awarded on a quarterly cycle. We evaluate applications and invest in programs based on the target population's need, the clarity of stated objectives and goals, and the organization's evaluation plan. Grantees receiving awards beyond a certain threshold are also required to share the success of their program and the impact of their work in the community through grant reporting. Below is a summary of the charitable contributions made during 2018 under the GCG Program:  
ON Semiconductor's role in the community involves more than monetary contributions. To encourage our employees to volunteer their time, talent, energy, and effort in the community, we also offer a paid employee volunteer program in North America. Through this program, employees may volunteer with organizations of their choosing for up to one day per year and get paid for doing so. Additionally, employees may also participate in Company-sponsored volunteer events during Company time. In 2018, we launched a volunteer

The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance matching grant whereby the Company matches the hours donated by our employees through financial contributions to qualified charitable organizations or educational institutions. 
Recognition. Our performance and recognition in CSR is a testament to our commitment to corporate citizenship, environmental sustainability, supplier responsibility, diversity and inclusion, and social impact. In 2018, we were added to the North America Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) as one of four global semiconductor companies. For two consecutive years, we have also been listed on Barron's 100 Most Sustainable Companies in the U.S. We are honored to be recognized by Dow Jones and Barron's among other leaders in our industry and around the globe as we continue to deeply embed socially responsible practices in our business operations. 
Code of Business Conduct 
We have adopted the ON Semiconductor Code of Business Conduct (the "Code of Business Conduct") for all of our Directors, officers, and employees, and we believe the Code of Business Conduct satisfies the standards promulgated by the Commission and Nasdaq. The Code of Business Conduct is available free of charge on our website at www.onsemi.com. To receive a paper copy of the Code of Business Conduct, you may also write to our Investor Relations Department, ON Semiconductor Corporation, 5005 East McDowell Road, M/D-C302, Phoenix, Arizona 85008, call our Investor Relations Department at (602) 244-3437, or email your request to investor@onsemi.com. 
Compliance and Ethics Program 
We have a Compliance and Ethics Program designed to prevent and detect violations of the Code of Business Conduct, other standards of conduct, and the law. A major goal of the Compliance and Ethics Program is to promote an organizational culture that encourages ethical conduct and a commitment to compliance with the law. In this regard, we have established avenues for parties external to the Company to raise compliance and ethics concerns to our Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer with respect to our employees, Directors, and third parties doing business with the Company.

Executive Summary 
2018 Financial Highlights. Company highlights for the year ended December 31, 2018 are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Total revenue of $5,878.3 million (a 6.0% increase from 2017)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Gross margin of 38.1% (a 1.4% increase from 2017)  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating cash flow of $1,274.2 million (a 16.5% increase from 2017)  
[END TABLE]
2018 Compensation Actions and Highlights. We undertook the following actions in 2018 relating to compensation for our Named Executive Officers: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We granted certain increases in base salary that were effective in July 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We moved from a semi-annual to an annual cash incentive program in order to better align the structure of our short-term  incentive compensation with market trends and stockholder preferences.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We revised the design of our cash incentive bonus program to include goals based on  non-generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") operating income, non-GAAP revenue, certain organizational performance metrics, and certain  organizational diversity metrics designed to increase the racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of our employee population.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As in prior years, we made 50% of our equity grants in the form of performance-based RSUs ("PBRSUs") and 50% in  the form of RSUs. We use a combination of performance-based equity grants and time-based grants to reward performance and foster retention of our top performers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The first tranche of the PBRSUs vests at the end of an 18-month performance period  depending on the achievement of a consolidated adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") goal. If the threshold performance goal is  exceeded, the second tranche, in an amount equal to the amount of the first tranche that was earned, will vest based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the date of grant. If the threshold performance goal is not exceeded, the  entire PBRSU award will be canceled.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs vest in one-third increments over a three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As in prior years, we included a multiplier component to the PBRSU grant for 2018 in order to further incentivize certain  key employees, including our Named Executive Officers, to increase the Company's market share and free cash flow. Upon meeting the Adjusted EBITDA target level, the multiplier gives those employees the opportunity to earn up to an additional  100% of their PBRSU grant for exceeding certain market share and free cash flow goals.  
[END TABLE]
Highlights of our compensation practices and policies for 2018 Named Executive Officer compensation include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs are designed to incentivize our employees to achieve or exceed financial goals established for  the Company and to deliver superior returns to our stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our executives have stock ownership guidelines that are designed to align their interests with those of our stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our long-term equity incentives generally vest over a period of three years to ensure that our executives maintain a  long-term commitment to stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We design our compensation policies and practices so that they do not pose a material risk to the Company or its  stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We benchmark our industry to ensure that our compensation is appropriate for leadership retention, aligned with stockholder  interests, and not excessive for our industry. We believe that the "alignment corridor" graph, depicted below under the heading "CEO Realizable Pay for Performance Relative to Peer Group," illustrates this principle.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide only limited perquisites to our executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our Named Executive Officers and other insiders may not pledge or margin our stock, hedge their exposure to ownership of  our stock, or engage in speculative transactions with respect to our stock.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our change in control agreements do not contain single triggers or excessive benefits. There are no excise tax gross-up provisions in the employment agreements for our Named Executive Officers.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There are no tax gross-ups on any perquisites other than standard relocation  benefits that are available to all employees and amounts paid for expatriate assignments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The minimum vesting period for full-value awards (e.g., RSUs, restricted stock, performance shares, performance share  units, and stock grant awards) made pursuant to the Amended and Restated Plan, including any such equity award made to our Named Executive Officers, is 12 months.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company follows a responsible approach to equity-based compensation. The Company's three-year unadjusted average  annual burn rate as of December 31, 2018 was 1.13% and was based on (a) the sum of options granted, stock grant awards, RSUs, restricted stock awards, and PBRSUs granted divided by (b) weighted average shares outstanding. Under the  adjusted burn rate approach utilized by Institutional Shareholder Services, Inc. ("ISS"), the Company's three-year adjusted average annual burn rate as of December 31, 2018 was 2.94%, approximately 46% of ISS' applicable  burn rate benchmark of 6.32% for our industry. The adjusted number reflects that ISS considers full-value awards to be more valuable than stock options. The adjustment is made based on the Company's annual stock price volatility.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Stockholder Approval of our Compensation Decisions. At the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, the Company's stockholders approved the advisory (non-binding) vote on executive compensation by 96.4% of the votes cast. The Compensation Committee considers this vote a validation of its approach to executive compensation and generally has continued its compensation processes and philosophy in making 2019 executive compensation decisions. 
CEO Realizable Pay versus Pay Opportunity 
A key component of our compensation philosophy is the link between compensation and both overall business results and individual performance. We strive to clearly communicate this alignment in our annual proxy statements and determined that looking at realizable pay versus pay opportunity can illustrate this point more effectively when compared against stockholder value creation. 
Many of the disclosures required in this report concerning CEO compensation discuss pay elements that may be earned by the CEO. Realizable pay, on the other hand, more closely considers actual earnings based on performance. For this purpose, we use the following definitions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay opportunity represents the sum of salary, target cash bonus opportunity for each fiscal year, the grant date  fair value of stock options granted in the fiscal year, the grant date fair value of RSUs and PBRSUs granted in the fiscal year, and all other compensation paid to or on behalf of the CEO.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Realizable pay represents the sum of salary, actual cash bonus paid for each fiscal year, the "in the  money" value of any stock options granted during the fiscal year and valued as of the fiscal year end, RSUs and unvested and outstanding PBRSUs granted during the fiscal year and valued as of the fiscal year end, any PBRSUs earned during the  fiscal year and valued as of the fiscal year end, and all other compensation paid to or on behalf of the CEO.  
[END TABLE]
The charts below present the realizable pay for Mr. Jackson and our other NEOs broken out by salary, short-term incentive pay, and long-term incentive pay. 
STI: Short-term incentive 
LTI: Long-term incentive 
40     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The chart below presents Mr. Jackson's realizable pay compared to his pay opportunity and the corresponding year-end stock price. In evaluating this information, note that there is an inherent lag in any attempt to align pay and performance due to the fact that pay decisions for any given year are based upon metrics and performance data from prior years. 
Mr. Jackson's realizable pay was above his pay opportunity in 2016, 2017, and 2018, reflecting improved business results, stock appreciation, aggressive market share growth, and the integration of Fairchild Semiconductor International, Inc. ("Fairchild") into the Company during the period. However, in 2018, Mr. Jackson's realizable pay decreased, tracking closely with the Company's stock price for the period, demonstrating alignment between his realizable compensation and stockholder outcomes. 
CEO Realizable Pay for Performance Relative to Peer Group 
In the course of reviewing our overall executive compensation program for 2018, Pearl Meyer reviewed the relationship between realizable total direct compensation ("TDC") and our performance for the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2015, December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2017. This time period was selected because it was most closely aligned with the compensation information available for our peer group companies over the corresponding period. For a discussion of our peer group companies, see "Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation — Use of Market Data" below in this CD&A. 
This review was conducted to understand the degree of alignment between realizable TDC delivered to the CEO during the period and our performance relative to our peer group. For purposes of this review, Company performance is defined as total shareholder return ("TSR"). Realizable TDC is defined as the sum of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Actual base salaries paid over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Actual short-term incentives (bonuses) earned over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "In-the-money" value as of  December 31, 2017 of any stock options granted over the three-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The value as of December 31, 2017 of any restricted shares or RSUs granted over the three-year period; and   
[END TABLE]
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     41 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Payouts of cash-based long-term incentive plans and the value as of December 31, 2017 of any PBRSUs earned over the  three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
The chart below illustrates the percentile ranking of our 3-year TSR and the CEO's realizable TDC. The CEO's realizable TDC was within an "alignment corridor" representing a reasonable alignment in terms of TSR performance and magnitude of realizable pay. The Compensation Committee believes this demonstrates an appropriate alignment between our compensation program outcomes and Company performance. 
Compensation Philosophy and Guiding Principles 
Our Compensation Committee is responsible for setting our compensation philosophy and guiding principles and for monitoring their effectiveness. The principal objective of our compensation programs is to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented individuals who will deliver competitive financial returns to our stockholders while accomplishing our short-term and long-term plans and goals. We believe that this philosophy should apply to all our employees, with a more significant level of variability and compensation generally at risk as an employee's level of responsibility increases. Our compensation philosophy is focused on the following core principles: 
Alignment with Stockholder Interests. Achieving acceptable and expected corporate results and performance are a necessary condition for our executives to realize targeted levels of compensation, particularly with respect to variable pay and long-term incentives. We believe that basing a substantial component of compensation on corporate results and performance aligns employee interests with stockholder interests. In addition, the use of stock incentives further aligns executives' interests with those of our stockholders. 
Pay for Performance. A portion of compensation should be tied to an individual's performance, both to incentivize goal-oriented performance and to reward individual contributions to our performance. 
Market or Peer Company Comparison. Our Compensation Committee, with the assistance of independent consultants, analyzes market compensation data in the design and implementation of our compensation programs. Our compensation programs must be competitive with those of our peer companies in order to retain our senior executives. As a general rule, we target the market median (50th percentile) for 
42     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis compensation and above the median for exceptional performance, although we may also deviate from the market median due to other factors. For a discussion of those other factors, see "Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation — Other Factors" below in this CD&A. The Company considers other semiconductor and high-technology companies as its market and generally utilizes survey or peer company data in these sectors to analyze the competitiveness of compensation design. 
Retention. Our compensation program is designed to attract and retain highly talented individuals critical to our success by providing competitive total compensation with retentive features. For instance, our employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers contain double-trigger severance and change in control arrangements. In addition, our stock-based awards are designed to retain our officers and other employees, while also accomplishing our other compensation goals and objectives. 
Purpose of Compensation 
We design our compensation programs to retain valued employees and reward both corporate and individual performance. The goal of these programs is to promote stockholder value by delivering a competitive rewards package comprising base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. Taking into account base salary and short- and long-term incentives, but excluding other benefits described in the Summary Compensation Table below, approximately 88% of our CEO's target TDC is incentive-based compensation. The target TDC of our other Named Executive Officers as a group is approximately 80% incentive-based compensation. 
STI: Short-term incentive 
LTI: Long-term incentive 
Short-term incentives in our compensation program are cash-based. Such incentives are intended to promote superior operational performance, disciplined cost management, and increased productivity and efficiency that contribute significantly to positive results for our stockholders. Long-term incentives in our compensation program are stock-based. The aim of the long-term incentives is to motivate long-term performance while promoting key employee retention. The long-term incentive grants also afford the officer the opportunity to increase stock ownership, which aligns the officer's interest with that of our stockholders and assists the officer in complying with our stock ownership guidelines. For a description of our stock ownership guidelines, see "Other Matters Relating to Executive Compensation — Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines for Officers" below in this CD&A. 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     43 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
While our emphasis in determining the total reward package for each Named Executive Officer is on performance incentives, we also provide elements that are not solely performance-based, including base salary, time-based equity awards, and perquisites. These elements assist in making our programs competitive and enable us to attract and retain talented executives. We consider peer group and market practices in determining the appropriate level of performance- and non-performance-based elements in our compensation programs. 
Processes and Procedures for Considering and Determining Executive Compensation 
Among other responsibilities, our Compensation Committee is primarily responsible for establishing the compensation programs for our Named Executive Officers, as well as monitoring, annually reviewing, and approving the goals and objectives relevant to these programs for our Named Executive Officers, including the CEO. 
Role of Compensation Consultants. In determining compensation, the Compensation Committee considers information and advice provided by its independent consultants. The Compensation Committee has engaged Pearl Meyer as its consultant to provide information and advice concerning executive and non-employee director compensation. The Compensation Committee believes that Pearl Meyer has the necessary skills, knowledge, industry expertise, and experience, as well as the necessary resources, to provide a comprehensive approach to executive and non-employee director compensation planning, strategy, and governance. Pearl Meyer provides advice related to executive and non-employee director compensation as requested, including an annual analysis of executive and non-employee director compensation compared to peer company practice and data. 
In late 2017, Pearl Meyer conducted an executive compensation study and made recommendations regarding changes to compensation design for the 2018 program (the "Pearl Meyer report"). Pearl Meyer also participates in Compensation Committee meetings, makes proposals for compensation adjustments, advises and provides comparator group data on compensation decisions for existing and newly appointed officers, and provides other back-up information and analysis of compensation matters as requested. 
The Compensation Committee consultant may also assist in preparing agendas for Compensation Committee meetings and provide input on management materials and recommendations in advance of Compensation Committee meetings. While the Compensation Committee considers the advice and recommendations of its independent consultants, ultimately, the Compensation Committee has the decision-making authority with respect to our compensation programs, including the specific amounts paid to our executive officers. 
Role of Senior Management in Determining Executive Compensation. The Compensation Committee made all compensation decisions related to our Named Executive Officer compensation in 2018. However, our CEO and other senior officers regularly provide information and recommendations to the Compensation Committee on the compensation and performance of other officers, including, but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the design, structure, and components of our compensation programs and of specific grants;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• appropriate levels of compensation, including equity grants; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the targets for corporate, business unit, and individual performance or other goals for our incentive compensation programs  and stock-based awards.  
[END TABLE]
The senior officers also assist the Compensation Committee in determining the level of achievement of the performance targets underlying performance-based awards and incentives and provide other information specifically requested by the Compensation Committee from time to time. The senior officers also provide information to the compensation consultants, as appropriate, at the request of the Compensation Committee or such consultants, and work with such consultants to develop relevant information and proposals for executive compensation planning and implementation. With respect to the compensation of the CEO, the independent consultant works directly with the Compensation Committee. The CEO does not make 
44     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis recommendations on the level of his compensation, nor does any Named Executive Officer or any other member of management. Similarly, the Compensation Committee does not seek such recommendations or similar input from the CEO or others in management concerning the level of CEO compensation. 
Use of Market Data. In general, the Compensation Committee targets the market median based on peer group or other survey data for total compensation of our executive officers. However, the Compensation Committee recognizes that critical skill sets, performance, retention concerns, or other considerations may justify pay levels above or below the median. The Compensation Committee also considers comparison data, among other things, in determining the individual elements of our compensation programs and in allocating between cash and non-cash compensation and between short-term and long-term incentive compensation. Although the peer company or other survey data is a starting point and a significant factor in the Compensation Committee's compensation determinations, it is not the only factor. See "Other Factors" below in this CD&A. 
The Compensation Committee used data provided in the Pearl Meyer report to assist in structuring the 2018 compensation packages for our Named Executive Officers. From time to time, we also use compensation survey data specific to the semiconductor industry obtained from third-party survey companies (e.g., AON/Radford) and not prepared specifically for us. 
Based on a comparator group update prepared by Pearl Meyer in mid-2017, the Compensation Committee considered changes to the peer group in light of consolidation within the semiconductor industry and related changes to the revenue and market capitalization of our peer group companies. Criteria used to screen the peer group included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• revenue between $2 billion and $15 billion, which was approximately 0.4 to 3 times the Company's revenue;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• market capitalization between $2 billion and $20 billion, which was approximately 0.33 to 3 times the  Company's market capitalization; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• other semiconductor or semiconductor equipment companies.  
[END TABLE]
After considering these criteria, the Compensation Committee determined that the peer group identified in 2017 for 2018 compensation decisions would consist of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Analog Devices, Inc., Applied Materials, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, First Solar, Inc., Lam Research Corporation, Marvell Technology Group Ltd., Maxim Integrated Products, Inc., Microchip Technology Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Qorvo Inc., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Texas Instruments Inc., and Xilinx, Inc. (the "2018 Peer Group"). 
Information provided by Pearl Meyer comparing certain Company information to the 25th percentile, 50th percentile, 75th percentile, and average of the 2018 Peer Group follows:

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
In evaluating the competitiveness of compensation, the Pearl Meyer report compared the compensation of senior executives to that of their functional matches (e.g., CFO compensation is compared to the compensation of comparator company CFOs). The report included information on each executive's competitive position for base salary, total cash compensation at target (base salary and target bonus), actual total cash compensation, long-term incentives (based on grant date fair value), and TDC at target and actual (base salary, bonus, and equity). In determining market data, Pearl Meyer utilized proxy statement data for the 2018 Peer Group, as well as data from three compensation surveys — the 2017 Radford Executive Survey, the 2017 CHiPs Technology Survey, and the 2017 Equilar Compensation Survey. These surveys, which were intended to reflect trending compensation practices generally as well as current practices of companies in the semiconductor industry, broader technology segments, and general industry are widely used and were not prepared specifically for the ON Semiconductor compensation analysis. 
Among other things, the Pearl Meyer report summarized the following with respect to 2017 annual cash compensation for the specified officers (negative amounts mean that our compensation is below the competitive median and positive amounts reflect that our compensation is above the competitive median). Data was aged 3.0% per year to January 1, 2018.

[END TABLE]
Other Factors. In addition to the market data provided by the independent consultant, the Compensation Committee also assesses other factors when making compensation decisions. This includes factors such as the executive's individual responsibilities, skills, expertise, and value added through performance, as well as 
46     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis prior award accumulation. The performance of each officer is formally reviewed by management and shared with the Compensation Committee prior to the Compensation Committee's annual determinations with respect to salary, target bonus adjustments, and long-term incentive awards. Our CEO presents the Compensation Committee with an individual performance overview for each other executive officer, describing the officer's accomplishments for the prior year, his or her strengths, areas of improvement, and development plans. The Compensation Committee separately reviews CEO performance based on, among other factors considered relevant, Company performance, including revenue growth, earnings growth, gross margin improvement, free cash flow, and earnings per share. 
The Compensation Committee considers each component of executive compensation in light of total compensation. In considering awards and other adjustments to the total compensation of each Named Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee also considers the value of previous compensation, including then-outstanding equity grants. On a quarterly basis, management also provides the Compensation Committee with information concerning expectations regarding the vesting of outstanding long-term incentive awards. The Compensation Committee uses this data to evaluate whether the officer's compensation, existing incentive opportunities from prior awards, and wealth accumulation from prior awards reflects Company operating performance and stockholder value, as well as the particular officer's performance, the extent to which they continue to motivate the officer, and whether adjustments are required to the program or an individual officer's compensation. The Compensation Committee will also consider other external factors that it considers relevant, such as the financial condition of the Company and other issues facing the Company at the time. 
The Compensation Committee also considers contractual commitments in determining or recommending executive pay. Each of the Named Executive Officers has entered into an employment agreement with us. The employment agreements generally provide for an initial level of annual salary, a target percentage of annual salary that can be earned pursuant to our short-term cash incentive plans, and a certain level of perquisites. However, the employment agreements also provide for periodic review by the Board or Compensation Committee of the officer's salary and target percentage for our short-term cash incentive plans. They also generally provide for certain payments in the event of termination of employment of the Named Executive Officer. The employment agreement of each Named Executive Officer is described below under the heading "Compensation of Executive Officers — Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements" in this proxy statement. The terms of these arrangements were approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board after considering the aggregate of these obligations in the context of the desirability of hiring or retaining the applicable officer. In each case, the initial level of salary and target percentage provided for in the employment agreements of the Named Executive Officers was less than or equal to the current salary and target percentage of the Named Executive Officers. Therefore, contractual commitments did not play a significant role in compensation decisions for 2018. 
When considering equity awards to our officers, including the Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee considers our equity availability and usage, the potential voting power dilution to our stockholders, and the projected impact on our earnings for the relevant years. The Company believes that its share usage and potential dilution have generally been conservative compared to peer group levels. 
While the Compensation Committee considers internal pay equity in making compensation decisions, we do not have a policy requiring any set levels of internal pay differentiation. As previously discussed, we generally target the compensation levels among our executives to be competitive with the market. As compensation is competitively determined, the Compensation Committee believes that the differentiation between the pay of Mr. Jackson, our CEO, and the other Named Executive Officers is appropriate. 
Risk Analysis. The Compensation Committee considers the potential for unacceptable risk-taking in its compensation design. The Compensation Committee performs periodic risk assessments with respect to its duties and actions. Before taking action on executive compensation, the Compensation Committee undertakes an express dialogue on pay for performance alignment and possible unintended consequences of 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     47 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis excessive risk-taking by executives. In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews the risk mitigating factors in the design of our annual and long-term incentive plans. 
We believe that the design of our executive compensation program does not unduly incentivize our executives to take actions that may conflict with our long-term best interests. Material risk in our compensation design is mitigated in several ways, including as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We design performance-based pay opportunities with goals that are intended to result in long-term value to the  stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have an appropriate mix of pay elements, with compensation not overly weighted toward any one compensation component.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We believe that the base salaries of our Named Executive Officers, as a component of aggregate total compensation,  discourage undue risk-taking.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Earnings goals and opportunity in our performance-based incentive compensation programs are at levels intended to be  aggressive but attainable without the need to take inappropriate risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
While executives have more of their total compensation at risk than other employees, we believe that corporate and individual performance drive incentive compensation, and the principles that serve as the basis for executive compensation practices generally apply to the compensation plans for all employees. 
Base Salary. The Compensation Committee approved base salary increases, effective July 16, 2018, as set forth below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Officer     2017 Base Salary     2018 Base Salary% Increase   
 Keith D. Jackson       $  1,000,000         $  1,035,000            3.5% 
 Bernard Gutmann       $  522,000         $  541,000            3.6% 
 William A. Schromm       $  527,000         $  546,000            3.6% 
 William M. Hall       $  462,000         $  479,000            3.7% 
 Paul E. Rolls       $  504,000         $  522,000            3.6% 
[END TABLE]
In making determinations regarding these salary increases, the Compensation Committee considered information from, and the analysis of, its consultant, Pearl Meyer, where available. Differences in salary among officers are based on market median data and other factors as described in this CD&A. The primary objectives for the base salary component were to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward and retain our Named Executive Officers; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• provide fixed compensation that was competitive in our market and commensurate with each Named Executive Officer's  level of responsibility.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee also considered that following the adjustments, base salaries for the Named Executive Officers would vary from the market median in the following amounts: Mr. Jackson: +14%; Mr. Gutmann: +7%; Mr. Schromm: -3%; Mr. Hall: +3%; and Mr. Rolls: +25%. 
Short-Term Cash Incentive Program. In 2018, the Compensation Committee converted the short-term incentive program from a semi-annual program to an annual program consistent with comparator group trends and institutional stockholder preferences. The primary objectives of the short-term cash incentive program were to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• maximize return to stockholders;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward and retain our top performers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reward achievement of short term financial performance goals;

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee had the ability to exercise negative discretion and pay such lesser amount as it determined.   
[END TABLE]
Threshold for Payout of Awards under the Bonus Program 
As structured, cash bonuses under the 2018 bonus program were to be paid for each component only if the threshold for that component was exceeded. Thereafter, actual bonuses under the bonus program were to be based on the level of achievement of the non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP revenue, ODM, and OPM components. 
Payout under the Non-GAAP Operating Income Component 
Payout of the non-GAAP operating income component was weighted at 60% with a primary gate and threshold of $808 million, a target of $948 million, and a stretch goal of $1,158 million. The target goal represented a 17.3% increase relative to actual results achieved for the prior fiscal year of $808 million. For purposes of calculating non-GAAP operating income for this bonus program, GAAP operating income was adjusted for the following items: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; actuarial gains or losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; acquisition or divestiture related costs; gains or losses (expenses or income) on business dispositions, including divestitures, licensing or similar arrangements, to the extent recognized in GAAP operating income; expensing of inventory fair market value step up; impact for the conversion of accounting from sell-through to sell-in, as measured in the quarter that the conversion occurs; amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets; and unusual/non-recurring material items. Unusual/non-recurring material items include items that are unusual in nature and/or occur infrequently consistent with applicable accounting standards. Generally, the above adjustments are not fixed and are intended to be conceptually consistent with the Company's earnings release calculations for adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share. 
The Compensation Committee believed that non-GAAP operating income should be used as a measure for the bonus program rather than GAAP operating income to prevent payments under the bonus program from being significantly impacted (positively or negatively) by extraordinary or unusual events or non-cash items. For example, an executive should not be deterred in taking necessary actions, such as restructuring or plant closures, due to the potential impact on his or her compensation, nor should he or she be influenced by incentive compensation to take actions that may result in one-time benefits to the Company. The Compensation Committee also considered adjustments eliminating the effect of certain non-cash items to be appropriate believing that the adjusted numbers are a better indicator of current actual Company operating performance.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Payout under the Non-GAAP Revenue Component 
Payout of the non-GAAP revenue component was weighted at 20% with a primary gate and threshold of $5,388 million, a target of $5,723 million, and a stretch goal of $6,200 million. The target goal represented a 6% increase relative to actual results achieved for the prior fiscal year of $5,388 million. For purposes of calculating non-GAAP revenue for this bonus program, GAAP revenue was to be adjusted for the impact for the conversion of accounting from sell-through to sell-in, as measured in the quarter that the conversion occurs, to offset the one-time impact of that conversion. However, in 2018, there was no such adjustment, and non-GAAP revenue mirrored GAAP revenue for purposes of this component. 
Payout under the ODM Component 
The ODM component consisted of three separate metrics, with a total weight of 5%. The first metric was based on the percentage of directors and above who were "diversity employees" as of December 31, 2018 ("diversity directors"). The definition of "diversity" is based on the population of the Company's employees who are either: (i) female; or (ii) (a) live and work in the United States, and (b) self-identify with one or more of the following races: American Indian, Alaskan Native, Asian, Black or African-American, Hispanic/Latino, or Hawaiian/Pacific Islander. An employee who falls into any of the above categories is referred to as a "diversity employee." The diversity directors component was weighted at 40%, with a threshold of 21%, a target of 23%, and a stretch goal of 25%. The second metric relates to diversity new hires and was determined based on the percentage of employees hired in 2018 who are diversity employees (down to the level of associates and recent college graduates). The diversity new hires component was weighted at 30%, with a threshold of 29%, a target of 31%, and a stretch goal of 33%. The third metric relates to diversity promotions and was determined by the percentage of employees promoted to an associate salary grade and above in 2018 who are diversity employees. The diversity promotion component was weighted at 30%, with a threshold of 29%, a target of 31%, and a stretch goal of 33%. 
Payout under the OPM Component 
The OPM component was weighted at 15%, with individual threshold, target, and stretch goals for the performance measurement period for each of the NEOs as follows:

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  Delivery is a customer service metric. For each quarter during 2018, the Company calculated a percentage based on the  following formula: A plus B divided by C, where A = customer request date on time delivery ("OTD") for direct customers (original equipment manufacturers and electronic manufacturing sales industry customers) divided by direct customer  total orders; B = commitment date OTD to distributors divided by distributor total orders; and C = total orders. The 2018 achievement for the delivery component reflected in the table above is the average of the four quarterly delivery results for  2018.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
For purposes of calculating PSG non-GAAP gross margin, PSG non-GAAP gross profit is divided by PSG non-GAAP revenue. PSG GAAP gross profit was adjusted for the following items: actuarial gains or losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; gains or losses (expenses or income) on divestitures to the extent recognized in GAAP gross profit; expensing of inventory fair market value step up; impact for the conversion of accounting from sell-through to sell-in, as measured in the quarter that the conversion occurs; and unusual/non-recurring material items. Unusual/non-recurring material items include items that are unusual in nature and/or occur infrequently consistent with applicable accounting standards. Generally, the above adjustments are not fixed and are intended to be conceptually consistent with the Company's earnings release calculations for adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share. 
Non-GAAP revenue is described above under the heading "Payout under the Non-GAAP Revenue Component." 
Principles Underlying Metrics 
In setting these payout metrics, the Compensation Committee considered its primary short-term compensation objectives, including maximizing total return to stockholders, the expectations of Company performance, projected market expectations, and expectations regarding individual performance and organizational diversity and performance. The diversity metric goals represent incremental improvement over baseline 2017 levels. Similarly, the OPM goals were set to reflect incremental improvement over past performance, considering corporate strategy and market conditions. With respect to the non-GAAP operating income and revenue goals, expectations at the date of approval regarding bonus attainment were projected to be 75% to 100% of target. As a general rule, amounts were set after considering the potential impact on TSR. In addition, the targets were set such that budgeted performance was between threshold and target levels for all metrics. 
Target Award Opportunity 
At its meeting on February 14, 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the award opportunity for each of the Named Executive Officers and, in each case, retained the 2017 target as a percentage of base salary. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Officer  2017 Target% of Base Salary   2018 Target% of Base Salary

Cash Incentive Awards for 2019. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a 2019 short-term incentive program similar to the 2018 program, which, for the Named Executive Officers, utilizes the following metrics: non-GAAP operating income (60%); revenue (20%); certain ODMs relating to employee hiring and retention (5%); and certain OPMs specific to each Named Executive Officer (15%). 
Long-Term Incentives. Long-term incentives for executives are entirely equity-based and are designed to reinforce the alignment of executive and stockholder interests. These rewards provide each individual with a significant incentive to manage from the perspective of an owner. 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee made annual long-term incentive awards to each Named Executive Officer consisting of 50% PBRSUs and 50% RSUs pursuant to the Amended and Restated Plan. The Committee determined that the mix of 50% PBRSUs and 50% RSUs provided a reasonable balance of performance-based incentives and retention hold on the executives. 
No design changes were made to the 2017 program in structuring the long-term incentive component of 2018 compensation. The principles of the 2018 equity grant program include that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• awards are aligned with stockholder interests;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the percentage of unvested value should align with executive retention strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the majority of the stock pool is reserved for top performers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• equity grants are budgeted consistent with market practice based on median value and actual grants are based on performance  and potential; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Company, department, and individual performance drive above-market equity grants in the following annual cycle or  additional grants throughout the year.  
[END TABLE]
Generally, RSUs are used for retention, PBRSUs are used in support of business performance strategies, and the PBRSU multiplier is used for certain executives and global site leaders who are key individuals to further incentivize performance. 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     53 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
General Description of Awards 
The 2018 RSUs are time-based and will vest annually in one-third increments on each anniversary of the grant date. 
The 2018 PBRSUs have both a performance-based and time-based component as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2018 PBRSUs have an 18-month performance measurement period starting on  January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of the second financial quarter of 2019 (the "PBRSU Performance Period") and provide for payout between 0 and 200% of the target award level. Awards payable between threshold and target (the  "base grant") are based on Adjusted EBITDA for the PBRSU Performance Period. The Adjusted EBITDA threshold is $1,600 million (required for vesting to begin) and target Adjusted EBITDA is $2,000 million (resulting in 100% vesting  of the base grant), with linear interpolation from threshold to target. Shares that may be earned pursuant to the base grant may be referred to in this proxy statement as the "Base Grant Shares."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the $1,600 million threshold amount is not exceeded, the entire award is cancelled.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If Adjusted EBITDA reaches the target level of $2,000 million, participants may earn an additional award amount of up  to 100% of their Base Grant Shares based on the achievement of certain market share and free cash flow targets for the PBRSU Performance Period pursuant to a multiplier component (the "Multiplier"), as described below.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% of the earned award, if any ("Tranche 1"), will vest following completion of the 18-month PBRSU Performance Period, and the remaining 50% of the earned award ("Tranche 2") will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Due to the 18-month performance period for the 2018 PBRSU grant, Adjusted EBITDA  for the performance period will not be determined until after the filing of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee must approve the level of attainment of the performance goals and may exercise negative  discretion with respect to the number of shares that will vest based on such goals.  
[END TABLE]
In summary, the number of shares that can be earned by an executive under the 2018 long-term incentive program equals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (a)  For Tranche 1, which vests after the 18-month PBRSU Performance Period:

• divided by two; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  For Tranche 2, which vests based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the grant date if the  executive remains employed on that date, subject to certain provisions relating to a change in control, an amount equal to the units that actually vested in Tranche 1.  
[END TABLE]
Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA (Threshold to Target Share Component of the PBRSUs) 
For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA, GAAP net income will be adjusted for the following items: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; interest expense and interest income; income tax provision; acquisition and divestiture related costs; gains or losses (expenses or income) on business dispositions, including divestitures, licensing or similar arrangements; net income attributable to non-controlling interests; depreciation and amortization; actuarial gains or losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; gain or loss on debt repurchase, debt exchange, early extinguishment of debt, etc.; expensing of inventory fair market value step up; and unusual/non-recurring material items. 
54     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee believes that EBITDA drives stockholder value and is a particularly relevant financial performance measure in our industry and in the economic environment in which we operate. In addition, we consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important tool in measuring our liquidity. The Compensation Committee believes that the adjustments to EBITDA are appropriate to avoid the impact (positive or negative) on achievement of the vesting parameters as a result of extraordinary or unusual items or non-cash items. The unusual/non-recurring items include items that are unusual in nature and/or occur infrequently consistent with applicable accounting standards. Each such adjustment, if any, is to be made to provide a consistent basis from period to period for calculations of performance goals in order to prevent the dilution or enlargement of a grantee's rights under the award. 
Description of Multiplier (Target to Maximum Share Component of the PBRSUs) 
The Multiplier allows participants to earn an additional 100% of the PBRSU base grant at 100% achievement of the Multiplier metrics. Thus, the participants' total award opportunity is two times the annual PBRSU base grant amount. The Multiplier is intended to further align the interests of participants with stockholder interests by driving exceptional business performance and focusing participants on key business indicators. The Multiplier PBRSUs have an 18-month performance measurement period consistent with the base grant PBRSU Performance Period. If the Company achieves target Adjusted EBITDA ($2,000 million), the Multiplier provides for payout of up to 200% of target shares (or an additional 100%) depending on the achievement of two additional metrics. For the Multiplier to pay at maximum, the Company would have to meet or exceed both the market share and free cash flow stretch goals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
      0% Payout (Threshold)       100%  Payout    (Stretch)      
      0% Payout (Threshold)       100%  Payout    (Stretch)      
 Market Share (weighted 50%)        7.215%           7.530%      
 Free Cash Flow (weighted 50%)     $  975 million        $  1,250 million      
[END TABLE]
The Multiplier has two performance measures: (i) market share, which is a relative performance measure benchmarked against our industry peer group; and (ii) free cash flow, which is a financial performance measure. Financial results of businesses acquired or divested during the performance period will be included in all calculations. If the threshold is not exceeded for either the market share or free cash flow portion of the Multiplier, the corresponding portion of the Multiplier will be zero. Tranche 1 of the Multiplier PBRSUs, consisting of up to one half of the Multiplier PBRSUs, will vest at the end of the PBRSU Performance Period based on the level of achievement of the Multiplier metrics and Tranche 2 of the Multiplier PBRSUs will vest based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the grant date in an amount equal to the vested Tranche 1 Multiplier PBRSUs. 
Shares that may be earned pursuant to the Multiplier component of the PBRSU award are referred to in this proxy statement as the "Multiplier Shares." 
In deciding on the Multiplier metrics, the Compensation Committee considered the correlation between free cash flow and stockholder return and that the Company operates in a highly-consolidated industry. In light of such considerations, the Committee ultimately determined that these metrics are a good indicator of the Company's long-term business performance. 
Market Share Component 
The market share component of the Multiplier is based on a peer group and is determined by dividing our total revenue for the performance measurement period by the sum of the semiconductor revenues of the peer group (including the Company) for the performance measurement period, subject to adjustment in certain cases. The target goals assume that the selected market share peer group and the Company will grow at the same percentage rate. The market share stretch performance goal is set at an assumed Company market share rate of growth significantly above our peer group. For 2018, the market share peer group was

Free Cash Flow Component 
Free cash flow equals net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant, and equipment, in each case in accordance with GAAP. 
Consideration of Performance Period 
As with the 2017 compensation program, the Compensation Committee elected a performance period of 18 months for the 2018 PBRSUs in order to more closely align the grant with stockholder advisory firm preferences and market practices and to further drive long-term performance. The Compensation Committee concluded that, in 2018, an 18-month performance period provided for changing perspectives within a long-term incentive award program in a highly cyclical business. 
The Compensation Committee has also considered the advantages and disadvantages of using absolute versus relative performance measures. The Compensation Committee considered that absolute measures, such as those utilized for the 2018 program (except for the market share component of the Multiplier), are consistent with stockholder expectations, allow for greater sense of control and influence by the executive, encourage motivation, and are consistent with the Company's cash flow and ability to pay. 
For 2019, the Compensation Committee decided to move to a 24-month performance period and to incorporate the use of a Relative TSR metric for long-term incentive awards granted under the Company's 2019 long-term incentive compensation awards. For a discussion of our 2019 long-term incentive program, see the "Long-Term Incentive Awards for 2019" subsection below in this CD&A.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  The actual value of each such award is disclosed in columns (h) and (j) of the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018 table below in this proxy statement and described in the footnotes to such table. The number of units granted was based on the closing stock price on the date of grant (March 5, 2018) of $24.46 per  share.  
[END TABLE]
In making determinations regarding target equity award levels, the Compensation Committee considered the CEO's recommendation as well as market information showing that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual grant value of the 2018 equity awards would vary from the market median for each of the Named Executive Officers  as follows: Mr. Jackson: +9%; Mr. Gutmann: +1%; Mr. Schromm: -8%; Mr. Hall: +12%; and Mr. Rolls: +40%.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Following the salary increases and increase in bonus opportunity described above and taking into account the 2018 equity  awards, target TDC variance from the market median for each of the Named Executive Officers would be as follows: Mr. Jackson: +11%; Mr. Gutmann: +2%; Mr. Schromm: +4%; Mr. Hall: -1%; and  Mr. Rolls: +37%.  
[END TABLE]
Generally, award amounts for each individual officer, and compensation variance from the market median based on the applicable benchmarking data, were based on the comparative data and other factors and processes discussed above, as well as on the individual considerations described below. In setting the amount of equity awards and other compensation for 2018, the Compensation Committee also considered the following for each Named Executive Officer: 
Keith D. Jackson. Mr. Jackson's target TDC was positioned above market (50th percentile). In determining Mr. Jackson's 2018 total pay package, the Compensation Committee considered Mr. Jackson's overall leadership of the Company, continued integration of the Fairchild acquisition, and the achievement of challenging 2017 EPS growth, revenue growth expectations, and continued gross margin improvements. The Company exceeded the Board-approved business plan goals and TSR expectations. The Compensation Committee recognizes that Mr. Jackson uses his deep understanding of the semiconductor industry to guide the Company successfully through mergers and acquisitions. We compensate Mr. Jackson to compete in a marketplace which is undergoing consolidation. We expect him to navigate difficult choices and pay him for accretive choices, such as the Fairchild acquisition, and we believe this compensation framework promotes sound decision-making and ensures that our primary selection criterion for our strategic acquisitions is enhancing value for stockholders. 
Bernard Gutmann. Mr. Gutmann's target TDC was positioned slightly above the market (50th percentile). Mr. Gutmann managed the Company's finances in an ever-changing global market, improved gross margins, increased free cash flow generation, managed expenses, paid down the Company's debt faster than expected, and executed strategic repurchases of ON Semiconductor shares during 2017. Mr. Gutmann's understanding of the semiconductor industry, financial leadership, and strong analytical and accounting skills allow him to positively contribute as the CFO. 
William A. Schromm. Mr. Schromm's target TDC was positioned at the market (50th percentile). Mr. Schromm demonstrated exemplary leadership in connection with the integration of Fairchild operations into ON Semiconductor. Mr. Schromm and his operations team launched several new IT platforms, dramatically improved factory performance, reduced manufacturing input costs, and achieved best-in-class quality metrics. 
William M. Hall. Mr. Hall's target TDC was positioned slightly below the market (50th percentile). Under Mr. Hall's leadership, the PSG organically grew revenue, gained market share, met aggressive gross margin goals, and continued the dramatic growth of the Power Integrated Modules business through new product development. 
Paul E. Rolls. Mr. Rolls' target TDC was positioned above the market (50th percentile). During 2017, the Sales and Marketing team under Mr. Rolls grew revenue and market share, exceeded annual revenue targets, and improved product pricing. The Compensation Committee recognizes Mr. Rolls' deep understanding of the semiconductor industry and vast knowledge of sales operations.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Compensation Committee's review of the individual performance of each Named Executive Officer is not formulaic. The factors outlined above were considered in conjunction with many others, including, but not limited to, the then-current business environment and business challenges, the safety of our employees, the quality of our environmental efforts, the retentive value of the total compensation package, and the cost of retention, all of which are taken into account in the course of making subjective judgments in determining final levels of executive compensation. 
See "Compensation of Executive Officers — 2018, 2017, and 2016 Awards of Equity — 2018 Awards of PBRSUs" and "— 2018 Awards of RSUs" below in this proxy statement for further description of the 2018 equity awards. We also disclose these awards in the Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement. The Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018 table, the Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018 table, and the 2018 Option Exercises and Stock Vested table also contain information about our long-term incentive awards to Named Executive Officers. 
Long-Term Incentive Awards for 2019. Based on its annual evaluation of the peer group held in August 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to remove NVIDIA from the peer group, as its revenue and market cap are outside the specified ranges (approximately 0.4 to 3 times the Company's revenue and approximately 0.33 to 3 times the Company's market capitalization), and to add Cree, Inc. 
In February 2019, the Compensation Committee approved changes to our annual long-term incentive program, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Revising the vehicle mix to focus more heavily on performance-based grants (i.e., the 2019 awards consist of 60% PBRSUs and  40% RSUs) to our Named Executive Officers other than Mr. Hall, who retired from the Company on March 8, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Extending the performance period to two years for the 2019 PBRSUs to be responsive to stockholder concerns and more  consistent with broader compensation trends. RSUs will continue to vest in equal annual amounts over a three-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Replacing the Multiplier award with a separate upside award tied to the long-term strategic goals of the Company. Certain  key employees, including Messrs. Jackson, Gutmann, Schromm, and Rolls, are eligible to earn additional PBRSUs ("Upside PBRSUs") if the Company exceeds the threshold levels for the following performance metrics: a revenue goal (weighted at  50%) and a relative TSR goal (weighted at 50%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adjusted EBITDA remains the base performance metric for the 2019 PBRSUs.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attainment of the goals will be established at the end of the performance period and will determine how many PBRSUs may  vest. If attainment meets or exceeds target for the PBRSUs, then 100% of the total award will vest.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee believes that these changes and, in particular, the ability to earn upside potential on the Upside PBRSUs, is consistent with market practices and will encourage management to accelerate the growth of the Company. 
Other Elements Affecting Compensation 
Severance and Change in Control Agreements. Under the ON Semiconductor Corporation 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2000 SIP") and the Amended and Restated Plan, the Board of Directors has discretion to accelerate equity-based vesting upon a "change in control" of the Company. In addition, with respect to our Named Executive Officers, our outstanding option agreements and RSU agreements generally contain provisions causing the unvested portion of the awards to vest upon a termination of employment without cause (including, if applicable, a deemed termination for good reason) within a two-year period after a change in control. Under the acceleration provisions of the PBRSU award agreements, if a change in control occurs prior to the end of the performance period for the award, the units that could vest will be based on the 
58     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Company's progress toward attainment of the performance goals as of the closing of the transaction or event resulting in the change in control. If the Company thereafter terminates the employee without cause or the employee resigns for good reason, a number of units will vest in an amount determined by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the employee was employed during the performance period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the performance period. If a change in control occurs after the end of the performance period, all units earned but not vested at that time will vest on the date of the employee's termination of employment. 
The severance and change in control provisions in the employment agreements with our Named Executive Officers provide that in the event that we terminated the employment of a Named Executive Officer within 24 months after a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable employment agreement), the executive would receive, in addition to other post-termination compensation each Named Executive Officer is entitled to under his employment agreement, an additional cash payment in an amount equal to: (i) in the case of Mr. Jackson, two times the target bonus for one year; and (ii) in the case of all other Named Executive Officers, the total target bonus for one year. For a description of the severance and change in control provisions of the employment agreements for our Named Executive Officers, see "Compensation of Executive Officers — Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements" and "Compensation of Executive Officers — Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control" below in this proxy statement. 
We believe that our severance benefits and change in control arrangements are aligned with existing market practices related to post-termination compensation and are consistent with the principal objectives of our compensation programs. To the extent a Named Executive Officer's agreement contains severance benefits or a change in control provision, such benefit is predicated upon the Named Executive Officer being terminated without "cause" or resigning for "good reason," as such terms are defined in the Named Executive Officer's employment agreement. In addition, our severance benefits are subject to the Named Executive Officer signing a general release and waiver and complying with certain restrictive covenants, including non-solicitation, confidentiality, and non-disparagement agreements, as well as non-competition or non-interference agreements, which serves the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
We believe that our management has played a crucial role in making us a successful company and it sends an important signal to the market and potential employees that we are willing to protect our management with some guaranteed compensation in the event of a termination after a change in control. In addition, management may be less inclined to resist change in control transactions that are in the best interests of our stockholders if they have the added security that comes with such change in control arrangements. 
Our change in control provisions do not include excise tax gross-ups. We examine our severance benefits and change in control arrangements on a regular basis. 
Generally Available Benefits and Retirement Plan. We do not offer executive retirement plans, pension benefits, or non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Instead, we provide our Named Executive Officers with opportunities to accumulate retirement income primarily through appreciation of their equity awards. 
Consistent with our pay-for-performance compensation philosophy, we do not provide our executive officers with significant perquisites. We strive to create a team-based environment, which is why the majority of our variable compensation is tied to team-based goals and the majority of our benefits are designed around broad-based employee participation. We have a few exceptions, which are selected for competitive purposes, including enhanced life insurance and annual financial planning services as described below. 
Executives are eligible to participate in benefit programs available to all of the Company's full-time employees. These programs, which are generally designed to provide competitive capital accumulation and other benefits, include a tax-qualified employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) savings plan, and medical, dental, disability, and life insurance programs. We also have a relocation program and provide a tax gross-up for certain benefits under this program that is available to all employees who enjoy the benefits of the 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     59 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis relocation policy. Other amounts may also be available for expatriate assignments. All employees receive mileage reimbursement if driving their own cars for Company business. An auto allowance of $1,200 per month is provided to each of our Named Executive Officers. 
In addition to benefits that provide for broad-based employee participation, we provide our executives limited perquisites that we believe help to maintain the competitiveness of our compensation package vis-à-vis our peer companies and provide value at a reasonable cost to the Company. These include enhanced coverage for life insurance (each executive receives life insurance coverage of $1,000,000, which is $500,000 above the maximum allowed standard coverage of two-times base salary that is afforded to all employees) and financial planning services (up to $10,000 per year). 
We describe the perquisites paid in 2018 to each of the Named Executive Officers in the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement. 
Impact of Taxation and Accounting Considerations on Executive Compensation 
Our Compensation Committee attempts to establish executive officer compensation programs that will allow related income tax deductions to the extent it determines that such actions are consistent with our compensation philosophy and in the best interests of our stockholders. 
Prior to the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Act"), for tax years beginning prior to December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), placed a $1 million limit on the amount of compensation the Company could deduct in any one year for compensation paid to our CEO and any of our three other most highly-compensated executive officers (excluding our CFO) unless the compensation payable qualified for the "performance-based compensation" exception to the limitations on the deduction of compensation imposed by Section 162(m). While the Compensation Committee has generally considered the deductibility of awards as a factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee has also consistently reserved the right to make compensation payments and awards that are not deductible pursuant to the "performance-based compensation" exception or otherwise when it believed such payments were in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
The Tax Act eliminated the "performance-based compensation" exemption for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, such that compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to binding written agreements that were in effect as of November 2, 2017 and are not materially modified thereafter. Due to ambiguities and uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of Section 162(m), as revised by the Tax Act, including the uncertain scope of the transition relief under the Tax Act, no assurance can be given that compensation intended to satisfy the requirements for exemption from Section 162(m) prior to the passage of the Tax Act will, in fact, satisfy such requirements. While the Compensation Committee considers deductibility of awards as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that stockholder interests are best served by not restricting the Compensation Committee's discretion and flexibility in administering compensation programs, even if such programs may result in non-deductible compensation expense. Further, the Compensation Committee reserves the right to amend compensation arrangements that were initially intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" if the Compensation Committee determines such amendments are in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Section 409A of the Code imposes an additional 20% federal income tax and penalties upon employees who receive "non-qualified deferred compensation" that does not comply with Section 409A. The Compensation Committee takes into account the impact of Section 409A in designing our executive plans and programs that provide for "non-qualified deferred compensation" and, as a general rule, these plans and programs are designed either to comply with the requirements of Section 409A or to qualify for an applicable exception to Section 409A so as to avoid possible adverse tax consequences that may result from failure to comply with Section 409A. We cannot, however, guarantee that the compensation will comply with the requirements of Section 409A or an applicable exception thereto. 
60     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Accounting considerations also play a role in the design of our executive compensation program. Accounting rules require us to expense the grant date fair values of our equity awards (that is, the value of our equity awards based on U.S. GAAP), which reduces the amount of our reported profits under U.S. GAAP. Because of this stock-based expensing and the impact of dilution to our stockholders, we closely monitor the number, share amounts, and the fair values of the equity awards that are granted each year. 
The Compensation Committee also takes into account other tax and accounting consequences of its total compensation program and weighs these factors when setting total compensation and determining the individual elements of an officer's compensation package. 
Other Matters Relating to Executive Compensation 
Hedging / Pledging Transactions. We have a comprehensive Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, prohibits our Named Executive Officers from engaging in hedging or monetization transactions with respect to our securities, including, but not limited to, short sales, buying or selling puts or calls, or similar derivative securities transactions, prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. We believe these transactions could give rise to a conflict of interest, which could negatively impact market perceptions about the Company and its Named Executive Officers. Our Named Executive Officers are also prohibited from any pledging or margin transactions with respect to our stock, including, but not limited to, holding our securities in a margin account or otherwise pledging such securities as collateral for a loan. Our other employees are also encouraged to adhere to these rules. 
Equity Award Policy. In 2006, we adopted an equity award grant date policy statement (the "Equity Award Policy"). Under the Equity Award Policy, equity grants under our stock incentive plans generally become effective on the first Monday (or next following trading day if the first Monday is not a trading day) of the next month following the date of Board, Compensation Committee, or CEO approval of the grant. From time to time, the Compensation Committee may approve an exception to the Equity Award Policy in its discretion. Options granted are priced at the closing market value on the date of grant. We generally make our annual equity awards to executives in the first quarter of each year. The Company does not have a practice of timing grants of stock-based awards to coordinate with the release of material information to the market. 
Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines for Officers. Under the Principles, executives holding the title of Senior Vice President or above are encouraged to hold our common stock in an amount equal to one to six times the officer's base salary. The holdings and transition period guidelines are described under "The Board of Directors and Corporate Governance — Corporate Governance Principles — Directors' and Officers' Stock Ownership and Retention Guidelines" above. As of March 8, 2019, all of our Named Executive Officers were in compliance with the guidelines. 
Clawback Policy. In 2014, we adopted a clawback policy. The policy requires the Company to seek to recover any incentive-based compensation awards and payments made to any covered person in the event that: (i) the Company is required to prepare a financial restatement resulting from material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirements under the federal securities laws, which restatement would have resulted in payment of a lesser incentive as determined by the Board of Directors; (ii) there has occurred any intentional misconduct by the covered person that is materially injurious to the Company; or (iii) there has occurred any breach by the covered person of any material provision in his or her employment agreement with the Company or in any other agreement with the Company that contains non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure, or non-disparagement provisions applicable to the covered person. A "covered person" is any current or former Senior Vice President, Executive Vice President, or Chief Executive Officer, or any other person as determined by the Board in its sole discretion. 
The compensation to be recovered pursuant to this policy is limited to any award or payment made under any incentive-based compensation plan, including any corporate bonus plan and any RSUs, PBRSUs, stock options, or other form of equity award, made or paid by the Company during the applicable recovery period. In 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     61 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis the case of any intentional misconduct or breach of a key agreement, the full amount of the award or payment would be recoverable. In the case of a restatement, the amount subject to recovery would be the difference between the amount granted or paid and the amount that should have been granted or paid based on the restatement as determined by the Board of Directors. 
The applicable recovery period for an accounting restatement is the three-year period preceding the date on which the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement (determined in accordance with any applicable law, regulation, or interpretation, or otherwise by the Board of Directors), which restatement would have resulted in payment of a lesser incentive as determined by the Board of Directors. With respect to intentional misconduct or breach of a key agreement, the applicable recovery period is the three-year period preceding the date on which the Board of Directors determines that these triggers exist. With respect to stock options that have been exercised, the Company will be entitled to recover: (i) the gross number of shares for which the option was exercised or the value thereof on the date of exercise; and (ii) any profit made by the covered person upon any sale of such shares. The amount of any recoupment will be the gross amount of the award or payment without taking into account any withholdings for tax or other amounts. The form of recoupment may be from future compensation, forfeiture of outstanding equity awards, direct repayment by the affected individual(s), or any combination of the foregoing at the discretion of the Board of Directors and subject to applicable law. 
In the award agreements for the 2018 PBRSU awards, we added additional clawback language that allows the Company to require the grantee to forfeit all or a portion of any unvested 2018 PBRSUs and any shares of stock delivered pursuant to the grant agreement if: (i) the grantee's employment is terminated for Cause (as defined in the grantee's employment agreement, or, if the grantee has no employment agreement, in the Amended and Restated Plan); or (ii) the Compensation Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, determines that the grantee engaged in serious misconduct that results or might reasonably be expected to result in financial or reputational harm to the Company.

      The amounts in this column do not necessarily represent the fair value for expensing purposes or the fair value of awards  which were expected to vest as of December 31, 2018. As of March 7, 2019, 200% of the PBRSUs awarded on March 7, 2016 were vested pursuant to the relevant award agreement, which amount takes into account the vesting of the Multiplier  Shares in addition to the Base Grant Shares. As of February 14, 2019, 200% of the PBRSUs awarded on March 6, 2017 are expected to vest by the final vesting date pursuant to the relevant award agreement, which amount takes into account the  vesting of the Multiplier Shares in addition to the Base Grant Shares. As of February 14, 2019, 150% of the PBRSUs awarded on March 5, 2018 are expected to vest by the final vesting date pursuant to the relevant award agreement, which  amount takes into account the expected vesting of the Multiplier Shares in addition to the Base Grant Shares. The estimated number of units which are expected to vest is evaluated and adjusted each reporting period, as necessary, in connection with  the Company's quarterly and annual financial statements.

(3)  This column represents PBRSU awards made in 2018. The amounts in the "Threshold" column (f) represent the  minimum number of units that would vest, if any, under the award agreements for the 2018 PBRSUs, assuming that certain threshold performance measure(s) are not exceeded. The amounts in the "Target" column (g) represent the total  number of Base Grant Shares, assuming that all performance goals are achieved and therefore all units would vest, but without inclusion of any Multiplier Shares. The amounts in the "Maximum" column (h) represent the total number of  units granted, assuming that all performance goals are achieved for both the base grant and the Multiplier and, therefore, that all Base Grant Shares and Multiplier Shares would vest. The PBRSUs vest in equal amounts over two consecutive 18-month periods, provided that the Company exceeds the threshold performance goal. If the performance measure for the PBRSUs that is achieved exceeds the threshold level, but is less than the target level, the  potential base grant amount would be determined based on linear interpolation from threshold to target. If the performance measure that is achieved equals or exceeds the target level, the amount of Multiplier Shares is determined based on linear  interpolation up to an additional 100% of the base grant based on additional performance goals. One-half of such amount would vest at the end of the first 18-month  period and an additional one-half of such amount would vest on the third anniversary of the grant date based solely on the passage of time, assuming that the officer remains employed on such date (subject to  certain exceptions in the event of a change in control of the Company). If the performance measure that is achieved equals or is less than the threshold performance level, the entire award will be canceled. These awards were made under the Amended  and Restated Plan and are described in the CD&A under "Elements of our Compensation Program — Long-Term Incentives" and below under "2018, 2017, and 2016 Awards of Equity — 2018 Awards of PBRSUs."

The grant  date fair value for RSUs and PBRSUs is derived using the closing price on the date of grant. The valuation for PBRSUs is based upon the probable outcome of the performance conditions underlying the PBRSUs (including the Multiplier Shares),  consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures.

2018, 2017, and 2016 Awards of Equity 
Below is a summary of the 2018, 2017, and 2016 awards of PBRSUs and other equity awards. For additional information regarding equity awards, see the CD&A under "Elements of Our Compensation Program — Long-Term Incentives" in this proxy statement. 
2018 Awards of Equity 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee approved annual long-term incentive grants to the Named Executive Officers. As in 2017, the Compensation Committee granted awards to each Named Executive Officer consisting of one-half PBRSUs and one-half RSUs. Subject to the Multiplier described below, the Compensation Committee granted: Mr. Jackson 122,650 PBRSUs and 122,650 RSUs; Mr. Gutmann 38,839 PBRSUs and 38,839 RSUs; Mr. Schromm 44,972 PBRSUs and 44,972 RSUs; Mr. Hall 26,574 PBRSUs and 26,574 RSUs; and Mr. Rolls 28,619 PBRSUs and 28,619 RSUs. 
2018 Awards of PBRSUs. Each PBRSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Plan and the applicable award agreement. The 2018 PBRSUs are designed to vest in two equal amounts (tranches), subject to exceeding the threshold level for the performance goal. Vesting of one-half of the PBRSUs ("Tranche 1") is based upon achievement of the performance goal during the 18-month period starting on January 1, 2018 and ending at the close of the second financial quarter of 2019 (the "2018 PBRSU Performance Period"). The Tranche 1 vesting amount will equal one-half of the total PBRSUs for the grantee multiplied by the attainment percentage. If the performance measure for the 2018 PBRSUs is achieved above the threshold level, the remaining PBRSUs ("Tranche 2") (in an amount equal to the units that actually vested in Tranche 1) would then vest based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the grant date if the officer remains employed on that date, subject to certain change in control provisions described below. If the threshold performance goal is not exceeded, the entire award would be canceled. 
The applicable performance measures for the 2018 PBRSUs are as follows and include straight-line interpolation between threshold and target Adjusted EBITDA: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Measurement Period       Performance Goal:   Adjusted EBITDA     
   Measurement Period       Performance Goal:   Adjusted EBITDA     
   Measurement Period       Performance Goal:   Adjusted EBITDA     
 2018 PBRSU Performance Period        Threshold – $1,600 million      
         Target – $2,000 million      
[END TABLE]
As in prior years, the 2018 PBRSU awards include a Multiplier for certain key individuals, including the Named Executive Officers. Once the target performance goal for Adjusted EBITDA is achieved or exceeded for the PBRSUs, the Multiplier opens and achievement of the Multiplier goals as follows determines the payout:

We describe the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the 2018 PBRSUs above in the CD&A under the heading "Elements of Our Compensation Program — Long-Term Incentives." 
Except as described below, if the grantee terminates employment with us for any reason, any unvested 2018 PBRSUs will be canceled and forfeited. Pursuant to the 2018 PBRSU award agreements, if a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Plan) occurs prior to the end of the 2018 PBRSU Performance Period, the units that could vest would be based on the Company's progress toward attainment of the performance goals as of the closing of the transaction or event resulting in the Change in Control. If the Company thereafter terminates the employee without cause or the employee resigns for good reason, a number of units will vest in an amount determined by multiplying the number of units that could vest (as described above) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the employee was employed during the 2018 PBRSU Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the 2018 PBRSU Performance Period. If a Change in Control occurs after the end of the 2018 PBRSU Performance Period, but before the vesting date, and, thereafter, the Company terminates the employee without cause or the employee resigns for good reason, the units earned but not vested at that time will immediately vest. 
The Company has filed a form of award agreement for the 2018 PBRSUs as an exhibit to its filings under the Exchange Act. 
2018 Awards of RSUs. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement. 
The 2018 awards of RSUs vest annually in equal amounts over a three-year period on each anniversary of the grant date through March 5, 2021. Compensation Committee approval is not required for vesting. However, subject to certain limitations, if a NEO terminates his or her employment or otherwise ceases to perform services for us for any reason, including upon a termination for Cause, as such term is defined in the NEO's employment agreement, any units that are not vested will be canceled and forfeited as of the date of termination of employment or service. 
If a NEO's employment is terminated without Cause (including a deemed termination for Good Reason), as such terms are defined in the NEO's employment agreement, within two years following a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Plan), any previously unvested RSUs will vest.

2017 Awards of Equity 
In February 2017, the Compensation Committee approved annual long-term incentive grants to the Named Executive Officers. As in 2016, the Compensation Committee granted awards to each Named Executive

Compensation of Executive Officers 
Officer consisting of one-half PBRSUs and one-half RSUs. Subject to the Multiplier described below, the Compensation Committee granted: Mr. Jackson 163,827 PBRSUs and 163,827 RSUs; Mr. Gutmann 58,978 PBRSUs and 58,978 RSUs; Mr. Schromm 58,978 PBRSUs and 58,978 RSUs; Mr. Hall 42,596 PBRSUs and 42,596 RSUs; and Mr. Rolls 39,319 PBRSUs and 39,319 RSUs. 
2017 Awards of PBRSUs. Each PBRSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Plan and the applicable award agreement. The 2017 PBRSUs are designed to vest in two equal amounts (tranches), subject to exceeding the threshold level for the performance goal. Vesting of one-half of the PBRSUs under Tranche 1 was based upon achievement of the performance goal during the 18-month period starting on January 1, 2017 and ending at the close of the second financial quarter of 2018 (the "2017 PBRSU Performance Period"). The Tranche 1 vesting amount was to equal one-half of the total PBRSUs for the grantee multiplied by the attainment percentage. If the performance measure for the 2017 PBRSUs was achieved above the threshold level, the remaining Tranche 2 PBRSUs (in an amount equal to the units that actually vested in Tranche 1) would then vest based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the grant date if the officer remains employed on that date, subject to certain change in control provisions described below. If the threshold performance goal was not exceeded, the entire award would be canceled. 
The applicable performance measures for the 2017 PBRSUs were as follows and included straight-line interpolation between threshold and target Adjusted EBITDA: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  Measurement Period               Performance Goal:           Adjusted EBITDA   
  Measurement Period               Performance Goal:           Adjusted EBITDA   
 2017 PBRSU Performance Period        Threshold – $1,220 million      
         Target – $1,525 million      
[END TABLE]
As in prior years, the 2017 PBRSU awards included a Multiplier for certain key individuals, including the Named Executive Officers. Once the target performance goal for Adjusted EBITDA was achieved or exceeded for the PBRSUs, the Multiplier opened and achievement of the Multiplier goals as follows determined the payout:

[END TABLE]
Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period was $1,795 million, resulting in an attainment level of 100% and the opening of the Multiplier. The market share component of the Multiplier (weighted 50%) 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     69 
Compensation of Executive Officers was achieved at 7.58%, and the free cash flow component of the Multiplier (weighted 50%) was achieved at $950.7 million, resulting in an attainment level of 100% and the vesting of the following amounts (including Base Grant Shares and Multiplier Shares) for the first tranche of the 2017 PBRSUs: Mr. Jackson: 163,827; Mr. Gutmann: 58,978; Mr. Schromm: 58,978; Mr. Hall: 42,596; and Mr. Rolls: 39,319. An equal amount will vest on the third anniversary of the grant date if the executive remains employed on that date, subject to certain change in control provisions described below. 
For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 PBRSU awards, non-GAAP net income excluded the following items: impact for the conversion of accounting from sell-through to sell-in, as measured in the quarter that the conversion occurs; restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; interest expense and interest income; income tax benefit; acquisition related costs; net income attributable to non-controlling interests; depreciation and amortization; actuarial gains or losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; gain or loss on acquisitions and divestitures; gain or loss on debt repurchase, debt exchange, early extinguishment of debt, etc.; expensing of inventory fair market value step up; and unusual/non-recurring material items. However, in the 2017 program, an adjustment for unusual or non-recurring material items could only be made to reduce rather than increase an award that is intended to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception of Section 162(m) of the Code. Subject to certain limitations, the Compensation Committee has the authority to determine that an alternate method to determine Adjusted EBITDA would be more appropriate to achieve the objectives of the award. 
Except as described below, if the grantee terminates employment with us for any reason, any unvested 2017 PBRSUs will be canceled and forfeited. Pursuant to the 2017 PBRSU award agreements, if a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Plan) would have occurred prior to the end of the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period, the units eligible for vesting would have been based on the Company's progress toward attainment of the performance goals as of the closing of the transaction or event resulting in the Change in Control. If the Company thereafter would have terminated the employee during the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period without cause, or if the employee had resigned during the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period for good reason, a number of units would have vested in an amount determined by multiplying the number of units that could have vested (as described above) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days the employee was employed during the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period and the denominator of which is the total number of days in the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period. If a Change in Control occurs after the end of the 2017 PBRSU Performance Period, but before the vesting date, and, thereafter, the Company terminates the employee without cause or the employee resigns for good reason, the units earned but not vested at that time will immediately vest.

2017 Awards of RSUs. Each RSU represents the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the award agreement. 
The 2017 awards of RSUs vest annually in equal amounts over a three-year period on each anniversary of the grant date through March 6, 2020. Compensation Committee approval is not required for vesting. However, subject to certain limitations, if a NEO terminates his or her employment or otherwise ceases to perform services for us for any reason, including upon a termination for Cause, as such term is defined in the NEO's employment agreement, any units that are not vested will be canceled and forfeited as of the date of termination of employment or service.

2016 Awards of Equity 
In February 2016, the Compensation Committee approved annual long-term incentive grants to the Named Executive Officers. The Compensation Committee granted awards to each Named Executive Officer consisting of one-half PBRSUs and one-half RSUs. Subject to the Multiplier described below, the Compensation Committee granted: Mr. Jackson 255,272 PBRSUs and 255,272 RSUs; Mr. Gutmann 77,692 PBRSUs and 77,692 RSUs; Mr. Schromm 94,340 PBRSUs and 94,340 RSUs; Mr. Hall 72,143 PBRSUs and 72,143 RSUs; and Mr. Rolls 63,818 PBRSUs and 63,818 RSUs. 
2016 Awards of PBRSUs. Each PBRSU represented the right to receive one share of the Company's common stock, subject to the terms and conditions of the Amended and Restated Plan and the applicable award agreement. The 2016 PBRSUs were designed to vest in two equal amounts (tranches), subject to exceeding the threshold level for the performance goal. Vesting of the Tranche 1 PBRSUs was based upon achievement of the performance goal during the 18-month period starting on January 1, 2016 and ending at the close of the second financial quarter of 2017 (the "2016 PBRSU Performance Period"). The Tranche 1 vesting amount was to equal one-half of the total base grant units for the grantee multiplied by the attainment percentage. If the performance measure for the 2016 PBRSUs was achieved above the threshold level, the Tranche 2 amount (equal to the units that actually vested in Tranche 1) would then vest based solely on the passage of time on the third anniversary of the grant date if the officer remains employed on that date, subject to certain change in control provisions described below. If the Tranche 1 threshold was not exceeded, the entire award would be canceled. 
The applicable performance measures for the 2016 PBRSUs were as follows and included straight-line interpolation between threshold and target Adjusted EBITDA:

[END TABLE]
The Company added a Multiplier to the PBRSU awards for certain key individuals, including the Named Executive Officers.

Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 PBRSU Performance Period was $1,270.5 million, resulting in achievement of an attainment level of 100% and the opening of the Multiplier. The market share growth component of the Multiplier (weighted 60%) was achieved at 8.25% and the revenue growth component of the Multiplier (weighted 40%) was achieved at $6,682 million, resulting in an attainment level of 100% and the vesting of the following amounts (including Base Grant Shares and Multiplier Shares) for the first tranche of the 2016 PBRSUs: Mr. Jackson: 255,272; Mr. Gutmann: 77,692; Mr. Schromm: 94,340; Mr. Hall: 72,143; and Mr. Rolls: 63,818. An equal amount vested on the anniversary of the grant date in 2019 for each of these Named Executive Officers. 
For purposes of calculating Adjusted EBITDA for the 2016 PBRSU awards, non-GAAP net income generally included stock compensation expense and 2016 acquisition activity and excluded: restructuring, asset impairments and other, net; goodwill and intangible asset impairment; interest expense and interest income; income tax benefit; acquisition related costs; net income attributable to non-controlling interests; depreciation and amortization; actuarial gains or losses on pension plans and other pension benefits; gain or loss on acquisitions; gain or loss on debt repurchase, debt exchange, early extinguishment of debt, etc.; expensing of inventory fair market value step up; acquisition financing related cost; acquisition related break-up fees (incurred or owed to the Company); and unusual/non-recurring material items. 
Except as described below, if the grantee had terminated employment with us for any reason, any unvested 2016 PBRSUs would have been canceled and forfeited. Pursuant to the 2016 PBRSU award agreements, if a Change in Control (as such term is defined in the Amended and Restated Plan) would have occurred prior to the end of the 2016 PBRSU Performance Period, the units eligible for vesting would have been based on the Company's progress toward attainment of the performance goals as of the closing of the transaction or event resulting in the Change in Control.

Compensation of Executive Officers 
Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements 
We currently have employment agreements with each of our Named Executive Officers. Each of the employment agreements originally entitled the officer to a base salary and to a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plan, subject to Board review from time to time or additional Board action. The employment agreements also generally provide for certain payments or benefits in the event of the termination of employment of the executive in various circumstances, including after a "Change in Control." Unless otherwise specified in the description of the particular employment agreement, "Change in Control" has the meaning given in the Amended and Restated Plan. Generally, the Amended and Restated Plan defines "Change in Control" to mean the occurrence of any of the following events: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(i)  any sale, lease, exchange, or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions) of assets of the  Company that has a gross fair market value of 85% or more of the total gross fair market value of all of the assets of the Company immediately prior to the transaction (or the first transaction in a series of related transactions) to any Person (as  defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) or group of related persons for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act (a "Group"), together with any affiliates thereof;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(ii)  the consummation of any plan or proposal for the liquidation or dissolution of the Company;

(iii)  any Person or Group shall become the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of shares representing more than 25% of  the aggregate voting power of the issued and outstanding stock entitled to vote in the election of directors (the "Voting Stock") of the Company and such Person or Group has the power and authority to vote such shares;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(iv)  the actual replacement of a majority of the Board over a two-year period from the  individual directors who constituted the Board at the beginning of such period, and such replacement shall not have been approved by a vote of at least a majority of the Board then still in office who either were members of such Board at the  beginning of such period or whose election as a member of such Board was previously so approved;

Mr. Jackson 
We entered into an employment agreement with Keith D. Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, effective November 19, 2002, and amended from time to time, most recently on June 1, 2017. The employment agreement for Mr. Jackson is automatically renewed each year for successive one-year periods unless either party provides notice of non-renewal in accordance with the employment agreement. The employment agreement, subject to Compensation Committee action and review from time to time, entitles Mr. Jackson to a base salary and sets a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plans. The employment agreement also provides Mr. Jackson with a monthly car allowance of up to $1,200. 
The employment agreement requires us to make specified payments to Mr. Jackson if his employment is terminated under various circumstances, including a termination without "Cause" or if he resigns for "Good Reason." "Cause" is defined to mean: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach by Mr. Jackson of the employment agreement after notice and a reasonable period of time (not to  exceed 30 days) to cure the breach;  
[END TABLE]
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     75 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the failure by Mr. Jackson to reasonably and substantially perform his duties under the employment agreement, other  than as a result of physical or mental illness or injury, after notice and a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) to cure the failure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to us; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the commission of a felony or other serious crime involving moral turpitude.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach of the employment agreement by us; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material diminution of Mr. Jackson's duties and responsibilities under the employment agreement;   
[END TABLE]
in each case after providing us with notice and a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) to cure the breach or diminution. The employment agreement treats Mr. Jackson's resignation for Good Reason as a termination by us without Cause. Generally, payments under the employment agreement upon termination of employment are subject to certain provisions intended to comply with the restrictions and limitations of Section 409A of the Code. 
Under his employment agreement, if Mr. Jackson's employment is terminated without Cause or if he resigns for Good Reason, he will be entitled to receive accrued and unused vacation and base salary through the date of termination and additional payments of base salary at the rate in effect as of the termination date for a period of two years. We will pay the additional base salary in installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices, beginning with the first payroll period immediately following the date on which the general release and waiver described below becomes irrevocable. The amount of payments during the six-month period following the date of termination shall not exceed the separation pay exception limitation amount set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) and any amount that is payable during such six-month period that is in excess of the separation pay exception limitation shall be paid in a single lump sum on the first day of the seventh month after the date of Mr. Jackson's separation from service or, if earlier, the date of his death following such separation from service (the "Delayed Payment Date"). If the Company determines in good faith that the separation pay exception set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) does not apply as of the date of termination, the amount set forth above shall be paid: (i) in an initial lump sum equal to six months' base salary (net of applicable taxes and withholdings) on the Delayed Payment Date; and (ii) thereafter in installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices in effect from time to time. To receive these payments, Mr. Jackson must execute a general release and waiver, waiving all claims he may have against us and the waiver must not have been revoked within a specified period for revocation. In addition, Mr. Jackson must comply with the non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants in the employment agreement. The non-solicitation and non-compete covenants are effective for a period of two years following Mr. Jackson's termination. The confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants do not provide for a specific termination date. The agreement requires Mr. Jackson to seek comparable employment upon such termination, and the termination amount that we must pay will be offset by any amounts he earns from other comparable employment during the two-year payment period. 
In the event of Mr. Jackson's death or disability, the employment agreement requires us to pay him accrued but unused vacation, accrued but unpaid base salary, any bonus earned with respect to the performance cycle ending immediately prior to the date of termination, and an amount equal to the bonus he earned in the year immediately preceding the date of termination times the percentage of the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs that has passed prior to his termination. Amounts for such bonus payments are to be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records of the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain limitations. 
If Mr. Jackson's employment is terminated without "Cause" or he resigns for "Good Reason" within 24 months following a "Change in Control," as defined in the Amended and Restated Plan, in addition to the other benefits provided in his employment agreement, we will provide continuation of medical benefits for the

Compensation of Executive Officers greater of two years after the date of termination or the remainder of Mr. Jackson's employment period (assuming no automatic extension) at the same cost and coverage level as in effect prior to the termination, subject to broad-based changes in cost or coverage level that apply to other employees. In addition, Mr. Jackson would be entitled to an additional amount equal to two times his total annual target bonus under our bonus program in effect as of the date of termination, or if bonuses are paid semi-annually, four times his target bonus for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs, payable as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records of the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain limitations. The employment agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that we and Mr. Jackson comply with the excise tax provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, including that we will be responsible for retaining and paying a law firm, certified public accounting firm, or executive compensation consultant to make any necessary calculations and determinations relating to such compliance. 
If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause or voluntarily by the executive other than for Good Reason, the Company will pay the executive or his estate accrued but unused vacation and base salary through the date of termination. 
Mr. Gutmann 
We entered into an employment agreement with Bernard Gutmann, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer, dated as of September 26, 2012, as amended from time to time, most recently on June 1, 2017. The agreement does not have a specified termination date and, subject to Compensation Committee action and review from time to time, entitles Mr. Gutmann to a base salary and sets a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plans. In addition, the employment agreement entitles Mr. Gutmann to a monthly car allowance of $1,200 and the reimbursement of up to $10,000 of financial planning expenses annually. 
The employment agreement also requires us to make specified payments to Mr. Gutmann if his employment is terminated under various circumstances, including a termination without "Cause" or if he resigns for "Good Reason." "Cause" is defined to mean: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach by Mr. Gutmann of the employment agreement;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the failure by Mr. Gutmann to reasonably and substantially perform his duties under the employment agreement (other  than as a result of physical or mental illness or injury);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Gutmann's willful misconduct or gross negligence which is materially injurious to us; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the commission by Mr. Gutmann of a felony or other serious crime involving moral turpitude.  
[END TABLE]
In the case of the first two events above, we must provide notice to Mr. Gutmann indicating in reasonable detail the events or circumstances that we believe constitute Cause and, if such breach or failure is reasonably susceptible to cure, provide Mr. Gutmann with a reasonable period of time (not to exceed 30 days) to cure such breach or failure. 
"Good Reason" means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach of the employment agreement by us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• without Mr. Gutmann's written consent, reducing his salary, as in effect immediately prior to such reduction,  while at the same time not proportionately reducing the salaries of the other comparable officers of the Company; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• without Mr. Gutmann's written consent, a material and continued diminution of his duties and responsibilities  hereunder, unless he is provided with comparable duties and responsibilities in a comparable position (i.e., a position of equal or greater duties and responsibilities).  
[END TABLE]
In the case of any of the events above, Mr. Gutmann must notify us within 30 days after the event or events which he believes constitute Good Reason and describe in such notice in reasonable detail such event or events and provide us a 30-day period after delivery of such notice to cure such breach or diminution. 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     77 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
If we terminate Mr. Gutmann's employment without "Cause," or if he resigns for "Good Reason," we are required to pay him: (i) accrued and unused vacation; (ii) base salary through Mr. Gutmann's date of termination (to the extent not previously paid); (iii) continued payments of base salary for 12 months after the date of termination; (iv) any earned but unpaid bonus for the immediately preceding performance cycle; and (v) a pro-rata portion of the bonus, if any, for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria. The amount described in clause (iii) above is to be paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices beginning with the first payroll period immediately following the date on which the general release and waiver described below becomes irrevocable. The amount of payments during the six-month period following the date of termination shall not exceed the severance pay exception limitation amount set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) and any amount that is payable during such six-month period that is in excess of the separation pay exception limitation shall be paid in a single lump sum on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination. If the Company determines in good faith that the separation pay exception set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) does not apply as of the date of termination, the amount set forth in clause (iii) shall be paid: (a) in an initial lump sum equal to six months' base salary (net of applicable taxes and withholdings) on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination; and (b) thereafter in installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices. The amounts set forth in (iv) and (v) above shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records for the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the employment agreement. We must also pay Mr. Gutmann's health plan continuation premiums for up to one year following termination, and he would be entitled to six months of outplacement assistance at a cost of up to $5,000. To receive these payments, Mr. Gutmann must execute (and not revoke) a general release and waiver, waiving all claims he may have against us. The employment agreement also requires the executive to comply with the non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants in his employment agreement, subject to certain exceptions regarding communication with governmental agencies. The non-solicitation and non-compete covenants are effective for a period of one year following Mr. Gutmann's termination. The confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants do not provide for a specific termination date. 
If Mr. Gutmann's employment is terminated without "Cause" or for "Good Reason" within 24 months after a "Change in Control," as defined in the Amended and Restated Plan, in addition to the other benefits provided in his employment agreement, and notwithstanding any provision in the applicable award agreement, any outstanding but unvested stock options and any RSUs that were granted either on or before the date he signed his employment agreement or in connection with his promotion to be our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will vest and all such options (vested and unvested) will remain exercisable until the first to occur of: (i) one year after the date of termination; and (ii) either the 10th anniversary or seventh anniversary of the grant date of the options depending upon what the relevant option grant agreement specifies with regard to an option's term or expiration date, subject to certain restrictions under Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Mr. Gutmann would be entitled to an additional amount equal to his total annual target bonus under our bonus program in effect as of the date of termination, or if bonuses are paid semi-annually, two times his target bonus for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs. Such amount shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records of the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain limitations. The employment agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that we and Mr. Gutmann comply with the excise tax provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, including that we will be responsible for retaining and paying a law firm, certified public accounting firm, or executive compensation consultant to make any necessary calculations and determinations relating to such compliance. 
If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, voluntarily by the executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of his death or disability, the Company will pay the executive or his estate accrued but unused vacation and base salary through the date of termination.

Compensation of Executive Officers 
Mr. Schromm 
We entered into an employment agreement with William A. Schromm, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, dated as of August 25, 2014, as amended on June 1, 2017. The agreement does not have a specified termination date and, subject to Compensation Committee action and review from time to time, entitles Mr. Schromm to a base salary and sets a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plans. The employment agreement further entitles Mr. Schromm to a monthly car allowance of $1,200 and the reimbursement of up to $10,000 of financial planning expenses annually. 
The employment agreement also requires us to make specified payments to Mr. Schromm if his employment is terminated under various circumstances, including a termination without "Cause" or if he resigns for "Good Reason." Mr. Schromm's employment agreement has the same definitions of "Cause" and "Good Reason" as in Mr. Gutmann's employment agreement described above. 
If we terminate Mr. Schromm's employment without "Cause," or if he resigns for "Good Reason," we are required to pay him: (i) accrued and unused vacation; (ii) base salary through Mr. Schromm's date of termination (to the extent not previously paid); (iii) continued payments of base salary for 12 months after the date of termination; (iv) any earned but unpaid bonus for the immediately preceding performance cycle; and (v) a pro-rata portion of the bonus, if any, for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs (based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria). The amount described in clause (iii) above is to be paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices beginning with the first payroll period immediately following the date on which the general release and waiver described below becomes irrevocable. The amount of payments during the six-month period following the date of termination shall not exceed the severance pay exception limitation amount set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) and any amount that is payable during such six-month period that is in excess of the separation pay exception limitation shall be paid in a single lump sum on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination. If the Company determines in good faith that the separation pay exception set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) does not apply as of the date of termination, the amount set forth in clause (iii) shall be paid: (a) in an initial lump sum equal to six months' base salary (net of applicable taxes and withholdings) on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination; and (b) thereafter in installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices. The amounts set forth in (iv) and (v) above shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records for the Company for the relevant performance period at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the employment agreement. We must also pay Mr. Schromm's health plan continuation premiums for up to one year following termination, and he would be entitled to up to six months of outplacement assistance at a cost of up to $5,000. To receive these payments, Mr. Schromm must execute (and not revoke) a general release and waiver, waiving all claims he may have against us, and comply with the non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants in his employment agreement, subject to certain exceptions regarding communication with governmental agencies. The non-solicitation and non-compete covenants are effective for a period of one year following Mr. Schromm's termination. The confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants do not provide for a specific termination date. 
If Mr. Schromm's employment is terminated without "Cause" or for "Good Reason" within two years after a "Change in Control," as defined in the Amended and Restated Plan, in addition to the other benefits provided in his employment agreement, and notwithstanding any provision in the applicable award agreement, any outstanding but unvested stock options and any time-based RSUs that were granted on or before the date he signed his employment agreement, or in connection with Mr. Schromm's promotion to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, will vest and all such options (vested and unvested) will remain exercisable until the first to occur of: (i) one year after the date of termination; and (ii) either the 10th anniversary or the seventh anniversary of the grant date of such options, depending upon what the relevant option grant agreement specifies with regard to an option's term or expiration date, subject to certain restrictions under Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Mr. Schromm would be entitled to an additional amount equal to his total annual target bonus under our bonus program in effect as of the date of termination, 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     79 
Compensation of Executive Officers or if bonuses are paid semi-annually, two times his target bonus for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs. Such amount shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records of the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain limitations. The employment agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that we and Mr. Schromm comply with the excise tax provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, including that we will be responsible for retaining and paying a law firm, certified public accounting firm, or executive compensation consultant to make any necessary calculations and determinations relating to such compliance. 
If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, voluntarily by the executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of his death or disability, the Company will pay the executive or his estate accrued but unused vacation and base salary through the date of termination. 
Mr. Hall 
We entered into an employment agreement with William M. Hall, our former Executive Vice President and General Manager, Power Solutions Group, dated as of April 23, 2006, and amended from time to time, most recently on June 1, 2017. The agreement does not have a specified termination date and, subject to Compensation Committee action and review from time to time, entitles Mr. Hall to a base salary and sets a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plans. The employment agreement further entitles Mr. Hall to a monthly car allowance of $1,200 and the reimbursement of up to $10,000 of financial planning expenses annually. 
Mr. Hall retired from the Company on March 8, 2019. Upon his retirement, Mr. Hall was entitled under his employment agreement to payment of accrued but unused vacation and any unpaid base salary through the date of his retirement. Mr. Hall's employment agreement provides that, for a period of at least one year following his retirement, he may not solicit or hire employees or become employed by or engaged in, or otherwise service, any Competitive Business of the Company, as such term is defined in his employment agreement. In addition, Mr. Hall is forever prohibited from using or disclosing any of the Company's Confidential Information, as such term is defined in his employment agreement, subject to certain exceptions regarding communication with governmental agencies, or unlawfully defaming or disparaging the Company. 
Mr. Rolls 
We entered into an employment agreement with Paul Rolls, our Executive Vice President, Sales & Marketing, effective July 14, 2013, and amended on June 1, 2017. The agreement does not have a specified termination date and, subject to Compensation Committee action and review from time to time, entitles Mr. Rolls to a base salary and sets a target percentage of base salary for purposes of our cash incentive plans. The employment agreement further entitles Mr. Rolls to a monthly car allowance of $1,200 and the reimbursement of up to $10,000 of financial planning expenses annually. 
The employment agreement also requires us to make specified payments to Mr. Rolls if his employment is terminated under various circumstances, including a termination without "Cause" or if he resigns for "Good Reason." Mr. Rolls' employment agreement has the same definition of "Cause" and "Good Reason" as in Mr. Gutmann's employment agreement described above. 
If we terminate Mr. Rolls' employment without "Cause," or if he resigns for "Good Reason," we are required to pay him: (i) accrued and unused vacation; (ii) base salary through Mr. Rolls' date of termination (to the extent not previously paid); (iii) continued payments of base salary for twelve months after the date of termination; (iv) any earned but unpaid bonus for the immediately preceding performance cycle; and (v) a pro-rata portion of the bonus, if any, for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs (based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria). The amount described in clause (iii) above is to be paid in accordance with our normal payroll practices beginning with the first payroll period immediately following the date on

The amount of payments during the six-month period following the date of termination shall not exceed the severance pay exception limitation amount set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii)(A) and any amount that is payable during such six-month period that is in excess of the separation pay exception limitation shall be paid in a single lump sum on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination. If the Company determines in good faith that the separation pay exception set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) does not apply as of the date of termination, the amount set forth in clause (iii) shall be paid: (a) in an initial lump sum equal to six months' base salary (net of applicable taxes and withholdings) on the sixth month anniversary of the date of termination; and (b) thereafter in installments in accordance with our normal payroll practices. The amounts set forth in (iv) and (v) above shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records for the Company for the relevant performance period at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain restrictions set forth in the employment agreement. We must also pay Mr. Rolls' health plan continuation premiums for up to one year following termination, and he would be entitled to up to six months of outplacement assistance at a cost of up to $5,000. To receive these payments, Mr. Rolls must execute (and not revoke) a general release and waiver, waiving all claims he may have against us.

The non-solicitation and non-compete covenants are effective for a period of one year following Mr. Rolls' termination. The confidentiality, non-disclosure, and non-disparagement covenants do not provide for a specific termination date. 
If Mr. Rolls' employment is terminated without "Cause" or for "Good Reason" within two years after a "Change in Control," as defined in the Amended and Restated Plan, in addition to the other benefits provided in his employment agreement, and notwithstanding any provision in the applicable award agreement, any outstanding but unvested stock options and any RSUs that were granted on or before the date he signed his employment agreement, or in connection with Mr. Rolls' promotion, will vest and all such options (vested and unvested) will remain exercisable until the first to occur of (i) one year after the date of termination and (ii) either the tenth anniversary or the seventh anniversary of the grant date of such options, depending upon what the relevant option grant agreement specifies with regard to an option's term or expiration date, subject to certain restrictions under Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Mr. Rolls would be entitled to an additional amount equal to his total annual target bonus under our bonus program in effect as of the date of termination, or if bonuses are paid semi-annually, two times his target bonus for the performance cycle in which the date of termination occurs. Such amount shall be paid as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of the accounting books and records of the Company for the relevant performance cycle at the same time bonuses are paid to other active employees, subject to certain limitations. The employment agreement also contains provisions designed to ensure that we and Mr. Rolls comply with the excise tax provisions of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code, including that we will be responsible for retaining and paying a law firm, certified public accounting firm, or executive compensation consultant to make any necessary calculations and determinations relating to such compliance. 
If the executive's employment is terminated by the Company for Cause, voluntarily by the executive other than for Good Reason, or as a result of his death or disability, the Company will pay the executive or his estate accrued but unused vacation and base salary through the date of termination. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control 
In the tables below, we summarize the estimated payments that will be made to each of our Named Executive Officers upon a termination of employment in the various circumstances listed, except for Mr. Hall, who retired from the Company on March 8, 2019 and, in connection with his retirement, received no post-termination compensation. The table for each Named Executive Officer should be read together with the description of that officer's employment agreement above and the description below. For information concerning the material conditions applicable to the receipt of certain payments or benefits, including waivers and 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     81 
Compensation of Executive Officers non-compete,non-solicitation, non-disparagement, and confidentiality agreements, see the description of each such employment agreement in "Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements" above. Unless we note otherwise in the individual table, the major assumptions that we used in creating the tables are set forth directly below. 
Date of Termination. The tables assume that any triggering event (e.g., termination, resignation, Change in Control, death, or disability) took place on December 31, 2018, with base salaries in effect at the end of the 2018 fiscal year being used for purposes of any severance payout calculation. 
Off-setting Employment. For purposes of the table, we have assumed that each Named Executive Officer was not able to obtain comparable employment during the applicable period, which would off-set the Company's severance payment obligations if such term was set forth in his employment agreement. 
Price Per Share of Common Stock. Calculations requiring a per share stock price are made on the basis of the closing price of $16.51 per share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on December 31, 2018. 
Cash Payment upon a Change in Control. No cash payment will be made solely because of a Change in Control. For each Named Executive Officer, the cash payments described under the heading "Termination Following a Change in Control" would be triggered upon a termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason within two years following a Change in Control. 
Equity Acceleration upon a Change in Control. Under the Amended and Restated Plan, the Board of Directors of the Company, in its discretion, can provide for acceleration of the vesting and the lapse of restrictions on all outstanding options or other awards upon a Change in Control (as defined in the Amended and Restated Plan). Under the employment agreement for each NEO other than Mr. Jackson, certain awards granted at or prior to the time of original entry into the employment agreement will vest if the NEO's employment is terminated without Cause or the NEO resigns for Good Reason within 24 months following a Change in Control. Generally, under the applicable award agreements, outstanding options, RSUs, and the earned portion of any PBRSUs (including any shares earned under a multiplier component) vest automatically, subject to certain conditions, if the Company terminates the officer's employment with the Company without Cause, including a deemed termination for Good Reason (as these terms are defined in the applicable award agreement), in connection with or following a Change in Control. See "2018, 2017, and 2016 Awards of Equity" above in this proxy statement for a more detailed description of the vesting of outstanding awards of RSUs and PBRSUs upon termination following a Change in Control. 
Medical and Other Benefits. The tables below do not include certain medical, disability, or outplacement services benefits that may be payable on termination as set forth in the Named Executive Officers' employment agreements. We also do not include any amounts payable on termination that are generally available to all employees on a non- discriminatory basis. As described in their employment agreements, Messrs. Gutmann, Schromm, and Rolls are generally entitled to Company-paid continuation of group health plan benefits under COBRA regulations for a period of up to one year following termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason (including circumstances involving a Change in Control). Mr. Jackson is entitled to the continuation of medical benefits for a period of up to two years upon a termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason within 24 months following a Change in Control. As of December 31, 2018, the monthly cost of such benefits for such officers ranged between approximately $359 to $1,337 depending on the medical, dental, and vision elections and dependent enrollment. Finally, the tables do not include amounts (see footnote (5) to the Summary Compensation Table) payable by the Company on behalf of each Named Executive Officer to cover the cost of an additional $500,000 of life insurance, which insurance benefit is not generally available to all employees on a non-discriminatory basis and would be realized in the event of the death of the Named Executive Officer. Messrs. Gutmann, Schromm, and Rolls are also entitled to outplacement services following a termination without Cause or resignation for Good Reason in an amount not to exceed $5,000. 
82     ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement 
Compensation of Executive Officers 
Retirement. A normal retirement is treated as a resignation other than for Good Reason in the tables. Upon retirement, Named Executive Officers would receive earned but unpaid salary and accrued but unused vacation time. On March 8, 2019, Mr. Hall retired from the Company and, pursuant to his employment agreement, received earned but unpaid salary and accrued but unused vacation time. 
Cash Incentive Program. We describe our cash incentive program in the CD&A under "Elements of Our Compensation Program — Short-Term Cash Incentive Program." 
The following table describes the potential payments upon termination or a Change in Control for Keith D. Jackson, our President and Chief Executive Officer.

(1)  Mr. Jackson's severance payment following a termination without Cause or a resignation for Good Reason is equal  to two years of annual base salary. Mr. Jackson's base salary at the end of fiscal 2018 was $1,035,000.

(2)  Mr. Jackson's cash payment following a termination without Cause or a resignation for Good Reason within 24  months following a Change in Control is equal to two times his target bonus under the 2018 cash incentive program. Such target bonus for 2018 was $1,524,231.

(3)  In the event Mr. Jackson is terminated due to death or disability, Mr. Jackson or his estate would be entitled  to any bonus earned with respect to the prior performance cycle ending immediately prior to the date of termination and an amount equal to the bonus he earned in the year immediately preceding the date of termination times the percentage of the  fiscal year that has passed prior to his termination. For purposes of this column, we have assumed that Mr. Jackson's death or disability was as of December 31, 2018. Mr. Jackson's cash incentive bonus earned in 2018 was  $1,841,576.

(4)  Because our Board of Directors has discretion to accelerate outstanding awards of equity under our Amended and Restated  Plan notwithstanding the provisions of an officer's employment agreement or the award agreements under which the awards were granted, for purposes of this disclosure, we have assumed that the Board has exercised such discretion and all  outstanding equity awards have been accelerated. For a description of the actual provisions of the employment agreements and such award agreements that may otherwise impact acceleration in connection with a Change in Control, see the discussion  above under "Potential Payments Upon Termination of Employment or Change in Control — Equity Acceleration upon a Change in Control." This amount denotes the incremental difference between the market value on December 31, 2018 and  the exercise price, if any, of unvested options, RSUs, or PBRSUs (including any Multiplier Shares) for which vesting might be accelerated.

(2)  Mr. Gutmann is entitled to any bonus earned but unpaid in previous cycles and a pro rata portion of his bonus, if  any, for the then current performance cycle based on achievement of the applicable performance criteria.

ON SEMICONDUCTOR 2018 PAY RATIO DISCLOSURE 
For 2018, our last completed fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the median of the annual total compensation of all employees of our Company (other than Mr. Jackson, our CEO) was  $14,356; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the annual total compensation of our CEO was $11,893,401.  
[END TABLE]
Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Jackson to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 828 to 1. 
The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We describe the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to identify the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees and to determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee" below. Because Commission rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there was no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. Accordingly, for purposes of calculating the 2018 pay ratio, we used the same median employee that we identified for purposes of calculating our 2017 pay ratio. 
For purposes of identifying our median employee, we used our global employee population as of October 31, 2017, identified based on our human resources system of record. To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we utilized a compensation measure consisting of base pay, overtime pay, and short-term incentive compensation, which includes all commissions and bonuses ("Cash Compensation"). We did not annualize the compensation of permanent employees included in the sample who were hired in 2017 but did not work for us or our consolidated subsidiaries for the entire fiscal year. We also did not make any cost-of-living adjustments in identifying the "median employee." We determined that annual equity awards, which are not widely distributed to our employees, and certain employee allowances, which are not uniformly distributed across our employee population, do not reasonably reflect the annual compensation of our employees and therefore excluded such compensation from Cash Compensation. Using this methodology, for purposes of 2017 compensation, we determined that the "median employee" was a full-time salaried employee located in the Philippines.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of the Company's consolidated financial statements, the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the Company's system of disclosure controls and procedures that may have a material impact on the financial statements of the Company (including internal control over financial reporting), and the qualifications, independence, and performance of its independent registered public accounting firm. It has the sole authority and responsibility to select, oversee, and, when appropriate, replace the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee meets periodically with the internal auditors and independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of our disclosure controls and procedures (including internal control over financial reporting), and the overall quality of our financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee, comprised at the time of four independent Outside Directors and operating under its written charter, has: (i) reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with our management; (ii) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees, issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; (iii) received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; (iv) discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm such independent registered public accounting firm's independence; and (v) discussed with management critical accounting policies and the processes and controls related to the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer financial reporting certifications required by the Commission and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to accompany the Company's periodic filings with the Commission. 
Based on its review and discussions listed above, as well as such other matters deemed relevant and appropriate by it, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report. 
It is not the duty of the Audit Committee to determine that the Company's financial statements and disclosures are complete and accurate and in accordance with GAAP or to plan or conduct audits. Those are the responsibilities of management and the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. In giving its recommendation to the Board, the Audit Committee has relied on: (1) management's representation that such financial statements have been prepared with integrity and objectivity and in conformity with GAAP; and (2) the report of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm with respect to such financial statements. 
This report is submitted by the Audit Committee.

This amount excludes purchase rights accruing under the 2000 ESPP that has a stockholder-approved reserve  of 28,500,000 shares.

The 2000 SIP terminated on February 17, 2010, and, accordingly, there are no shares available for future grants under the 2000 SIP as of December 31, 2018.

RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS 
Policies and Procedures 
As set forth in the Audit Committee Charter, unless submitted to another comparable independent body of the Board, and to the extent required under applicable federal securities laws and related rules and regulations, and/or the Nasdaq listing standards, related party transactions are submitted to the Audit Committee for review and oversight. 
We have a written policy on related party transactions (the "Policy") to which all employees are required to adhere. The Policy has been revised from time to time to, among other reasons, reflect changes to the Commission's rules governing disclosure of related party transactions. The Policy provides for review and oversight requirements and related procedures with respect to transactions in which: (i) the Company was, is, or will be a participant; (ii) the amount involved exceeds $120,000; and (iii) any related party had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. The Policy intentionally defines "related party" to not only include parties set forth under the definitions contained in Commission rules but also to include additional parties such as commonly controlled affiliates of the Company, certain investments in other entities, and employee trusts. The Policy directs our Law Department to periodically distribute a list of all known related parties to certain employees responsible for monitoring potential related party transactions. All related party transactions must be reviewed by our Corporate Controller's Office, in conjunction with our Law Department, for potential conflict of interest situations and related matters on an ongoing basis. Even related party transactions which do not require review and oversight by the Audit Committee (or other independent body of the Board of Directors) and public disclosure under the Commission's rules and Nasdaq's listing standards must be reported to our Corporate Controller's Office (preferably prior to consummation of such transactions) so that our Corporate Controller's Office, in conjunction with our Law Department, can review the transactions for conflicts of interest and related matters. 
When review and oversight by the Audit Committee (or other independent body) is required, the Audit Committee (or other independent body) must be provided the details of such transactions, including, but not limited to, the terms of the transaction, the business purpose of the transaction, and the benefits to the Company and to the relevant party. Although the Policy has not set standards for review or approval of related party transactions, our Audit Committee (or other independent body), Corporate Controller's Office, and Law Department seek to ensure that all related party transactions are conducted at arms-length, on terms that are fair to the Company and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
Related Party Transactions 
Since January 1, 2018, there have been no related party transactions that are required to be reported as such under Commission rules. For transactions between us and our Named Executive Officers, see "Compensation of Executive Officers" generally and specifically "Compensation of Executive Officers — Employment, Severance, and Change in Control Agreements and Arrangements" above. For a discussion of certain relationships pertaining to our Directors that were analyzed in connection with the Board's independence determinations, see "Management Proposals — Proposal No. 1: Election of Directors" above. 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     93 
SECTION 16(a) REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our Directors, officers, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Commission initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership of any of our equity securities. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of Forms 3, 4, and 5 furnished to us during the year ended December 31, 2018, all amendments thereto, and a representation from our Directors and Section 16 officers that no other reports were required, all Directors, officers, and beneficial owners of greater than 10% of any class of our equity securities registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act made all filings required under Section 16(a) during 2018 on a timely basis, except that: (i) a Form 4 was not timely filed for Mr. Gutmann with respect to a sale of 8 shares of Company common stock executed by Mr. Gutmann's broker without Mr. Gutmann's knowledge or direction; and (ii) a Form 4 for Mr. Colpitts was amended promptly after we discovered that, due to an administrative error, the acquisition of 1,720 shares of Company common stock in connection with a PBRSU vesting event was not included in the original Form 4. 
MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION 
Solicitation of Proxies 
The cost of soliciting proxies will be borne by us. We have retained Georgeson LLC ("Georgeson") to assist in the distribution of proxy solicitation materials and the solicitation of proxies. We have agreed to indemnify Georgeson against certain liabilities arising out of or in connection with the engagement and to limit its aggregate liability for its services. The estimated cost will be $14,500, plus additional fees relating to telephone solicitation of proxies and upon the occurrence of certain other contingencies, as well as other customary costs. In addition to the solicitation of proxies by mail, we will request banks, brokers, and other record holders to send proxies and proxy materials to the beneficial owners of the stock and secure their voting instructions, if necessary. We will reimburse such record holders for their reasonable expenses in so doing. We may also use several of our regular employees, who will not be specially compensated, to solicit proxies personally or by telephone, telegram, facsimile, or special delivery letter. 
Annual Report/Form 10-K 
Our 2018 annual report to stockholders, which includes the Annual Report (without certain exhibits which are excluded from our annual report to stockholders pursuant to Rule 14a-3(b) of the Exchange Act), is being delivered concurrently with this proxy statement to all stockholders of record as of March 19, 2019. Those exhibits that are excluded from the annual report to stockholders as described above are available for the cost of photocopying. To receive a copy, please write to: Investor Relations, ON Semiconductor Corporation, 5005 East McDowell Road, M/D-C302 Phoenix, Arizona 85008; call: Investor Relations at (602) 244-3437; email to: investor@onsemi.com; or go to the Investor Relations section of our website at www.onsemi.com. 
Stockholders Sharing the Same Address 
If you hold your shares in "street name" and share the same address as another stockholder, you will receive only one Internet Notice or set of proxy materials, including the annual report to stockholders, unless you have provided contrary instructions. If you hold your shares in "street name" and wish to receive a separate Internet Notice or set of proxy materials, or if you share the same address as another stockholder and are receiving multiple Internet Notices or sets of proxy materials and wish to receive only one Internet Notice or set of proxy materials, you will need to contact your bank or brokerage firm. Registered holders are each provided an Internet Notice or set of proxy materials; however, if you are a registered holder and would like an additional copy or, alternatively, if you share the same address as another stockholder and: (i) are receiving a single Internet Notice or set of proxy materials and wish to receive multiple Internet Notices or sets; or (ii) are

We will promptly provide a copy as requested. 
Other Business 
Other than the election of Directors, the advisory vote on executive compensation, and the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers as our independent registered public accounting firm, we do not intend to bring any other matters to be voted on at the Annual Meeting and we are not currently aware of any other matters that will be presented by others for action at the Annual Meeting. If, however, other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting and you have signed and returned your proxy card, the proxies will have discretion to vote your shares on such matters to the extent authorized under the Exchange Act.
Stockholder Communications with the Board of Directors 
We have a process by which our stockholders can send communications to the Board, and every effort is made to ensure that the Board or individual Directors, as applicable, hear the views of our stockholders so that appropriate responses can be provided to our stockholders in a timely manner. Any matter intended for the Board, or for any individual member or members of the Board, should be directed to our Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, Chief Risk Officer, and Corporate Secretary, George H. Cave, at the address of our principal offices with a request to forward the same to the intended recipient. Substantive communications will generally be forwarded to the Board. 
Stockholder Nominations and Proposals 
Stockholders may present, and our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider, proposals for action at a future meeting if they comply with our Bylaws and Commission rules. In 2013, we amended our Bylaws to allow a special meeting of stockholders to be called upon the written request (a "Special Meeting Request") of stockholders who hold in the aggregate at least 25% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock that is entitled to vote on the matters to be brought before the meeting. Subject to compliance with the requirements of the Bylaws, a special meeting so requested will be held at such date, time, and place as may be fixed by the Board but not more than: (a) 120 days after receipt by our corporate Secretary of the properly submitted Special Meeting Request, if the request relates to matters other than the election of Directors; and (b) if the request relates to the election of Directors, 180 days after receipt by our corporate Secretary of the properly submitted Special Meeting Request. The requesting stockholders are required to provide specified information as provided in our Bylaws relating to the matters to be considered at the special meeting. 
Subject to advance notice provisions contained in our Bylaws, a stockholder of record may also propose the nomination of someone for election as a Director at our annual meeting of stockholders by timely written notice to our Secretary. Unless the Board determines otherwise, next year's annual meeting of stockholders will be held on May 20, 2020. Generally, a notice is timely if received by our Secretary not less than 90 days (by February 20, 2020) or more than 120 days (by January 21, 2020) before the date of the annual meeting. If, however, the date of the annual meeting has not been publicly disclosed or announced at least 105 days in advance of the annual meeting, then our Secretary must have received the notice within 15 days of such initial public disclosure or announcement. The notice must set forth: (i) with respect to each person whom such stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director, all information relating to such person as would be required to be disclosed under federal securities laws in a proxy statement relating to the election of Directors (including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee); (ii) the name and address of the nominating stockholder, as they appear on our books; and (iii) the class and number of shares that are owned beneficially and of record by the nominating stockholder on the date of the notice. In addition, not more than 10 days after a request from our Secretary, the nominating 
ON Semiconductor Corporation 2019 Proxy Statement     95 
Miscellaneous Information stockholder must furnish to the Secretary such additional information as the Secretary may reasonably require. A nomination that does not comply with the above procedure and other procedures described in our Bylaws will be disregarded. 
Under the Commission rules, stockholder proposals for the 2020 annual meeting must be received at our principal executive office, located at 5005 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85008, not later than November 30, 2019 to be considered for inclusion in next year's proxy statement. Proposals to be presented at such annual meeting that are not intended for inclusion in the proxy statement must be submitted in accordance with applicable advance notice provisions of our Bylaws. You may contact our Secretary at the principal executive offices to request a copy of the relevant bylaw provisions regarding the requirements for making stockholder proposals. Generally, our Bylaws provide that a stockholder may sponsor a proposal to be considered at the annual meeting if written notice of such proposal is timely received by our Secretary. Generally, a notice is timely given if received by our Secretary not less than 90 days (by February 20, 2020) or more than 120 days (by January 21, 2020) before the date of the annual meeting. If, however, the date of the annual meeting has not been publicly disclosed or announced at least 105 days in advance of the annual meeting, then our Secretary must have received the notice within 15 days after the initial public disclosure or announcement of the date of the annual meeting. 
The notice must set forth: (a) as to each matter the sponsoring stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting, a brief description of the proposal desired to be brought before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting; (b) the name and address of the sponsoring stockholder as they appear on our books; (c) the class and number of shares that are owned beneficially and of record by the sponsoring stockholder on the date of the notice; and (d) any material interest of the sponsoring stockholder in such proposal. In addition, not more than 10 days after a request from our Secretary, the sponsoring stockholder must furnish to the Secretary such additional information as the Secretary may reasonably require. A proposal that does not comply with the above procedure and other procedures described in our Bylaws will be disregarded. 
If any such matter is brought before an annual meeting, our management will use its discretionary authority to vote the shares subject to the proxies as the Board may recommend, to the extent allowed by our Bylaws and applicable law. 
Stockholders are urged to vote their shares as more fully described in the proxy card and above in this proxy statement under the heading "Proxy Statement." Your prompt response is appreciated.
