2019 Annual Meeting of  Shareholders  
Table of Contents 
March 27, 2019 
To Our Shareholders: 
On behalf of your board of directors, it is our privilege to invite you to attend the 2019 annual meeting of shareholders of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. The annual meeting will be held on Wednesday, May 8, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., local time, at the Hyatt Regency Tulsa, 100 East Second Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103. At the annual meeting, shareholders will vote on the matters set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement and any other business matters properly brought before the annual meeting. Whether or not you are able to attend the meeting, we encourage you to read the enclosed materials and submit your proxy. 
      Outstanding Progress in 2018         
We will meet to discuss our progress on executing our strategy – progress that allows us to fulfill our mission to feed the crops that feed the world efficiently and sustainably, as we create long-term shareholder value. 
Our ability to do this starts with the commitment and dedication of 3,000 CF employees. In 2018, they worked safely, ran our plants well, and successfully navigated unfavorable weather that significantly shortened the spring fertilizer application season. Their execution, along with a strengthening global nitrogen market and less expensive natural gas, led to strong operational and financial results. We are positioned at the low end of the global cost curve due to our access to low-cost and plentiful North American natural gas. During 2018, we invested in this structural advantage by exercising our right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. for $388 million. We also continued our track record of returning excess cash to shareholders, in line with our long-standing capital allocation philosophy. We announced and completed a $500 million share repurchase program during the year, which reduced our shares outstanding as of the beginning of 2018 by approximately five percent. 
      Sustainable for the Long-Term         
Our commitment to sustainability remains a key focus for your company in our efforts to create long-term shareholder value. Indeed, sustainability is inherent to our business. Because 23 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are estimated from land use, a sustainable future requires the world to use less land to feed its people. Deforestation for new crop land not only releases carbon into the atmosphere but destroys carbon-sequestering trees. We estimate that fertilizer helps save the world nearly 5 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions each year by allowing farmers to grow more food on less land, saving trees in the process. 
While our products support a more sustainable future, we also continue to drive improvement in the sustainability of our operations. We operate some of the world's most energy-efficient nitrogen production facilities. As we've expanded our plants, our new natural gas-based facilities have displaced inefficient coal-based nitrogen facilities in China, reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by the fertilizer industry. We also continue to increase our Global Reporting Initiative disclosures as part of our annual Corporate Sustainability Report. Notably, we documented our water use intensity for the first time this year. We invite you to

      Continued Strong Corporate Governance         
Finally, we want to welcome two new members of the board of directors, Javed Ahmed and Celso L. White, who were elected in 2018. Javed and Celso bring tremendous leadership, experience and insight to the board. They will truly be an asset as we continue to focus on strong corporate governance in order to deliver long-term value to you. 
We are proud of the progress we have made as a company and look forward to reviewing what we have achieved and the opportunities ahead at the annual meeting. Thank you for your continued trust in CF Industries and we hope to see you on May 8, 2019. 
Sincerely,

      VOTING MATTERS         
      OUR BUSINESS         
CF Industries is a leading global fertilizer and chemical company with outstanding operational capabilities and a cost-advantaged production and distribution platform. Our 3,000 employees operate world-class manufacturing complexes in Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. Our customers include both agricultural and industrial users of our products. Our principal nitrogen products are ammonia, granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution, and ammonium nitrate. We also manufacture diesel exhaust fluid, urea liquor, nitric acid, and aqua ammonia, which are sold primarily to industrial customers, and compound fertilizer products, which are solid granular fertilizer products for which the nutrient content is a combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. We serve our customers in North America through an unparalleled production, storage, transportation and distribution network. We also reach a global customer base with exports from our Donaldsonville, Louisiana, plant, the world's largest and most flexible nitrogen complex. Additionally, we move product to international destinations from our Verdigris, Oklahoma, facility, our Yazoo City, Mississippi, facility, our Billingham and Ince facilities in the United Kingdom, and a joint venture ammonia facility in the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago in which we own a 50 percent interest. 
For more information on our business, see "Item 1. —Business" and "Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2018 Annual Report.  Table of Contents
      OUR STRATEGY         
Our vision, given the cyclical nature of our business, is to deliver superior shareholder returns over the cycle. Our strategy, in support of our vision, is built upon a foundation of distinct core capabilities and core values that we live each and every day. We leverage our capabilities to drive business results that create long-term value for our shareholders. Our strategy is reviewed and endorsed annually by our Board and the Board plays an active role in measuring our ability to successfully execute it. 
      Our Strategy Is Aligned with Our Mission and Corporate Responsibility         
Our strategy for creating long-term shareholder value is directly aligned with our mission: We feed the crops that feed the world and produce the building blocks for a better life, and we do so efficiently and sustainably. Fertilizer is responsible for helping to grow the crops that comprise about half of the world's food supply, which makes life possible for billions of people. Fertilizer also supports sustainable food production because it increases yield per acre, which means farmers need less land to grow the food the world's population needs to survive. By increasing crop yields, we help limit the conversion of carbon-sequestering forests into farmland. We also manufacture products that reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. In addition, our diesel exhaust fluid product helps reduce nitrous oxide emissions of heavy-duty trucks. For further discussion of our corporate responsibility and sustainability practices, see "Corporate Governance -Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability." 
Manufacturing chemical products responsibly requires a focus on safety. At CF Industries, safety is more than just a requirement – it is a point of pride and ingrained in our corporate culture and values. This commitment is illustrated by our industry leading safety statistics. At CF Industries, we believe that our strong safety record is a result of our focus on behavioral safety practices. During 2018, we further demonstrated our commitment to operational excellence and safety by incorporating an operational metric into our annual incentive plan  Table of Contents which was based on our achievement of ammonia production goals, subject to first achieving a gating level of performance on behavioral safety practices. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" for further information. 
      Strong Shareholder Returns Over the Cycle         
We firmly believe that, due to the cyclical nature of the commodity chemical industry in which we operate, it is important to view performance over a longer time horizon than just one year. Our execution of initiatives aligned with our strategy helped us achieve our vision – delivering superior shareholder returns over the cycle. The following table shows the cumulative total shareholder return, assuming the reinvestment of dividends, for our common stock and a peer group index for the 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2018. In constructing the peer group index, we have selected Agrium Inc. (Agrium), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) and The Mosaic Company (Mosaic), all of which were publicly traded manufacturers of agricultural chemical fertilizers with headquarters in North America during the periods. On January 2, 2018, Agrium and PotashCorp completed a merger of equals transaction to form Nutrien Ltd. (Nutrien). See the notes following the table for the methodology used to measure TSR. 
Prior to January 2, 2018, common shares of each of Agrium and PotashCorp traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). On January 2, 2018, Agrium and PotashCorp completed a merger of equals transaction to form Nutrien. Nutrien common shares began trading on the NYSE on January 2, 2018 and trading of common shares of Agrium and PotashCorp was concurrently halted. In the merger of equals transaction, each common share of PotashCorp was exchanged for 0.40 common shares of Nutrien and each common share of Agrium was exchanged for 2.23 common shares of Nutrien.
For purposes of calculating the TSR of CF Industries and the peer group index for the 1-year period ending December 31, 2018, the peer group was composed of Nutrien and Mosaic and the beginning stock price for each company was established by its respective closing price on January 2, 2018 (the first trading day for Nutrien shares). The returns of the peer group companies were weighted according to their respective market capitalizations as of January 2, 2018.
For purposes of calculating the TSR of CF Industries and the peer group index for the 3, 5, 7, and 10-year periods ending December 31, 2018, the peer group at the beginning of the measurement period was composed of Mosaic, Agrium, and PotashCorp and the beginning stock price for each company was established by its respective closing price on the last trading day immediately preceding January 1 of the first fiscal year of the applicable measurement period. The returns of the peer group companies were weighted according to their respective market capitalizations as of the date used to establish the beginning stock price. The cumulative investment in each of Agrium and PotashCorp, assuming dividend reinvestments up to December 31, 2017, was converted into shares of Nutrien on January 2, 2018 using the exchange ratio in the merger of equals transaction consummated on that date.

      2018 PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS         
   Operating Results  
   Annual Incentive Plan Performance Metrics  
Higher global nitrogen prices and lower natural gas costs drove the company's financial performance in 2018 compared to the year's target. Producers in Asia and Europe experienced significantly higher-than-expected increases in feedstock costs during 2018. The average annual price per MMBtu of natural gas at the Dutch TTF trading hub was 35 percent higher in 2018 compared to 2017; the average annual price per MMBtu for liquefied natural gas in Asia was 43 percent higher; and the price per metric ton of anthracite coal in China was 25 percent higher. These higher feedstock costs, along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in China, resulted in lower production in these regions, tightening the global supply and demand balance and increasing global nitrogen prices significantly compared to 2017. At the same time, CF's natural gas cost per MMBtu in cost of sales for 2018 was five percent lower than in 2017, supporting significantly higher margins for the company during the year. 
Additionally, the company continued to deliver against its strategic priorities and create long-term shareholder value. 
(1)         EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See Appendix A for a reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  
(2)         The Secondary Metric, Tons of Ammonia Produced, has a behavioral safety gate threshold. If at least 95% of the aggregated safety grades of all employees at manufacturing sites were a "B" or better for the year, the safety performance gating requirement would be achieved. If the safety performance gating requirement was not achieved, there would be no payout under the Secondary Metric.  Table of Contents

      SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT         
We believe that building positive relationships with our shareholders is critical to CF Industries' success. We value the views of, and regularly communicate with, our shareholders on a variety of topics, such as our financial performance, corporate governance, executive compensation, and related matters. Management shares the feedback received from shareholders with the Board. Our chairman or other members of the Board may also be available to participate in meetings with shareholders as appropriate. Requests for such a meeting are considered on a case-by-case basis. Our engagement activities have resulted in valuable feedback that has contributed to our decision-making with respect to these matters. 
We conduct shareholder outreach campaigns in the spring and in the fall. Our engagements in the spring are primarily focused on ballot items on which shareholders will vote at our annual meeting. Our engagements in the fall generally focus on voting outcomes from our prior annual meeting – including direct shareholder feedback on how they voted on ballot items – as well as potential corporate governance or executive compensation changes the Board and its committees are considering. The fall engagement also presents an opportunity to discuss with shareholders developments in their methodologies and analyses and potential future areas of focus. 
In the first half of 2018 leading up to our 2018 annual meeting, we contacted shareholders comprising approximately 75% of our outstanding shares to invite them to speak with members of our senior management and the chair of our compensation and management development committee. Combined, management and our compensation committee chair met with shareholders representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares in advance of our 2018 annual meeting, discussing with these shareholders our compensation program, special meeting right, and other governance focused matters. 
During the second half of 2018 following our 2018 annual meeting, we contacted shareholders comprising approximately 70% of our outstanding shares inviting them to speak with members of our senior management. We held meetings with shareholders accounting for 45% of our outstanding shares, discussing with these shareholders the voting outcome from our 2018  Table of Contents annual meeting as well as general governance, compensation, corporate responsibility and sustainability matters. 
      COMPENSATION PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS         
Our compensation philosophy at CF Industries seeks to align the interests of our employees and our shareholders through focusing on the total compensation (base salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, and benefits) of our employees, including our executive officers. We seek to benefit from this strategy by attracting key talent, retaining strong performers, increasing productivity, and maximizing operational and financial results, while also implementing compensation programs that are cost effective, market competitive, and sustainable across business cycles. 
      Compensation Policies and Practices         
Our executive compensation practices are overseen and administered by the compensation and management development committee. Key compensation governance policies and practices that govern the committee's approach include: 
      2018 Target Total Compensation Mix         
The compensation and management development committee believes the majority of compensation should be composed of awards that are performance-based – both by direct ties to the company and individual employee performance. The significant majority of each named executive officer's target compensation is at-risk based on company performance.

      PROPOSAL 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS       
      DIRECTOR NOMINEES         
Our directors are elected each year for one-year terms expiring at the next annual meeting of shareholders. The Board has nominated the twelve current directors for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Each director elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will serve a one-year term and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified. 
Each nominee has consented to being named in this Proxy Statement and to serve if elected. If any nominee becomes unavailable to serve, an event that the Board does not presently expect, we will vote the shares represented by proxies for the election of directors for the election of such other person as the Board may recommend. Unless otherwise instructed, we will vote all proxies we receive FOR the directors listed below. 
      Majority Vote Standard for Election of Directors         
Our directors are elected by a majority of the votes cast in uncontested elections (the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director nominee). An "uncontested election of directors" means an election of directors in which, as of the date that is fourteen days in advance of the date we file our definitive proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the number of nominees for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected by the shareholders at that election. In a contested election (a situation where the number of nominees for election exceeds the number of directors to be elected), the standard for election would be a plurality of the shares represented in person or by proxy at any such meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. 
      Director Resignation Policy         
In accordance with procedures set forth in the company's corporate governance guidelines, any incumbent director (including the twelve nominees standing for election at the Annual Meeting) who fails to receive a majority of votes cast in an uncontested election will be required to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the company's corporate governance and nominating committee. The corporate governance and nominating committee will consider the resignation and, within 45 days following the date of the applicable annual meeting, make a recommendation to the Board concerning the acceptance or rejection of the resignation. The Board will then take formal action on the corporate governance and nominating committee's recommendation no later than 90 days following the date of the annual meeting. Following the Board's decision on the committee's recommendation, we will publicly disclose the Board's decision, together with an explanation of the process by which the decision was made and, if applicable, the Board's reason or reasons for rejecting the tendered resignation. 
      DIRECTOR SUCCESSION PLANNING AND NOMINATION PROCESS         
The Board is responsible for nominating members for election to the Board and for filling vacancies on the Board that may occur between annual meetings of shareholders. The corporate governance and nominating committee is responsible for identifying, screening, and recommending candidates to the Board for Board membership.  Table of Contents
      Regular Assessment of our Board Composition and Succession Planning         
The chairman of the board and chair of the corporate governance and nominating committee lead an active process to regularly review the overall composition of the Board and each Board committee and assess whether each reflects the appropriate mix of experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills that are relevant to CF Industries' current and future global strategy, business, and governance. Board composition and succession planning is a standing item on the agenda for each regular corporate governance and nominating committee meeting. The review process incorporates the results of the annual Board and committee performance and skills self-assessment processes described under the heading "Corporate Governance — Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluations and Director Peer Evaluations" in assessing and determining whether any gaps in experience, qualifications, attributes, and skills exist and the characteristics and critical skills required of prospective candidates for election to the Board. 
In order to maintain a Board with an appropriate mix of experience and qualifications and to permit time for orientation, the succession planning process generally considers the development of the Board over the next five year time horizon. In the case of an anticipated change in the composition of the Board, whether as a result of a retirement consistent with our general aged-based retirement policy described below or otherwise, the Board generally prefers to recruit and add new directors such that there is time for the new directors to learn in detail our strategy, business, and governance sufficiently in advance of expected departures. The Board has also concluded that the appropriate number of directors is generally no fewer than eight nor more than twelve. The Board believes this range permits diversity of experience without hindering effective discussion or diminishing individual accountability. Therefore, the Board attempts to coordinate director additions and departures to maintain this size while allowing orientation time for new members as discussed above. Consistent with this process, the Board has added six new independent members over the past five years (Ms. Wagler in 2014, Ms. Noonan in 2015, Messrs. Eaves and Tolle in 2017, and Messrs. Ahmed and White in 2018), and two independent directors (Messrs. Robert G. Kuhbach and Edward A. Schmitt) retired as of the date of the 2018 annual meeting. Given our general aged-based retirement policy described below, at least three of our current directors are expected to retire within the next four years. In order to coordinate this refreshment in accordance with the Board's intention to allow orientation time for new directors while maintaining the benefit of departing director's experience, the Board expects these three current directors will retire over the course of the next three annual meetings. During this time, if one or more new directors are elected to the Board, the number of directors may exceed the preferred range of eight to twelve. At the end of this process, however, the Board expects the number of directors to be within that range. 
      Identifying and Evaluating Candidates for Director         
The corporate governance and nominating committee generally identifies potential nominees by engaging third party search firms that specialize in identifying director candidates. Current directors and executive officers may also notify the committee if they become aware of potential candidates, and the committee refers such persons to the third party search firm to first evaluate whether the candidate meets the criteria for Board membership discussed below. The committee will also consider candidates recommended by shareholders as described below. 
Once a person has been identified by the corporate governance and nominating committee as a potential candidate, the committee may collect and review publicly available information regarding the person to assess whether the person should be considered further. If the corporate governance and nominating committee determines that the candidate warrants further consideration, the committee chair or another member of the committee will contact  Table of Contents the person. Generally, if the person expresses a willingness to be considered and to serve on the Board, the corporate governance and nominating committee will request information from the candidate, review the person's accomplishments and qualifications, including in light of any other candidates that the committee might be considering, and conduct one or more interviews with the candidate. In certain instances, committee members may contact one or more references provided by the candidate or may contact other members of the business community or other persons who may have greater first-hand knowledge of the candidate's accomplishments. The committee's evaluation process will not vary based on whether or not a candidate is recommended by a shareholder, although, as stated below, the committee may take into consideration the number of shares held by the recommending shareholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. 
      Recent Director Searches         
As a result of our active succession planning and candidate evaluation processes, directors Ahmed, Eaves, Noonan, Toelle, Wagler and White were identified as candidates and added to the Board over the last five years. Each of these independent directors brings important skills and experience to our company that have further strengthened and complemented our Board. Each of these six individuals was recommended for consideration to the corporate governance and nominating committee by a third party search firm, and none of these six individuals was known to our chairman of the board or chief executive officer prior to the candidate evaluation process. 
      Shareholder Recommendations of Director Candidates         
The corporate governance and nominating committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders. In considering candidates submitted by shareholders, the committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board and the qualifications of the candidate. To have a candidate considered by the committee, a shareholder must submit the recommendation in writing and include the following information:
The shareholder recommendation and information described above must be sent c/o the corporate secretary to our principal executive offices at the address on the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement and must be received by the corporate secretary not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of our most recent annual meeting of shareholders. 
      Proxy Access         
Our bylaws allow eligible shareholders to include their own nominees for director in our proxy materials along with the Board-nominated candidates. Subject to applicable procedural and other requirements under our bylaws, the proxy access provisions of our bylaws permit any shareholder or group of up to 20 shareholders who have maintained continuous qualifying ownership of 3% or more of our outstanding common stock for at least the previous three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees constituting not more than 25% of the number of the directors in office at the time of the nomination.  Table of Contents
      CRITERIA FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP         
      Director Qualifications and Attributes         
The corporate governance and nominating committee takes into consideration a number of factors and criteria in reviewing candidates for potential nomination to the Board. The corporate governance and nominating committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a director of CF Industries are that a nominee demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board's oversight of our business and affairs and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. 
In addition, the committee will examine a candidate's specific experiences and skills, relevant industry background and knowledge, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest, material relationships with CF Industries, and independence from management and the company. 
      Diversity         
Our corporate governance guidelines and corporate governance and nominating committee charter reflect the intention of the Board that the board of directors represent a diversity of backgrounds. In accordance with the corporate governance and nominating committee charter and our corporate governance guidelines, the corporate governance and nominating committee considers diversity in identifying nominees for director, including personal characteristics such as race, gender and age, and the experiences and skills relevant to the Board's performance of its responsibilities in the oversight of the company. In furtherance of this objective, the corporate governance and nominating committee has determined that it will incorporate recruitment protocols that seek to identify candidates in any future director search who meet these diversity characteristics. As discussed above, six new independent directors have joined our Board over the last five years. These directors' experience and skills backgrounds include senior executive leadership (two sitting and one retired chief executive officers, a sitting chief financial officer, and a global supply chain executive) and two directors with expertise in agriculture. In terms of personal characteristics, these directors include two women, an African American, and a director of Asian origin who lives in Europe and has dual citizenship in the US and UK. 
      Retirement Age         
As set forth in the company's corporate governance guidelines, it is the general policy of the company that no director having attained the age of 74 years shall be nominated for re-election or reappointment to the Board. However, the Board may determine to waive this policy in individual cases.  Table of Contents
      Director Tenure         
To ensure that the Board maintains an appropriate balance of experience, continuity, and an openness to new ideas and a willingness to critically re-examine the status quo, the corporate governance and nominating committee considers the issue of continuing director tenure in connection with each director nomination recommendation. 
Four director nominees, comprising 33% of the nominees, have served more than 10 years and two director nominees, comprising 17% of the nominees, have served between 5 and 10 years. These directors bring a wealth of experience and knowledge concerning CF Industries. 
The remaining six director nominees, comprising 50% of the nominees, have joined the Board over the past five years and bring fresh perspective to Board deliberations. 
      Service on Other Public Company Boards         
CF Industries does not have a policy limiting the number of other public company boards of directors upon which a director may sit, in general. However, the corporate governance and nominating committee considers the number of other public company boards and other boards (or comparable governing bodies) of which a prospective nominee is a member. 
Although we do not impose a limit on outside directorships, we do recognize the substantial time commitments attendant to Board membership and expect that the members of our Board be fully committed to devoting all such time as is necessary to fulfill their Board responsibilities, in terms of both preparation for and attendance and participation at meetings. 
In addition, in recognition of the enhanced time commitments associated with membership on a public company's audit committee, the Board has adopted a policy that no member of the audit committee may serve simultaneously on the audit committees of more than two other public companies unless the Board determines that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of such director to effectively serve on the company's audit committee.  Table of Contents
      Summary of Director Core Competencies         
We consider the depth and diversity of experience on our Board a key strength. Our twelve director nominees offer a diverse set of qualifications and perspectives and possess a wealth of leadership and professional experience. As discussed under the heading "Corporate Governance — Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluations and Director Peer Evaluations," the chair of our corporate governance and nominating committee sponsors an annual self-assessment of director skills and experience in which each director ranks the importance of various business experiences, qualifications, attributes, and skills and rates the director's competency level in the skills. The following table summarizes experiences and skills that we have identified as key to our current and future global strategy, business, and governance. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Public Company Governance     A deep understanding of the Board's duties and responsibilities enhances board effectiveness and ensures independent oversight that is aligned with shareholder interests.   
    Senior Executive Leadership     We believe that directors who have served as CEOs or senior executives are in a position to challenge management and contribute practical insight into business strategy and operations.

    Accounting and Finance Expertise     A strong understanding of accounting and finance is important for ensuring the integrity of our financial reporting and critically evaluating our performance. Our directors have significant accounting experience and  corporate finance expertise.   
    Industry Focus     As one of the world's largest manufacturers and distributors of nitrogen fertilizer and other nitrogen products, we seek directors who are knowledgeable about the chemical, energy, and agriculture industries. These  directors help guide the company in assessing trends and external forces in these industries.   
    International Business     Directors with international business experience help us as we develop and grow our international manufacturing operations and global product distribution.   
    Strategic Initiatives     Experience with major strategic initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and partnerships, substantial capital projects, and integration helps our company identify, pursue and  consummate the right major initiatives that achieve our strategic objectives and realize synergies and optimal growth.

      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE       
CF Industries is committed to implementing sound corporate governance practices that enhance the effectiveness of the Board and our management and that serve the interests of our shareholders. Our corporate governance and nominating committee periodically reviews corporate governance developments and best practices along with our policies and business strategies. The committee advises the Board and management in an effort to strengthen existing governance practices and develop new policies that make CF Industries a better company. We are proud of the steps we have taken and the progress we have made to further strengthen our corporate governance practices and demonstrate our responsiveness to shareholder concerns. 
      CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES         
The Board has adopted corporate governance guidelines to document its overall management governance philosophy. According to these guidelines, the business and affairs of CF Industries shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. The Board's goal is to build long-term value for our shareholders and assure the vitality of the company for our customers and employees and the other individuals and organizations who depend on us. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines is available to shareholders at our corporate website,  www.cfindustries.com, or by writing to our corporate secretary at the address of our principal executive offices on the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement. 
      DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE         
The experience and diversity of our directors has been, and continues to be, critical to our success. Our corporate governance guidelines require that the Board be composed of at least a majority of directors who qualify as independent directors under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"). Additionally, in accordance with NYSE listing standards, the members of our audit, compensation, and corporate governance and nominating committees must be independent. The Board has made an affirmative determination that all eleven of our non-employee directors have no material relationship with CF Industries or any of its subsidiaries (other than being a director and shareholder of CF Industries) and, accordingly, meet the applicable requirements for "independence" set forth in the NYSE's listing standards. 
      LEADERSHIP OF THE BOARD         
      Separate Independent Board Chairman and Chief Executive Officer         
The Board has determined that the most effective leadership structure is to maintain an independent Board chair role separate from the chief executive officer. In making this determination, the Board takes into account a number of factors, including (1) that separating these positions allows our Board chairman to focus on the Board's role of providing advice to, and independent oversight of, management and (2) the time and effort our chief executive officer needs to devote to the management and operation of CF Industries and the development and implementation of our business strategies. Although our governance documents provide the Board with the flexibility to select the leadership structure in the way that it deems best for CF Industries at any given point in time, it is the Board's intention to continue to maintain an independent Board chair separate from the chief executive officer. In addition, according to our corporate governance guidelines, if the chairman of the Board is not an independent director, our independent directors will designate one of their number to  Table of Contents serve as a lead independent director. Otherwise, if the chairman of the Board is an independent director, he or she will serve as the lead independent director. 
Stephen A. Furbacher has served as our lead independent director since 2010 and as Board chairman since May 2014. Mr. Furbacher was selected to serve as chairman because of his contributions to the leadership of the Board through his position as our lead independent director prior to becoming chairman. Because Mr. Furbacher is an independent director, he continues to serve as our lead independent director. The lead independent director's duties include coordinating the activities of the independent directors, coordinating the agenda for and moderating sessions of the independent directors, and facilitating communications between the other members of the Board. Unless otherwise provided in a short-term succession plan approved by the Board:
in each case, until the Board has the opportunity to consider the situation and take action. 
      Executive Sessions         
At each regularly scheduled meeting, the Board conducts executive sessions, which are discussions that involve only the non-employee directors. Our corporate governance guidelines state that the lead independent director or, in such director's absence, another independent director designated by the lead independent director will preside at the executive sessions of the Board. 
      Annual Board and Committee Self-Evaluations and Director Peer Evaluations         
Our corporate governance and nominating committee sponsors an annual self-assessment of the Board's performance and the performance of each committee of the Board as well as director peer evaluations. The assessment includes a review of any areas in which the Board or management believes the Board can make a better contribution to CF Industries. In addition, the chair of the corporate governance and nominating committee sponsors an annual self-assessment of director skills and experience. The assessment asks each director to rank the importance of various business experiences, qualifications, attributes, and skills to our current and future global strategy, business, and governance and to rate the director's competency level in the skills. The results of the assessments are discussed with the full Board and each committee. The corporate governance and nominating committee considers the results of these self-evaluation processes as applicable in assessing and determining the characteristics and critical skills required of prospective candidates for election to the Board and making recommendations to the Board with respect to assignments of Board members to various committees. 
      Management Development and Succession Planning         
Our Board plays an integral oversight role in talent development by recognizing the importance of succession planning for the CEO and other key executives at CF Industries. To assist the Board, the chief executive officer prepares and distributes to the Board an annual  Table of Contents report on succession planning for all senior officers of the company with an assessment of senior managers and their potential to succeed the chief executive officer and other senior management positions. In addition, the chief executive officer prepares, on a continuing basis, a short-term succession plan which delineates a temporary delegation of authority to certain officers of the company, if all or a portion of the senior officers should unexpectedly become unable to perform their duties. 
      COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD         
The Board has established three separate standing committees: the audit committee, the compensation and management development committee, and the corporate governance and nominating committee. The Board has adopted written charters for each of these committees and copies of these charters are available to shareholders at our corporate website,  www.cfindustries.com, or by writing to our corporate secretary at the address of our principal executive offices on the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement. 
Audit Committee. Our audit committee is a separately designated standing committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The committee currently consists of Theresa E. Wagler (chair), Robert C. Arzbaecher, William Davisson, John W. Eaves, and Stephen J. Hagge. During 2018, the audit committee members were Theresa E. Wagler (chair), Robert C. Arzbaecher, William Davisson, John W. Eaves, Stephen J. Hagge, and Robert G. Kuhbach (from January to May 2018). The Board has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who served on the audit committee during 2018 and who presently serve on the committee are independent under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE applicable to audit committee members. The Board has also determined all of these directors are "audit committee financial experts," as defined by the SEC. The audit committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility for (1) the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process and our systems of internal accounting and financial controls, (2) the performance of our internal audit function, (3) the annual independent integrated audit of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, and (4) our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, including our disclosure controls and procedures. The duties and responsibilities of the audit committee include the engagement of our independent registered public accounting firm and the evaluation of our accounting firm's qualifications, independence, and performance. The audit committee's report to shareholders appears elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. 
Compensation and Management Development Committee. Our compensation and management development committee currently consists of Stephen J. Hagge (chair), John D. Johnson, Anne P. Noonan, Michael J. Toelle, and Celso L. White. During 2018, the compensation and management development committee members were Stephen J. Hagge (chair), Stephen A. Furbacher (from January to May 2018), John D. Johnson, Anne P. Noonan, Edward A. Schmitt (from January to May 2018), Michael J. Toelle, Theresa E. Wagler (from January to May 2018) and Celso L. White (effective October 2018). The Board has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who served on the compensation and management development committee during 2018 and who presently serve on the committee are independent under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE applicable to compensation committee members. The Board has also determined that all of the members of the committee qualify as "non-employee directors," within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and "outside directors," within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). The compensation and management development committee oversees our compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including our executive compensation plans, director compensation plans, and incentive-compensation and equity-based plans. In  Table of Contents addition, the compensation and management development committee supports the full Board with succession plans for the CEO, while overseeing and reviewing management's development, retention and succession planning for other key executives and senior management. The compensation and management development committee's report to shareholders appears elsewhere in this Proxy Statement. Additional information regarding the processes and procedures of the compensation and management development committee in recommending and determining compensation for our directors and executive officers is set forth below under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Our corporate governance and nominating committee currently consists of Robert C. Arzbaecher (chair), Javed Ahmed, John W. Eaves, Stephen A. Furbacher, Anne P. Noonan, and Michael J. Toelle. During 2018, the corporate governance and nominating committee members were Robert C. Arzbaecher (chair), Javed Ahmed (effective December 2018), William Davisson (from January to May 2018), John W. Eaves, Stephen A. Furbacher, John D. Johnson (from January to May 2018), Robert G. Kuhbach (from January to May 2018), Anne P. Noonan, Edward A. Schmitt (from January to May 2018), and Michael J. Toelle. The Board has affirmatively determined that all of the directors who served on the corporate governance and nominating committee during 2018 and who presently serve on the committee are independent under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE. The corporate governance and nominating committee's responsibilities include identifying and recommending to the Board individuals qualified to serve as directors and on committees of the Board; advising the directors with respect to the Board's composition, procedures, and committees; developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles; and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and the president and chief executive officer. 
      ATTENDANCE OF DIRECTORS AT MEETINGS         
Directors are expected to attend meetings of the Board and the committees on which they serve, as well as our annual meeting of shareholders. A director who is unable to attend a meeting (which it is understood will occur on occasion) is expected to notify the chairman of the Board or the chair of the appropriate committee in advance of such meeting. 
During 2018, the Board held seven meetings, our audit committee held nine meetings, our compensation and management development committee held five meetings, and our corporate governance and nominating committee held five meetings. In 2018, each of our directors attended 100% of the meetings of the Board held during the period for which he or she was serving as a director and 100% of the meetings of those committees on which he or she served held during the periods that he or she served. All ten of our directors then in office attended the 2018 annual meeting, which was held on May 10, 2018. 
      BOARD OVERSIGHT OF STRATEGY AND RISK MANAGEMENT         
Shareholders elect the Board to oversee management and to serve shareholders' long-term interests. Management is responsible for delivering on our strategy, creating our culture, establishing accountability, and managing risk. The Board and its committees work closely with management to balance and align strategy, risk, corporate social responsibility, and other areas while considering feedback from shareholders. Essential to the Board's oversight role is a transparent and active dialogue between the Board and its committees, and management. To support that dialogue, the Board and its committees have access to, receive presentations from, and conduct regular meetings with our executive officers, other internal business and function leaders and subject matter experts, as well as external experts and advisors.  Table of Contents
      Board Oversight of Strategy         
One of the Board's primary responsibilities is reviewing and approving the strategy established by management and measuring our ability to successfully execute it. Throughout the year, the Board and its committees provide oversight and guidance to management regarding our strategy, operating plans, and overall performance. While elements of strategy are embedded in every regularly-scheduled meeting of the Board, the Board also dedicates at least one full day meeting each year to focus on our long-term business strategic planning. At all of these reviews, the Board engages with our executive officers and other business leaders regarding business objectives, the competitive landscape, economic trends, and regulatory developments. At meetings occurring throughout the year, the Board also assesses mergers and acquisitions, our budget and capital allocation plans, and performance for alignment to our strategy. 
      Board Oversight of Risk Management         
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining systems to assess and manage the company's risk exposure, and the Board provides oversight in connection with those efforts. In fulfilling its risk oversight role, the Board focuses on the adequacy of our risk management process and the effectiveness of our overall risk management system. In addition, the Board routinely assesses policies and procedures in critical areas to ensure that the responsibilities and authority delegated to senior management are appropriate from an operational and risk management perspective. The Board also receives regular reports from senior management addressing financial and operational risk exposure and execution, including monthly scorecards and quarterly dashboards that include financial metrics and safety and environmental statistics. 
Our management has established an enterprise risk management ("ERM") program that includes an annual assessment process that is designed to identify risks that could affect us and the achievement of our objectives; to understand, assess, and prioritize those risks; and to facilitate the implementation of risk management strategies and processes across the company that are responsive to the company's risk profile, business strategies, and specific material risk exposures. The ERM program seeks to integrate consideration of risk and risk management into business decision-making throughout the company, including through the implementation of policies and procedures intended to ensure that necessary information with respect to material risks is transmitted to senior executives and, as appropriate, to the Board or relevant committees. 
The Board administers its risk oversight function as a whole and through its committees. In accordance with its charter, the audit committee supports the Board in its oversight of the company's risk management system and process by reviewing and discussing with the key members of management responsible for management of risk the guidelines and policies governing the ERM process, the key risks identified in the ERM process, as well as the likelihood of occurrence and the potential impact assigned to those risks by management, and the risk mitigation strategies in each instance. 
In addition, the audit committee receives regular reports on the efficacy of our information security and technology risks (including cybersecurity) and related policies and procedures from our chief information officer and other members of senior management who are tasked with monitoring cybersecurity risks. 
The other standing committees of the Board oversee management of risks relating to their respective areas of responsibility. The compensation and management development committee reviews risks associated with the design and implementation of our compensation plans and arrangements (see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation and Benefits Risk  Table of Contents
Analysis" below). The nominating and corporate governance committee reviews risks related to our governance structures and processes. 
All Board members are invited to attend every committee meeting, and Board members who do not attend a committee meeting receive information about committee activities and deliberations. 
   Spotlight: Assessing the risks and opportunities associated with climate change  
While the potential impacts of climate change are difficult to predict, we believe climate change presents our company with both risks and opportunities. 
The implications of climate change also present us and our industry with opportunities. We believe the synthetic fertilizers we manufacture are part of the solution to reducing GHG emissions that contribute to climate change. As we discuss further below under the heading "Corporate Governance - Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability," fertilizer is responsible for helping to grow the crops that comprise about half of the world's food supply, which makes life possible for billions of people. Fertilizer also supports sustainable food production because it increases yield per acre, which means farmers need less land to grow the food the world's population needs to survive. By increasing crop yields, our products help limit the conversion of carbon-sequestering forests into farmland. We also manufacture products that reduce GHG emissions from industrial processes and our diesel exhaust fluid product helps reduce nitrous oxide emissions of heavy-duty trucks.  Table of Contents
Our Board and its committees are actively involved in the oversight of our strategy and processes to identify, assess, and address the risks and opportunities to our company associated with climate change. Management provides the Board regular updates on these issues, including during the discussions at the full day Board meeting focused on our long-term business strategic plan and as part of management's review of the enterprise risk management process. 
      SHAREHOLDER ENGAGEMENT         
We believe that building positive relationships with our shareholders is critical to CF Industries' success. We value the views of, and regularly communicate with, our shareholders on a variety of topics, such as our financial performance, corporate governance, executive compensation, corporate responsibility and sustainability, and related matters. As discussed in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis – Shareholder Engagement," we conduct shareholder outreach campaigns in the spring and fall. Management shares the feedback received from shareholders with the Board. Our chairman or other members of the Board may also be available to participate in meetings with shareholders as appropriate. Requests for such a meeting are considered on a case-by-case basis. Our engagement activities have resulted in valuable feedback that has contributed to our decision-making with respect to these matters. We welcome your input and feedback and look forward to continued engagement with our shareholders. 
      COMMUNICATIONS WITH DIRECTORS         
The Board has established a process to receive communications from shareholders and other interested parties. Shareholders and other interested parties may contact any member (or all members) of the Board, any Board committee, or any chair of any such committee by mail. To communicate with the Board, any individual director, or any group or committee of directors, correspondence should be addressed to the Board or any such individual director or group or committee of directors by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent c/o the corporate secretary to our principal executive offices at the address on the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement. 
All communications received as set forth in the preceding paragraph will be opened by the office of our general counsel for the sole purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to one or more of our directors and then forwarded promptly to each addressee. In the case of communications to the Board or any group or committee of directors, the office of the general counsel will distribute copies of the contents to each director who is a member of the Board or of the group or committee to which the envelope or correspondence is addressed. 
      CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY         
Corporate responsibility and sustainability are inherent to our values and our "Do It Right" culture and an intrinsic part of our commitment to the communities in which we live and work. 
      Code of Corporate Conduct         
Our commitment to ethical behavior is captured in our code of corporate conduct, which was adopted by our Board. The code is applicable to all of our directors, officers, and employees, all of whom must acknowledge receiving and reading the code annually. We provide annual code of corporate conduct and anti-corruption training to all employees.  Table of Contents 
A copy of our code of corporate conduct is available at our corporate website, www.cfindustries.com, or by writing to our corporate secretary at the address of our principal executive offices on the Notice of Annual Meeting accompanying this Proxy Statement. We intend to disclose on our corporate website any amendment to any provision of the code that relates to any element of the definition of "code of ethics" enumerated in Item 406(b) of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act, and any waiver from any such provision granted to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller or persons performing similar functions. 
      Political Contributions Report         
We prepare a semiannual Political Contributions Report listing CF Industries' political contributions. Each Political Contributions Report is posted on our corporate website, www.cfindustries.com, and presented to the corporate governance and nominating committee. Additionally, the Political Contributions Reports set forth the United States trade associations and other similar non-profit organizations to which the company annually pays dues of $20,000 or more and identify the portion of such dues that is used for advocacy and/or political activities by those associations. The most recent Political Contributions Report and our code of corporate conduct, containing our corporate policies related to political activities and contributions, lobbying and related matters, are currently available on our corporate website. 
      Charitable Contributions Report         
We also prepare a semiannual Charitable Contributions Report listing CF Industries' charitable contributions that exceed $20,000. Each Charitable Contributions Report is posted on our corporate website, www.cfindustries.com. Most of our philanthropic and social outreach initiatives are locally based. This enables each of our facilities to address the unique needs and opportunities in their respective communities. 
      Sustainability         
CF Industries is a leader in an industry whose mission is fundamental to human survival: putting food on the world's table. By providing plant nutrients to farmers, we feed the crops that feed the world and produce building blocks for a better life. We are proud of the role our company plays in fulfilling this increasingly challenging mission. We also believe our company has an important role to play in addressing some of the most critical challenges of our time. As a company, we are confronting issues such as energy efficiency, resource use, and economic growth. We prepare annual Corporate Sustainability Reports, each of which is posted on our corporate website, www.cfindustries.com, and presented to the corporate governance and nominating committee. 
Our most recent Corporate Sustainability Report communicates our performance across fundamental environmental, health and safety, social, and other considerations. Our report includes information regarding our carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions, which we report every year. It also discusses how we estimate that our products actually prevent and reduce more CO2 equivalent emissions than we generate. For example, land use is the leading cause of CO2 emissions in agriculture. Because our products increase yields substantially, farmers need less land to grow the food the world population needs to survive. By increasing crop yields, we help limit the conversion of carbon-sequestering forests into farmland. Our products also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial processes. In addition, our diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) product helps substantially reduce nitrous oxide emissions of heavy-duty trucks while also improving fuel efficiency.  Table of Contents
Our most recent Corporate Sustainability Report also discusses our partnership with The Nature Conservatory through which we seek to help improve soil health across the state of Iowa. The program, called 4R Plus, is designed to increase awareness and understanding among Iowa's farmers and crop advisers of two important farming practices: (1) 4R Nutrient Stewardship, and (2) conservation. 4R Nutrient Stewardship refers to the concept of applying the right nutrient source at the right rate, right time, and right place. The "Plus" in 4R Plus refers to a suite of in-field and edge-of-field conservation practices that increase soil resiliency and help to keep nutrients on fields and out of adjacent water bodies. When implemented effectively, 4R Plus practices will not only improve soil health and water quality, but also increase farmers' yields and bottom lines. 
To help spread 4R Plus awareness and understanding, CF and The Nature Conservancy developed a range of marketing materials and tools to spread the message as far as possible. Those materials are based on extensive qualitative and quantitative research that showed that the key drivers to increased 4R Plus adoption by farmers moving forward are the economic benefits that come with 4R Plus practices and farmers' desire to leave their land in the best condition for the next generation. Nearly 40 partners have joined the initiative as of its formal launch in 2018, including state commodity groups, agribusinesses, conservation organizations, government agencies, universities and others. 
      DIRECTOR COMPENSATION         
Non-employee directors receive compensation, including fees and reimbursements of expenses, for their service and dedication to our company. We recognize the substantial time and effort required to serve as director of a large public company like ours. We believe that compensation for non-employee directors should be competitive and should encourage increased ownership of CF Industries stock through the payment of a portion of director compensation in shares of our stock. In order to further align the interests of our directors with the interests of our shareholders, our non-employee directors are required to achieve and maintain stock ownership with a market value equal to five times their annual cash retainer. 
Our compensation and management development committee is responsible for reviewing director compensation and making recommendations to the Board. The committee reviews the compensation of our non-employee directors annually. In connection with its annual review of the compensation of our non-employee directors, the committee also authorizes its compensation consultant, Exequity, to work with our human resources department to compare the compensation of our non-employee directors with compensation paid to comparable directors at peer companies and the overall market based on the 2016-2017 National Association of Corporate Directors survey on director compensation. (See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Role of the Compensation Consultant.") This information showed the additional annual cash retainer amounts paid to the chairman of the Board and the chairs of the Board committees and the value of the annual restricted stock grant to directors were below median. Based on this review, in May 2018 the compensation and management development committee recommended to the Board and the Board approved an increase in the amount of the additional annual cash retainers paid to the chairman of the Board and the chairs of the Board committees and the value of the annual restricted stock grant to directors to the amounts set forth below. Although the non-employee director compensation program is reviewed annually, this was the first change to the amount of cash or equity compensation paid to directors who are not the chairman of the Board since 2013 and the first change to the cash or equity compensation paid to the chairman of the Board since Mr. Furbacher was first elected chairman in 2014.  Table of Contents
      Annual Cash Retainer         
Each non-employee director is entitled to an annual cash retainer of $100,000, payable quarterly. We do not pay meeting fees to our directors. The chairman of the Board and the chairs of the Board committees receive additional annual cash retainers in the following amounts, payable quarterly: 
      Annual Restricted Stock Grant         
Each non-employee director will receive, upon joining the Board, a restricted stock grant with a fair market value of $130,000 (or, in the case of the chairman of the Board, $230,000), rounded to the nearest whole share. Thereafter, each continuing non-employee director will receive an annual restricted stock grant with a fair market value of $130,000 (or, in the case of the chairman of the Board, $230,000), rounded to the nearest whole share, on the date of each annual meeting of the shareholders. Assuming continuing service as a non-employee director, all shares of restricted stock will vest on the earlier of (x) the date of the first annual meeting of the shareholders following the date of grant or (y) the first anniversary of the date of grant. 
      2018 Total Director Compensation         
The following table sets forth cash and non-cash compensation with respect to the year ended December 31, 2018, for our non-employee directors. Mr. Will receives no additional compensation for his service as a director.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE  
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and officers and persons who own more than 10% of our common stock to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC and the NYSE, and to furnish us with copies of the reports. Specific due dates for these reports have been established and we are required to report in this Proxy Statement any failure by directors, officers, and ten percent holders to file such reports on a timely basis. Based on our review of such reports and written representations from our directors and officers, we believe that all such filing requirements were timely met during 2018. 
      POLICY REGARDING RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS       
We recognize that transactions with related persons can present potential or actual conflicts of interest and create the appearance that our decisions are based on considerations other than the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is our preference to avoid such transactions. 
Nevertheless, we recognize that there are situations where related person transactions may be in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the company and its shareholders, including but not limited to situations where we may obtain products or services of a nature, quantity, or quality, or on other terms, that are not readily available from alternative sources, or when we provide products or services to related persons on an arm's length basis on terms comparable to those provided to unrelated third parties or on terms comparable to those provided to employees generally. 
In order to deal with the potential conflicts inherent in such transactions, our audit committee has adopted a written policy regarding related person transactions. For the purposes of this policy, a "related person transaction" is a transaction, arrangement, or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements, or relationships) in which the company was, is, or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any related person had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than (a) transactions where the rates or charges involved in the transaction are determined by competitive bids, or the transaction involves the rendering of services as a common or contract carrier, or public utility, at rates or charges fixed in conformity with law or governmental authority; (b) transactions involving services as a bank depositary of funds, transfer agent, registrar, or trustee under a trust indenture, or similar services; (c) transactions in which the interest of the related person derives solely from his or her service as a director of another entity that is a party to the transaction; or (d) transactions in which the interest of the related person derives solely from his or her ownership of less than 10% of the equity interest in another entity (other than a general partnership interest) which is a party to the transaction. 
In addition, transactions involving the purchase of products or services (other than personal or professional services) from an entity for which a director of the company or an immediate family member of a director serves as an executive officer shall not be considered to involve a material interest on the part of such director (and therefore shall not be considered related person transactions) if (i) the director did not participate in the decision on the part of the company to enter into such transactions, (ii) the transactions are made in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for transactions with other unrelated third parties, and (iii) the amount paid in all transactions with any such entity in a twelve-month period is less than the greater of $500,000 or 1% of  Table of Contents such entity's consolidated gross revenues for the most recently completed fiscal year for which data is publicly available. 
For purposes of the policy, a "related person" means:
Except as described below with respect to certain commercial transactions in the ordinary course of business, any proposed transaction with a related person shall be consummated or amended only if the following steps are taken:
At the audit committee's first meeting of each fiscal year, the committee shall review any previously approved related person transactions that remain ongoing and have a remaining term of more than six months or remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the company of more than $120,000. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, taking into  Table of Contents consideration the company's contractual obligations, the committee shall determine if it is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders to continue, modify, or terminate the related person transaction. 
FMR and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, "Fidelity") own in the aggregate more than 5% of our outstanding common stock and, therefore, are considered related persons under our policy regarding related person transactions. We have agreements in place for Fidelity to provide administrative and trustee services for the company's 401(k) and deferred compensation plans. During 2018, Fidelity earned approximately $108,000 from us and approximately $101,000 from plan participants for these services. At its first meeting in 2019, the audit committee reviewed and approved the transactions with, and ongoing administrative services from, Fidelity in accordance with our policy. 
No member of the audit committee shall participate in any review, consideration, or approval of any related person transaction with respect to which such member or any of his or her immediate family members is the related person. 
Sales of our products and services to related persons in the ordinary course of business, at prices and on terms consistent with those offered to similarly situated customers in our industry in transactions between unaffiliated parties will generally not be subject to the approval procedures described above; provided, however, that any (i) modification or amendment of a multi-year supply contract or (ii) entry into, modification, or amendment of a similar long-term supply contract with any related person will be subject to the same procedures under this policy as are applicable to any other related person transactions.

      PROPOSAL 2: ADVISORY VOTE ON COMPENSATION OF NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS ("SAY ON PAY")       
Pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act, our shareholders are entitled to an advisory (non-binding) vote to approve the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, including in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) beginning on page 43 and the Executive Compensation tables and accompanying narrative discussion beginning on page 79. This proposal is commonly referred to as a "Say on Pay" proposal. 
The Board and the compensation and management development committee believe that the compensation of the executive officers named in this Proxy Statement is appropriate for the company and in the best interests of our shareholders over the long term. As discussed in more detail in the CD&A beginning on page 43, our compensation programs are intended to:
While still nearly 80%, we were disappointed that our 2018 say-on-pay vote yielded lower shareholder support than previous years when support levels exceeded 90%. As discussed in our CD&A under the heading "Executive Summary - Shareholder Engagement," we conducted extensive shareholder outreach both before and after our 2018 annual meeting. In these conversations, the overwhelming majority of shareholders supported the design of our ongoing compensation program. 
We have stock ownership guidelines and an incentive compensation "clawback" policy to encourage appropriate levels of risk taking by our management. We continue to provide for significant levels of "at risk" performance-based compensation, which further aligns executive and shareholder interests. As discussed in our CD&A under the heading "Executive Compensation Program Changes for 2018," the compensation and management development committee approved several significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2018 that further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment of our programs and focus our executives on metrics that are directly correlated to value creation for shareholders. For example, beginning with 2018 grants for named executive officers, the compensation committee increased the percentage of the total long-term incentive award value allocated to performance-vesting restricted stock units ("PRSUs") to 60%, increased the percentage allocated to time-vesting restricted stock units ("RSUs") to 40% and eliminated stock option awards. 
We will continue to regularly review (along with outside compensation consultants) our executive compensation programs to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy, and we are committed to continuing our dialogue with shareholders so that we can be proactive in responding to emerging industry trends and be responsive to shareholder dialogue. 
Accordingly, we are asking you to vote FOR the adoption of the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the shareholders of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. approve the compensation of the CF Industries Holdings, Inc.'s named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange  Table of Contents
Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and related narrative discussion." 
As an advisory vote, this proposal is not binding on the company. Although the vote is non-binding, the Board and the compensation and management development committee value the opinions of our shareholders and will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. 
We currently hold our advisory "Say on Pay" proposal every year. Therefore, the next advisory "Say on Pay" proposal would be held at our 2020 annual meeting. Shareholders will have an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on the frequency of "Say on Pay" proposals at least every six years. We currently expect that the next advisory vote on the frequency of the "Say on Pay" proposals will occur at the 2023 annual meeting of shareholders. 
      Board Recommendation         
      The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the Say on Pay proposal.          Table of Contents

Modern nitrogen production begins with the production of ammonia through the Haber-Bosch chemical process. Ammonia is the most concentrated nitrogen fertilizer product as it contains 82% nitrogen and is the "basic" nitrogen product that we upgrade into other nitrogen products such as granular urea, UAN and AN. We produce ammonia at all of our nitrogen manufacturing complexes using natural gas as the feedstock.  Table of Contents
   Recent Investments Positioning Us for Profitable Growth  
Beginning in 2012, the company underwent a major capital expansion program, adding capacity at two of our facilities. Both projects began ammonia production in the second half of 2016 and have now achieved consistent, stable operations with production above expectations. In total, the two expansions have increased our nitrogen production capacity by more than 25%. In addition, we acquired the 50% equity interest in our UK facilities not previously owned by us in 2015. Taking operational control allowed us to increase its asset utilization nearly 20% by 2017. During 2018, we invested in our production capacity by exercising our right to purchase all of the publicly traded common units of Terra Nitrogen Company, L.P. The following chart illustrates the growth in our gross ammonia capacity and actual production over the past five years.  Table of Contents
   Financial Results are Impacted by Highly Cyclical Commodity Prices  
Our financial results are significantly impacted by the pronounced effects of highly volatile commodity prices for fertilizer products. In 2015 and 2016, nitrogen product prices were lower and stayed at depressed levels longer than expected. Product prices remained volatile throughout 2017, and the year ended with a meaningful decline in the pricing environment. As a result, our financial performance and corresponding incentive compensation programs were negatively impacted during 2015, 2016, and 2017. Going into 2018, we expected price volatility to continue through 2018, followed by a sustained price recovery driven by a tightening supply demand balance.

       2018 Performance Highlights         
Management prepares the company's annual business plan and reviews it in detail with the Board. To develop the annual plan, management utilizes a combination of factors, including its view of current conditions, recent historical performance, internal forecasts, as well as external public market indicators such as natural gas futures. The compensation and management development committee utilizes the annual business plan in connection with setting goals and targets for our incentive compensation programs at the end of each calendar year. 
Actual results in 2018 differed from the company's forecasts as product prices improved more rapidly than anticipated – contributing to higher revenue and margins. At the same time, the cost of our principle feedstock, natural gas, declined compared to the market expectations reflected in forward market curves when setting our budget. During 2018, we also exceeded our production goals. This combination of a more advantageous pricing environment, lower natural gas costs, and efficient production contributed to the strong financial results illustrated below.  Table of Contents
   Operating Results  
   Annual Incentive Plan Performance Metrics  
Higher global nitrogen prices and lower natural gas costs drove the company's financial performance in 2018 compared to the year's target. Producers in Asia and Europe experienced significantly higher-than-expected increases in feedstock costs during 2018. The average annual price per MMBtu of natural gas at the Dutch TTF trading hub was 35 percent higher in 2018 compared to 2017; the average annual price per MMBtu for liquefied natural gas in Asia was 43 percent higher; and the price per metric ton of anthracite coal in China was 25 percent higher. These higher feedstock costs, along with continued enforcement of environmental regulations in China, resulted in lower production in these regions, tightening the global supply and demand balance and increasing global nitrogen prices significantly compared to 2017. At the same time, CF's natural gas cost per MMBtu in cost of sales for 2018 was five percent lower than in 2017, supporting significantly higher margins for the company during the year. 
Additionally, the company continued to deliver against its strategic priorities and create long-term shareholder value. 
(1)             EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense-net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. See Appendix A for a reconciliation of EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.  
(2)             The Secondary Metric, Tons of Ammonia Produced, has a behavioral safety gate threshold. If at least 95% of the aggregated safety grades of all employees at manufacturing sites were a "B" or better for the year, the safety performance gating requirement would be achieved. If the safety performance gating requirement was not achieved, there would be no payout under the Secondary Metric.  Table of Contents
   Total Shareholder Return  
We firmly believe that, due to the cyclical nature of the commodity chemical industry in which we operate, it is important to view performance over a longer time horizon than just one year. Our execution of initiatives aligned with our strategy helped us achieve our vision – delivering superior shareholder returns over the cycle. The following table shows the cumulative total shareholder return, assuming the reinvestment of dividends, for our common stock and a peer group index for the 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10-year periods ended December 31, 2018. In constructing the peer group index, we have selected Agrium Inc. (Agrium), Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc. (PotashCorp) and The Mosaic Company (Mosaic), all of which were publicly traded manufacturers of agricultural chemical fertilizers with headquarters in North America during the periods. On January 2, 2018, Agrium and PotashCorp completed a merger of equals transaction to form Nutrien Ltd. (Nutrien). See the notes following the table for the methodology used to measure TSR. 
Prior to January 2, 2018, common shares of each of Agrium and PotashCorp traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). On January 2, 2018, Agrium and PotashCorp completed a merger of equals transaction to form Nutrien. Nutrien common shares began trading on the NYSE on January 2, 2018 and trading of common shares of Agrium and PotashCorp was concurrently halted. In the merger of equals transaction, each common share of PotashCorp was exchanged for 0.40 common shares of Nutrien and each common share of Agrium was exchanged for 2.23 common shares of Nutrien.
For purposes of calculating the TSR of CF Industries and the peer group index for the 1-year period ending December 31, 2018, the peer group was composed of Nutrien and Mosaic and the beginning stock price for each company was established by its respective closing price on January 2, 2018 (the first trading day for Nutrien shares). The returns of the peer group companies were weighted according to their respective market capitalizations as of January 2, 2018.
For purposes of calculating the TSR of CF Industries and the peer group index for the 3, 5, 7, and 10-year periods ending December 31, 2018, the peer group at the beginning of the measurement period was composed of Mosaic, Agrium, and PotashCorp and the beginning stock price for each company was established by its respective closing price on the last trading day immediately preceding January 1 of the first fiscal year of the applicable measurement period. The returns of the peer group companies were weighted according to their respective market capitalizations as of the date used to establish the beginning stock price. The cumulative investment in each of Agrium and PotashCorp, assuming dividend reinvestments up to December 31, 2017, was converted into   Table of Contents shares of Nutrien on January 2, 2018 using the exchange ratio in the merger of equals transaction consummated on that date.
      Shareholder Engagement         
We believe that building positive relationships with our shareholders is critical to CF Industries' success. We value the views of and regularly communicate with our shareholders on a variety of topics, including corporate governance, executive compensation and related matters. Management shares the feedback received from shareholders with the Board. Our chairman and other members of the Board are available to participate in meetings with shareholders as appropriate. Requests for such meetings are considered on a case-by-case basis. Our engagement activities have resulted in valuable feedback that has contributed to our decision-making with respect to these matters. We welcome your input and feedback and look forward to continued engagement with our shareholders. 
We conduct shareholder outreach campaigns in the spring and in the fall. Our engagements in the spring are primarily focused on ballot items on which shareholders will vote at our annual meeting. Our engagements in the fall generally focus on voting outcomes from our prior annual meeting – including direct shareholder feedback on how they voted on ballot items – as well as potential corporate governance or executive compensation changes the Board and its committees are considering. The fall engagement also presents an opportunity to discuss with shareholders developments in their methodologies and analyses and potential future areas of focus. 
   2018 Shareholder Engagement Campaign  
In the first half of 2018 leading up to our 2018 annual meeting, we contacted our top 30 shareholders comprising approximately 75% of our outstanding shares to invite them to speak with members of our senior management and the chair of our compensation and management development committee. Combined, management and our compensation and management development committee chair met with 15 shareholders representing approximately 60% of our outstanding shares in advance of our 2018 annual meeting, discussing with these shareholders our compensation program, special meeting right, and other governance focused matters. In these conversations, the overwhelming majority of shareholders supported the design of our ongoing compensation program (as evidenced by the nearly 80% of votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay vote). This feedback was relayed to the compensation and management development committee and full Board.  Table of Contents 
   Responsiveness to 2018 Say-on-Pay Vote  
While still nearly 80%, we were disappointed that our 2018 say-on-pay vote yielded lower shareholder support than previous years when support levels exceeded 90%. As part of our fall shareholder engagement campaign, the compensation and management development committee requested management engage with shareholders on this topic specifically to better understand why some investors opposed our say-on-pay proposal. 
During the second half of 2018 following our 2018 annual meeting, we contacted 19 shareholders comprising approximately 70% of our outstanding shares inviting them to speak with members of our senior management. We held meetings with 13 shareholders representing approximately 45% of our outstanding shares. While a minority of shareholders expressed concerns regarding the supplemental shareholder alignment award the compensation and management development committee granted in 2017 – which was a rare action taken by the committee in unique circumstances – the overwhelming majority of shareholders supported the design of our compensation program (as evidenced by the nearly 80% of votes cast in favor of our say-on-pay vote). This feedback was relayed to the compensation and management development committee and the full Board. 
As discussed below under the heading "Executive Compensation Program Changes for 2018," the compensation and management development committee approved several significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2018 that further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment of our programs and focus our executives on metrics that are directly correlated to value creation for shareholders. Based on shareholder feedback received in 2018, the compensation and management development committee determined that no significant additional changes to our executive compensation program are warranted for 2019. 
We will continue to regularly review (along with outside compensation consultants) our executive compensation programs to ensure alignment with our compensation philosophy, and we are committed to continuing our dialogue with shareholders so that we can be proactive in responding to emerging industry trends and be responsive to shareholder dialogue. 
      Compensation Program Overview         
Our total direct compensation is targeted at the 50th percentile of our peer group. The compensation and management development committee considers skills, performance, capabilities, experience, criticality of the role, and the future potential of each executive in setting actual compensation, therefore total direct compensation can be above or below the 50th percentile for different individuals.

*         EBITDA is computed as the sum of (i) net earnings attributable to common stockholders  plus (ii) interest expense (income)—net plus (iii) income taxes  plus (iv) depreciation, depletion, and amortization less (v) loan fee amortization. 
**       Adjusted EBITDA is computed as the sum of (i) EBITDA (described above) plus (ii) unrealized mark to market losses (gains) on hedges plus (iii) restructuring, exit, impairments, system implementation costs or similar types of costs plus (viii) non-capitalized expansion project costs  plus (ix) losses (gains) recognized due to the acquisition or disposal of a business or group of assets that represents a major portion of the business less (x) profits (losses) associated with acquisitions or divestitures completed during the year.  
***     Average Return on Net Assets (RONA) is determined by reference to the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of adjusted EBITDA (as defined for purposes of our 2018 annual incentive plan) divided by average operational assets. The "average operational assets" denominator of this metric is essentially the simple average of the beginning and year-end values for  the sum of (i) total assets less (ii) cash and cash equivalents  less (iii) restricted cash less (iv) short-term investments  less (v) investments in marketable equity securities less (vi) prepaid income taxes less (vii) total current liabilities less (viii) long-term deferred income taxes  less (ix) other noncurrent liabilities less (x) assets associated with major capital projects (as approved by the compensation committee) less (xi) net assets associated with acquisitions and divestitures completed during the year  plus (xii) short-term debt or notes payable included in current liabilities.  
      Executive Compensation Program Changes for 2018         
In December 2017, the compensation and management development committee approved several significant changes to our executive compensation program for 2018 that further strengthen the pay-for-performance alignment of our programs and focus our executives on metrics that are directly correlated to value creation for shareholders. 
   Annual Incentive Program Changes  
Subject to the achievement of a threshold EBITDA performance metric, actual annual incentive payments for 2018 were determined based on primary and secondary performance metrics. The Primary Metric of Adjusted EBITDA and its 75% weighting were unchanged from 2017. The Secondary Metric in the annual incentive program for 2018 was based on our achievement of ammonia production goals, subject to first achieving a gating level of  Table of Contents performance on safety practices. The production metric and safety "gate" demonstrate our focus on excellence in terms of operational execution and underscore our commitment to driving workplace safety. 
   Long-Term Incentive Program Changes  
In the long-term incentive program, changes approved by the compensation and management development committee increased the portion of equity awards that are explicitly linked to long-term company performance:
In addition to increasing the portion of equity awards explicitly linked to long-term performance, the compensation and management development committee also approved changes to the metrics used for measuring performance with respect to the PRSUs:
In deciding to measure RONA annually for three years, the compensation and management development committee considered the difficulty in establishing appropriate long-term performance measures for the company given the inherent cyclicality in our industry as well as the pronounced effects of highly volatile commodity prices for raw materials and fertilizer products upon our operating results. 
The target TSR performance level for the modifier in the 2018 PRSUs was set to reflect a compound annual TSR equal to 7%, which is the approximate average annual real total return for the S&P 500 Index since inception. Maximum performance was set at a level well above the average, and threshold performance was set at a level below which a maximum reduction was appropriate. In structuring the TSR modifier, the compensation and management development committee determined not to use a relative TSR benchmark because there are not enough similarly sized companies with comparable business lines in which the committee could assemble a peer group for meaningful TSR performance purposes, and the committee considered that basing the TSR modifier on a broad market comparison (e.g., the S&P 500) over a three-year period would not be appropriate given the cyclicality of our business. 
      2018 Target Total Compensation         
The compensation and management development committee believes the majority of compensation should be composed of awards that are performance-based – with direct ties to the Company and individual employee performance. The significant majority of each NEO's target compensation is at-risk based on company performance.  Table of Contents

   2018 CEO Target Total Compensation  
The compensation and management development committee determined that our CEO's base salary and the target value of his incentive awards for 2018 should remain unchanged from those in effect in 2016 and 2017 due to target compensation continuing to be in line with our Industry Reference Group (described in greater detail below) and the overall general industry survey data and in recognition of industry market conditions at the time. The committee believes this underscores that our executive compensation program is working, that payouts are appropriately aligned with performance, and that salaries and the target value for incentive awards are appropriately benchmarked.

      Compensation Governance Practices         
Our executive compensation practices are overseen and administered by the compensation and management development committee, which is comprised exclusively of independent directors. The committee is responsible for designing an executive compensation program – including approving any changes to it – that effectively incentivizes our executives to create  Table of Contents long-term value. Key compensation governance practices that govern the committee's approach to these responsibilities are described below:

      COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: IN DETAIL         
      Compensation Philosophy         
Our compensation and management development committee has adopted a compensation philosophy that seeks to align the interests of our employees and our shareholders through focusing on the total compensation (base salary, short-term incentives, long-term incentives, and benefits) of our employees, including our NEOs. We seek to benefit from this strategy by attracting key talent, retaining strong performers, increasing productivity, and maximizing operational and financial results, while also implementing compensation programs that are cost effective, market competitive, and sustainable across business cycles. 
Our executive compensation program is designed to reward executives for their contributions to our short-term and long-term results. Annual cash incentive compensation is based on the achievement of annual performance goals – both financial and operating objectives – while the majority of executives' long-term incentive opportunity is based on performance against criteria that are correlated with both annual and long-term shareholder value. 
Our goal is to provide direct compensation to our NEOs that is market competitive with other comparable companies. To obtain a general understanding of current compensation practices, the compensation and management development committee received in 2018 a market assessment from its independent outside compensation consultant, Exequity LLP ("Exequity"), that was derived from published survey compensation data, which Exequity adjusted for variations in revenue among the included companies. To further gauge the competitiveness of our total compensation offering, we also compare ourselves against our Industry Reference Group, which is a group of 18 similar companies in related industries. Additional information regarding this group of companies is set forth below under the heading "Use of Industry Reference Group." 
Our total direct compensation for our NEOs is targeted at the 50th percentile of our peer group. The compensation and management development committee considers skills, performance, capabilities, experience, criticality of the role, and the future potential of each executive in setting actual compensation, therefore total direct compensation can be above or below the 50th percentile for different individuals. 
Incentive opportunities are structured in a way that recognizes our cyclicality and emphasis on a team-based culture.  Table of Contents

   Compensation Metrics Tie to Business Strategy  
The compensation and management development committee selects performance metrics for our incentive compensation programs that align executive interests with those of our shareholders. Executives are focused on achieving top performance across metrics that are directly tied to shareholder value creation and our core strategic objectives, as indicated below:  Table of Contents
      Evolution of Compensation Program         
The compensation and management development committee seeks to ensure that the compensation program aligns with the company's strategic objectives. Over time, the committee has refined the program, notably the incentive plan metrics, to align executives' focus areas with strategic imperatives that have evolved along with market conditions and our operations. Our primary metric for each of the last three years has been Adjusted EBITDA at a weighting of 50% to 75%. 
   Annual Incentive Program Changes  
Changes to our secondary metric demonstrate our commitment to safety and the "Do It Right" culture. Operating in a safe and responsible manner is a core value and an integral part of what sets CF Industries apart to all our stakeholders. Our safety strategy permeates our business in three key ways: Table of Contents
Our commitment to safety never takes a day off, and we have demonstrated that our focus on this priority is yielding positive results. 
   2018 Long-Term Incentive Program Changes

In addition to increasing the portion of equity awards explicitly linked to long-term performance, the compensation and management development committee also approved changes to the metrics used for measuring performance with respect to the PRSUs:
In deciding to measure RONA annually for three years, the compensation and management development committee considered the difficulty in establishing appropriate long-term performance measures for the company given the inherent cyclicality in our industry as well as the pronounced effects of highly volatile commodity prices for raw materials and fertilizer products upon our operating results. 
The target TSR performance level for the modifier in the 2018 PRSUs was set to reflect a compound annual TSR equal to 7%, which is the approximate average annual real total return for the S&P 500 Index since inception. Maximum performance was set at a level well above the average, and threshold performance was set at a level below which a maximum reduction was appropriate. In structuring the TSR modifier, the compensation and management development committee determined not to use a relative TSR benchmark because there are not enough similarly sized companies with comparable business lines in which the committee could assemble a peer group for meaningful TSR performance purposes, and the committee considered that basing the TSR modifier on a broad market comparison (e.g., the S&P 500) over a three-year period would not be appropriate given the cyclicality of our business.

      The Compensation Process         
   Allocation of Compensation Elements  
We provide a mixture of cash compensation and non-cash compensation to our NEOs. The cash portion consists primarily of base salaries and short-term incentive awards. The non-cash portion consists primarily of stock-based long-term incentive awards. 
Our allocation among base salary, short-term incentives, and long-term incentives varies significantly by management level, reflecting individual responsibility levels and competitive market practices. In general, our more senior executive officers receive a greater percentage of their total expected compensation in the form of incentives (particularly long-term incentives) and a correspondingly lower percentage in the form of salary. 
In addition to using benchmark survey data, we also consider internal factors that may cause us to adjust particular elements of an individual executive officer's compensation. These factors may include an individual's operating responsibilities, management level, tenure, and performance in the position. 
To assist in its evaluation, our compensation and management development committee reviews the details of an executive's historical and proposed compensation as described below, including a review of our NEOs' existing base salaries and target annual incentive levels in connection with the approval of their new base salaries and target annual incentive levels for the following year. 
In addition, four times per year the compensation and management development committee reviews reports regarding our NEOs' holdings and transactions involving our stock, including our NEOs' holdings of stock and long-term stock-based incentive awards, stock option exercises, purchases, sales and gifts of stock, and surrenders of vested shares of restricted stock in order to satisfy withholding tax requirements, as applicable. 
   Compensation Benchmarking  
Our total direct compensation is targeted at the 50th percentile of our Industry Reference Group. The compensation and management development committee considers skills, performance, capabilities, experience, criticality of the role, and the future potential of each NEO in setting actual compensation; therefore, total direct compensation can be above or below the 50th percentile for different NEOs. 
   Committee Process for Incentive Target-Setting  
Our industry is inherently cyclical, with ±50% swings in product pricing not uncommon, impacting significantly our financial results. When setting performance hurdles for our incentive compensation programs, the compensation and management development committee considers historical performance and management's outlook. This outlook is built through a rigorous process incorporating current and futures prices for commodities and other external indicators relevant to our business. 
The timing – in terms of calendar – of the compensation and management development committee's decision-making process around target-setting for our incentive compensation programs is particularly important to understanding its limited visibility into certain external  Table of Contents factors that have the potential to significantly impact our financial and operating results, including natural gas prices, international trade policies, weather, etc.

      Review and Approval of 2018 Cash Compensation         
In setting cash compensation levels for 2018, the compensation and management development committee reviewed the base salaries and target annual and long-term incentives for our NEOs that had been in effect for 2017 and, in December 2017, approved levels for 2018 that were unchanged from those in effect for 2017. 
In connection with its review of the existing cash compensation levels that had been in effect for 2017, the compensation and management development committee reviewed a report from its outside compensation consultant, Exequity, to obtain a general understanding of current compensation practices. In performing its market assessment, Exequity used published survey compensation data, and adjusted for variations in revenue among the included companies. 
In addition, the compensation and management development committee reviewed information provided by the compensation consultant regarding the publicly reported cash compensation of NEOs of the group of companies in our Industry Reference Group, which is comprised of 18 companies in related industries. Additional information regarding this group of companies is set forth below under the heading "Use of Industry Reference Group." 
The compensation and management development committee also considered cash compensation recommendations from our chief executive officer for each of the NEOs other than himself. These recommendations took into account the chief executive officer's assessment of each individual's operating responsibilities, management level, tenure and performance in the position, and potential. 
   Review of Base Salary Compensation  
During its review of NEO's base salaries, the compensation and management development committee considered all of this information in the context of the goals and objectives of our  Table of Contents executive compensation plans. As noted above, we seek to pay salaries in line with individual performance and contribution to company goals. 
   Review of the Short-term Incentive Program  
During its review of our short-term incentive program, the compensation and management development committee considered the following general goals:
The compensation and management development committee also considered the following factors specific to our company:
In addition, the compensation and management development committee reviewed a report from Exequity, the committee's outside compensation consultant, regarding competitive market practices with respect to the use of short-term incentives. 
The compensation committee considered all of this information in the context of the goals and objectives of our executive compensation plans. As noted above, we use short-term incentives to provide executive officers and other employees with the opportunity to earn additional annual compensation beyond base salary. The role of short-term incentives is to reward and encourage the achievement of annual financial results and other specified corporate performance goals. In the aggregate our short-term incentive awards are targeted at the median of the peer group companies in our Industry Reference Group and the overall  Table of Contents general industry market data from the outside compensation consultant's market assessment. Additional information regarding these goals and objectives is set forth above under the headings "Compensation Philosophy" and "Components of Compensation." 
   Selection of Threshold EBITDA Performance Metric for 2018  
Based on its review and the other factors discussed above, the compensation and management development committee determined that the annual incentive awards to our NEOs for 2018 would be subject to the attainment of a threshold EBITDA performance metric of $300 million for the company's 2018 fiscal year. If that level of EBITDA was achieved for 2018, each NEO would become eligible for an annual incentive award with respect to 2018 of up to $3 million, which amount would be subject to reduction in the discretion of the compensation and management development committee (sometimes referred to as "negative discretion"). If the threshold EBITDA performance metric had not been attained, no annual incentive awards would be made to the NEOs. 
The compensation and management development committee determined that the use of a threshold EBITDA performance metric, combined with the committee's right to use negative discretion, provided the maximum level of flexibility to reward and encourage the achievement of annual financial results and other specified corporate performance goals while retaining the ability to pay incentive awards to executive officers which were deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
   Selection of Primary and Secondary Performance Metrics for 2018  
If the threshold EBITDA performance metric was attained, it was the compensation committee's intention to use its negative discretion to pay 2018 annual bonuses based upon our level of achievement of the following primary and secondary performance metrics:
The compensation and management development committee established the following performance levels and corresponding percentages of target opportunity earned with respect to the Primary Metric for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Performance Level                  Primary Metric      Adjusted EBITDA Achieved                    Percentage of   Primary Metric   Target Award Earned                     
 Below Threshold   Less than $600 million   0%     
 Threshold   $600 million   50%     
 Target   $825 million   100%     
 Maximum   $1.25 billion   200%     
[END TABLE]
Straight line interpolation is used to determine the achievement percentage for the Primary Metric between threshold and target and between target and maximum performance levels. 
For the Secondary Metric, each of our production and distribution facilities develops and implements specific behavioral safety objectives that are pertinent and meaningful to each work group at the site. Each employee is involved in developing and taking ownership for  Table of Contents completing objectives that make their workplace safer and effect a positive change in the safety culture. 
Each quarter, evaluations are conducted and an overall achievement grade (A through F) for each hourly group and individual manager is assigned. Under the Secondary Metric, the quarterly grades issued to all site employees were aggregated. If at least 95% of the grades were "B" or better for the year, the safety performance gating requirement would be achieved. If the safety performance gating requirement was not achieved, there would be no payout under the Secondary Metric. 
The compensation and management development committee established the following ammonia production performance levels and corresponding percentages of target opportunity earned with respect to the Secondary Metric for 2018, subject to first achieving the safety performance gating requirement: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    Performance Level                  Secondary Metric      Tons of Ammonia Produced                    Percentage of   Secondary Metric   Target Award Earned                     
 Below Threshold   Less than 9.1 million tons   0%     
 Threshold   9.1 million tons   50%     
 Target   9.6 million tons   100%     
 Maximum   10.1 million tons   200%     
[END TABLE]
Straight line interpolation is used to determine the achievement percentage for the Secondary Metric between threshold and target and between target and maximum performance levels. 
The ammonia production performance levels were set by the compensation and management development committee based on the company's 2018 business plan, which was prepared taking into account a number of factors, including historical performance and planned maintenance and turnaround activity at production facilities. During 2018, more of the company's ammonia units were scheduled for downtime for turnaround and maintenance activity than in 2017, resulting in an expected decrease in production levels on a year-over-year basis and performance levels were set accordingly. 
The compensation and management development committee retained discretion to adjust the performance levels to address circumstances that impact our ability to meet production expectations, such as market-based curtailments, severe weather events or other events of force majeure that result in production outages, and other adjustments approved by the compensation and management development committee. 
   Target-Setting Considerations for the Short-Term Incentive Program  
When setting performance levels for the short-term incentive program, the compensation and management development committee takes into account historical performance and management's outlook. Measured over an extended period, the objective of the committee is to select financial performance levels such that we have a roughly (i) 80% probability of exceeding the threshold level, (ii) 50% probability of exceeding the target level, and (iii) 20% probability of exceeding the maximum level. 
Although the compensation and management development committee considers management's outlook as one of several factors in evaluating financial performance levels each year, the committee also recognizes that the outlook for any particular year represents  Table of Contents only a single scenario from among a broad range of plausible alternatives, given the pronounced effects of highly volatile commodity prices upon our operating results. 
In general, the compensation and management development committee aims to achieve a larger payout under the program for years when our performance is superior by long-term industry standards, and a smaller payout (or none at all) for years when our performance is relatively weak, while creating incentives for improved performance under all conditions given the inherent cyclicality in our industry. 
When considering appropriate performance metrics for the short-term incentive program, the compensation and management development committee also considers alternative metrics for measuring company performance, such as achievement of operating efficiency goals, continued emphasis on the establishment of a behavioral-based safety culture, progress towards strategic objectives, or performance relative to a variable budget, as well as alternative plan designs that emphasize the personal accomplishment of individual or shared goals. The objective in each case is to incentivize strong operational performance in an inherently cyclical business. 
The compensation and management development committee determined for 2018 that objective measures of company performance measured on an absolute basis would align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareholders and reflect our team-based culture. For the Primary Metric (Adjusted EBITDA) and the ammonia production portion of the Secondary Metric, target performance was set at a level consistent with the company forecast for 2018. Maximum performance was set at a level judged to be difficult to achieve and threshold performance was set at the lowest level that would justify a payout. The committee determined to condition payout on the Secondary Metric to first achieving the "safety gate" to underscore the company's commitment to our "Do It Right" culture and complement our efforts to drive workplace safety. 
   Approval of Base Salaries and Target Annual Incentive Awards for 2018  
Based on its review of the general, company-specific, and competitive considerations described above, in December 2017, the compensation and management development committee made the decision that our NEOs' base salaries and target annual incentive awards for 2018 would remain unchanged from those in effect for 2017 due to target compensation being in line with our Industry Reference Group and the overall general industry survey data and in recognition of current industry market conditions. 
The table below shows the base salaries and target annual incentive levels for our NEOs for 2018 and 2017:

   Approval of Annual Incentive Payments for 2018  
Following the end of 2018, management prepared a report on our level of achievement of the threshold EBITDA performance metric, the Primary Metric (Adjusted EBITDA), the  Table of Contents threshold gate of behavioral safety performance, and the Secondary Metric (Production of Ammonia Tons) under the short-term incentive plan. The compensation and management development committee reviewed the report and approved final performance results. Based on the results, the committee determined that each of our NEOs earned 185% of the executive's target opportunity with respect to the executive's annual incentive award for 2018. This result is based on our attainment of EBITDA of $1,429 million exceeding the threshold EBITDA performance metric. Our attainment of Adjusted EBITDA of $1,371 million resulted in a payout percentage for the Primary Metric of 200% and, after first achieving the gating level of performance of behavioral safety practices goals, our production of 9,805,000 ammonia tons equated to a payout percentage for the Secondary Metric of 141%. 
      Review and Approval of 2018 Long-Term Incentives         
The compensation and management development committee reviewed our long-term incentive program during 2017 and granted long-term stock-based incentive awards to our NEOs in January 2018. 
During its review of our long-term incentive program, the compensation and management development committee considered the following general factors:
The compensation and management development committee also considered the difficulty in establishing appropriate long-term performance measures for the company, other than stock price appreciation and total shareholder return (including dividends), given the inherent cyclicality in our industry as well as the pronounced effects of highly volatile commodity prices for raw materials and fertilizer products upon our operating results. 
In addition, the compensation and management development committee reviewed a report from Exequity, the committee's outside compensation consultant, regarding competitive market practices with respect to the use of long-term incentives. 
The compensation and management development committee considered all of this information in the context of the goals and objectives of our executive compensation plans. As noted above, our long-term incentives focus on enterprise value creation and employee retention. Long-term incentives are provided through annual awards that vest over a period of subsequent years. Our 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan allows the use of stock options, full-value shares, and cash-based awards. Eligibility is extended to executive officers and other key employees. Eligibility guidelines with award ranges related to position responsibilities levels are updated annually. In consideration of these guidelines, there is individual variation in long-term incentives based on performance level, potential contribution, and value to the business. 
   Design of Target Awards for 2018  
Based on its review of general, company-specific, and competitive considerations, the compensation and management development committee determined that the long-term incentive awards granted to our NEOs for 2018 would be composed of 60% PRSUs and 40% RSUs. From 2014 until the grants in 2018, the long-term incentive awards granted to our  Table of Contents
NEOs in connection with setting the officers' target compensation was composed of 60% stock options, 20% PRSUs, and 20% RSUs. The committee determined to change the mix of long-term incentive awards in 2018 to further align pay with long-term performance and to reflect trends in executive compensation generally. In addition, in selecting a mixture of PRSUs and RSUs for our target long-term incentive awards and eliminating stock options, the compensation and management development committee noted that:
   How We Determine the Number of PRSUs Earned  
The number of PRSUs earned is determined based the company's average RONA performance over three one-year periods and subject to a three-year TSR modifier, as follows: Table of Contents

   Approval of Target Awards for 2018  
On January 2, 2018, the compensation and management development committee approved long-term incentive awards for our NEOs for 2018 as set forth in the table below. 
On the grant date, the compensation and management development committee approved dollar-denominated RSU and PRSU awards for each of our individual NEOs. In setting the dollar-denominated values of the individual awards, the committee considered our Industry Reference Group and the competitive general industry survey data presented by Exequity, the committee's outside compensation consultant. 
The committee also considered the recommendations from our chief executive officer for the long-term incentive awards to each of the NEOs other than himself. These recommendations took into account the chief executive officer's assessment of each individual's operating responsibilities, management level, tenure and performance in the position, and potential. 
After the close of business on the grant date, the dollar-denominated awards were translated into an actual number of RSUs and PRSUs using the unweighted average of the NYSE closing price for the twenty (20) trading days preceding the grant date. The number of PRSUs  Table of Contents represented 60% of the total value on the grant date and the number of RSUs represented 40%. 
   Target Values versus Accounting Values  
Because of the accounting rules governing preparation of the Summary Compensation Table on page 79, the grant date value for RSUs and PRSUs awarded in 2018 as reported in the Summary Compensation Table are different than the target award values set forth in the table above. As discussed above, the compensation and management development committee approves dollar-denominated target award values, which are translated into an actual number of RSUs and PRSUs using the unweighted average of the NYSE closing price for the twenty (20) trading days preceding the grant date. With respect to RSUs, the values reflected in the Summary Compensation Table are computed as the product of the number of RSUs awarded multiplied by the closing stock price on the date of grant. As described above with respect to PRSUs, at the beginning of each year of the PRSUs' three-year performance period, the compensation and management development committee establishes RONA performance levels for such year. Under the applicable accounting rules, the Summary Compensation Table only reflects the value of grants made during the year for which applicable performance goals have been set. Only the RONA performance goals for the 2018 fiscal year were approved at the time the PRSUs were awarded in 2018. As a result, for the 2018 PRSUs, the Summary Compensation Table does not include the value of the PRSUs based on the annual RONA goals for fiscal 2019 or fiscal 2020. Such amounts will be included as equity compensation in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020, respectively, when the RONA goals are established. The target grant values set forth in the table above reflect the value of the entire 2018 PRSUs, without regard for when the performance goals are established. 
   Vesting and Other Terms of RSUs and PRSUs  
The target RSUs granted to our NEOs in 2018 will vest in three equal annual installments following the date of grant, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting (as described below). Until vested, the RSUs may not be sold, assigned, transferred, donated, pledged, or otherwise disposed of (except by will or the laws of descent and distribution). At the vesting dates, the RSUs give the holder the right to receive one share of common stock with respect to each vested RSU. We will pay dividend equivalents in cash with respect to the RSUs to our NEOs during the vesting period. 
The PRSUs granted to our NEOs in 2018 will vest upon the certification by the compensation and management development committee of the attainment of the performance goals following the end of the three-year performance period, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting (as described below). The PRSUs are settled in shares of our common stock. The PRSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance and vesting period. Upon vesting, holders of PRSUs will be paid a cash equivalent of the dividends paid on our common stock during the performance and vesting period based on the number of shares of stock, if any, delivered in settlement of the PRSUs. 
As discussed below under the heading "Change in Control, Severance, and Retirement Benefits," upon a change in control, the restrictions, limitations, and conditions applicable to RSUs and PRSUs will lapse, the performance goals with respect to the PRSUs will be deemed fully achieved at the greater of target or actual performance to-date, and all of the awards will become fully vested. Upon death or disability, RSUs become fully vested and the PRSUs become fully vested at the target level of performance. The RSUs and PRSUs will vest on a pro rata basis upon retirement in the case of those NEOs who have reached the age of 60 with at least five years of service at the time of retirement and who provide us with at least six months' notice.

Additional information with respect to the compensation and management development committee's grants of RSUs and PRSUs to our NEOs during 2018 is set forth below under the heading "Executive Compensation—Grants of Plan-based Awards." 
   Determination of 2016-2018 Performance Period PRSU Awards  
The three-year performance period for PRSU awards granted in 2016 ended on December 31, 2018. The performance metrics for PRSUs granted in 2016 were our three-year TSR compared against the S&P 500 Index and a modifier pursuant to which the number of shares earned based on our TSR relative to the S&P 500 Index could be increased or decreased by up to 20% based on our TSR compared against a select fertilizer peer group comprised of Agrium Inc., CVR Partners LP, Incitec Pivot Ltd, LSB Industries, Inc., The Mosaic Company, Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan Inc., and Yara International ASA. Our final TSR for the three-year period was at the 28th percentile of the S&P 500 Index and ranked 4th out of the eight companies (including us) in the select fertilizer peer group used as a modifier. As a result, in accordance with the terms of the awards, the committee approved a payout of 57.14% of the PRSUs from these grants. 
      2019 Compensation Actions         
In December 2018, the compensation and management development committee approved base salaries and target annual incentive awards for our NEOs for calendar year 2019. In addition, on January 2, 2019, the compensation and management development committee approved long-term incentive awards for our NEOs for 2019. In setting compensation levels for 2019, the compensation and management development committee considered a competitive market assessment performed by Exequity, the committee's outside compensation consultant, and the goals and objectives of our executive compensation plans. The following table shows the base salaries, target annual incentives, and long-term incentive awards for our named executive officers for 2019.  Table of Contents
   Performance Metrics for Annual Incentive Payments for 2019  
The annual incentive awards to our NEOs for 2019 will again be determined based upon our level of achievement of the following performance metrics:
These two performance metrics are unchanged from our 2018 annual incentive program. In setting the performance metrics for 2018 and years prior to the modifications to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the annual incentive program incorporated a threshold EBITDA performance metric as described above. If the threshold EBITDA performance metric was achieved, actual incentive payments were approved by the compensation and management committee utilizing its negative discretion based on performance against the primary and secondary performance metrics (i.e., for 2018, the Primary Metric and the Secondary Metric as described above.) The annual incentive program's performance metric structure, combined with the committee's right to use negative discretion, provided flexibility to reward and encourage the achievement of annual financial results and other specified corporate performance goals while retaining the ability to pay incentive awards to executive officers which were deductible under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act modified Section 162(m) to remove the performance-based compensation exception, and, as a result, compensation paid to our covered employees in excess of $1,000,000 will generally not be deductible. Because of these changes to Section 162(m), the compensation and management development committee streamlined the structure of the annual incentive plan performance metrics to eliminate the threshold EBITDA performance metric for 2019. 
The performance levels and corresponding percentages of target opportunity earned with respect to the 2019 Primary Metric and 2019 Secondary Metric established by the compensation and management development committee will be disclosed in the proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting. 
   Performance Metrics for PRSUs Granted in 2019  
The performance metrics for the PRSUs granted in 2019 are structured in the same manner as the PRSUs granted in 2018. The number of PRSUs earned under the PRSUs granted in 2019 will be determined based the company's average RONA performance over three one-year periods and subject to a three-year TSR modifier. The RONA performance levels for fiscal 2019 and corresponding payout percentages for the year established by the compensation and management development committee will be disclosed in the proxy statement for our 2020 annual meeting. 
      Change in Control, Severance, and Retirement Benefits         
The compensation and management development committee reviewed our change in control, severance, and retirement benefits during 2018 as described below. Based on its review, and after considering the factors noted below, the compensation and management development committee determined that our change in control, severance, and retirement benefits continue to serve the best interests of the company and our shareholders and are consistent with competitive market practices.  Table of Contents
   Change in Control Benefits  
With respect to our change in control benefits, the compensation and management development committee noted that we have change in control agreements with our executive officers, as well as certain change in control benefits for all of the participants (including the executive officers) under our 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan. Additional information regarding these benefits is set forth below under the heading "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
In connection with its review, the compensation and management development committee noted that the change in control agreements with our executive officers are:
The compensation and management development committee also noted that our change in control agreements require both (i) a change in control and (ii) a qualifying termination of the executive officer's employment (sometimes referred to as a "double trigger"), before any benefits will be owing to the executive officer under the agreement. 
In addition, the compensation and management development committee noted that our 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan and 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan provide that all plan-based awards will be deemed fully vested and fully exercisable and any performance conditions will be deemed fully achieved upon a change in control (sometimes referred to as a "single trigger"), unless the committee determines otherwise with respect to a particular award at the time of grant and reflects this determination in the applicable award agreement. In this regard, the compensation and management development committee noted it would be difficult to preserve the original performance and vesting goals in our plan-based awards following a change in control, given the fundamental changes in our organization, capital structure, and operations that would typically result from such a transaction. Accordingly, all of our plan-based awards have included this change in control provision for the benefit of our executive officers and the other participants. 
As part of its review, the compensation and management development committee reviewed "tally sheets," estimating these benefits for our chief executive officer and the other NEOs under various assumptions and scenarios. 
Based on its review, and the other factors noted above, the compensation and management development committee determined that our change in control benefits serve the best interests of the company and our shareholders and are consistent with competitive market practices. 
   Excise Tax Gross-Ups  
In December 2014, the Board adopted a policy whereby the company will not in the future enter into any new agreements with its NEOs that include Internal Revenue Code Section 280G excise tax "gross-up" provisions with respect to payments contingent on a change in control of the company.  Table of Contents
   Severance Benefits  
With respect to our severance benefits, the compensation and management development committee noted that none of our executive officers has any employment or severance agreement, and none of our executive officers is entitled to receive any other severance benefits, except for (i) the change in control agreements and change in control benefits discussed above, (ii) such severance benefits as we may provide under our standard policies applicable to all employees, (iii) such severance benefits as we may be required to pay under applicable law in certain jurisdictions, and (iv) such additional severance benefits as our compensation and management development committee may approve in certain instances. Based on its review, and the other factors noted above, the compensation and management development committee determined that our severance benefits serve the best interests of the company and our shareholders and are consistent with competitive market practices. 
   Retirement Benefits  
With respect to our retirement benefits, the compensation and management development committee noted that we maintain tax-qualified and nonqualified defined benefit, defined contribution, and deferred compensation plans. Additional information regarding these benefits is set forth below under the headings "Executive Compensation—Pension Benefits" and "Executive Compensation—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
We maintain a defined benefit pension plan named the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. Pension Plan (the "Pension Plan"). The Pension Plan includes three components. Supplement A of the Pension Plan, which we refer to herein as the New Retirement Plan, is a defined benefit pension plan that became effective on January 1, 2013, under which all domestic employees (including executive officers) became eligible to participate as of January 1, 2013, except for those employees who participate in Supplement B of the Pension Plan. Supplement B of the Pension Plan is our historic defined benefit pension plan, which we refer to herein as the Old Retirement Plan and which was closed to new participants on December 31, 2003. Employees who joined the company after that date, which includes all of the NEOs, are ineligible to receive any pension benefits under the Old Retirement Plan, but are eligible for benefits under the New Retirement Plan. Under the New Retirement Plan, we credit the account of each participating employee an amount between 4% and 7% (depending on years of service) of the participant's eligible compensation. For our NEOs, eligible compensation is limited to base salary. Each participant's account will earn an annual return based on the greater of (i) the annual yield on 10-year treasury nominal securities and (ii) 3% annual interest. The third component of the Pension Plan is Supplement C, which was formerly known as the Terra Industries Inc. Employees' Retirement Plan and covers employees who commenced employment with Terra Industries, or any other entity that was an employer under the former plan, prior to August 1, 2003. None of our NEOs are participants in Supplement C of the Pension Plan. 
The compensation and management development committee also reviewed "tally sheets," estimating these benefits for our chief executive officer and the other NEOs under various assumptions and scenarios.  Table of Contents 
Commencing with equity grants made in 2014, employees, including our NEOs, who retire upon having reached age 60 with at least five years of service at the time of retirement will continue to vest in their stock option awards that were granted at least one year prior to their termination date and will receive a pro-rated number of RSUs and PRSUs based on their length of service between the grant date of such award and the executive's retirement date and, with respect to PRSUs, contingent upon the level of attainment of applicable performance goals, provided, that, in each case, the executive has provided us with at least six months' notice prior to such retirement. In addition, such eligible retirees will have four years from their retirement date to exercise any vested options. 
Based on its review, and the other factors noted above, the compensation and management development committee determined that our retirement benefits serve the best interests of the company and our shareholders and are consistent with competitive market practices. 
      Use of Industry Reference Group         
As noted above, the compensation and management development committee has adopted an Industry Reference Group for use in establishing compensation and incentive levels. The compensation and management development committee's consultant, Exequity, leads a review of the companies in the peer group annually and proposes changes based on quantitative and qualitative assessments of comparability. The 18 companies in our Industry Reference Group for 2018, which is unchanged from 2017, are listed in the following table:

      Other Compensation Governance Practices and Considerations         
   Role of the Compensation Consultant  
The compensation and management development committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for, and terminate advisors, consultants, and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. Pursuant to this authority, the compensation and management development committee engaged Exequity, an independent executive compensation consulting firm, to assist the committee in making recommendations  Table of Contents and decisions regarding compensation for our directors and executive officers based on market and industry practices. Exequity provides no other services to the company. 
The compensation consultant regularly attends meetings of our compensation and management development committee and meets regularly with the committee in executive sessions without management present. The compensation and management development committee reviews the materials and recommendations provided by Exequity, but exercises independent judgment in determining the compensation payable to our NEOs. Any recommendations of the compensation and management development committee with respect to non-employee director compensation are subject to approval by the Board. 
The compensation and management development committee has determined, after appropriate inquiry, including consideration of Exequity's independence in light of the factors set forth under Rule 10C-1 of the Exchange Act, that no conflicts of interest exist with respect to the firm's engagement as the committee's independent compensation consultant. 
   Stock Ownership Guidelines  
The Board believes that our directors and officers should be shareholders of CF Industries and, based on the recommendation of the compensation and management development committee, has established guidelines for stock ownership. 
As of December 31, 2018, each of our directors and officers was in compliance with the stock ownership guideline requirements. Their financial interests are aligned with those of our shareholders; they are incentivized to take actions that create sustainable value. 
For purposes of these guidelines, any of the following may be used to satisfy the ownership requirements: (i) shares purchased by the individual, (ii) shares retained upon the exercise of a vested stock option, (iii) shares acquired upon the vesting of restricted shares or units, (iv) shares acquired upon the vesting of performance shares or units, (v) shares (including "phantom" shares) held within our qualified and non-qualified deferred compensation and retirement plans, (vi) shares purchased through an employee stock purchase plan, (vii) restricted shares or units, (viii) earned performance shares or units (i.e., shares or units under a performance award for which the primary performance criteria has been achieved, but which remain subject to time-based vesting requirements, without regard to any potential subsequent modification based on additional performance criteria such as a TSR modifier), and (ix) the difference in value between the exercise price and current market price for vested but unexercised options, net of taxes at an assumed maximum tax rate. Non-vested stock options and unearned non-vested performance shares or units are specifically excluded in meeting the ownership requirements. 
It is expected that an individual who is subject to the stock ownership guidelines will not sell any shares unless he or she has satisfied the ownership guidelines both before the sale and after giving effect to the shares sold. An individual who has initially satisfied the guidelines but as a result of a subsequent decline in stock prices no longer meets the guidelines is precluded from selling any shares until such time as he or she again satisfies the guidelines.  Table of Contents
Surrendering shares to the company in order to pay withholding or other taxes on compensation income or pay the exercise price of stock options is not considered a sale of shares for purposes of the guidelines. 
We may facilitate stock ownership by directors and officers through grants of equity-based compensation under our 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan. 
   Clawback Policy  
We have in place an executive compensation recoupment policy, or "clawback" policy, which applies to our executive officers (referred to as "covered officers"), including the NEOs. Under the policy, in the event that the specified financial results upon which a cash or equity-based incentive award was predicated become the subject of a financial restatement that is required because of material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements, the compensation and management development committee will conduct a review of awards covered by the policy and will, to the extent permitted by governing law, have the sole and absolute authority to make adjustments to the awards to ensure that the ultimate payout gives retroactive effect to the financial results as restated, including the authority to seek recoupment of any excess cash or equity that has already been paid to or received by a covered person. The policy covers any cash or equity-based incentive compensation award that was paid, earned or granted to a covered officer during the last completed three fiscal years immediately preceding the date the financial restatement is publicly announced. Our executive officers have each signed a form acknowledging the applicability of the policy in order to enhance the enforceability of these provisions. 
   Trading, Hedging and Pledging Restrictions  
We have a Policy on Insider Trading, which prohibits our directors, officers, and employees from engaging in speculative transactions in our securities. Specifically, it is against our policy to trade in options, warrants, puts and calls, or similar derivatives on our stock, sell our stock "short," or hold our stock in margin accounts. In addition, our policy prohibits our directors and executive officers from pledging our stock as collateral for a loan. 
   Compensation and Benefits Risk Analysis  
The compensation and management development committee reviewed the potential effects of the various components of our compensation and benefits program for 2018 upon individual and collective behavior and, ultimately, upon our risk profile and our overall approach to risk management. The compensation and management development committee reviewed the following relevant features of: Table of Contents limitations on trading, hedging, and pledging our stock imposed by our stock ownership guidelines and our Policy on Insider Trading; 
Based on this review, the compensation and management development committee determined that the company's compensation and benefits program balances risk and potential reward in a manner that is appropriate to the circumstances and in the best interests of the company's shareholders over the long term.  Table of Contents
      COMPENSATION AND MANAGEMENT DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE REPORT       
The compensation and management development committee oversees our compensation and employee benefit plans and practices, including our executive compensation plans, director compensation plans, and other incentive compensation and equity-based plans. The compensation and management development committee is composed of five non-employee directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. Each member of the compensation and management development committee is independent under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE applicable to compensation committee members. The Board has also determined that all of the members of the committee qualify as "non-employee directors," within the meaning of Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, and "outside directors," within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
The compensation and management development committee held five meetings during the year ended December 31, 2018 and met in executive session at four of the meetings. The compensation and management development committee also reviewed and discussed with management the compensation discussion and analysis section of this Proxy Statement. 
Based on its review and the foregoing meetings and discussions, the compensation and management development committee recommended to the Board that the compensation discussion and analysis section be included in this Proxy Statement and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

* The 2018 PRSU performance metrics are composed of two measures: average return on net assets ("RONA") over three one-year periods and a modifier pursuant to which the number of shares earned based on RONA performance may be increased or decreased by up to 20% based on our three-year TSR performance. For the 2018 PRSU awards, the amounts shown in the table above represent the value of one-third of the target number of PRSUs awarded at grant, consistent with the applicable accounting rules, as only the first-year goal of the three-year performance period beginning in 2018 was communicated to award holders in 2018.

As further described in that section, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting, these awards will vest upon the certification by the compensation and management development committee of the attainment of the performance goals following the end of the three-year performance period. The PRSU performance metrics are composed of two measures: average return on net assets ("RONA") over three one-year periods and a modifier pursuant to which the number of shares earned based on RONA performance may be increased or decreased by up to 20% based on our three-year TSR performance. The "target" amount shown represents one-third of the 2018 PRSU grant. See the Summary Compensation Table footnote 2 for further information on the full value of the PRSU grant. The dollar value of each PRSU at the time of grant was $44.61. The PRSUs accrue dividend equivalents during the performance and vesting period. Upon vesting, holders of PRSUs will be paid a cash equivalent of the dividends paid on our common stock during the performance and vesting period based on the number of shares of stock, if any, delivered upon the settlement of the PRSUs.

      Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control         
We have entered into change in control agreements with each of the named executive officers, each of which remains currently in effect. Under the terms of the change in control agreements, the named executive officer is entitled to receive certain payments and benefits from us upon a qualifying termination, specifically if we terminate his employment without cause (other than by reason of his death or disability) or if he resigns because of good reason, in either case within the period of 24 months following (or in certain cases prior to) a change in control (as such terms are defined in the agreements). 
Under the change in control agreements, a named executive officer will be deemed to have good reason if we:
Following a qualifying termination, the change in control agreements for each named executive officer provide for (i) a lump sum payment to the named executive officer equal to two times (or, three times in the case of Mr. Will) the sum of his base salary and target annual incentive payment; (ii) welfare benefit continuation for a period of two years (or three years, in the case of Mr. Will) and outplacement services for a period of up to two years; and (iii) a pro-rata annual incentive payment for the year of termination, assuming target levels of performance or, if higher, actual year-to-date performance. 
The named executive officer will also receive a cash payment equal to the contributions that we would have made on his behalf for a period of two years (or, three years in the case of Mr. Will) under our defined contribution 401(k) Plan and the related amounts that we would have credited to his account balance under our Supplemental Benefit and Deferral Plan. If the named executive officer is not fully vested in his benefits under these plans, he will also receive a cash payment equal to his unvested benefits. 
In addition, the named executive officers other than Messrs. Barnard and Frost will receive a cash payment equal to the actuarial value of two additional years (or, three additional years in the case of Mr. Will) of age and service credit under our defined benefit New Retirement  Table of Contents
Plan and will be credited with two additional years (or, three additional years in the case of Mr. Will) of age and service credit under our Supplemental Benefit and Deferral Plan. If the named executive officer is not fully vested in his benefits under these plans, he will also receive a cash payment equal to his unvested benefits. 
The change in control agreements for Messrs. Barnard and Frost, which were entered into in 2007 and 2008, respectively, further provide that, if any of the payments to the named executive officer become subject to the "golden parachute" excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the named executive officer will be entitled to receive an additional gross-up payment such that, after payment by him of all taxes, including any excise tax imposed upon the gross-up payment, he will receive the net after-tax benefit that he would have received had the excise tax not been imposed. The change of control agreements for Messrs. Will, Kelleher, and Bohn do not provide for a gross-up payment. The change in control agreements for each of these three named executive officers provide that payments that would be subject to the excise tax will be reduced to the greatest amount that he may receive without becoming subject to the excise tax, unless he would be better off on an after-tax basis (including following application of the excise tax) receiving the full amount of such payments, in which case no such reduction will be applied. 
In December 2014, the Board adopted a policy whereby the company will not in the future enter into any new agreements with its named executive officers that include Internal Revenue Code Section 280G excise tax "gross-up" provisions with respect to payments contingent on a change in control of the company. 
Each of the named executive officers will be required to sign a release of claims at the time of the qualifying termination as a condition to receiving any such payments or benefits from us under his change in control agreement. 
The named executive officer will not be obligated to seek other employment in mitigation of the payments and benefits to be provided, and no such other employment will reduce our obligation to make such payments and to provide such benefits to him under the agreements. 
In addition, upon a change in control (as defined in our Equity and Incentive Plans) the restrictions, limitations, and conditions applicable to outstanding RSUs, PRSUs, stock options, and other plan-based awards will lapse, any performance goals will be deemed to be fully achieved, and the awards will become fully vested and exercisable, which for the annual incentive payment means payment at target-level performance, pro-rated for the portion of the year the executive officer was employed prior to the change in control, as set forth in the applicable incentive award letter. 
Assuming a change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018, with a transaction price equal to the closing price for our stock ($43.51 per share) on the NYSE as of December 31, 2018 (the last trading day of 2018), each of the named executive officers would have been  Table of Contents entitled to receive the following estimated severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of his employment on such date:

      CEO Pay Ratio         
In 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd – Frank Act"), the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of our median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our principal executive officer. The company's principal executive officer is Mr. Will. 
Mr. Will had 2018 annual total compensation of $7,758,005, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included under the heading "Executive Compensation." Our median employee's 2018 annual total compensation was $107,901. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Will's 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 72 times that of our median  Table of Contents employee. Due to the variability of Mr. Will's performance-based compensation, the CEO pay ratio can differ significantly from year to year. In addition, Mr. Will's 2018 annual total compensation reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, consistent with accounting rules, includes only one-third of the total target number of PRSUs granted to Mr. Will in 2018. If the total target number of PRSUs granted to Mr. Will in 2018 was included in the 2018 annual total compensation of Mr. Will for purposes of calculating the CEO pay ratio, we estimate Mr. Will's 2018 annual total compensation with such change would be approximately 94 times that of our median employee. 
The SEC rule permits a company to identify its median employee only once every three years, unless there has been a change in its employee population or employee compensation arrangements that the company reasonably believes would result in a significant change in the pay ratio disclosure. There has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements that we believe would significantly impact the pay ratio disclosure. Therefore, we elected to use the same median employee we identified in 2017 for purposes of calculating the CEO pay ratio for 2018. We identified our median employee in 2017 by examining the 2017 total cash compensation (base salary and cash bonus) for all individuals, excluding our chief executive officer, who were employed by us on November 1, 2017. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, temporary or part-time basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments (including cost-of-living adjustments) or use any estimates with respect to determining total cash compensation, except that we annualized the compensation for our full-time and part-time permanent employees who were not employed by us for all of 2017. We calculated the 2018 annual total compensation for our median employee using the same methodology we use for our named executive officers as required to be set forth in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement.

      PROPOSAL 3: RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR 2019       
The audit committee has selected KPMG as the independent registered public accounting firm to perform the audit of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for 2019. KPMG was our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
KPMG representatives are expected to attend the Annual Meeting. They will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate shareholder questions. 
We are asking our shareholders to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although ratification is not required by our bylaws or otherwise, the Board is submitting the selection of KPMG to our shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate governance practice. Should the shareholders fail to provide such ratification, the audit committee will reconsider its approval of KPMG as our independent registered public accountants for 2019. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of CF Industries and its shareholders. 
Unless otherwise instructed, we will vote all proxies we receive FOR ratifying the selection of KPMG as the company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
      BOARD RECOMMENDATION         
The Board unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
      AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT FEES         
On behalf of CF Industries and its affiliates, the audit committee retained KPMG to audit our consolidated financial statements for 2018. In addition, the audit committee retained KPMG, as well as other accounting firms, to provide other auditing and advisory services in 2018. 
The aggregate fees for professional services provided by KPMG with respect to these various services for 2018 and 2017 were:

      PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES         
Consistent with SEC policies regarding auditor independence, the audit committee has responsibility for appointing, setting the compensation of, and overseeing the work of the independent registered public accounting firm. In recognition of this responsibility, the audit committee has established a policy to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. 
Prior to engagement of the independent registered public accounting firm for the next year's audit, management will submit a list of services and related fees expected to be rendered during that year within each of four categories of services to the audit committee for approval. 
Prior to engagement, the audit committee pre-approves independent registered public accounting firm services within each category. The fees are budgeted and the audit committee requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval categories. In those instances, the audit committee requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm. 
The audit committee has delegated specific pre-approval authority to the chair of the audit committee provided that the estimated fee for any such engagement does not exceed $100,000. The chair of the audit committee must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the audit committee at its next scheduled meeting. 
      AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE         
We understand the need for KPMG to maintain objectivity and independence in its audit of our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting. To minimize relationships that could appear to impair the objectivity of KPMG, our audit committee has restricted the non-audit services that KPMG may provide to us primarily to audit-related services and tax services. The committee also has determined that we will only obtain these non-audit services from KPMG when the services offered by KPMG are more effective or economical than services available from other service providers, and, to the extent possible,  Table of Contents only after competitive bidding. It is the audit committee's goal that the fees we pay KPMG for non-audit services should not exceed the audit fees paid to KPMG. 
Our audit committee has adopted restrictions on our hiring of any KPMG partner, director, manager, staff, advising member of the department of professional practice, reviewing actuary, reviewing tax professional, and any other persons having responsibility for providing audit assurance on any aspect of their certification of our financial statements.  Table of Contents
      AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT       
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our system of internal controls, and the independence and performance of our internal and independent auditors. The audit committee is also responsible for the selection, evaluation, and oversight of our independent auditors. The audit committee is composed of five non-employee directors and operates under a written charter adopted by the Board. Each member of the audit committee is independent under the corporate governance standards of the NYSE applicable to audit committee members. 
Management is responsible for the financial reporting process, including establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, and for the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. KPMG, our independent auditor, is responsible for auditing the financial statements. The audit committee's responsibility is to monitor and review these processes. The audit committee relies on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to it and on the representations made by management and KPMG. 
During 2018, the audit committee held nine meetings and met in executive session at each of the five meetings that were held in person. The audit committee reviewed and discussed with management and KPMG the audited consolidated financial statements of CF Industries for the year ended December 31, 2018 and KPMG's evaluation of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The audit committee also discussed with KPMG the matters that are required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 1301, "Communications with Audit Committees," issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and Rule 2-07 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. In addition, the audit committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditor's communications with the audit committee concerning independence, and the audit committee discussed with KPMG that firm's independence. The audit committee also considered whether the provision of non-audit services by KPMG was compatible with maintaining its independence. 
Based on its review and the foregoing meetings, discussions, and reports, and subject to the limitations on its role and responsibilities referred to above and in the audit committee charter, the audit committee recommended to the Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of CF Industries for the year ended December 31, 2018, as audited by KPMG, be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC. The audit committee selected KPMG as our independent auditor for 2019 and recommended to the Board that the Board seek shareholder ratification of the selection of KPMG.

      PROPOSAL 4: SHAREHOLDER PROPOSAL REGARDING THE RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT       
Information regarding a shareholder proposal is set forth below. CF Industries disclaims any responsibility for the content of this proposal and statement of support, which is presented as received from the shareholder. John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, CA 90278, has advised us that he owns no fewer than 100 shares of our common stock and has given us notice that this proposal will be presented at the Annual Meeting. 
    Proposal 4 – Right to Act by Written Consent         
Resolved, Shareholders request that our board of directors undertake such steps as may be necessary to permit written consent by shareholders entitled to cast the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize the action at a meeting at which all shareholders entitled to vote thereon were present and voting. This written consent is to be consistent with applicable law and consistent with giving shareholders the fullest power to act by written consent consistent with applicable law. This includes shareholder ability to initiate any valid topic for written consent. 
This proposal topic won majority shareholder support at 13 major companies in a single year. This included 67%-support at both Allstate and Sprint. Hundreds of major companies enable shareholder action by written consent. This proposal topic would have received a vote still higher than 67% at Allstate and Sprint if most shareholders at Allstate and Sprint had access to independent proxy voting advice. 
This proposal is more important because our Board of Directors under the leadership of Robert Arzbaecher, who chaired the Board of Directors governance committee, would not even let us vote in 2018 on a shareholder proposal to improve the shareholder right to call for a special meeting. A law firm with 1,700 attorneys was hired to argue that our company could prevent us from casting a vote on such an important issue. 
Our current higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting may be unreachable due to the prescribed time constraints and detailed technical requirements. 
Shareholder proposals such as this have taken a leadership role to improve the corporate governance rules of our company. For instance after CF Industries received shareholder proposals CF Industries then adopted better practices such as elimination of an uphill 67% vote requirement for shareholders on certain key governance issues (2014), adoption of a rudimentary version of a shareholder right to call a special meeting (2014) and elimination of a management entrenching poison pill (2017). 
From Mr. Arzbaecher's proxy biography it seems that Mr. Arzbaecher retired from full-time work at age 56 and does not serve on any other significant board to keep his skills current and bring new ideas to our company. Plus Mr. Arzbaecher has long-tenure on our Board which can be the exact opposite of shareholder-oriented independence in a director. 
The expectation is that, once this proposal is adopted, shareholders would not need to make use of this right of written consent because its mere existence will act as a guardrail to help ensue that our company is better overseen by a more qualified and focused board. 
Our Directors will want to avoid shareholder action by written consent and will thus have more of an incentive to improve the oversight role of the Board of Directors. 
Please vote yes:  Right to Act by Written Consent – Proposal 4 Table of Contents
      THE BOARD'S STATEMENT IN OPPOSITION         
      The Board unanimously recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.         
The Board has given careful consideration to the shareholder proposal regarding the right of shareholders to act by written consent and to the rejection by the company's shareholders of a substantially similar proposal submitted by the same proponent at the 2015 and 2016 annual meetings of shareholders. The Board continues to believe that the actions requested by the proponent are not in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. Moreover, the Board believes that implementation of the proposal is unnecessary given the ability of holders of 25% or more of the company's outstanding common stock to call a special meeting of shareholders and in light of the company's responsiveness to shareholders on matters of corporate governance. 
The company's certificate of incorporation requires actions that are subject to a vote of the company's shareholders to be considered at a meeting of shareholders. This requirement assures that all shareholders receive advance notice of the proposed action and have an opportunity to discuss it and consider all points of view. In contrast, the proposal calls for the Board to take steps necessary to permit shareholder action by written consent, which would allow critical actions to be approved by holders of a bare majority of the company's outstanding common stock without notice to other shareholders and without an opportunity for discussion at a meeting of shareholders. This proposal, if adopted, could therefore result in action being taken without the knowledge or participation of many shareholders—particularly smaller shareholders—thereby disenfranchising those shareholders, while enabling other short-term or special-interest investors to approve proposals that are not in the best interests of all shareholders. Allowing shareholder actions by written consent could also result in duplicative or contradictory written consents being circulated at the same time, wasting resources, confusing shareholders and hindering the ability of management and the Board to ensure the orderly and efficient conduct of the company's affairs. Because of such deficiencies, the Board believes that the written consent process is not appropriate for a widely-held public company like CF Industries. 
In 2014, the company amended its bylaws and, with shareholder approval, its certificate of incorporation to grant holders of not less than 25% of the company's outstanding common stock the right to call a special meeting of shareholders. This right to call special meetings allows shareholders to propose actions without waiting for the company's next annual meeting. Shareholder action taken at a special meeting is preferable to action by written consent, because a meeting allows all shareholders to participate in, and discuss the merits of, a proposed action, and allows the Board to make a considered recommendation about the action. Shareholder action by means of a shareholder-initiated special meeting is thus better suited than shareholder action by written consent to a culture of transparency and good corporate governance, and the ability of shareholders to call a special meeting makes unnecessary the written consent procedure contemplated by the proposal. The provisions of the company's bylaws and certificate of incorporation, including the 25% ownership threshold, under which shareholders may call a special meeting are designed to assure that shareholders have a meaningful right to call a special meeting while protecting against the risk that a small minority of shareholders with narrow or special interests could request one or more special meetings that could impose unnecessary costs on the company and disrupt the company's business. Shareholders ratified these provisions at the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, with 73% of votes cast voting in favor of ratification. 
The Board further believes that the company's strong corporate governance practices make adoption of this proposal unnecessary. In addition to giving shareholders the right to call special meetings, the company's corporate governance practices already provide transparency  Table of Contents and accountability of the Board to all of the company's shareholders. The company has demonstrated accountability and responsiveness to the views and concerns of shareholders by 
We value the views of, and regularly communicate with, our shareholders on a variety of topics, such as our financial performance, corporate governance, executive compensation, and related matters. The Board has established a process to receive communications from shareholders, whereby shareholders may contact any member (or all members) of the Board outside the annual meeting cycle. See "Corporate Governance – Communications with Directors." In addition, as discussed in the sections of this proxy statement under the headings "Proxy Statement Summary – Shareholder Engagement" and "Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Shareholder Engagement," we conduct shareholder outreach campaigns in the spring and in the fall. 
The Board believes that the company's current governance structure strikes an appropriate balance between permitting shareholders to raise important matters at any time and ensuring that all shareholders are afforded an opportunity for meaningful participation in a deliberative and democratic process based on accurate and complete public disclosure. Consistent with its current practice, the Board will continue to evaluate appropriate corporate governance measures and changes to the company's governance structure, policies and practices that it believes will serve the best interests of the company and its shareholders. 
For these reasons, the Board unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST the proposal.
THE PROPOSAL IS ADVISORY IN NATURE, AND APPROVAL OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD NOT IN ITSELF GIVE SHAREHOLDERS THE RIGHT TO ACT BY WRITTEN CONSENT. SUCH APPROVAL WOULD ONLY SERVE AS A RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD. IF THE PROPOSAL IS NOT PROPERLY PRESENTED BY THE PROPONENT AT THE ANNUAL MEETING, IT WILL NOT BE VOTED UPON. Table of Contents 
      ANNUAL MEETING INFORMATION       
      QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING         
      Why did I receive these proxy materials?         
We are providing these proxy materials in connection with the solicitation by the board of directors of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders and at any adjournment or postponement of such meeting. 
You are invited to attend the Annual Meeting on Wednesday, May 8, 2019, commencing at 10:00 a.m., local time. The Annual Meeting will be held at the Hyatt Regency Tulsa, 100 East Second Street, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74103. 
      Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials  instead of a full set of proxy materials?
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, the company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials via the Internet. Accordingly, the company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to the company's shareholders. All shareholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the notice or request a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the notice. In addition, shareholders may request proxy materials in printed form by mail or electronically by email on an ongoing basis. The company encourages shareholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the expenses incurred by the company with respect to its annual meetings. 
      How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials?         
The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will provide you with instructions regarding how to:

Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
      What will be voted on at the Annual Meeting?         
At the Annual Meeting, shareholders will be asked to: Table of Contents
      How many votes do I have?         
You will have one vote for every share of CF Industries common stock you owned on March 15, 2019 (the record date). If you were a shareholder of record as of the record date, you will retain your right to vote, even if you sell your shares after the record date. 
      How many votes can be cast by all shareholders?         
The total number of votes that can be cast by all shareholders is 222,397,087, consisting of one vote for each share of common stock that was outstanding on the record date. There is no cumulative voting. 
      How many votes must be present to hold the Annual Meeting?         
A majority of the votes that can be cast must be present for us to hold the Annual Meeting. We urge you to vote by proxy even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, so that we will know as soon as possible that enough votes will be present. 
      How do I vote?         
You can vote either in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy, whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. 
To vote by proxy, you must either: 
The Internet and telephone voting procedures set forth on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and proxy card are designed to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to provide their voting instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote through the Internet or by telephone, you should not return your proxy card. 
To ensure that your vote is counted, please remember to submit your vote so that we receive it at least one business day prior to the Wednesday, May 8, 2019 Annual Meeting. 
If you hold your CF Industries common stock in "street name" with a bank, brokerage firm, dealer, trust company, or other nominee, only they can exercise your right to vote with respect to your shares. Please follow the instructions provided to you by your bank, brokerage firm, dealer, trust company, or other nominee to authorize a proxy to vote your shares. If you want to vote in person at the Annual Meeting and you hold your stock in street name, you must obtain a "legal" proxy from your broker and bring that proxy to the Annual Meeting.  Table of Contents
      Can I change my vote?         
Yes. You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is voted at the annual meeting by either:
      What if I don't specify how my shares are to be voted?         
Whether you vote by mail, telephone, or the Internet, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you return a signed proxy card without indicating your vote or when voting on the Internet or by telephone you indicate that you wish to vote as recommended by the Board, your shares will be voted:
      How many votes are required to elect directors and to adopt the other proposals?         
With respect to Proposal 1, directors receiving a majority of votes cast (number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director) will be elected as a director. 
For each of Proposals 2, 3, and 4 and any other matter (other than Proposal 1) properly brought before the meeting, an affirmative vote of a majority of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon is required in order to approve such proposal. 
      Can my shares be voted if I don't vote by proxy and don't attend the Annual Meeting?         
If you are a shareholder of record, you can vote by proxy or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. If you don't vote your shares held in street name, your broker can vote your shares on the ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm. Your broker is not permitted to vote your shares on the election of the director nominees or any other matter on the agenda, other than the ratification of the selection of KPMG as our independent registered public accounting firm, without receiving instructions from you. This is referred to as a "broker non-vote." If you hold your shares in your own name, you must vote such shares in person or by proxy or they will not be voted.  Table of Contents
      How are my votes counted?         
With respect to Proposal 1, you may either vote for or against or you may abstain with respect to the election of each nominee for the Board. If you abstain with respect to any nominee, your shares will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will not be counted as votes cast with respect to the election of such nominee and, accordingly, will have no effect on the election of that nominee. 
For each of Proposals 2, 3, and 4, you may vote for or against or you may abstain with respect to the approval of the applicable proposal. If you abstain from voting on any of these proposals, your shares will be counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum, and the abstention will have the same effect as a vote against that proposal. 
Broker non-votes on any matter will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the voting on Proposals 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
      Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?         
We don't know of any other matters that will be considered at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters arise at the Annual Meeting, the proxies will be voted at the discretion of the persons named in the proxy. 
      What happens if the Annual Meeting is postponed, adjourned, or delayed?         
Your proxy will still be good and may be voted at the postponed, adjourned or delayed meeting. You will still be able to change or revoke your proxy until it is voted. 
      What procedures must I follow to attend the Annual Meeting?         
You will need proof of ownership of CF Industries stock to enter the Annual Meeting. When you arrive at the Annual Meeting, you may be asked to present photo identification, such as a driver's license. This will suffice if you hold your shares in your own name. If you hold your stock through a securities broker (that is, in street name), a recent brokerage statement or letter from your broker is an example of proof that you are the beneficial owner of such shares. No large bags, briefcases, or packages will be permitted in the Annual Meeting and shareholders will not be permitted to use any cameras (including cell phones with photographic capabilities), recording equipment or electronic devices at the meeting. 
      IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION         
      Cost of Annual Meeting and Proxy Solicitation

 Appendix A  
     CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.   SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION   NON-GAAP DISCLOSURE ITEMS         
The company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Management believes that EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, provides additional meaningful information regarding the company's performance and financial strength. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, EBITDA included in this proxy statement may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
      Reconciliation of net earnings attributable to common stockholders to EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure), as  applicable:         
EBITDA is defined as net earnings attributable to common stockholders plus interest expense—net, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Other adjustments include the elimination of loan fee amortization that is included in both interest and amortization, and the portion of depreciation that is included in noncontrolling interests. 
The company has presented EBITDA because management uses this measure to track performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the industry.
