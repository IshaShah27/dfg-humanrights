PROXY STATEMENT 
ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 
May 14, 2019 
This Proxy Statement is furnished to the holders of common stock, $1.00 par value per share ("Common Stock"), of Chicago Rivet & Machine Co., an Illinois corporation (the "Company"). Proxies are being solicited on behalf of the Board of Directors of the Company to be used at the Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Tuesday, May 14, 2019 at the Company's principal offices, 901 Frontenac Road, Naperville, Illinois, at 10:00 A.M. (CDT), and at any adjournments or postponements thereof, for the purposes set forth in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the "Notice"). The Company's Annual Report to Shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, including financial statements, this Proxy Statement, the Notice and the attached form of proxy are first being mailed to shareholders on or about March 25, 2019. 
Each shareholder of record at the close of business on March 18, 2019, the record date stated in the Notice, is entitled to vote at the meeting and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. On the record date, there were outstanding 966,132 shares of Common Stock, each entitled to one vote. No other shares of the Company of any other class were outstanding. 
A majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. The affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting is required for the election of directors and for the approval of all other matters that may properly come before the Annual Meeting, other than the advisory vote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory votes. On the advisory vote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory votes, the number of years for the frequency of the advisory vote on executive compensation that receives the highest number of votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote thereon will be the frequency that shareholders approve. Abstentions and withheld votes are counted for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. Abstentions and withheld votes are counted as votes against a proposal, other than with respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory votes. With respect to the advisory vote on the frequency of future executive compensation advisory votes, abstentions have no effect on the proposal. If a shareholder does not inform his or her broker as to how the shareholder's shares are to be voted, the broker may not exercise its discretion in voting on any matter other than the ratification of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. A vote on any such matter will be labeled a broker "non-vote" and will be counted for purposes of establishing a quorum, but will have no effect on the outcome of any matter.  Any shareholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time prior to the exercise thereof by executing and delivering to the Secretary of the Company at the above address a subsequent proxy or a written notice of revocation of the proxy, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. In the absence of any contrary written direction in the proxy, each proxy will be voted for the election of the nominees for director named in this proxy statement, for the advisory vote on executive compensation, for an every three year advisory vote on executive compensation and for the ratification of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Proxies will be solicited by mail and may also be solicited by personal interview, telephone and facsimile. Solicitation will be made on a part-time basis by directors and officers of the Company and by other managerial employees, who will receive no compensation therefor other than their regular salary. The Company will arrange for brokerage houses, nominees and other custodians holding Common Stock of record to forward proxy soliciting material to the beneficial owners of such shares, and will reimburse such record owners for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them. The cost of the solicitation of proxies will be borne by the Company. 
The Board of Directors of the Company does not intend to bring any matters before the Annual Meeting except those indicated in the Notice and does not know of any matter which anyone else may properly present for action at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, however, the persons named in the enclosed proxy, or their duly constituted substitutes acting at the Annual Meeting, will be authorized to vote or otherwise act thereon in accordance with their best judgment on such matters.

 ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
A Board of seven directors is to be elected at the Annual Meeting, to serve until the next Annual Meeting and until their successors shall have been elected and shall qualify. The Board of Directors believes that the persons named will be available, but, if any nominee is unable or unwilling to serve as director, the proxies will be voted for another individual to be selected by the Board of Directors. 
In the election of directors, voting rights are cumulative, which means that each shareholder is entitled to as many votes as are equal to the number of his or her shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected (seven). Each shareholder may cast all of such votes for one nominee or may distribute them among two or more nominees in his or her discretion. In the absence of any contrary written direction in the proxy, the proxy will confer discretionary authority on the persons named therein as representatives to cumulate votes selectively among the nominees in the manner just described. 
The Nominating Committee recommended and the Board of Directors selected the nominees for director named in this proxy statement. Six of the nominees are currently directors of the Company. Nominee John C. Osterman was recommended for consideration by the Nominating Committee by the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of the Company. When considering whether the nominees have the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills to serve as a director of the Company, the Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors focused primarily on the biographical information set forth in the table below.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE BOARD 
OF DIRECTORS AND COMMITTEES 
The Board of Directors has determined that Edward L. Chott, Kent H. Cooney, William T. Divane, Jr. and John L. Showel are "independent directors" under the rules of the NYSE American. The Board of Directors has also determined that director nominee John C. Osterman meets the requirements to be an "independent director" under the rules of the NYSE American. In reviewing Mr. Osterman's independence, the Board of Directors considered the fact that Mr. Osterman previously served as an officer and director the Company (last serving as Chief Operating Officer and a director of the Company at the time of his retirement from the Company in 2006) and as a consultant to the Company from his retirement through 2018. The Board of Directors determined that such relationships would not interfere with the exercise of Mr. Osterman's independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director if so elected. 
The Board of Directors of the Company held a total of four meetings during 2018. 
The Board of Directors has appointed an Audit Committee, which presently consists of Directors Edward L. Chott, Kent H. Cooney and William T. Divane, Jr., each of whom is an "independent director" under the rules of the NYSE American applicable to audit committee members. The Audit Committee is a separately designated committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Board of Directors has determined that each member of the Audit Committee is able to read and understand fundamental financial statements and that Mr. Cooney is qualified as an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Mr. Cooney's background as described in footnote 4 on page 6 of this proxy statement, along with his training and experience as a CPA and former partner with the public accounting firm of RSM US LLP, provide the basis for this determination. The Audit Committee met four times during 2018. The duties of the Audit Committee include selecting the Company's independent auditor, reviewing the arrangements   and scope of the independent auditor's examination, reviewing internal accounting procedures and controls, and reviewing the independence of the auditor in regard to the Company and its management. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is located on the Company's website: www.chicagorivet.com. 
The Board of Directors has also appointed a Compensation Committee, which presently consists of Directors Edward L. Chott and William T. Divane, Jr., each of whom is an "independent director" under the rules of the NYSE American applicable to compensation committee members. The duties of the Compensation Committee include considering and recommending to the Board of Directors the compensation and benefits of all officers of the Company. The Committee is solely responsible for developing its recommendations to the Board but the Committee may, in its discretion, solicit information from management of the Company. The Compensation Committee met two times during 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Compensation Committee, a copy of which is located on the Company's website: www.chicagorivet.com. 
Director compensation for non-employee directors is determined by the Board of Directors. 
The Board of Directors has also appointed an Executive Committee, which presently consists of Directors Michael J. Bourg, John A. Morrissey and Walter W. Morrissey. Under the by-laws of the Company and the resolution of the Board of Directors appointing the Executive Committee, the Executive Committee has all of the authority of the Board of Directors in the management of the Company, except as otherwise required by law. The Executive Committee met eleven times during 2018. 
The Board of Directors has also appointed a Nominating Committee, which presently consists of Directors Edward L. Chott, William T. Divane, Jr. and John L. Showel, each of whom is an "independent director" under the rules of the NYSE American. The duties of the Nominating Committee include identifying individuals qualified to serve as directors of the Company and recommending to the Board of Directors nominees for the board and members of board committees. The Nominating Committee met twice in 2018. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the Nominating Committee, a copy of which is located on the Company's website: www.chicagorivet.com. 
The Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by shareholders. In considering candidates submitted by shareholders, the Nominating Committee will take into consideration the needs of the Board and the qualifications of the candidate. The Nominating Committee may also take into consideration the number of shares held by the recommending shareholder and the length of time that such shares have been held. To have a candidate considered by the Nominating   Committee, a shareholder must submit the recommendation in writing and must include the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name of the shareholder and evidence of the person's ownership of Company stock, including the number of shares owned and the length of time  of ownership; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The name of the candidate, the candidate's resume or a listing of his or her qualifications to be a director of the Company and the person's  consent to be named as a director if selected by the Nominating Committee and nominated by the Board.  
[END TABLE]
The shareholder recommendation and information described above must be sent to the Corporate Secretary at 901 Frontenac Road, Naperville, IL 60563 and must be received by the Corporate Secretary not less than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of the Company's proxy statement in connection with the previous year's annual meeting of shareholders. 
The Nominating Committee believes that the minimum qualifications for serving as a director of the Company are that a nominee demonstrate, by significant accomplishment in his or her field, an ability to make a meaningful contribution to the Board's oversight of the business and affairs of the Company and have an impeccable record and reputation for honest and ethical conduct in both his or her professional and personal activities. In addition, the Nominating Committee examines a candidate's specific experiences and skills, time availability in light of other commitments, potential conflicts of interest and independence from management and the Company. The Nominating Committee also seeks to have the Board represent a diversity of backgrounds and experience. 
The Nominating Committee identifies potential nominees by asking current directors and executive officers to notify the Committee if they become aware of persons, meeting the criteria described above, who have had a change in circumstances that might make them available to serve on the Board, including business and civic leaders in the communities in which the Company's facilities are located. The Nominating Committee also, from time to time, may engage firms that specialize in identifying director candidates. As described above, the Committee will also consider candidates recommended by shareholders. 
Once a person has been identified by the Nominating Committee as a potential candidate, the Committee may collect and review publicly available information regarding the person to assess whether the person should be considered further. If the Nominating Committee determines that the candidate warrants further consideration, the Chairman or another member of the Committee contacts the person. Generally, if the person expresses a willingness to be considered and to serve on the Board, the Nominating Committee requests information from the candidate, reviews the person's accomplishments and qualifications and conducts one or more interviews with the candidate. Committee members may contact one or more references provided by the candidate or may contact   other members of the business community or other persons that may have greater first-hand knowledge of the candidate's qualifications. The Committee's evaluation process does not vary based on whether or not a candidate is recommended by a shareholder. 
It is Company policy that each of our directors attends the Annual Meeting. All of our directors were in attendance at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
Board Leadership Structure and Risk Management 
John A. Morrissey has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since 1979 and also as the Company's Chief Executive Officer since 1981. The Board of Directors believes that Mr. Morrissey's combined role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer furthers development and execution of the Company's strategy, facilitates information flow between management and the Board of Directors and promotes efficiency given the size of the Company and its operations. While the Board of Directors does not have a lead independent director, the independent directors on the Board of Directors meet separately regularly and rotate responsibility for chairing these separate sessions of the independent directors. 
The Audit Committee is primarily responsible for overseeing the Company's risk management process on behalf of the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee periodically meets with the Company's senior management to review the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Audit Committee reports regularly to the full Board of Directors, which also considers the Company's risk profile. While the Audit Committee and the full Board of Directors oversee the Company's risk management, the Company's management is responsible for the implementation of the Company's risk management guidelines and policies and the Company's day-to-day risk management process. 
Shareholder Communications with Directors 
The Board has established a process to receive communications from shareholders. Shareholders may contact any member (or all members) of the Board or the non-management directors as a group, any Board committee or any chair of any such committee by mail. To communicate with the Board of Directors, correspondence should be addressed to the Board of Directors or any such individual director or group or committee of directors by either name or title. All such correspondence should be sent "c/o Corporate Secretary" at 901 Frontenac Road, Naperville, IL 60563. 
With the exception of material that is in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service, or patently offensive material as determined by the Corporate Secretary, all communications received as set forth in the preceding paragraph will be forwarded promptly to the addressee. In the   case of communications to the Board or any group or committee of directors, the Corporate Secretary will make sufficient copies of the contents to send to each director who is a member of the group or committee to which the envelope is addressed. 
Policy Regarding Related Person Transactions 
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy regarding related person transactions. For the purposes of this policy, a "Related Person Transaction" is a transaction, arrangement, or relationship in which the Company was, is, or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any "Related Person" had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest. A "Related Person" means: (i) any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of the Company's last fiscal year was, a director or executive officer of the Company or a nominee to become a director of the Company; (ii) any person who is known to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's common stock; (iii) any immediate family member of any of the foregoing persons; and (iv) any firm, corporation, or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% or greater beneficial ownership interest. Any Related Person Transaction, identified as such prior to consummation, shall be consummated or amended only if approved in accordance with the policy. 
The Secretary, in concert with the Chief Operating Officer, will assess whether the proposed transaction is a Related Person Transaction for purposes of the policy. If it is determined that the proposed transaction is a Related Person Transaction, the proposed transaction shall be submitted to the Audit Committee for consideration at the next committee meeting or, in those instances in which the Secretary, in consultation with the Chief Operating Officer, determines that it is not practicable or desirable for the Company to wait until the next Audit Committee meeting, to the chairman of the Audit Committee (who has been delegated authority to act between committee meetings). The Audit Committee, or where submitted to the chairman of the Audit Committee, the chairman, shall consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to the committee or the chairman, including (if applicable) but not limited to: (i) the benefits to the Company; (ii) the impact on a director's independence in the event the Related Person is a director, an immediate family member of a director, or an entity in which a director is a partner, shareholder, or executive officer; (iii) the availability of other suppliers or customers for comparable products or services; (iv) the terms of the transaction; and (v) the terms available to unrelated third parties or to employees generally. The Audit Committee (or the chairman) shall approve only those Related Person Transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, as the committee (or the chairman) determines in good faith. 
At the Audit Committee's first meeting of each fiscal year, the committee shall review any previously approved Related Person Transactions that remain ongoing and have a remaining term or   remaining amounts payable to or receivable from the Company. Based on all relevant facts and circumstances, taking into consideration the Company's contractual obligations, the committee shall determine if it is in, or not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to continue, modify, or terminate the Related Person Transaction. The policy also contains procedures to ratify Related Party Transaction not previously approved in accordance with the policy. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that the Company's directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such persons are also required to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on the Company's review of copies of such forms, the Company is not aware that any of its directors, executive officers or 10% shareholders failed to comply with the filing requirements of Section 16(a) during the period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2018. 
COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS 
Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
The Company is a leader in the fastener industry manufacturing rivets, standard and specialty cold-formed fasteners, screw machine products and automated assembly equipment, primarily for the automotive industry. The fastener industry is characterized by intense competition for customers, market share and executive talent. The objective of the Executive Compensation Program of the Company (the "Program") is to align compensation with business objectives and performance to enable the Company to attract, retain, and reward key executives whose contributions are critical to ensuring the long-term success of the Company and increasing profitability, thereby enhancing shareholder value. The following principles guided compensation decisions for key executives of the Company: compensation opportunity is related to performance; compensation decisions are designed to achieve financial objectives, build shareholder value and reward individual and corporate performance; compensation is competitive and equitable; and the proportion of total pay that is at risk against individual and Company performance objectives increases with the more senior positions. 
We believe that these objectives are attainable through a compensation package that contains two key elements of compensation: base salary and cash bonuses. 
Base salaries for executives are established based upon the executive's qualifications and experience, scope of responsibilities and past performance. Base salaries are reviewed and adjusted from time to time after taking into account corporate and individual performance, as well as market levels   for positions with similar responsibilities. In setting 2018 base salaries, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, competitive salary scales, changes in responsibilities and duties, the contributions of each officer toward the long-term growth and profitability of the Company and the economic environment. 
Cash bonuses are intended to reward individual contributions to the Company's overall performance during the year and can therefore be highly variable from year to year. Such bonuses are awarded based upon the subjective evaluation by the Board of Directors based upon a recommendation of the Compensation Committee of each executive's contribution towards the Company's overall success. In determining the amount of bonuses for 2018, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the Company's operating results and individual contributions related to operational improvements. 
The Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. Profit Sharing Trust (the "Employees' Trust") is a part of the Chicago Rivet & Machine Co. Profit Sharing Plan (the "Plan") established by the Company for the benefit of its employees. Participants eligible to share in Company contributions include all employees of the Company who have completed one year of service with the Company. 
The Company makes discretionary contributions to the Employees' Trust based on the Company's judgment. The Company's contributions are allocated among eligible participants in proportion to their respective compensation, subject to statutory limitations. 
Each participant has a balance in the Employees' Trust consisting of his share of Company contributions, amounts forfeited by other participants and investment earnings. Each participant's balance vests over a five-year period, beginning with the second year of employment. Full vesting also occurs, regardless of length of employment, when a participating employee reaches normal retirement age, dies or becomes permanently and totally disabled. 
The Plan also contains a 401(k) feature pursuant to which participants may elect to have a portion (up to 60%) of their compensation (but not to exceed the maximum permitted by law) contributed to the Employees' Trust in lieu of receiving it in cash. Each eligible employee, for this purpose, becomes a participant following completion of two months of employment. These contributions are always fully vested and nonforfeitable. 
Contributions received by the Employees' Trust are held by the Trustee and invested in accordance with participants' investment directions among certain investment funds selected by the administrative committee and sponsored by the Trustee.  Distributions of a participant's vested balance are made on termination of employment, or later, if the participant so requests, subject to certain limitations. Distributions are made in a lump sum. Participants may request a loan from the Plan of an amount that does not exceed the lesser of 50% of the participant's 401(k) account balance or $50,000. 
At its 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company conducted a non-binding "say-on-pay" vote to approve the compensation of its executive officers. The Company has taken the result of that vote (in which approximately 97% of voting shareholders approved of the compensation program) into account in determining to generally continue with its existing executive compensation program. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), generally disallows a tax deduction to public companies for compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the Company's CEO or any of the four other most highly compensated executive officers. Certain performance-based compensation, however, is exempt from the deduction limit. Given the amount of compensation paid the CEO and the four other most highly compensated executive officers, the limits on deductibility of Section 162(m) of the Code on the Company's tax return are not currently applicable to the Company. 
ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
This advisory vote, commonly referred to as "say-on-pay," is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but instead relates to the tabular disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation, and the narrative disclosure accompanying the tabular presentation. These disclosures allow our shareholders to view the trends in our compensation program and the application of our compensation philosophies for the years presented. 
The Compensation Committee believes an effective compensation program should be one that is designed to recruit and keep top quality executive leadership focused on attaining long-term corporate goals and increasing stockholder value. We believe that our executive compensation program is designed reasonably and fairly to recruit, motivate, retain, and reward our executives for achieving our objectives and goals. 
Although this vote is advisory and not binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions.  The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR the approval of the resolution set forth below approving the executive compensation of the Company's named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement. 
"RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation awarded to the named executive officers, as described in this proxy statement." 
ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF THE ADVISORY 
VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also requires that we provide our shareholders with the opportunity to vote on a non-binding advisory resolution to determine whether the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation will occur every one, two, or three years. 
Accordingly, we are seeking an advisory vote on the frequency with which say-on-pay votes should be held in the future. This advisory vote is commonly referred to as "say-on-frequency." Shareholders may also abstain from voting on this proposal. 
Triennial Recommendation: At its 2013 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company last conducted its non-binding "say-on-frequency" vote, and, consistent with the Company's recommendation at that meeting, a plurality of the shareholders voting on the proposal voted in favor of a three year interval. Since 2013, the Company has held its say-on-pay votes at three year intervals. 
We continue to recommend that our shareholders select a frequency of three years, or a triennial vote. Our executive compensation program is designed to support long-term value creation, and a triennial vote will allow shareholders to better judge our executive compensation program in relation to our long-term performance. One of the core principles of our executive compensation program is to ensure management's interests are aligned with our stockholders' interests to support long-term value creation. Accordingly, we recommend a triennial vote, which would allow our executive compensation programs to be evaluated over similar time-frame and in relation to our long-term performance. In addition, a triennial vote will provide us with the time to thoughtfully respond to shareholders' sentiments and implement any necessary changes. 
We carefully review changes to our executive compensation program to maintain the consistency of the program which is important in motivating and retaining our employees. We therefore believe that a triennial vote is an appropriate frequency to provide our Compensation Committee sufficient time to thoughtfully consider shareholders' input and to implement any appropriate changes to our executive compensation program, in light of the timing that would be required to implement   any decisions related to such changes. Because this proposal is advisory, it will not be binding. However, the Board of Directors values shareholders' opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote FOR "Three Years" on the proposal recommending the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation in this proxy statement.

REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed of Edward L. Chott, Kent H. Cooney and William T. Divane, Jr., each of whom are "independent directors" as defined by the rules of the NYSE American applicable to audit committee members. The Audit Committee operates under a charter approved by the Board of Directors. 
Management is responsible for the Company's financial statements and the financial reporting process and has represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The independent accountants are responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for oversight of these processes. The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the financial statements with members of management and with the independent accountants. The Audit Committee, in addition to reviewing with the independent auditors their opinion on the conformity of the audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, discussed their judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) required to be discussed with the Audit Committee. 
Further, the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent accountants the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA Professional Standards Vol. 1, AU section 380) as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. The Audit Committee received the written disclosures and the letter from the independent accountants required by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communication with the audit committee concerning independence and discussed with the independent accountant its independence. 
Based upon the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2018, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee has selected Crowe LLP for engagement as independent accountants for 2019. 
March 20, 2019  RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITOR 
The firm of Crowe LLP served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ended December 31, 2018. A representative of that firm is expected to be present at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders with the opportunity to make a statement, if so desired, and to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The Audit Committee has selected Crowe LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
The Company is asking shareholders to ratify the selection of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. Although ratification is not required by the Company's by-laws or otherwise, the Board of Directors is submitting the selection of Crowe LLP to the Company's shareholders for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. Should the shareholders fail to provide such ratification, the Audit Committee will reconsider its selection of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants for 2019. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of Crowe LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. 
Audit and Non-Audit Fees 
The following table shows the fees for professional audit services provided by Crowe LLP for the audit of the Company's annual financial statements for fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

[END TABLE]
 The engagement of Crowe LLP in connection with the annual audit of the Company's financial statements, the reviews of the financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports and tax services, if any, were approved by the Audit Committee before the service was provided. It is the policy of the Audit Committee that all services to be performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm be approved in advance of the commencement of such services. 
OTHER MATTERS 
It is not presently expected that any matters other than the election of directors, the advisory votes and ratification of independent auditors will be brought before the meeting. If, however, other matters do come before the meeting, it is the intention of the persons named as representatives in the accompanying proxy to vote in accordance with their best judgment on such matters. 
SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS 
Shareholder proposals for inclusion in proxy materials for the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act must be received by the Company at the Company's principal executive offices by November 23, 2019. The Company's by-laws require that shareholder proposals made outside of Rule 14a-8 and shareholder nominees for election as a director must be submitted in accordance with the requirements of the by-laws, not later than December 23, 2019 and not earlier than November 23, 2019. However, if the annual meeting is called for a date not within 30 days before or after such anniversary date, such proposals must be received by the Company not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date notice of the annual meeting was mailed or a public announcement of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs.
