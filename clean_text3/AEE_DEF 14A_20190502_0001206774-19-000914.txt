2018 Performance Highlights
The successful execution of our strategy drove strong results in 2018, as well as over the past five years. Key financial and operational highlights include the following:
Financial Highlights
[BEGIN TABLE]
 $3.32 Earnings per diluted share  (GAAP) $3.37 Earnings per diluted share  (Core, non-GAAP) Ameren earned $3.32 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and $3.37 per diluted share on a core (non-GAAP) basis in 2018. The 2018 core earnings represented a strong 19 percent increase over 2017 core earnings of $2.83 per diluted share. Core results for 2018 excluded non-cash charges of 5 cents per diluted share reflecting the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of changes in federal income tax rates.* Execution of our strategy has also driven a strong 5-year compound annual earnings per share growth rate of greater than 7 percent from year-end 2013 to year-end 2018.         Ameren shares provided a total shareholder return ("TSR") of approximately 14 percent in 2018, including an approximate 4 percent increase in the quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of 2018. This was the fifth consecutive year the dividend was increased. For the three and five years ending December 31, 2018, Ameren shares provided a TSR of approximately 66 percent and 115 percent, respectively. These results meaningfully exceeded the TSR of the S&P 500 Utility and Philadelphia Utility indices for each of these periods. Ameren's TSR also ranked first among its peer group for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2018.        $2.3 billion in infrastructure   The Company invested approximately $2.3 billion in energy infrastructure to better serve customers, which also drove strong rate base growth of approximately 8 percent. Over the last 5 years, we have invested approximately $10 billion in energy infrastructure, which drove robust compound annual rate base growth of approximately 8 percent. These investments have improved the safety and reliability of our electric and natural gas systems, improved the efficiency of our energy centers, enhanced our environmental footprint, and strengthened our cyber security posture while keeping our electric rates competitive and affordable.

Proxy Statement Summary 
Operational and Regulatory Highlights
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ameren's residential electric rates remained well below the Midwest and national averages. 
● We achieved top quartile performance in our System Average Interruption Frequency Index ("SAIFI") performance, a standard customer reliability measure that indicates how often the average customer experiences a sustained interruption over a one-year period. 
● The Company achieved meaningful improvements in co-worker engagement, electric and gas system reliability and energy center performance. 
● Our Callaway nuclear energy center achieved strong safety and reliability performance, as evidenced by the fact that it experienced no unplanned outages during 2018. 
● To further facilitate cleaner energy resources and enhance system reliability in our region, Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois continued to make significant progress on its largest transmission project, Illinois Rivers, which is substantially complete. 
● In June 2018, Missouri Senate Bill 564 ("SB 564") was enacted. SB 564 significantly enhances the Missouri electric regulatory framework to support investment by improving our ability to earn a fair return on capital investments. It is also expected to deliver significant benefits to customers, create a significant number of good-paying jobs, and better position Missouri for the future, all while maintaining strong Missouri Public Service Commission ("MoPSC") oversight and consumer protections. Our company now operates under constructive regulatory frameworks that support investment in energy infrastructure in all of our business segments. 
● In June 2018, the MoPSC approved Ameren Missouri's Renewable Choice Program, which allows large commercial and industrial customers and municipalities to elect to receive up to 100 percent of their energy from renewable resources. Based on customer contracts, the program enables Ameren Missouri to supply up to 400 megawatts ("MW") of renewable wind energy generation, up to 200 MW of which it could own. 
● Under its 2017 Integrated Resource Plan, Ameren Missouri is pursuing ownership of at least 700 MW of wind generation with multiple developers. In 2018, Ameren Missouri entered into agreements to acquire, after construction, two wind generation facilities for a total of up to 557 MW. The MoPSC has approved the acquisition of both facilities. Both transactions remain subject to obtaining a Midcontinent Independent System Operator ("MISO") transmission interconnection agreement, approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ("FERC"), and other customary contract terms and conditions. 
● In November 2018, the Illinois Commerce Commission ("ICC") approved a $72 million increase in Ameren Illinois' annual electric distribution service rates beginning in January 2019, as well as a $32 million increase in Ameren Illinois' annual gas distribution service rates beginning in November 2018. In each case, these amounts were consistent with Ameren Illinois' request. 
● In December 2018, the MoPSC approved Ameren Missouri's energy efficiency plan. The plan included a three-year portfolio of customer energy-efficiency programs and a six-year plan for low-income energy-efficiency programs, along with a regulatory recovery mechanism. Ameren Missouri intends to invest $226 million over the life of the plan.

Other Highlights
[BEGIN TABLE]
● DiversityInc recognized the Company as the top utility in the nation for diversity and inclusion again in 2018, the fourth consecutive year the Company has won this honor. And for the first time ever, Ameren was included in the top ten list of all regional companies. 
● In November 2018, following through on the shareholder proposal that received majority support at our 2018 annual shareholder meeting, we issued a report on our responsible management of coal combustion residuals ("CCR"). The report included a detailed discussion of our risk management, oversight and compliance measures with respect to our CCR storage facilities. 
● In 2018, we continued to provide extensive information regarding our sustainability initiatives through our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, our responses to the annual climate change and water surveys conducted by CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, we participated in the Edison Electric Institute's ("EEI") environmental, social and governance ("ESG") and sustainability-related reporting initiative, as well as undertook the development of our climate risk report, which was issued in March 2019.

● The Company is asking shareholders to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the executives named in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement (the "Named Executive Officers", or "NEOs").● For more information about the NEOs' compensation, please see the Executive Compensation discussion on pages 43-75.
[END TABLE]
The Board has a long-standing commitment to strong corporate governance and recognizes the interests that shareholders have in executive compensation. The Company's compensation philosophy is to provide a competitive total compensation program that is based on the size-adjusted median of the compensation opportunities provided by similar utility industry companies (the "Market Data"), adjusted for our short- and long-term performance and the individual's performance. The Board unanimously recommends a "FOR" vote because it believes that the Human Resources Committee, which is responsible for establishing the compensation for the NEOs, designed the 2018 compensation program to align the long-term interests of the NEOs with that of shareholders to maximize shareholder value.

Board Composition and Refreshment
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regularly evaluates the composition of the Board in light of the Company's strategy and the tenure of the members of the Board. 
● We maintain a director retirement age of 72. A director who attains age 72 must submit a letter to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee offering his or her resignation from the Board, effective with the end of the director's elected term. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review the appropriateness of continued service on the Board of Directors by that director and make a recommendation to the Board of Directors and, if applicable, repeat such review annually thereafter. Mr. Galvin and Dr. Jackson will retire from the Board, effective immediately following the Annual Meeting, in accordance with this policy. 
● In addition, the Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that a director who undergoes a significant change with respect to principal employment is required to notify the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and offer his or her resignation from the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will then evaluate the facts and circumstances and make a recommendation to the Board whether to accept the offered resignation or request that the director continue to serve on the Board.

Consideration of Director Nominees
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominations from shareholders in accordance with the Company's Policy Regarding Nominations of Directors ("Director Nomination Policy"), a copy of which can be found on the Company's website. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider as a candidate any director of the Company who has indicated to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee that he or she is willing to stand for reelection as well as any other person who is recommended by any shareholders of the Company who provide the required information and certifications within the time requirements, as set forth in the Director Nomination Policy. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also undertake its own search process for candidates and may retain the services of professional search firms or other third parties to assist in identifying and evaluating potential nominees. In 2018, a nationally-recognized, leading third-party search firm was engaged by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to assist in identifying and evaluating potential director nominees.
In considering a potential nominee for the Board, shareholders should note that in selecting candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee endeavors to find individuals of high integrity who have a solid record of leadership and accomplishment in their chosen fields and who display the independence to effectively represent the best interests of all shareholders. Candidates are selected for their ability to exercise good judgment, to provide practical insights and diverse perspectives and to contribute to the regular refreshment of skill sets represented on the Board. Candidates also will be assessed in the context of the then-current composition of the Board, the average tenure of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of all shareholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will, in connection with its assessment and recommendation of candidates for director, consider diversity (including, but not limited to, gender, race, ethnicity, age, experience and skills), director tenure, board refreshment and such other factors as it deems appropriate given the then-current and anticipated future needs of the Board and the Company, and to maintain a balance of perspectives, qualifications, qualities and skills on the Board. In such cases, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will direct its third-party search firm to provide a list of candidates dominated by certain underrepresented categories, such as women or racial or ethnic minorities. These focused searches have contributed to the diversity of the Company's current Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and assesses the implementation and effectiveness of its diversity policy in connection with Board nominations annually. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may seek candidates that have different qualities and experiences at different times in order to maximize the aggregate experience, qualities and strengths of the Board members, nominees for each election or appointment of directors will be evaluated using a substantially similar process and under no circumstances will the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluate nominees recommended by a shareholder of the Company pursuant to a process substantially different than that used for other nominees for the same election or appointment of directors.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers the following qualifications at a minimum in recommending to the Board potential new Board members, or the continued service of existing members:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the highest professional and personal ethics; 
● broad experience in business, government, education or technology; 
● ability to provide insights and practical wisdom based on their experience and expertise; 
● commitment to enhancing shareholder value; 
● sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties; their service on other boards of public companies should be limited to a reasonable number; 
● compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; 
● ability to develop a good working relationship with other Board members and contribute to the Board's working relationship with senior management of the Company; and 
● independence; a substantial majority of the Board shall consist of independent directors, as defined by the Company's Director Nomination Policy. See "— Board Structure — Director Independence" below.

Corporate Governance
Other than the foregoing, there are no stated minimum criteria for director nominees, although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does, however, believe it appropriate for at least one member of the Board to meet the criteria for an "audit committee financial expert" as defined by SEC rules. In addition, because the Company is committed to maintaining its tradition of inclusion and diversity within the Board, each assessment and selection of director candidates will be made by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in compliance with the Company's policy of non-discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ethnicity, age, disability, veteran status, pregnancy, marital status, sexual orientation or any other reason prohibited by law. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers and assesses the implementation and effectiveness of its diversity policy in connection with Board nominations annually to assure that the Board contains an effective mix of individuals to best advance the Company's long-term business interests.
The Company's Director Nomination Policy requires all directors standing for reelection to agree that in the event that any director fails to obtain the required majority vote at an annual meeting of shareholders, such director will tender his or her resignation as a director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will evaluate the best interests of the Company and its shareholders and will recommend to the Board the action to be taken with respect to such tendered resignation.
The Board's Role and Responsibilities
Overview
The Board oversees the strategic direction of the Company in the long-term interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Board's major responsibilities include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Overseeing enterprise risk management; 
● Reviewing and approving strategic and operating plans, financial objectives and other significant actions; 
● Creating and maintaining an effective governance structure, including appropriate Board composition and planning for Board succession; 
● Overseeing our legal, regulatory and ethical compliance programs, including those relating to the preparation of financial statements and other public disclosures; 
● Evaluating CEO and senior management performance and determining executive compensation; and 
● Planning for CEO succession and monitoring management's succession planning for other key executive officers. 
[END TABLE]
Risk Oversight Process
Given the importance of monitoring risks, the Board has charged its Audit and Risk Committee with oversight responsibility of the Company's overall enterprise risk management process, which includes the identification, assessment, mitigation and monitoring of risks on a Company-wide basis. Our enterprise risk management program is a comprehensive, consistently applied management framework that is designed to ensure all forms of risk and opportunity are identified, reported and managed in an effective manner. Risk management is embedded into business processes and key decision making at all levels of the Company.
The Audit and Risk Committee meets on a regular basis to review the enterprise risk management processes, at which time applicable members of senior management provide reports to the Audit and Risk Committee. The Audit and Risk Committee coordinates this oversight with other committees of the Board having primary oversight responsibility for specific risks (see "— BOARD COMMITTEES" below). Each of the Board's standing committees receives regular reports from members of senior management concerning its assessment of Company risks within the purview of such committee. Each such committee also has the authority to engage independent advisers. The risks that are not specifically assigned to a Board committee are considered by the Audit and Risk Committee through its oversight of the Company's enterprise risk management process. The Audit and Risk Committee then discusses with members of senior management methods to mitigate such risks.

Notwithstanding the Board's oversight delegation to the Audit and Risk Committee, the entire Board is actively involved in risk oversight. The Audit and Risk Committee annually reviews for the Board which committees maintain oversight responsibilities described above and the overall effectiveness of the enterprise risk management process. In addition, at each of its meetings, the Board receives a report from the Chair of the Audit and Risk Committee, as well as from the Chair of each of the Board's other standing committees identified below, each of which is currently chaired by an independent director. Through the process outlined above, the Board believes that its leadership structure provides effective oversight of the Company's risk management.

We are committed to operating in a sustainable manner and are doing this by carefully balancing our key responsibilities to our customers and the communities we serve, our co-workers, our shareholders, and the environment. Reflecting this balanced approach to sustainability, Ameren's commitment to strong corporate governance includes policies and principles that integrate ESG matters into our broader risk management and strategic planning initiatives. We are focused on ensuring that our corporate governance and enterprise risk management practices protect and enhance long-term shareholder value and reflect our environmental stewardship.
The full Board of Directors oversees environmental matters as they relate to policy and strategy, including those related to planning for the potential implications of climate-related risks. The Board routinely considers environmental issues (including climate issues) and assesses how they impact the Company's operations, strategies and risk profile. The Company's directors engage in vigorous discussions regarding these issues in which they express and consider diverse points of view. The Board has a diverse range of skills that make it well-positioned to address the risks and opportunities associated with environmental issues. These include extensive energy industry, strategic planning, financial, cyber, and regulatory experience, as well as environmental and legal expertise. In addition to the Board's direct oversight, standing committees of the Board have the following responsibilities:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Audit and Risk Committee oversees Ameren's enterprise risk management program, which includes strategic and operational risks, as well as the processes, guidelines, and policies for identifying, assessing, monitoring, and mitigating such risks, which include climate-related risks.

● The Nuclear and Operations Committee oversees and reviews the Company's operations, including safety, performance and compliance issues. This includes environmental compliance matters and related risk management policies and practices. Senior management updates the Nuclear and Operations Committee on all aspects of the Company's operations throughout the year, including long-term generation planning and compliance with environmental regulations. 
● The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company's corporate governance, which includes review of the Company's proxy statements, shareholder proposals, the Company's responses to shareholder proposals and any reports the Company issues in response to shareholder proposals. 
[END TABLE]
We provide extensive information regarding our sustainability initiatives through our website, including in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility report, our responses to the annual climate change and water surveys conducted by CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project), and our other filings with the SEC. In addition, we are among the initial steering committee members of, and are participating in, the Edison Electric Institute's ("EEI") ESG and sustainability-related reporting program. This program has developed a reporting framework to enable utility companies to provide the financial sector with key ESG and sustainability information on more uniform and consistent basis. EEI's reporting framework includes both a quantitative section with data on recent greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a 2005 baseline for comparison, and a qualitative section with a discussion of the company's ESG and sustainability strategy and governance. Our EEI ESG/Sustainability reports under this framework, which are available on our website at www.amereninvestors.com/corporate-governance/EEI-ESG-Sustainability, include greenhouse gas emissions data and other ESG data.
In response to shareholder interest, we have recently issued two additional environmental reports:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In November 2018, following through on the shareholder proposal that received majority support at our 2018 annual shareholder meeting, we issued a report on our responsible management of coal combustion residuals ("CCR"). The report included a detailed discussion of our risk management, oversight and compliance measures with respect to our CCR storage facilities. 
● In March 2019, we issued a climate risk report that includes analysis of the impact of technological and policy changes that are consistent with limiting global warming. It describes the comprehensive steps Ameren is taking to meet its obligation to provide safe, reliable and affordable energy in an environmentally responsible manner to its customers and the communities it serves while effectively balancing climate-related risks. Among other things, this report leveraged the results of our participation in the Electric Power Research Institute's study regarding utility industry scenario analyses with respect to climate change. 
[END TABLE]
Consideration of Risks Associated with Compensation
In evaluating the material elements of compensation available to executives and other Company employees, the Human Resources Committee takes into consideration whether the Company's compensation policies and practices may incentivize behaviors that might lead to excessive risk taking. The Human Resources Committee, with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"), and Company management, reviews the Company's compensation policies and practices each year for design features that have the potential to encourage excessive risk taking. The program contains multiple design features that manage or mitigate these potential risks, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● an appropriate balance of fixed and variable pay opportunities; 
● caps on incentive plan payouts; 
● the use of multiple performance measures in the compensation program; 
● measurement of performance at the corporate level; 
● a mix between short-term and long-term incentives, with an emphasis for executives on rewarding long-term performance; 
● Committee discretion regarding individual executive awards; 
● oversight by non-participants in the plans; 
● a code of conduct, internal controls and other measures implemented by the Company; 
● anti-hedging and anti-pledging policies for executives; 
● a clawback provision in the 2014 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2014 Plan") and 2006 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2006 Plan") that applies to annual and long-term incentive plan grants; and

Based upon the above considerations, the Human Resources Committee determined that the Company's compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Management Succession Planning and Human Capital Management
The Board, consulting with the Human Resources Committee, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and others, as it considers appropriate, establishes and reviews policies and procedures regarding succession to the Chief Executive Officer position in the event of emergency or retirement. In furtherance thereof, the Board and the Human Resource Committee meet periodically in executive session to plan for succession with respect to the position of Chief Executive Officer and monitor management's succession planning for other key executives.
In 2018, the Human Resources Committee charter was amended to provide that the Human Resources Committee will review and discuss with management the Company's human capital management practices and policies, including diversity and inclusion initiatives.
Shareholder Outreach and Engagement
The Company maintains an active shareholder engagement program to ensure regular communication with shareholders regarding areas of interest or concern. Each year, we conduct outreach to shareholders owning a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of Common Stock.
The Company's outreach meetings have historically focused on its governance practices, executive compensation, and environmental matters and oversight. Shareholder feedback and suggestions that we receive are reported to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Nuclear and Operations Committee, or the entire Board, as applicable, for consideration. Our recent engagement efforts have influenced:
Board Structure
Board Leadership Structure
The Company's By-Laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines delegate to the Board of Directors the right to exercise its discretion to either separate or combine the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. The Board annually considers the appropriate leadership structure for the Company and has concluded that the Company and its shareholders are best served by the Board retaining discretion to determine whether the same individual should serve as both Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. This decision is based upon the Board's determination of what is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, in light of then-current and anticipated future circumstances and taking into consideration succession planning, skills and experience of the individual(s) filling those positions, and other relevant factors. The independent members of the Board have determined that the
26     Ameren Corporation
Table of Contents
Corporate Governance 
Board leadership structure that is most appropriate at this time, given the specific characteristics and circumstances of the Company and the skills and experience of Mr. Baxter, is a leadership structure that combines the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer with Mr. Baxter filling those roles for the following primary reasons:
The Board recognizes that, depending on the specific characteristics and circumstances of the Company, other leadership structures might also be appropriate. A Board leadership structure that separates the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer has previously served the Company and its shareholders well and may serve them well in the future. The Company is committed to reviewing this determination on an annual basis.
According to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, when the Chairman of the Board is the Chief Executive Officer or an employee of the Company, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors will select an independent director to preside at or lead the executive sessions (which selection will be ratified by vote of the independent directors of the Board of Directors) (the "Lead Director"). The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Lead Director will serve a one-year term and that it is expected that the Lead Director will serve at least three and no more than five consecutive terms in order to facilitate the rotation of the Lead Director position while maintaining experienced leadership. The Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines set forth the authority, duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors' Lead Director as follows:

Corporate Governance 
In performing the duties described above, the Lead Director is expected to consult with the Chairs of the appropriate Board committees and solicit their participation. The Lead Director also performs such other duties as may be assigned to the Lead Director by the Company's By-Laws or the Board of Directors.
Director Independence
Pursuant to NYSE listing standards, the Company's Board of Directors has adopted a formal set of categorical independence standards with respect to the determination of director independence. These standards are set forth in the Company's Director Nomination Policy. The provisions of the Director Nomination Policy regarding director independence meet and in some areas exceed the NYSE listing standards. In accordance with the Director Nomination Policy, in order to be considered independent a director must be determined to have no material relationship with the Company other than as a director.
The Director Nomination Policy specifies the criteria by which the independence of our directors will be determined.
Under the Director Nomination Policy, an "independent director" is one who:
28     Ameren Corporation
Table of Contents
Corporate Governance 
For purposes of determining a "material relationship," the following standards are utilized:
For purposes of these independence standards, (i) immediate family members of a director include the director's spouse, parents, stepparents, children, stepchildren, siblings, mother- and father-in-law, sons- and daughters-in-law, and brothers- and sisters-in-law and anyone (other than domestic employees) who shares the director's home and (ii) the term "primary business affiliation" means an entity of which the director or the director's immediate family member is a principal/executive officer or in which the director or the director's immediate family member holds at least a five percent equity interest.
In accordance with the Director Nomination Policy, the Board undertook its annual review of director and director nominee independence. During this review, the Board considered transactions and relationships between each director and director nominee or any member of his or her immediate family and the Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The Board also considered whether there were any transactions or relationships between directors, nominees or any member of their immediate family (or any entity of which a director, director nominee or an immediate family member is an executive officer, general partner or significant equity holder). As provided in the Director Nomination Policy, the purpose of this review was to determine whether any such relationships or transactions existed that were inconsistent with a determination that the director or nominee is independent.
In evaluating the independence of directors, the Board considered all transactions between the Company and entities with which the directors and nominees are associated. Directors Dickson, Eder, Fitzsimmons, Galvin, Harshman and Johnson are affiliated with companies that purchased services from and/or sold services to the Company or its subsidiaries, which services were either rate-regulated or competitively bid. Directors Eder, Fitzsimmons, Galvin and Harshman are affiliated with companies that purchased services from and/or sold services to the Company or its subsidiaries, which services were not rate-regulated or competitively bid but which were entered into in the ordinary course of business and on substantially the same terms as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non-affiliated persons. In each case, the Board determined that the transactions were significantly below the thresholds under the director independence standards, under the NYSE requirements, and under the Company's own standard for determining "material relationships" and did not affect the directors' independence.
The Board also reviewed all contributions made by the Company and its subsidiaries to charitable organizations with which the directors or their immediate family members serve as an executive officer. The Board determined that the contributions were consistent with similar contributions, were approved in accordance with the Company's normal procedures and were under the thresholds of the director independence requirements.
All of the referenced transactions discussed above were ordinary course commercial transactions made on an arm's-length basis and on terms comparable to those generally available to unaffiliated third parties under the same or similar circumstances. The Board considered each of these transactions and relationships and determined that none of them was material or affected the independence of directors involved under either the general independence standards contained in the NYSE's listing standards or the categorical standards contained in our Director Nomination Policy.

As a result of this review, the Board, at its meeting in February 2019, affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent under the standards set forth in the Director Nomination Policy: Catherine S. Brune, J. Edward Coleman, Ward H. Dickson, Noelle K. Eder, Ellen M. Fitzsimmons, Rafael Flores, Richard J. Harshman, Craig S. Ivey, James C. Johnson, Steven H. Lipstein and Stephen R. Wilson; and that Warner L. Baxter, as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, is not independent under the Director Nomination Policy. The Board also determined that Walter J. Galvin and Gayle P.W. Jackson, who are currently directors of the Company but who are not standing for reelection and will retire effective as of the Annual Meeting, are independent under such standards.
All members of the Audit and Risk Committee, the Human Resources Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Nuclear and Operations Committee and the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors are independent under the standards set forth in the Director Nomination Policy.
Executive Sessions of Independent Directors
The independent directors meet privately in executive sessions to consider such matters as they deem appropriate, without management being present, as a routinely scheduled agenda item for every Board meeting. During 2018, all directors other than Mr. Baxter were independent (see "— Board Structure — Director Independence" above). Richard J. Harshman, who currently serves as the Lead Director, presides at the executive sessions. The Lead Director's duties also include those detailed under "— Board Structure — Board Leadership Structure" above.
Board Committees
The Board of Directors has a standing Audit and Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Nuclear and Operations Committee and Finance Committee, the chairs and members of which are recommended by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, appointed annually by the Board and are identified below. The Audit and Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are comprised entirely of non-management directors, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined to be "independent" as defined by the relevant provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the NYSE listing standards and the Director Nomination Policy. In addition, the Nuclear and Operations Committee and the Finance Committee are currently comprised entirely of non-management directors, each of whom the Board has also determined to be "independent" under the Director Nomination Policy.

Corporate Governance Guidelines and Policies, Committee Charters and Codes of Conduct
The Board of Directors has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines, a Director Nomination Policy, a Policy Regarding Communications to the Board of Directors, a Related Person Transactions Policy and written charters for its Audit and Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Nuclear and Operations Committee and Finance Committee. The Board of Directors also has adopted the Company's code of business conduct (referred to as Ameren's Principles of Business Conduct) applicable to all of the Company's directors, officers and employees, and the Company's Code of Ethics for Principal Executive and Senior Financial Officers. These documents and other items relating to the governance of the Company can be found on our website at www.amereninvestors.com/corporate-governance. These documents are also available in print free of charge to any shareholder who requests them from the Office of the Company's Secretary.
Policy Regarding Communications to the Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has adopted a policy for shareholders and other interested persons to send communications to the Board. Shareholders and other interested persons who desire to communicate with the Company's directors or a particular director may write to our principal executive offices, to the attention of the Head of Investor Relations: Ameren Corporation, Mail Code 202, 1901 Chouteau Avenue, St. Louis, Missouri 63103. E-mail communications to directors should be sent to directorcommunication@ameren.com. All communications must be accompanied by the following information: if the person submitting the communication is a shareholder, a statement of the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock that the person holds; if the person submitting the communication is not a shareholder and is submitting the communication to the Lead Director or the non-management directors as an interested party, the nature of the person's interest in the Company; any special interest, meaning an interest not in the capacity of a shareholder of the Company, of the person in the subject matter of the communication; and the address, telephone number and e-mail address, if any, of the person submitting the communication. Communications received from shareholders and other interested persons to the Board of Directors will be reviewed by the Head of Investor Relations, or such other person designated by all non-management members of the Board, and if such communications are not solicitations, advertisements or other forms of mass mailings, they will be forwarded by the Office of the Secretary to the Lead Director or applicable Board member or members as expeditiously as reasonably practicable.
Annual Assessment of Board, Board Committee and Individual Director Performance
The Board of Directors annually reviews its performance, structure and processes in order to assess how effectively it is functioning. This assessment is implemented and administered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee through an annual Board evaluation. Further, each of the Audit and Risk Committee, Human Resources Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, Nuclear and Operations Committee and Finance Committee of the Board conducts an annual evaluation of its performance. After reviewing the Board evaluations, the Lead Director discusses the Board's effectiveness with each director individually. The Lead Director reports to the Board on the Board evaluations, and each committee chair reports to the applicable committee on the committee evaluations. The full Board of Directors discusses the Board evaluation and committee evaluation reports to determine what, if any, action could improve (1) Board and Board committee performance and (2) if necessary, a director's performance as it relates to the overall effectiveness of the Board.
In addition to the performance evaluations described above, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also reviews annually the performance of all incumbent directors who are eligible for reelection at the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders.

Board and Committee Meetings and Annual Meeting Attendance
The Board of Directors held eight meetings during 2018. Each director attended at least 75 percent of the total meetings of the Board and Board committees on which he or she served during the year. The average attendance rate of all directors at Board and Board committee meetings in 2018 was 99 percent.
The Company has adopted a policy under which Board members are expected to attend each shareholders' meeting. At the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, all of the then-incumbent directors were in attendance.
Standing Board Committee Governance Practices
The standing Board committees focus on good governance practices. These include:
Director Orientation and Development
Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Company provides an orientation program for newly elected directors of the Company. The program, which is conducted no more than six months after the meeting at which the new director is elected, includes:
The Board has also established a director development program that provides directors with the opportunity to receive substantive instruction on topical issues relating to the current and evolving responsibilities of directors of public companies and corporate governance matters. Through this program, each director has the opportunity to attend one or more development programs each year. In addition, the Board typically holds a development session in connection with each of its regularly scheduled meetings. These sessions include presentations by internal and external experts on key operational, financial, environmental or governance issues. In 2018, these sessions included presentations on cybersecurity, diversity and inclusion, crisis management, and energy industry trends.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board of Directors, in accordance with NYSE listing standards, has adopted a formal set of Corporate Governance Guidelines, which include certain director qualification standards, stock ownership requirements for directors, officers and other members of management.

Stock Ownership Requirements
Director Stock Ownership Requirement
Since 2007, the Company has had a stock ownership requirement applicable to all of its non-management directors. Under this requirement, as set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, within the later of five years of the January 1, 2007 effective date or within five years after initial election to the Board, all non-management directors are required to own Company Common Stock equal in value to at least five times their base annual cash retainer and hold such amount of stock throughout their directorship.
If at any time a non-management director does not satisfy the stock ownership requirement, such director must retain at least 50 percent of the after-tax shares acquired by such director subsequent to January 1, 2012 under Ameren's equity compensation programs until the stock ownership requirement is satisfied.
All non-management directors currently satisfy the stock ownership requirement, with the exception of Directors Dickson, Eder and Ivey who became directors in 2018 and have until 2023 to meet this requirement.
Management Stock Ownership Requirement
The Company has a stock ownership requirement for members of the Senior Leadership Team (which includes the NEOs) that fosters long-term Common Stock ownership and aligns the interests of the Senior Leadership Team and shareholders. The stock ownership requirement applicable to the Senior Leadership Team is included in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The requirement provides that each member of the Senior Leadership Team is required to own shares of Common Stock valued as a percentage of base salary as follows:
If at any time a member of the Senior Leadership Team does not satisfy the applicable stock ownership requirement, such member of the Senior Leadership Team must retain at least 75 percent of the after-tax shares acquired upon the vesting and settlement of (i) the Senior Leadership Team member's awards that are then outstanding under the Company's equity compensation programs and (ii) any future awards granted to the Senior Leadership Team member under the Company's equity compensation programs, until the applicable stock ownership requirement is satisfied. All NEOs are in compliance with the stock ownership requirements, including taking into account any base salary increases for fiscal year 2019.
Related Person Transactions Policy
The Board of Directors has adopted the Ameren Corporation Related Person Transactions Policy. This written policy provides that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will review and approve Related Person Transactions (as defined below); provided that the Human Resources Committee will review and approve the compensation of each Company employee who is an immediate family member of a Company director or executive officer and whose annual compensation exceeds $120,000. The Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has been delegated authority to act between Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meetings.
The policy defines a "Related Person Transaction" as a transaction (including any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships)) in which the Company (including any of its subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and in which any Related Person (as defined below) had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than: (1) competitively bid or regulated public utility services transactions; (2) transactions involving trustee type services; (3) transactions in which the Related Person's interest arises solely from ownership

"Related Person" is defined as (1) each director, director nominee and executive officer of the Company, (2) any person who is known by the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of the Company's voting securities, (3) immediate family members of the foregoing persons and (4) any entity in which any of the foregoing persons is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person and all immediate family members of such person has a ten percent or greater beneficial interest.
The Office of the Secretary of the Company assesses whether a proposed transaction is a Related Person Transaction for purposes of the policy.
The policy recognizes that Related Person Transactions may, in some circumstances, be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.
The approval procedures in the policy identify the factors the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider in evaluating whether to approve or ratify Related Person Transactions or material amendments to pre-approved Related Person Transactions. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider all of the relevant facts and circumstances available to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, including (if applicable) but not limited to: the benefits to the Company; the actual or apparent conflict of interest of the Related Person in the event of the Related Person Transaction, including, but not limited to, the impact on a director's independence; the availability and costs of other sources for comparable products or services; the terms of the transaction; the terms available to or from unrelated third parties or to employees generally; and an analysis of the significance of the transaction to both the Company and the Related Person. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will approve or ratify only those Related Person Transactions (a) that are in compliance with applicable SEC rules and regulations, NYSE listing requirements and the Company's policies, including but not limited to the Principles of Business Conduct and (b) that are in, or are not inconsistent with, the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determines in good faith. The policy provides for the pre-approval by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of certain Related Person Transactions up to one year prior to the commencement of the transaction. The Human Resources Committee will review and approve on an annual basis the compensation of each Company employee who is an immediate family member of a Company director or executive officer and whose total annual compensation exceeds $120,000.
Based on the standards described above and certain determinations made by the Board discussed under "— Board Structure — Director Independence," we had no Related Person Transactions in 2018.

2018 DIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE
Role of Director Compensation Consultant
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee directly retains Meridian to advise it with respect to director compensation matters. During 2018, Meridian conducted an outside director market pay analysis for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, as discussed further under "— Director Compensation — Fees and Stock Awards" below, and attended a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting to discuss the analysis. Pursuant to policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors for the purpose of determining whether the work of any compensation consultant raised any conflict of interest, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee determined that with respect to director compensation-related matters, no conflict of interest was raised by the work of Meridian.

Corporate Governance 
Fees and Stock Awards
The compensation program for non-management directors is reviewed on an annual basis by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee with a view to provide a pay program that compensates non-management directors at the median of the market. During 2018, this review, in consultation with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's independent director compensation consultant, included an evaluation of a comparative peer group of companies that was identical to the 2017 PSUP peer group (as discussed under "— Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Long-Term Incentive Compensation" in the proxy statement prepared in connection with the Company's 2018 annual meeting of shareholders) to determine the overall competitiveness of pay and prevalence of program features of Ameren's director compensation program.
As a result of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's annual review, the Board of Directors approved the following changes to the non-management director compensation program, effective January 1, 2019: increasing the cash retainer for the chair of each of the Human Resources Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and Finance Committee by $2,500; increasing the cash retainer for the Lead Director by $5,000; and increasing the annual and initial grants of Company Common Stock by $15,000. The 2019 non-management director compensation program consists of the following cash and stock-based compensation:
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan Participation
The Ameren Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Members of the Board of Directors, as amended (the "Directors Deferred Compensation Plan"), offers non-management directors the option to defer all or part of their annual cash retainers, meeting fees and Company Common Stock share awards as described below. The deferred compensation plan available to directors prior to 2009 permitted non-management directors to defer only annual cash retainers and meeting fees. In 2018, each of Directors Eder, Galvin and Ivey elected to defer all of his or her annual cash retainers. Each of Directors Coleman, Flores, Galvin and Johnson elected to defer all of his 2018 stock award under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan.
All deferrals of Company Common Stock awards pursuant to the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan are converted to "Stock Units," representing each share of Company Common Stock awarded to and deferred by the participant. Stock Units are not considered actual shares of Company Common Stock, and participants have no rights as an Ameren shareholder with respect to any Stock Units until shares of Company Common Stock are delivered in accordance with the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan. Participants will have the right to receive dividend equivalents on Stock Units as of each dividend payment date, which are to be converted to additional Stock Units on the dividend payment date in accordance with the 2006 Plan and the 2014 Plan, as applicable. The price used for converting dividend equivalents to additional Stock Units is the same as the price used for calculating the number of additional shares purchased as of such dividend payment date by Ameren's Deferred Compensation Plan record keeper.
All payments under the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan relating to deferrals of a director's Company Common Stock award (including dividend equivalents which will be converted into additional Stock Units) will be made in the form of one share of Company Common Stock for each whole Stock Unit and cash equal to the fair market value of each fraction of a Stock Unit credited to the participant's account.

Corporate Governance 
With respect to annual cash retainer and meeting fees, deferred amounts, plus an interest factor, are used to provide payout distributions following completion of Board service and certain death benefits. In October 2009, the Company adopted an amendment to the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan which amended the portion of the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan relating to the interest crediting rates used for cash amounts deferred with respect to plan years commencing on and after January 1, 2010. In October 2010, the Company adopted an amendment to the Directors Deferred Compensation Plan for plan years beginning on and after January 1, 2011 to change the measurement period for the applicable interest rates for cash amounts deferred under such plan prior to January 1, 2010. Pursuant to the amended Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, cash amounts deferred (and interest attributable thereto) accrue interest at the rate to be applied to the participant's account balance depending on (1) the plan year for which the rate is being calculated and (2) the year in which the deferral was made, as follows:
After the participant director retires or dies, the deferred amounts (and interest attributable thereto) accrue interest as follows:
As a result of the changes described in the narrative preceding the tables above, there are no above-market or preferential earnings on compensation deferred with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010 for deferrals made on and after January 1, 2010.
A participant director may choose to receive the deferred amounts upon ceasing to be a member of the Company's Board of Directors at age 55 or over in a lump sum payment or in installments over a set period of up to 15 years. However, in the event a participant ceases being a member of the Company's Board of Directors prior to age 55, the balance in such participant's deferral account shall be distributed in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant ceases being a member of the Company's Board of Directors. In the event a participant ceases being a member of the Company's Board of Directors prior to age 55 and after the occurrence of a Change of Control (as hereinafter defined under "— Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control"), the balance in such director's deferral account, with any interest payable as described in Table A above, shall be distributed in a lump sum to the director within 30 days after the date the director ceases being a member of the Company's Board of Directors. In the event that the Company ceases to exist or is no longer publicly traded on the NYSE or the NASDAQ Stock Market ("NASDAQ"), upon the occurrence of such Change of Control, any Stock Units held by a participating director will be converted to a cash value upon the Change of Control and thereafter will be credited with interest as described in Table A above until distributed. The cash value of the Stock Unit will equal the value of one share of Company Common Stock based upon the closing price on the NYSE or NASDAQ on the last trading day prior to the Change of Control.

Guiding Objectives
Our objective for compensation of the NEOs is to provide a competitive total compensation program that is based on the size-adjusted median of the compensation opportunities provided by similar utility companies, adjusted for our short- and long-term performance and the individual's performance. The adjustment for our performance aligns the long-term interests of the NEOs with that of our shareholders to maximize shareholder value.
Our compensation philosophy and related governance features are executed by several specific policies and practices that are designed to align our executive compensation with long-term shareholder interests, including:

We also provide various health and welfare benefits to the NEOs on substantially the same basis as we provide to all salaried employees.
Each element is reviewed individually and considered collectively with other elements of our compensation program to ensure that it is consistent with the goals and objectives of that particular element of compensation as well as our overall compensation program.

2018 Total Cash Versus Equity-Based Compensation
Market Data and Compensation Peer Group
In October 2017, the Committee's independent consultant collected and analyzed comprehensive data regarding similar utility industry companies, including base salary, target short-term incentives (non-equity incentive plan compensation) and long-term incentive opportunities. The industry data was obtained from a proprietary database maintained by Aon Hewitt.
The elements of pay were benchmarked both individually and in total to the same comparator group.
Compensation opportunities for the NEOs were compared to the size-adjusted median of the compensation opportunities for comparable positions provided by similar utility companies (the "Market Data"), defined as regulated utility industry companies in a revenue size range approximately one-half to double our size, with a few exceptions (our "compensation peers"). The Committee's independent consultant used statistical techniques to adjust the data to be appropriate for our revenue size. Our compensation peers have a range of revenues, but because of the use of regression analysis, this did not necessarily impact the Market Data.
We provide compensation opportunities at levels indicated by the Market Data, and design our incentive plans to pay more or less than the target amount when performance is above or below target performance levels, respectively. Thus, our plans are designed to result in payouts that are market-appropriate given our performance for that year or period.
The companies identified as the "compensation peers" used to develop 2018 compensation opportunities from the above-described data are listed in the graphic below. The list is subject to change each year depending on merger and acquisition activity, the availability of the companies' data through Aon Hewitt's database and the continued appropriateness of the companies in terms of size and industry in relationship to the Company.
PSU Peer Group
For purposes of measuring our relative TSR performance for our PSU awards, we use an overlapping but distinct peer group (the "PSU Peer Group"). The 2018 PSU Peer Group was established as of December 2017 using the following criteria:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Classified as an "NYSE Investor Owned Utility," within SNL Financial LC's SEC/Public Companies Power Database. 
● Market capitalization greater than $2 billion. 
● Minimum S&P credit rating of BBB- (investment grade). 
● Dividends flat or growing over the last twelve-month period. 
● Not an announced acquisition target. 
● Not undergoing a major restructuring including, but not limited to, a major spin-off or sale of a significant asset. 
[END TABLE]
The 20 companies included in the 2018 PSU Peer Group as of January 1, 2018 are listed in the graphic below. These PSU Peer Group companies are not entirely the same as the compensation peers used for market pay comparisons, because inclusion in this group was not dependent on a company's revenues relative to Ameren or its participation in an executive pay database. At the end of the performance period, the final 2018 PSU Peer Group may be impacted by acquisition and restructuring events.

COMPARISON OF COMPENSATION PEER GROUP AND PSU PEER GROUP
Mix of Pay
We believe that both cash compensation and noncash compensation are appropriate elements of a total rewards program. Cash compensation is short-term compensation (i.e., base salary and annual incentive awards), while noncash compensation is generally long-term compensation (i.e., equity-based incentive compensation).
A significant percentage of total compensation is allocated to short-term and long-term incentives as a result of the philosophy mentioned above. During 2018, there was no pre-established policy or target for the allocation between either cash and noncash or short-term and long-term compensation. Rather, the Committee reviewed the Market Data provided by its consultant to determine the appropriate level and mix of incentive compensation. The allocation between current and long-term compensation was based primarily on competitive market practices relative to base salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive award values. By following this process, the impact on executive compensation is to increase the proportion of pay that is at risk as an individual's responsibility within the Company increases and to create long-term incentive opportunities that exceed short-term opportunities for NEOs.
Base Salary
Our base salary program is designed to reward the NEOs with market competitive salaries based upon role, experience, competence and sustained performance.
We determine the amount for base salary by referencing the Market Data discussed above. Based on this data and the scope of each NEO's role, a base salary range was established for each position at +/- 20 percent of the established market rate for the position. The base salary of each NEO is typically managed within this pay range.

Executive Compensation Matters
In 2017, Mr. Baxter (our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer) recommended a 2018 base salary increase for each of the other NEOs considering the executive's then-current salary in relation to the Market Data, experience and sustained individual performance and results. These recommendations, which took into account the Market Data provided by the Committee's compensation consultant, were presented to the Committee for discussion and approval at the December 2017 Committee meeting. Increases were approved based on the Market Data and base salary range, experience, individual performance and the need to retain an experienced team. Performance takes into account competence, initiative, leadership and contribution to achievement of our goals.
In December 2017, the Committee also approved an increase to the 2018 base salary of Mr. Baxter from $1,075,000 to $1,140,000 in connection with Mr. Baxter's annual performance review. The Committee's decision to adjust Mr. Baxter's base salary was based on a number of factors, including his performance as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the Committee's review of the Market Data for the chief executive officer position.
Short-Term Incentive Compensation: Executive Incentive Plan
2018 Ameren Executive Incentive Plan
The Ameren Executive Incentive Plan ("EIP") for 2018 was designed to reward the achievement of Ameren's EPS performance, safety performance, customer-focused measures relating to reliability and affordability, and individual performance. We choose to pay it to incentivize higher annual corporate and individual performance.
How the EIP Works
For 2018, the EIP (the "2018 EIP") was comprised of the following components:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Ameren diluted earnings per share ("EPS") (80% weight); 
● safety, as measured by co-worker to co-worker interactions (10% weight); 
● customer-focused measures, including three quantitative measures relating to reliability and affordability (10% weight); and  
● an individual performance modifier.

Targets for 2018 EPS, Co-Worker to Co-Worker Safety Interactions and Customer-Focused Measures
EPS, Co-Worker to Co-Worker Safety Interactions and Customer-Focused Measures The Committee established threshold, target and maximum levels of goals for each of Ameren EPS, co-worker to co-worker ("c2c") safety interactions and three customer-focused measures (System Average Interruption Frequency Index ("SAIFI"), Equivalent Availability Base Load Coal Fleet ("EA") and the Callaway Nuclear Energy Center Performance Index ("CPI")) under the 2018 EIP. Payouts for Ameren EPS, c2c, SAIFI, EA and CPI performance falling between the established levels were interpolated on a straight-line basis. The three goal levels are described below:
Safety Measure A c2c safety interaction is a leading indicator for safety performance and reinforces safety as a core value and continued focus on shaping a culture of safety. A c2c safety interaction is a conversation between co-workers that involves giving and receiving feedback to improve safety, with the primary objective of encouraging all co-workers to recognize and eliminate at-risk behaviors or conditions and reinforce safe behaviors in the workplace, ultimately improving safety outcomes.
Customer-Focused Measures SAIFI is a standard customer reliability measure which indicates how often the average customer experiences a sustained interruption over a one-year period. The measure excludes major events (for example, major storms) and is calculated consistent with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ("IEEE") standards. A lower SAIFI result indicates better performance.
EA measures the percentage of the year Ameren Missouri's coal-fired base load generation fleet is available for operating at full capacity. The measure is calculated by subtracting forced and scheduled outages from the energy center's available hours (i.e., the period of time during which a unit is capable of service whether it is actually in service or not) and dividing this by the hours in the year. Ameren calculates EA consistent with North American Electric Reliability Corporation ("NERC") reporting standards. A higher EA result indicates better performance.
The CPI measures overall nuclear energy center performance through an industry standard index comprised of 12 safety and reliability measures. The CPI measures performance over a 12-month period. A higher CPI score indicates better performance.

Individual Performance Modifier The 2018 EIP base award for each NEO was subject to upward or downward adjustment for individual performance on key performance variables. These included leadership and the achievement of key operational goals (other than those specifically mentioned in the plan), as applicable and as determined by the Committee. The individual performance modifier for the CEO is determined by the Committee in its sole discretion without involvement of the CEO.
Historically, the Individual Performance Modifier has been used to differentiate performance that is considerably above or below that expected. Such differentiations do not lend themselves to formulas and are applied at the Committee's discretion.
The Individual Performance Modifier could reduce the base award by up to 25 percent, with the ability to pay zero for poor or non-performance. Increases could be up to 25 percent of the base award, with a potential maximum total award at 200 percent of each NEO's target opportunity.
Base Award, Earned through the Achievement of Ameren EPS, Co-Worker to Co-Worker Safety Interactions, and Customer-Focused Measures At the February 2019 Committee meeting, Mr. Baxter presented 2018 EIP achievement levels for Ameren EPS, safety performance and customer-focused measures, and recommended EIP payouts for the NEOs (other than with respect to himself) to the Committee for review:

The resulting metrics and payouts, as approved by the Committee in February 2019, are shown below.
Earned through Individual Performance Modifier As discussed above, the 2018 EIP base awards were subject to upward or downward adjustment by up to 25 percent based upon an NEO's individual contributions and performance on certain key performance variables during the year. For 2018, the Committee, after consultation with Mr. Baxter, increased the 2018 EIP base award for Mr. Lyons by approximately 3 percent, for Mr. Mark by approximately 3 percent, and for Mr. Moehn by approximately 6 percent. The Committee increased the 2018 EIP base award for Mr. Baxter by approximately 6 percent.
Resulting 2018 EIP Payouts Actual 2018 EIP payouts are shown below as a percent of target. Payouts were made in February 2019, and are set forth under column (g) entitled Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.

Long-Term Incentive Compensation
The Ameren Long-Term Incentive Program ("LTIP") is intended to reward NEOs for their contributions to Ameren's long-term success by providing the opportunity to earn shares of Ameren Common Stock. In 2018, the long-term incentive program was updated to better align it with market practice, simplify the overall structure of the plan, and create more clarity and focus for participants.
In 2017, the Committee conducted an in-depth review of the long-term incentive program over the course of several meetings. After considering overall company strategy, business needs and industry practices, changes were made (effective for 2018 grants), which included:
A PSU is the right to receive a share of Ameren Common Stock if certain long-term performance criteria are achieved and certain service requirements are met. An RSU is the right to receive a share of Ameren Common Stock assuming continued employment through the vesting period.
Role of the LTIP
The 2018 LTIP grants, which are governed by the shareholder-approved 2014 Plan, are designed to serve the following roles in the compensation program:

The threshold and maximum amounts of payout for the 2018 PSU awards are reflected in columns (f) and (h) of the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table (not including any potential dividends).

PSU Performance/Payout Relationship
Once Ameren's 2018–2020 TSR is calculated and compared to the PSU peer group, the scale below determines the percentage of the target PSU award that is paid. Payout for performance between points is interpolated on a straight-line basis.
Section 162(m) of the IRC
Prior to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "TCJA"), Section 162(m) of the IRC provided an exemption from the general limitation for "qualified performance-based compensation." For the 2016 and 2017 PSU awards, the Committee set a maximum limitation on the PSU payouts for each NEO and, in so doing, intended for such payouts to meet the definition of qualified performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the IRC as in effect prior to the enactment of the TCJA. Actual 2016 and 2017 PSU payouts will be determined by the Committee based on the comparison of Ameren's TSR against the PSU Peer Group for the applicable performance period.
2016 PSU Awards Vesting
The PSU performance period for the 2016 grants ended December 31, 2018. Our 2016–2018 TSR performance was determined to be at the 100th percentile of the 2016 PSU Peer Group. The following table shows the 2016 PSU awards, their original value at grant, the number earned (which equals the target number plus accrued dividends, times 200 percent), and their value at year-end (December 31, 2018). The resulting earned amounts were 332 percent of the original target value of the 2016 awards, which reflects both TSR performance against the PSU peer group and the actual TSR generated during the three-year period, together with dividends earned and reinvested and stock price appreciation. Vesting of the awards for each NEO is subject to continued employment as of the payment date. Each NEO's award vested and was paid as of February 28, 2019.

2017 and 2018 PSU and RSU Awards
The PSU performance periods for the 2017 and 2018 grants will not end until December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Similarly, the RSU vesting periods for the 2018 grants will not end until the payment date for these awards in 2021. The figures in column (e) of the Summary Compensation Table of this proxy statement for the years 2017 and 2018 represent the aggregate grant date fair values for the PSU and RSU grants, computed as described in footnote (3) to the Summary Compensation Table. There is no guarantee that such amounts will ultimately be earned by participants.
2018 Retention Awards
At its February 2018 meeting, the Committee approved the grant of one-time RSU awards for Messrs. Lyons, Mark and Moehn to recognize their strong leadership skills that have delivered superior value to customers and shareholders, and to maintain strong business and leadership continuity in the execution of the Company's business strategy in the future. The awards, which are reflected in column (e) of the Summary Compensation Table, were granted effective as of March 1, 2018 and had an initial value of $1,025,999, $784,526 and $820,473 respectively, and will vest on February 28, 2021. These awards do not provide for accelerated vesting in connection with the executive's retirement.
Perquisites
We provide limited perquisites to provide competitive value and promote retention of the NEOs and others.
Retirement Benefits
The objective of retirement benefits is to provide post-employment security to our employees, and such benefits are designed to reward continued service. We choose to provide these benefits as an essential part of a total compensation package to remain competitive with those packages offered by other companies, particularly utilities.
There are several retirement benefit programs applicable to the NEOs, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● The Company's 401(k) savings and cash balance retirement plans; 
● Supplemental Retirement Plans (together, the "SRP") that provide the NEOs a benefit equal to the difference between the benefit that would have been paid if IRC limitations were not in effect and the reduced benefit payable as a result of such IRC limitations; and 
● a deferred compensation plan that provides the opportunity to defer part of base salary and all or a portion of non-equity incentive compensation, as well as earnings thereon. Beginning with plan years commencing on and after January 1, 2010, this includes deferrals of cash compensation above IRC limitations, together with Company matching credits on these deferrals.

Human Resources Committee Governance Practices
The Human Resources Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to provide professional advice.

In its decision to retain Meridian as its independent compensation consultant, the Committee gave consideration to a broad range of attributes necessary to assist the needs of the Committee in setting compensation, including:
Meridian representatives attended five of the six Human Resources Committee meetings during 2018. At the Human Resources Committee's request, the consultant met regularly with the Committee members outside the presence of management, and spoke separately with the Committee Chair and other Committee members.
During 2018, the Committee requested of Meridian the following items:
Other than services provided to the Human Resources Committee as set forth above and for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee as described below, Meridian did not perform any other services for the Company or any of its subsidiaries in 2018.
Pursuant to its letter agreement with the Committee, if the Company or management of the Company proposes that Meridian perform services for the Company or management of the Company other than in Meridian's retained role as consultant to the Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, any such proposal is required to be submitted to the Committee for approval before such services begin.
In December 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also approved the continued engagement of Meridian as its independent consulting firm with respect to director compensation matters. See "— DIRECTOR COMPENSATION — Role of Director Compensation Consultant" above for a description of the services Meridian provided to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in 2018.

Executive Compensation Matters
Each of the Human Resources Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has procedures for the purpose of determining whether the work of any compensation consultant raises any conflict of interest. Pursuant to such procedures, in December 2018 each such committee considered various factors, including the six factors mandated by SEC rules, and determined that with respect to executive and director compensation-related matters, no conflict of interest was raised by the work of Meridian.
Delegation of Authority
The Human Resources Committee has delegated authority to the Company's Administrative Committee, comprised of designated members of management, to approve changes, within specified parameters, to certain of the Company's retirement plans. It has also delegated authority to management to make pro rata equity grants in the first year of LTIP eligibility to co-workers who, while not Section 16 Officers, are newly promoted into a LTIP eligible role or hired into a LTIP eligible role from an external source during the year. In addition, the Human Resources Committee has delegated to the Chief Executive Officer the authority to make discretionary grants of equity awards from a pre-authorized pool of shares of Common Stock to co-workers who are not Section 16 Officers. The Company will ensure the total value of the equity grants made by the Chief Executive Officer does not exceed a specified limit.
Human Resources Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
No current member of the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (Messrs. Johnson, Harshman, Lipstein and Wilson) was at any time during 2018 or at any other time an officer or employee of the Company, and no member had any relationship with the Company requiring disclosure under applicable SEC rules.
No executive officer of the Company has served on the board of directors or compensation committee of any other entity that has or has had one or more executive officers who served as a member of the Company's Board of Directors or the Human Resources Committee during 2018.
Timing of Compensation Decisions and Awards
The Board and the Committee establish meeting schedules annually, well in advance of each meeting, to ensure a thorough and thoughtful decision process. Incentive compensation awards are typically made at regularly scheduled meetings.
Following is a discussion of the timing of certain compensation decisions for 2018:
Decisions relating to material elements of compensation are fully deliberated by the Committee at each Committee meeting and, when appropriate, over the course of several Committee meetings. This allows for any follow-up to questions from Committee members in advance of the final decision. The Committee approves long-term incentive grants at its December meeting of the year prior to the year the grants are made. The Committee expects to continue to establish base salaries at its December meeting each year with such base salaries to be effective in the following January.

Executive Compensation Matters
Consideration of Company's 2018 "Say-on-Pay" Vote
The Committee considers the results of the shareholder advisory "say-on-pay" vote along with other factors in connection with discharging its responsibilities relating to the Company's executive compensation program, although no factor is assigned a quantitative weighting. As a result of the 2018 advisory "say-on-pay" vote, which saw a substantial majority (of approximately 93 percent) of the Company's shareholders who were entitled to vote and represented approve the compensation program described in the proxy statement in connection with our annual meeting held on May 3, 2018, the Committee continued to apply the same principles in determining the amounts and types of executive compensation for fiscal year 2019.
Through its shareholder outreach program, the Company has welcomed feedback from its shareholders with respect to its executive compensation program.
Other Considerations for Changes in Compensation Opportunities
Market Data, retention needs and general economic conditions have been the primary factors considered in decisions to increase or decrease compensation opportunities. Corporate and individual performance are the primary factors in determining the ultimate value of those compensation opportunities.
Role of Executive Officers
For 2018, the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Baxter, with the assistance of the Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Chief Human Resources Officer of Ameren Services, Mark C. Lindgren, recommended to the Committee compensation amounts for the other NEOs. The Chief Executive Officer makes recommendations to the Committee with respect to the compensation of the NEOs (other than himself) and other senior executives. The Chief Executive Officer possesses insight regarding individual performance levels, degree of experience and future promotion potential. In all cases, the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations are presented to the Committee for review based on the Market Data provided by the Committee's independent consultant. The Committee independently determines each NEO's compensation, as discussed in this CD&A.
Neither the Chief Executive Officer nor any other NEO makes recommendations for setting his own compensation. The Chief Executive Officer's compensation is determined in Committee meetings during an executive session with only the Committee members and the Committee's independent consultant present.
The Chief Executive Officer, the other NEOs and our other senior executives play a role in the early stages of design and evaluation of our compensation programs and policies. Because of their extensive familiarity with our business and corporate culture, these executives are in the best position to suggest programs and policies to the Committee and the independent consultant that will engage employees and provide effective incentives to produce outstanding financial and operating results for the Company and our shareholders.
Other Compensation Matters
We do not have any written or unwritten employment agreements with any of our NEOs. Each NEO is an employee at the will of the Company and/or its subsidiaries, as specified below.
Severance
All officers of the Company participate in the Ameren Corporation Severance Plan for Ameren Officers (the "Officer Severance Plan"). The primary purpose of the Officer Severance Plan is to facilitate mid-career hires and act as a retention tool during times of uncertainty. The Officer Severance Plan provides market-level pay and benefits to officers and NEOs in the event of an involuntary termination of employment without "Cause", as defined in the Officer Severance Plan. The Officer Severance Plan provides for a lump sum payment that is generally equal to annual base salary plus target annual cash incentive award in effect at termination of employment, a pro-rated annual incentive payment based on actual plan performance, continuation of medical coverage for 12 months subsidized by the Company, and outplacement career transition services. Upon a change of control, officers who are eligible for
2019 Proxy Statement     59
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation Matters severance pay and benefits under the Company's Second Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan, as amended, would be entitled to the greater of the benefits available under that plan or the Officer Severance Plan, but would not receive benefits under both plans. The Human Resources Committee may amend, suspend or terminate the Officer Severance Plan at any time, provided that twelve months' notice is required if the amount of potential severance pay and benefits is to be reduced.
Change of Control
Ameren's Second Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan, as amended, is designed to reward NEOs for remaining employed with us when their prospects for continued employment following a transaction may be uncertain. The objectives of this plan are to maintain a stable executive team during the process and to assist us in attracting highly qualified executives into the Company.
Change of Control protections provide severance pay and, in some situations, vesting or payment of long-term incentive awards, upon a Change of Control of the Company. The arrangements provide market-level payments in the event of an involuntary termination not for "Cause" or a voluntary termination for "Good Reason." Definitions of "Change of Control," "Cause" and "Good Reason," as well as more complete descriptions of Change of Control protections, are found below under the caption "— Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control."
The applicable triggers are structured so that payment and vesting occur only upon the occurrence of both a change of control and a qualifying termination of employment.
We expect it would take more time for senior leaders to find new employment than for other employees and, therefore, senior management, including the NEOs, generally are paid severance upon a termination for a longer period following a Change of Control. The Committee considered this as well as the factors described in the preceding paragraphs in structuring the cash payments described under "— Compensation Tables and Narrative Disclosures — Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control — Change of Control" below, which an NEO would receive if terminated within two years following a Change of Control.
Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging Policy
We maintain policies that prohibit executive officers and directors from engaging in pledges of Company securities or short sales, margin accounts and hedging or derivative transactions with respect to Company securities. In addition, our policies prohibit directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries from entering into any transaction which hedges (or offsets) any decrease in the value of Company equity securities as discussed under "SECURITY OWNERSHIP — SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND MANAGEMENT" below.
Clawback
Awards granted under the 2006 Plan or the 2014 Plan, including EIP and PSU awards, are subject to a "clawback" in certain circumstances. If the Company is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to the material noncompliance of the Company, as a result of misconduct, with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws, and if an award holder knowingly or with gross negligence engaged in or failed to prevent the misconduct, or if the award holder is one of the individuals subject to automatic forfeiture under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the award holder will be required to reimburse the Company the amount of any payment in settlement of an award earned or accrued during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing of the financial document embodying the financial reporting requirement.
In addition, under the terms of the EIP, PSU and RSU awards, if the award holder engages in conduct or activity that is detrimental to the Company or violates the confidentiality or customer or employee non-solicitation provisions included in the award, generally, the award holder will be required to repay the award to the Company after receiving a demand from the Company for the repayment.

Retirement benefits for the NEOs fall under the Benefits for Salaried Employees (the "Cash Balance Account"). Most salaried employees of Ameren and its subsidiaries, including the NEOs, earn benefits in the Cash Balance Account under the Ameren Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan") immediately upon employment. Benefits become vested after three years of service.
On an annual basis, a bookkeeping account in a participant's name is credited with an amount equal to a percentage of the participant's pensionable earnings for the year. Pensionable earnings include base salary and annual EIP compensation, which are equivalent to amounts shown in columns (c) and (g) in the Summary Compensation Table. The applicable percentage is based on the participant's age as of December 31 of that year.

Executive Compensation Matters 
These accounts also receive interest credits based on the average yield for one-year U.S. Treasury constant maturity for the previous October, plus one percent. The minimum interest credit is five percent.
Effective January 1, 2001, an enhancement account was added that provides a $500 additional credit at the end of each year.
The normal retirement age under the Cash Balance Account structure and the SRP is 65. Neither the Cash Balance Account structure nor the SRP contains provisions for crediting extra years of service or for early retirement. When a participant terminates employment (including as a result of retirement), the amount credited to the participant's account is converted to an annuity or paid to the participant in a lump sum. The participant can also choose to defer distribution, in which case the account balance is credited with interest at the applicable rate until the future date of distribution.
Ameren Supplemental Retirement Plan
In certain cases, pension benefits under the Retirement Plan are reduced to comply with maximum limitations imposed by the IRC. The SRP is maintained by Ameren to provide for a supplemental benefit equal to the difference between the benefit that would have been paid if such IRC limitations were not in effect and the reduced benefit payable as a result of such IRC limitations. Any NEO whose pension benefits under the Retirement Plan would exceed IRC limitations is eligible to participate in the SRP. The SRP is unfunded and is not a qualified plan under the IRC.
There is no offset under either the Retirement Plan or the SRP for Social Security benefits or other offset amounts.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
The following table discloses contributions, earnings and balances under the nonqualified deferred compensation plan for each NEO.
NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION TABLE

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan Participation
Pursuant to an optional deferred compensation plan available to members of the Company's management, NEOs may annually choose to defer up to 50 percent (in one percent increments) of their salary and up to 100 percent (in one percent increments or amounts in excess of a threshold) of cash incentive awards. There are no minimum dollar thresholds for deferrals. At the request of a participant, the Company may, in its discretion, waive the 50 percent limitation.
The Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan, as amended and restated, effective January 1, 2010 (the "Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan"), changed the interest crediting rates for deferrals made with respect to plan years commencing on and after January 1, 2010 and added a 401(k) restoration benefit for eligible officers of Ameren whose total salary and short-term incentive award exceeds the limit on compensation in effect under the IRC. In October 2010, the Company adopted an amendment to the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan for plan years beginning on and after January 1, 2011 to, among other things, change the measurement period for the applicable interest rates to amounts deferred under such plan prior to January 1, 2010 and clarify that matching contributions made under the plan are based upon all of a participant's deferrals under the plan during a plan year. Pursuant to the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan, amounts deferred (and interest attributable thereto), other than the 401(k) Restoration Benefit (as defined below), accrue interest at the rate to be applied to the participant's account balance depending on (1) the plan year for which the rate is being calculated and (2) the year in which the deferral was made, as follows:
Under the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan, upon a participant's termination of employment with the Company and/or its subsidiaries prior to age 55 and after the occurrence of a "Change of Control" (as defined under "— Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control — Change of Control" below) the balance in such participant's deferral account, with interest as described in the table above, shall be distributed in a lump sum within 30 days after the date the participant terminates employment.
The 401(k) Restoration Benefit allows eligible officers of Ameren, including the NEOs, to also defer a percentage of salary and/or EIP awards in excess of the limit on compensation then in effect under the IRC (currently $275,000), in one percent increments, up to a maximum of six percent of total salary and EIP awards (a "401(k) Restoration Deferral," together with Ameren's 401(k) matching credit described below, the "401(k) Restoration Benefit"). Under the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan, Ameren credits each participating officer's deferral account with a matching credit equal to 100 percent of the first three percent of salary and EIP awards
68     Ameren Corporation
Table of Contents
Executive Compensation Matters and 50 percent of the remaining salary and EIP awards deferred by the participant, including a 401(k) Restoration Deferral. In general, eligible participants, including the NEOs, may direct the deemed investment of the 401(k) Restoration Benefit in accordance with the investment options that are generally available under Ameren's 401(k) savings investment plan, except for the Ameren stock fund.
As a result of the changes described in this section, no preferential or above-market earnings are paid pursuant to the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan with respect to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2010 for deferrals made on and after January 1, 2010. The investment returns for the funds available to NEOs under the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan in 2018 were as follows:
After the participant retires, the deferred amounts (and interest attributable thereto), other than the 401(k) Restoration Benefit, accrue interest as follows:
The plan compounds interest annually and the rate is calculated as of the first day of the plan year.
Distributions from the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan will be paid in cash. A participant may choose to receive the deferred amounts at retirement in a single lump sum payment or in substantially equal installments over a period of 5, 10 or 15 years. In the event a participant terminates employment with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to age 55, the balance in such participant's deferral account is distributable in a lump sum to the participant within 30 days of the date the participant terminates employment.

Participants are 100 percent vested at all times in the value of their contributions, investment earnings and any Company 401(k) matching credits. A participant's benefit will be comprised of separate bookkeeping accounts evidencing his or her interest in each of the investment funds in which contributions and applicable matching contributions have been deemed invested. While no actual contributions are made to the funds, earnings or losses are calculated using the valuation methodology employed by the record keeper for each of the corresponding funds. Participants may generally transfer investments among various investment alternatives on a daily basis, subject to the provisions of the Ameren Deferred Compensation Plan.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control
This section describes and estimates payments that could be made to the NEOs serving as of December 31, 2018, under different termination and change-in-control events. The estimated payments would be made under the terms of Ameren's compensation and benefits plans, as well as the Severance Plan for Ameren Officers ("Officer Severance Plan") or the Second Amended and Restated Change of Control Severance Plan ("Change of Control Plan").
The tables below reflect the payments and benefits payable to each of the NEOs in the event of a termination of the NEO's employment under several different circumstances. The amounts shown assume that termination was effective as of December 31, 2018, at the NEO's compensation and service levels as of that date, and are estimates of the amounts that would be payable to the NEO in each scenario. In addition, the amounts shown do not include benefits paid by insurance providers under life and disability policies or payments and benefits provided on a non-discriminatory basis to employees upon a termination of employment. The actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the NEO's actual separation from the Company. Factors that could affect the nature and amount of the payments on termination of employment include, among others, the timing of the event, compensation level, the market price of Common Stock and the NEO's age.

Termination Other Than for Change of Control The following table summarizes the impact of certain employment events outside the context of a Change of Control that may result in the payment of unvested LTIP awards.
CEO Pay Ratio
We are providing the following information to comply with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K:
For 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $119,718. We calculated the median employee's annual total compensation based on the rules for determining annual total compensation of our named executive officers, which includes base salary, incentive compensation, change in pension value, and other elements of pay, such as 401(k) employer match, stock awards, or overtime, as applicable. The annual total compensation of our CEO was $8,454,460 and the ratio of our CEO's compensation to the median employee was 71 to 1. The pay ratio disclosed is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.
The employment of the median employee reported in the 2018 proxy statement terminated in 2018. Accordingly, for 2018, we identified an alternative median employee as of October 1, 2018, in accordance with the same methodology used to determine the median employee in 2017, using for such purposes our entire workforce of approximately 8,600 full, part-time and temporary employees and base salary for the period of January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, rounded to the nearest $100. We determined that there were no changes to our employee base or compensation arrangements that would significantly change our pay ratio disclosure.
SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio allow companies to apply various methodologies and various assumptions and, as a result, the pay ratio reported by the Company may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported by other companies.

Audit Matters 
PwC has served continuously as the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company and its subsidiaries since at least 1932. In evaluating PwC's tenure, the Audit and Risk Committee believes there are important benefits to having a long-tenured independent accounting firm, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Enhanced audit quality due to PwC's deep understanding of Ameren's business, industry and accounting policies and practices;  
● Efficient fee structures due to PwC's familiarity with the Company and industry expertise; and  
● Avoidance of significant costs and disruptions (including Board and management time and distractions) that would be associated with evaluating and retaining a new independent auditor. 
[END TABLE]
In addition, PwC is subject to robust independence controls that further mitigate the risks that may be associated with long auditor tenure. These include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A strong regulatory framework for auditor independence, including limitations on non-audit services; 
● Oversight of PwC by the Audit and Risk Committee that includes regular communication on and evaluation of the quality of the audit and auditor independence;  
● PwC's internal independence controls and compliance program;  
● Conducting regular private meetings with each of PwC and Ameren management at the end of each regularly scheduled Audit and Risk Committee meeting; and  
● Mandatory audit partner rotation every five years, a process which is directed and ultimately approved by the Audit and Risk Committee. 
[END TABLE]
Representatives of PwC are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Policy Regarding the Pre-Approval of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Provision of Audit, Audit-Related and Non-Audit Services
The Audit and Risk Committee's charter provides that the Committee is required to pre-approve all audit, audit-related, tax and other services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm to Ameren and its subsidiaries, except that pre-approvals of non-audit services may be delegated to a single member of the Audit and Risk Committee. The Audit and Risk Committee pre-approved 100 percent of the fees for services provided by PwC covered under the above captions: "— Audit Fees," "— Audit-Related Fees," "— Tax Fees" and "— All Other Fees" for fiscal years 2018 and 2017.
The information contained in the following Audit and Risk Committee Report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or "filed" or "incorporated by reference" in future filings with the SEC, or subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, except to the extent that the Company specifically incorporates it by reference into a document filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act.
Audit and Risk Committee Report
The Audit and Risk Committee reviews Ameren Corporation's ("Ameren") financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. In fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit and Risk Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements included in the 2018 Form 10-K with Ameren's management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, as well as maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and assessing such effectiveness. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, as well as expressing an opinion on whether Ameren maintained effective internal control over financial reporting.
In addition, in connection with its review of the Ameren's annual audited financial statements, the Audit and Risk Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be communicated pursuant to PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 16 (Communications with Audit Committees), has received and reviewed the written communications from the independent registered public accounting firm required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding PwC's communications with the Audit and Risk Committee concerning independence, and has discussed with such accounting firm its independence. The Audit and Risk Committee also has considered whether the provision by the independent registered public accounting firm of non-audit services to Ameren is compatible with maintaining their independence.
To ensure the independence of the independent registered public accounting firm, Ameren has instituted monitoring processes at both the management level and the Audit and Risk Committee level. At the management level, the chief financial officer or the chief accounting officer is required to review and pre-approve all engagements of the independent registered public accounting firm for any category of services, subject to the pre-approval of the Audit and Risk Committee described above. In addition, the chief financial officer or the chief accounting officer is required to provide to the Audit and Risk Committee at each of its meetings (except meetings held exclusively to review earnings press releases and quarterly reports on SEC Form 10-Q) a written description of all services to be performed by the independent registered public accounting firm and the corresponding estimated fees. The monitoring process at the Audit and Risk Committee level includes a requirement that the Committee pre-approve the performance of any services by the independent registered public accounting firm, except that pre-approvals of non-audit services may be delegated to a single member of the Committee. At each Audit and Risk Committee meeting (except meetings held exclusively to review earnings press releases
78     Ameren Corporation
Table of Contents
Audit Matters and quarterly reports on SEC Form 10-Q), the Committee receives a joint report from the independent registered public accounting firm and the chief financial officer or the chief accounting officer concerning audit fees and fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm for all other services rendered, with a description of the services performed. The Audit and Risk Committee has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of the services covered under the captions "AUDIT MATTERS — FEES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2018 AND 2017 — Audit-Related Fees," "— Tax Fees" and "— All Other Fees" in this proxy statement is compatible with maintaining the independent registered public accounting firm's independence and has concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm's independence has not been impaired by its engagement to perform these services.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Risk Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in Ameren's 2018 Form 10-K, for filing with the SEC.

In addition, since 2013, the Company has had a policy which prohibits directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries from entering into any transaction which hedges (or offsets) any decrease in the value of Company equity securities that are (1) granted by the Company to the director or employee as part of compensation or (2) held, directly or indirectly, by the director or employee.

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of the Company's Common Stock to file reports of their ownership in the equity securities of the Company and its subsidiaries and of changes in that ownership with the SEC. SEC regulations also require the Company to identify in this proxy statement any person subject to this requirement who failed to file any such report on a timely basis. To our knowledge, based solely on a review of the filed reports and written representations that no other reports are required, we believe that each of the Company's directors and executive officers complied with all such filing requirements during 2018.

Q.        Who is soliciting my vote? 
A.   The solicitation of proxies is made by our Board of Directors for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders of the Company. We are a holding company, and our principal direct and indirect subsidiaries include Union Electric Company, doing business as Ameren Missouri; Ameren Illinois Company, doing business as Ameren Illinois; and Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois. 
Q.   Does the Board consider director nominees recommended by shareholders? 
A.   The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider director nominations from shareholders in accordance with the Company's Director Nomination Policy, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website. 
Q.   Do I need a ticket to attend the Annual Meeting? 
A.   An admission ticket is required to enter the Company's Annual Meeting. Please follow the advance registration instructions on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card. Please plan to arrive promptly to have sufficient time to proceed through a customary security line, which may include a bag search. 
Q.   Is my vote confidential? 
A.   The Board of Directors has adopted a confidential shareholder voting policy for proxies, ballots and voting instructions submitted by shareholders. This policy does not prohibit disclosure when it is required by applicable law. In addition, nothing in the confidential shareholder voting policy prohibits shareholders or participants in the Company's savings investment plans from voluntarily disclosing their votes or voting instructions, as applicable, to the Company's directors or executive officers, nor does the policy prevent the Company or any agent of the Company from ascertaining which shareholders have voted or from making efforts to encourage shareholders to vote. The policy does not limit the free and voluntary communication between the Company and its shareholders. Except with respect to materials submitted regarding shares allocated to participant accounts in the Company's savings investment plans, all comments written on proxies, ballots or voting materials, together with the names and addresses of the commenting shareholders, may be made available to Company directors and executive officers. 
Q.   Can I listen to the Annual Meeting online? 
A.   The Annual Meeting will be webcast live on May 2, 2019. You are invited to visit www.amereninvestors.com at 10:00 a.m. CDT on May 2, 2019, to hear the webcast of the Annual Meeting. On the home page, you will click on "Live Webcast - 2019 Annual Meeting", then the appropriate audio link. You cannot record your vote on this webcast. 
Q.   How do I review the list of shareholders? 
A.   The names of shareholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be available at the Annual Meeting and, for ten days prior to the Annual Meeting, at the Office of the Secretary of the Company. 
Q.   What is the Company's mailing policy when multiple registered shareholders share an address? 
A.   The Company is permitted and intends to mail only one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and/or one annual report and one proxy statement to multiple registered shareholders sharing an address who have consented to the delivery of one set of proxy materials per address or have received prior notice of our intent to do so, so long as the Company has not received contrary instructions from one or more of such shareholders. This practice is commonly referred to as "householding." Householding reduces the volume of duplicate information received at your household and the cost to the Company of preparing and mailing duplicate materials.

  If you share an address with other registered shareholders and your household receives one set of the proxy materials and you decide you want a separate copy of the proxy materials, the Company will promptly mail your separate copy if you contact the Office of the Secretary, Ameren Corporation, P.O. Box 66149, St. Louis, Missouri 63166-6149 or by calling toll-free 1-800-255-2237 (or in the St. Louis area 314-554-3502).

Other Matters
The Board of Directors is not presently aware of any matters to be conducted at the meeting other than those discussed in this proxy statement, including the Floor Proposal discussed in the "Notice of Annual Meeting of Shareholders of Ameren Corporation" on page 4. If any other matter properly comes before the shareholders for a vote at the meeting, the proxy holders will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment.
Shareholder Proposals
Under the rules of the SEC, any shareholder proposal intended for inclusion in the proxy material for the Company's 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by the Secretary of the Company on or before November 20, 2019. We expect that the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders will be held on May 7, 2020.
In addition, under the Company's By-Laws, shareholders who intend to submit a proposal that will not be in the proxy statement but is to be considered at the 2020 annual meeting, or who intend to nominate a director at the 2020 annual meeting, must provide advance written notice along with other prescribed information. In general, such notice must be received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than 60 days or earlier than 90 days prior to the anniversary of the previous year's annual meeting (i.e., not later than March 9, 2020, or earlier than February 7, 2020). Subject to certain conditions, shareholders or a group of shareholders who have owned more than 5% of the Company's Common Stock for at least one year may also recommend director nominees for nomination by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee provided that written notice from the shareholder(s) must be received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than 120 days prior to the anniversary of the date the Company's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting (i.e., not later than November 20, 2019). As described under the section entitled "Board Practices, Policies and Processes" of this proxy statement, the Company has adopted a "proxy access" by-law. Under the Company's By-Laws, shareholders who meet the requirements set forth in the Company's By-Laws may nominate a person for election as a director and include such nominee in the Company's proxy materials. The By-Laws require, among other things, that written notice from the shareholder(s) must be received by the Secretary of the Company at the principal executive offices of the Company not later than 120 days or earlier than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the date the Company's proxy statement was released to shareholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting (i.e., not later than November 20, 2019, or earlier than October 21, 2019). The specific procedures to be used by shareholders to recommend nominees for director are set forth in the Company's By-Laws and Director Nomination Policy. The specific procedures to be used by shareholders to submit a proposal in person at an annual meeting are set forth in the Company's By-Laws. The chairman of the meeting may refuse to allow the transaction of any business, or to acknowledge the nomination of any person, not made in compliance with the procedures set forth in the Company's By-Laws and, in the case of nominations, the Director Nomination Policy. Copies of the Company's By-Laws and Director Nomination Policy may be obtained upon written request to the Secretary of the Company.

Forward-Looking Information
Statements in this proxy statement not based on historical facts are considered "forward-looking" and, accordingly, involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed.

Appendix A
The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP to core earnings in millions of dollars and on a per share basis:
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this proxy statement, Ameren has presented core earnings per share, which is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies. Generally, core earnings or losses include earnings or losses attributable to Ameren common shareholders and exclude income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings, such as the third quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a July 2017 change in Illinois law that increased the state's corporate income tax rate, the fourth quarter 2017 non-cash charge for the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from a December 2017 change in federal law that decreased the federal corporate income tax rate, and the third quarter 2018 non-cash charge for a true-up to the revaluation of deferred taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulting primarily from regulations related to bonus depreciation issued in August 2018. Ameren uses core earnings internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance. Ameren also uses core earnings as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results and outlook, as the Company believes that core earnings allow it to more accurately compare its ongoing performance across periods. In providing core earnings guidance, there could be differences between core earnings and earnings prepared in accordance with GAAP as a result of our treatment of certain items, such as that described above. Ameren is unable to estimate the impact, if any, on future GAAP earnings of such future items.
