BLACKROCK CAPITAL INVESTMENT CORPORATION
PROXY STATEMENTFOR SPECIAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS TO BE HELD ON MAY 3, 2019 
This document will give you the information you need to vote on the matter listed on the accompanying Notice of Special Meeting of Stockholders (the "Notice of Special Meeting"). Much of the information in this proxy statement (this "Proxy Statement") is required under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"); some of it is technical. If there is anything you do not understand, please contact us at 212-810-5800. 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board," each member of which is referred to as a "Director") of BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation (the "Company," "we," "our" or "us"), of proxies to be voted at the Special Meeting (the "Special Meeting") of owners of shares of common stock (the "Stockholders") of the Company and, if the 2019 Special Meeting is adjourned, postponed or delayed, at any later meetings, for the purposes stated in the Notice of Special Meeting. The Special Meeting will be held on the 4th floor of 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York, on May 3, 2019 at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time). This Proxy Statement, the Notice of Special Meeting and the enclosed proxy card are first being sent to Stockholders on or about March 20, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHY IS A STOCKHOLDER MEETING BEING HELD?  
[END TABLE]
To address a proposal (the "Proposal") that requires Stockholder approval. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHAT PROPOSAL WILL BE VOTED ON?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders are being asked to authorize flexibility for the Company, with approval of the Board of the Company, to sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock (during the next 12 months) at a price below the Company's then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings, subject to certain limitations set forth herein (including that the cumulative number of shares sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25% of the Company's then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale). However, pursuant to this authority, there is no limit on the discount below NAV at which the Company may sell its common stock during the period this authorization is in effect. No further authorization from stockholders will be solicited even if the dilution resulting from any such offering or offerings is significant.
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WILL MY VOTE MAKE A DIFFERENCE?  
[END TABLE]
YES! Your vote is important to the governance of the Company, no matter how many shares you own. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHO IS ASKING FOR YOUR VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
The enclosed proxy is solicited by the Board for use at the Special Meeting to be held on May 3, 2019, and, if the Special Meeting is adjourned, postponed or delayed, at any later meetings, for the purposes stated in the Notice of Special Meeting (see previous page).  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  HOW DOES THE COMPANY'S BOARD RECOMMEND THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE ON THE PROPOSAL? 
[END TABLE]
The Board recommends that you vote "FOR" the Proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHO IS ELIGIBLE TO VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of record at the close of business on March 5, 2019 are entitled to be present and to vote at the Special Meeting or any adjournments, postponements or delays thereof. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote. Shares represented by duly executed proxies will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you sign the proxy, but do not fill in a vote, your shares will be voted in accordance with the Board's recommendation. If any other business is brought before the Special Meeting, your shares will be voted by the proxyholders at their discretion according to the Board's recommendation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STOCKHOLDER OF RECORD AND A BENEFICIAL OWNER OF SHARES?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of record own shares that are registered directly in their name with the Company's transfer agent, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing (US) Inc. The Notice of Special Meeting, Proxy Statement and proxy card are being sent directly to Stockholders of record by the Company. Stockholders of record have the right to vote in person at the Special Meeting or to grant a voting proxy directly to anyone to vote in their place. 
Beneficial owners of shares own shares that are held in a stock brokerage account or by a bank or other nominee. The Notice of Special Meeting, Proxy Statement and proxy card are being forwarded to beneficial owners by their respective broker, bank or other nominee who is considered, with respect to those shares, the Stockholder of record. A beneficial owner has the right to direct its broker, bank or other nominee on how to vote and is also invited to attend the Special Meeting. A beneficial owner may vote shares by voting in accordance with the Notice of Special Meeting, by returning a proxy card to the Company or by making an arrangement with its broker, bank or other nominee concerning how such broker, bank or other nominee should vote its shares. A beneficial owner may also vote its shares in person at the Special Meeting, if the beneficial owner brings a brokerage statement reflecting its stock ownership as of March 5, 2019, the record date. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  HOW DO I VOTE BY PROXY?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders of record may authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf by mail, as described on the enclosed proxy card. Authorizing a proxy will not limit a Stockholder's right to vote in person at the Special Meeting. A properly completed and submitted proxy timely received by the Company before the Special Meeting will be voted in accordance with the Stockholder's instructions, unless those instructions are subsequently revoked. If the Stockholder authorizes a proxy without indicating voting instructions, the proxyholders will vote the Stockholder's shares at their discretion according to the Board's recommendations. Stockholders of record may also vote either via the Internet or by telephone. The enclosed proxy card includes specific instructions to be followed by Stockholders of record interested in voting via the Internet or by telephone. The Internet and telephone voting procedures are designed to authenticate a Stockholder's identity and to allow Stockholders to vote their shares and to confirm that their instructions have been properly recorded. Stockholders that vote via the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which will be borne by the Stockholder.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  HOW DO I VOTE IF MY SHARES ARE HELD THROUGH A BROKER?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders who hold shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee must follow the voting instructions provided by the broker, bank or nominee, whichever is the record holder. If a Stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee and the Stockholder wishes to vote in person at the Special Meeting, the Stockholder must obtain a legal proxy from the record holder of the Stockholder's shares and present the proxy at the Special Meeting. If the Stockholder does not vote in person at the Special Meeting or does not submit voting instructions to its broker, bank or nominee, the broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to vote the Stockholder's shares on non-routine proposals. The Proposal is considered a non-routine proposal. For non-routine proposals, a broker, bank or other nominee that holds shares in street name on behalf of a Stockholder must receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares in order for the shares to be voted at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes represent those shares held in street name for which the beneficial Stockholder has not provided voting instructions. If there are broker non-votes at the Special Meeting, they will be treated as present at the Special Meeting for quorum purposes but will not be voted at the Special Meeting. Broker non-votes, if any, would have the effect of a vote "Against" the Proposal. If the beneficial owner does not provide voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee cannot vote its shares for the Proposal. However, if the beneficial owner authorizes a proxy or properly executes any materials prepared by the broker, bank or other nominee without indicating voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee will have the discretion to vote its shares according to the Board's recommendations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not expect many, if any, broker non-votes at the Special Meeting because there are no routine proposals to be voted on at the Special Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  CAN I REVOKE MY PROXY OR CHANGE MY VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
The Stockholder of record can revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised at the Special Meeting by (1) delivering a written revocation notice prior to the Special Meeting to BlackRock Capital Investment Corporation, Attention: Corporate Secretary, 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022; (2) submitting a later-dated proxy card, a later-dated electronic vote via the website stated on the proxy card, or a later-dated vote using the toll-free telephone number stated on the proxy card; or (3) voting in person at the Special Meeting. If the Stockholder holds shares of common stock through a broker, bank or other nominee, the Stockholder must follow the instructions received from the broker, bank or other nominee in order to revoke the voting instructions. Attending the Special Meeting does not revoke a proxy unless the Stockholder also votes in person at the Special Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHO IS PAYING FOR THE SOLICITATION OF PROXIES?  
[END TABLE]
The Company will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Special Meeting, including the cost of preparing, assembling, printing, mailing and posting to the Internet the Notice of Special Meeting, this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to Stockholders. The Company intends to use the services of Georgeson Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies. The Company expects to pay market rates for such services, with an estimated fee of $6,500 plus expenses. 
Proxies may also be solicited in person and/or by telephone, mail, facsimile transmission or email by the Directors or our officers and/or certain employees of BlackRock Capital Investment Advisors, LLC, the Company's investment advisor (the "Advisor"), or its affiliates. No additional compensation will be paid to the Directors, officers or regular employees for such services.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHAT VOTE IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE PROPOSAL?  
[END TABLE]
Approval of the Proposal may be obtained in either of two ways. First, the Proposal will be approved if we obtain the affirmative vote of (1) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting; and (2) a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting that are not held by affiliated persons of the Company, which includes the Directors, officers, employees and 5% Stockholders. For purposes of the Proposal, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") defines "a majority of the outstanding shares" as: (1) 67% or more of the voting securities present at the Special Meeting if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company are present or represented by proxy; or (2) 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, whichever is the less. Second, the Proposal also will be approved if we receive approval from a majority of the number of beneficial holders of our common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting, without regard to whether a majority of such shares are voted in favor of the Proposal. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have the same effect as votes against the Proposal. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  HOW ARE VOTES COUNTED?  
[END TABLE]
Stockholders may vote "For," "Against," or "Abstain." A vote for "Abstain" with respect to the Proposal will not be voted in favor of or against the Proposal, but will be treated as present and will have the effect of a vote "Against" the Proposal. If a Stockholder holds shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, the Stockholder's broker, bank or other nominee will not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to the Proposal. Therefore, if a Stockholder holds shares through a broker, bank or other nominee and the Stockholder does not return voting instruction materials sent to them by their broker, bank or nominee, their shares will not be treated as present for purposes of establishing quorum. However, if a Stockholder authorizes a proxy or properly executes any materials prepared by the broker, bank or other nominee without indicating voting instructions, the broker, bank or other nominee will vote the Stockholder's shares according to the Board's recommendations. 
Similarly, if a Stockholder holds shares in its own name (i.e., not through a bank, broker or nominee) and signs and returns a proxy card with no further instructions, the Stockholder's shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendations of the Board with respect to the Proposal. The proxyholders will vote in accordance with their discretion with regard to any other matter that properly comes before the Special Meeting. 
The Special Meeting may be adjourned from time to time pursuant to our bylaws. If there appears not to be enough votes to approve the Proposal at the Special Meeting, the Chairman of the Special Meeting or a majority of the Stockholders who are represented in person or by proxy and entitled to vote at the Special Meeting may vote to adjourn the Special Meeting, in the manner provided in our bylaws,  to permit the further solicitation of proxies. The persons named as proxies will vote proxies held by them for such adjournment, unless marked to be voted against the proposal for which an adjournment is sought, to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  HOW MANY SHARES OF THE COMPANY WERE OUTSTANDING AS OF THE RECORD DATE?  
[END TABLE]
The Company had 68,836,255 shares of common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date. Each share of common stock is entitled to one vote.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
    *  WHAT IS A QUORUM FOR PURPOSES OF THE PROPOSAL BEING VOTED ON AT THE SPECIAL MEETING?  
[END TABLE]
The holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting and present in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum for the Proposal; provided, however, that if there is no contest for the election of Directors, and a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock entitled to vote at the Special Meeting are not present in person or by proxy, the holders of one-third of such shares shall constitute a quorum to the extent permitted by applicable law. In the event there are not sufficient votes for a quorum or to approve the Proposal at the time of the Special Meeting, the Special Meeting may be adjourned, postponed or delayed in order to permit further solicitation of proxies by the Company. 
THE PROPOSAL 
TO AUTHORIZE FLEXIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY, WITH APPROVAL OF THE BOARD OF THE COMPANY, TO SELL OR OTHERWISE ISSUE SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK (DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS) AT A PRICE BELOW THE COMPANY'S THEN CURRENT NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE IN ONE OR MORE OFFERINGS, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN (INCLUDING THAT THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF SHARES SOLD PURSUANT TO SUCH AUTHORITY DOES NOT EXCEED 25% OF THE COMPANY'S THEN OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO EACH SUCH SALE). 
The Company is a closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company (a "BDC") under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act generally prohibits the Company from selling shares of its common stock at a price below the current net asset value per share of such stock or "NAV," unless its Stockholders authorize such a sale and the Board makes certain determinations. 
The Company seeks the approval of its Stockholders so that it may, in one or more public or private offerings, sell or otherwise issue shares of its common stock at a price below its then current NAV, subject to certain additional conditions discussed below. If approved, the authorization by Stockholders would include a limitation as to the number of shares of common stock the Company may issue below NAV. If approved, the authorization would be effective for a twelve month period expiring on the anniversary of the date of Stockholder approval. Upon obtaining the requisite Stockholder approval, the Company will comply with the conditions described below in connection with any financing undertaking pursuant to this proposal. See below for a discussion of the risks of dilution. 
Reasons to Offer Common Stock at a Price Below NAV. Over the past several years, capital markets have experienced periods of disruption evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets, write-offs in the financial services sector, the re-pricing of credit risk, the failure of certain major financial institutions and general concerns about the state of the U.S. economy. Many investors sold assets because they had to repay debt and/or meet equity redemption requirements, which created an environment of forced selling. These sales created a negative pressure on valuations that led to unprecedented declines in prices in the corporate debt markets. The effect of all of these factors was an increase in realized and unrealized losses on debt and equity investments of many finance companies. While market conditions have improved, there can be no assurance that adverse market conditions will not repeat themselves or worsen in the future. Further, there is some uncertainty about the new presidential administration's effect on the regulation of U.S. financial markets. If adverse conditions return, the Company and other companies in the financial services sector may not have access to sufficient debt and equity capital to take  advantage of favorable investment opportunities. Capital may not be available to the Company on favorable terms, or at all, in light of the inherent uncertainty and volatility of the financial markets. 
The current economic environment gives companies that have access to capital a significant advantage. The Company believes that current market conditions have created opportunities to invest in assets at prices that are at discounts to their economic or intrinsic fair value. For firms that continue to have access to capital, the current environment may provide investment opportunities on more favorable terms than have been available in recent periods, including more reasonable pricing of risk and more advantageous contractual provisions. To capitalize on these investment opportunities as they arise, the Company needs to be able to maintain consistent access to capital. 
Stockholder approval of the Proposal will provide the Company with flexibility. In addition to using a portion of net proceeds from an offering of the Company's shares at a price below NAV to make investments in accordance with the Company's investment objective, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds from any such offering to repay outstanding borrowings. 
Many BDCs have sought and received authorization from their stockholders to sell shares of common stock at prices below NAV for many of the same reasons discussed above. Several of those BDCs have over time completed offerings of common stock at prices per share below their respective NAV. If the Company issues additional shares, the Company's market capitalization and the amount of publicly tradable common stock will increase, which may afford all holders of our common stock greater liquidity. A larger market capitalization may make the Company's stock more attractive to a larger number of investors who have limitations on the size of companies in which they invest. Furthermore, a larger number of shares outstanding may increase trading volume, which could decrease the volatility in the price of the Company's common stock in the secondary market. 
As a BDC and a regulated investment company (a "RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company depends on its ability to raise capital through the issuance of its common stock. RICs generally must distribute substantially all of their earnings to stockholders as dividends in order to achieve favorable tax treatment, which prevents the Company from using those earnings to support new investments (including investments into existing portfolio companies). Further, BDCs must maintain an asset coverage ratio (the ratio of total assets less total liabilities other than indebtedness to total indebtedness) of not less than 200% (or 150% in certain circumstances) in order to incur debt or to issue other senior securities, meaning generally that for every dollar of debt incurred or senior securities issued, the Company must have at least two dollars of assets immediately following issuance. The Company's credit facility also requires that the Company maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than 200%. 
To the extent that the Company is unable to raise capital through the issuance of equity, its ability to raise capital through the issuance of debt or senior securities may be inhibited by the asset coverage ratio requirement. Failure to maintain an asset coverage ratio of not less than 200% could have severe negative consequences for a BDC, including the inability to pay dividends, breaching debt covenants and failure to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC. Although the Company does not currently expect that its asset coverage ratio will fall below 200%, the markets in which it operates and the general economy remain volatile and uncertain. Volatility in the capital markets could result in negative pressure on debt investment valuations, potentially impacting the Company's asset valuations, Stockholder equity and the Company's asset coverage ratio. In addition, the debt capital that will be available, if at all, to the Company may be at a higher cost and on less favorable terms and conditions in the future. The issuance of additional stock would enable the Company to increase the dollar amount of its leverage. The following table lists the high and low closing sales price as quoted on NASDAQ under the symbol "BKCC" for the Company's common stock and the closing sales price as a percentage of NAV for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and for the current fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.

[END TABLE]
While the Company has never completed an offering of its common stock at a price per share below NAV, and the Company has no immediate plans to sell any shares of its common stock at a price below NAV (other than through its dividend reinvestment plan), it is seeking Stockholder approval now in order  to provide flexibility for future sales, which typically must be undertaken quickly. The final terms of any sale below NAV will be determined by the Board at the time of sale. Also, because the Company has no immediate plans to sell any shares of its common stock at a price below NAV (other than through its dividend reinvestment plan), it is impracticable to describe the transaction or transactions in which shares of common stock would be sold. Instead, any offering where the Company sells shares of common stock, including the nature and amount of consideration that would be received by the Company at the time of sale and the use of any such consideration, will be reviewed and approved by the Board at the time of sale. If the Proposal is approved, no further authorization from the Stockholders will be solicited prior to any such sale in accordance with the terms of the Proposal. 
Conditions to Sales Below NAV. If Stockholders approve the Proposal, the Company will be permitted to sell shares of its common stock at a price below NAV per share only if the following conditions are met: 
(1) a majority of the Company's Independent Directors who have no financial interest in the sale have determined that such sale would be in the best interests of the Company and Stockholders; 
(2) a majority of the Company's Independent Directors, in consultation with the underwriter or underwriters of the offering if it is to be underwritten, have determined in good faith, and as of a time immediately prior to the first solicitation by or on behalf of the Company of firm commitments to purchase such securities or immediately prior to the issuance of such securities, that the price at which such securities are to be sold is not less than a price which closely approximates the market value of those securities, less any underwriting commission or discount; and 
(3) the number of shares sold pursuant to such authority does not exceed 25% of the Company's then outstanding common stock immediately prior to each such sale. 
Shares issued below NAV pursuant to the Company's dividend reinvestment plan will not count towards the foregoing 25% limitation because shares issued below NAV pursuant to the Company's dividend reinvestment plan do not rely on the authority sought pursuant to this proposal. The Company will also follow any SEC guidance with respect to the issuance of stock below NAV.
Key Stockholder Considerations. Before voting on the Proposal or giving proxies with regard to this matter, Stockholders should consider the potentially dilutive effect on the NAV per outstanding share of common stock of the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock at a price less than NAV per share. Any sale of common stock at a price below NAV would result in an immediate dilution to existing Stockholders. This dilution would include reduction in the NAV per share of outstanding shares of common stock as a result of the issuance of shares of common stock at a price below the then current NAV per share and a proportionately greater decrease in a Stockholder's interest in the earnings and assets of the Company and voting interest in the Company. The Board will consider the potential dilutive effect when considering whether to authorize any such issuance. Shares of common stock sold at prices below then current NAV upon exercise or conversion of any warrants or other securities that may be issued under authority previously approved by Stockholders in accordance with Section 61(a) of the 1940 Act will not be taken into account in determining whether the 25% limitation described above in this Proposal has been reached. 
When stock is sold at a sale price below NAV per share, the resulting increase in the number of outstanding shares is not accompanied by a proportionate increase in the net assets of the issuer. Stockholders should also consider that they will have no subscription, preferential or preemptive rights to additional shares of the common stock proposed to be authorized for issuance, and thus any future issuance of common stock at a price below NAV will dilute a Stockholder's holdings of common stock as a percentage of shares outstanding to the extent the Stockholder does not purchase sufficient shares in the  offering or otherwise to maintain the Stockholder's percentage interest. Further, if the Stockholder does not purchase any shares to maintain the Stockholder's percentage interest, regardless of whether such offering is at a price above or below the then current NAV, the Stockholder's voting power will be diluted. 
As discussed above, the maximum number of shares issuable below NAV that could result in such dilution is limited to 25% of the Company's then outstanding common stock. 
Examples of Dilutive Effect of the Issuance of Shares Below Net Asset Value. The following table illustrates the level of NAV dilution that would be experienced by a nonparticipating stockholder in four different hypothetical common stock offerings of different sizes and levels of discount from NAV per share, although it is not possible to predict the level of market price decline that may occur. Actual sales prices and discounts may differ from the presentation below. There is no maximum level of discount from NAV at which we may sell shares pursuant to this authority.
The examples assume that Company XYZ has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding, $15,000,000 in total assets and $5,000,000 in total liabilities. The current NAV and NAV per share are thus $10,000,000 and $10.00. The table illustrates the dilutive effect on nonparticipating Stockholder A of (1) an offering of 50,000 shares (5% of the outstanding shares) at $9.50 per share after offering expenses and commission (a 5% discount from NAV); (2) an offering of 100,000 shares (10% of the outstanding shares) at $9.00 per share after offering expenses and commissions (a 10% discount from NAV); (3) an offering of 250,000 shares (25% of the outstanding shares) at $7.50 per share after offering expenses and commissions (a 25% discount from NAV); and (4) an offering of 250,000 shares (25% of the outstanding shares) at $0 per share after offering expenses and commissions (a 100% discount from NAV).  The prospectus supplement pursuant to which any discounted offering is made will include a chart for these examples based on the actual number of shares in such offering and the actual discount from the most recently determined net asset value per share. It is not possible to predict the level of market price decline that may occur.

 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND TRANSACTIONS 
We have entered into an investment management agreement with the Advisor, under which the Advisor, subject to the overall supervision of our Board, manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment advisory services to us. For providing these services, we have agreed to pay the Advisor a management fee based on our total assets and an incentive fee based on our investment performance, plus reimbursement of certain expenses incurred by the Advisor. Our executive officers and Directors and the employees of the Advisor and certain of its affiliates, as well as members of the investment committee, serve or may serve as investment advisors, officers, directors or principals of entities or investment funds that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do and/or investment funds managed by our affiliates. We note that any affiliated investment vehicle currently formed or formed in the future and managed by the Advisor or its affiliates may have overlapping investment objectives with our own and, accordingly, may invest in asset classes similar to those targeted by us. As a result, the Advisor and/or its affiliates may face conflicts in allocating investment opportunities between us and such other entities. Accordingly, we may not be given the opportunity to participate in certain investments made by investment funds managed by advisors affiliated with the Advisor. However, the Advisor and its affiliates will endeavor to allocate investment opportunities in a fair and equitable manner and consistent with applicable allocation procedures. In any such case, if the Advisor forms other affiliates in the future, we may co-invest on a concurrent basis with such other affiliates, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. In certain circumstances, negotiated co-investments may be made only if we receive an order from the SEC permitting us to do so. 
Pursuant to the terms of the administration agreement, BlackRock, through the Administrator (a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock), provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. 
From time to time, we may invest in transactions in which our Directors and officers or the officers and employees of the Advisor and/or certain of its affiliates have a pecuniary interest. With respect to any such investment, we intend to comply with the relevant provisions of the 1940 Act to the extent they apply to us as a business development company, any other applicable laws and our written policies and procedures concerning affiliated transactions. Depending on the extent of the individual's pecuniary interest, the Advisor will disclose the interest to its investment committee, our senior management and our Board and may, among other actions, seek the Board's approval to enter into the transaction and require the individual to recuse himself or herself from the deliberations and voting of our Board, the Advisor and its investment committee with respect to the transaction.

WE WILL FURNISH, WITHOUT CHARGE, A COPY OF OUR MOST RECENT ANNUAL REPORT AND THE MOST RECENT QUARTERLY REPORT SUCCEEDING THE ANNUAL REPORT, IF ANY, TO ANY STOCKHOLDER UPON REQUEST. REQUESTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE COMPANY AT 40 EAST 52ND STREET, NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10022 (TELEPHONE NUMBER 212-810-5800) OR GEORGESON INC., THE COMPANY'S PROXY SOLICITOR (TELEPHONE NUMBER 1-866-316-3922).

SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, the Company's Directors and executive officers, and any persons holding 10% or more of its common stock, are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based solely upon a review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons, the Company believes that each of its officers and directors and any persons holding 10% or more of its common stock complied with all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to them during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.
DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN 
On March 6, 2018, the Company amended its dividend reinvestment plan (the "Plan"). Under the terms of the amended Plan, if the Company declares a dividend or determines to make a capital gain or other distribution, the reinvestment plan agent will acquire shares for the participants' accounts, depending upon the following circumstances, (i) through receipt of unissued but authorized shares from the Company ("newly issued shares") and/or (ii) by purchase of outstanding shares on the open market or on the Company's primary exchange ("open-market purchases"). If, on the last quarterly dividend payment date, the net asset value per share ("NAV") is equal to or less than the closing market price per share on such dividend payment date (such condition often referred to as a "market premium"), the reinvestment plan agent will invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares acquired on behalf of the participants. The number of newly issued shares to be credited to each participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the greater of (i) the NAV or (ii) 95% of the closing market price on such dividend payment date. If, on the dividend payment date, the NAV is greater than the market price per share plus estimated brokerage commissions (such condition often referred to as a "market discount"), the reinvestment plan agent may, upon notice to the reinvestment plan agent from the Company, either (a) invest the distribution amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants or (b) invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the participants in open-market purchases. In the event that the Company elects to have the reinvestment plan agent invest the dividend amount in newly issued shares on behalf of the participants, the number of newly issued shares to be credited to each participant's account will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the market price on the dividend payment date. In the event that the Company elects to have the reinvestment plan agent invest the dividend amount in shares acquired on behalf of the participants in open-market purchases, the number of shares issued to each participant will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the weighted average price per share (including any applicable brokerage commissions) for all shares purchased by the reinvestment plan agent in the open market in connection with the dividend. The reinvestment plan agent will have until the last business day before the next date on which the shares trade on an "ex-distribution" basis or 30 days after the distribution payment date, whichever is sooner (the "last purchase date"), to invest the distribution amount in shares acquired in open-market purchases. If the reinvestment plan agent is unable to invest the full dividend amount in open-market purchases on the last purchase date, the reinvestment plan agent shall invest any uninvested portion in newly issued shares at the closing market price per share on the last purchase date. If the market discount shifts to a market premium based on the closing market price per share at any day during the purchase period, the reinvestment plan agent shall cease making open-market purchases after such day and invest any un-invested portion in newly issued shares. Investments in newly issued shares made in this manner would be made pursuant to the process described under the market premium condition with the date of such shift from market discount to market premium substituting for the dividend payment date. In either of the above scenarios where a combination of open-market purchases and newly issued shares is used to fulfil the Plan's requirements, the number of shares issued to each participant will be determined by dividing the dollar amount of the dividend by the weighted average of the two methods including any applicable  brokerage commissions. On March 7, 2018, the Company filed a Form 8-K with the SEC concerning the amended Plan. You may access the Form 8-K filing and the Plan at http://www.sec.gov or http://www.blackrockbkcc.com.

Notice of any such business must be in writing and received at the Company's principal executive office between Friday, January 3, 2020 and Monday, February 3, 2020. In order to be considered timely, such notice shall be delivered to the Company's Secretary at the principal executive office of the Company and shall set forth all information required under the Company's bylaws. 
Copies of the Company's bylaws are available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC's Internet site at www.sec.gov. The Company will also furnish, without charge, a copy of its bylaws to a Stockholder upon request. Such requests should be directed to the Company at 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022, or by calling 212-810-5800.  
HOUSEHOLDING OF PROXY MATERIALS 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries (e.g., brokers) to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single proxy statement and annual report addressed to those stockholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially means extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies.  A number of brokers with account holders who are the Company's Stockholders will be "householding" the Company's proxy materials. A single Proxy Statement will be delivered to multiple Stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected Stockholders. If you have received notice from your broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Proxy Statement and annual report, please notify your broker. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Proxy Statement and annual report at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their brokers. 
Please note that only one Proxy Statement and annual report may be delivered to two or more Stockholders who share an address, unless the Company has received instructions to the contrary. To request a separate copy of this Proxy Statement and annual report or for instructions as to how to request a separate copy of this document and annual report or as to how to request a single copy if multiple copies of this document and annual report are received, Stockholders should contact the Company at the address and phone number set forth below. 
Requests should be directed to the Company at 40 East 52nd Street, New York, New York 10022 (telephone number 212-810-5800). Copies of these documents may also be accessed electronically by means of the SEC's home page on the Internet at http://www.sec.gov.
