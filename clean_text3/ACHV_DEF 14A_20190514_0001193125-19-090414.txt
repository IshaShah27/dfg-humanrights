PROXY STATEMENT FOR 
2019 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of the Board of Directors of Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation, for use at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders, or the Annual Meeting, to be held on May 14, 2019, at 12:00 p.m. Pacific time, or at any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, for the purposes set forth in this proxy statement and in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting. 
The Annual Meeting will be held on May 14, 2019 at the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, 1191 Second Avenue, Floor 10, Seattle, Washington. 
This Proxy Statement and accompanying proxy card will first be mailed on or about March 28, 2019 to all stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
Voting Rights 
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2019, the record date, are entitled to notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting and any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting. At the close of business on March 15, 2019, we had 6,721,200 shares of common stock outstanding. 
Each stockholder of record is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock held on the record date on all matters. Dissenters' rights are not applicable to any of the matters being voted on. 
Board Recommendation 
Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR each of the nominees for the Board of Directors, who are, Anthony Clarke, Scott Cormack, Donald Joseph,  Martin Mattingly, Jay Moyes, Stewart Parker, and Richard Stewart; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the ratification of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the  fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Voting of Proxies 
All shares represented by a valid proxy received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted, and, if you provide specific instructions, your shares will be voted as you instruct. If you sign your proxy card with no further instructions and do not hold your shares beneficially through a broker, bank or other nominee, your shares will be voted FOR each of the nominees for the Board of Directors, FOR the ratification of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and in the discretion of the proxy holders with respect to any other matters that properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting.  How to Vote Your Shares 
YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. Your shares can be voted at the Annual Meeting only if you are present in person or represented by proxy. Whether or not you expect to attend the Annual Meeting, please take the time to vote your proxy. 
Stockholders of record, or "registered stockholders," can vote by proxy in the following three ways: 
If your shares are held beneficially in "street" name through a nominee such as a financial institution, brokerage firm, or other holder of record, your vote is controlled by that institution, firm or holder. Your vote by proxy may also be cast by telephone or via the Internet, as well as by mail, if your financial institution or brokerage firm offers such voting alternatives. Please follow the specific instructions provided by your nominee on your voting instruction card. 
Even if you have given your proxy, you still may vote in person if you attend the Annual Meeting. Please note, however, that if your shares are held beneficially through a bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to vote at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a proxy issued in your name from the record holder. Should you wish to attend the Annual Meeting, directions to the offices of Fenwick & West LLP, 1191 Second Avenue, Floor 10, Seattle, Washington can be obtained by contacting our Secretary at (250) 686-1500. 
Revocability of Proxies 
You may revoke or change any previously delivered proxy (including a proxy sent to you by someone other than us) at any time before the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering a written notice of revocation to our Secretary at our principal executive office at 1040 West Georgia  Street, Suite 1030, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 4H1;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering a valid proxy bearing a later date or submitting a new later dated proxy; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person, although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself,  revoke a proxy.  
[END TABLE]
If you hold shares in street name through a broker, bank or other nominee, you must contact that bank, broker or other nominee to revoke any prior voting instructions. 
If you receive a proxy from someone other than us, see "Background of Stockholder Nominations" below. 
Quorum 
The presence, in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. Both abstentions and broker non-votes are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
Votes Required to Approve Matters Presented at the Annual Meeting 
Our directors are elected by a plurality of the votes of shares of common stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Approval of Proposal 2 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of common stock properly cast at the Annual Meeting.  Broker Non-Votes 
For banks, brokers or other nominee accounts that receive proxy materials only from us, they are entitled to vote shares held for a beneficial owner on "routine" matters without instructions from the beneficial owner of those shares. For "non-routine" matters, the beneficial owner of such shares is required to provide instructions to the bank, broker or other nominee in order for them to be entitled to vote the shares held for the beneficial owner. Proposal 1 (election of our directors) will be treated as a non-routine matter. If you hold your shares in street name and you do not instruct your bank, broker or other nominee how to vote in the election of directors, no votes will be cast on your behalf with respect to this proposal. The approval of Proposal 2 (the ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent public accounting firm) will be treated as a routine matter, and, therefore, no broker non-votes are expected to exist with respect to this proposal. 
If you hold your shares in street name, it is critical that you cast your vote if you want it to count on all matters to be decided at the Annual Meeting. 
As noted above, broker non-votes are counted for purposes of determining whether or not a quorum exists for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting. Broker non-votes, as well as abstentions from voting, will not, however, be treated as votes cast and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of Proposals 1 and 2. 
Solicitation of Proxies 
We will bear the cost of soliciting proxies, including preparing, assembling, printing and mailing this Proxy Statement, the proxy card and any additional information furnished to stockholders. Copies of solicitation materials will be furnished to banks, brokerage houses, fiduciaries and custodians holding in their names shares of common stock beneficially owned by others to forward to such beneficial owners. We may reimburse persons representing beneficial owners of common stock for their costs of forwarding solicitation materials to such beneficial owners. Original solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, telegram, via the Internet or by personal solicitation by our directors, officers or other regular employees. No additional compensation will be paid to these individuals for such services. 
Availability of Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K 
Our Proxy Statement and Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 are available at www.sec.gov and on our website at ir.achievelifesciences.com. We have provided to each stockholder of record as of March 15, 2019, a copy of our consolidated financial statements and related information, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018. We will mail without charge, upon written request, a copy of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018, including the consolidated financial statements, schedules and list of exhibits, and any particular exhibit specifically requested. Requests should be sent to: Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., 1040 West Georgia Street, Suite 1030, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 4H1, Attention: Investor Relations.  BOARD OF DIRECTORS

Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board of Directors is required to hold at least four regularly scheduled meetings each year. At least one of these meetings must include budgeting and long-term strategic planning.

Related-Party Transactions Policy and Procedure 
Our Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing and approving all related-party transactions and conflict of interest situations involving a principal stockholder, a member of the Board of Directors or senior management. Our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics requires our executive officers and directors to report any conflicts of interest with our interests to our Audit Committee, and generally prohibits our executive officers and directors from conflicts of interest with our interests. Waivers of our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics with respect to an executive officer or director may only be granted by the Board of Directors or, if permitted by Nasdaq and any other applicable stock exchange's rules, our Nominating and Governance Committee. We do not have a specific policy concerning approval of transactions with stockholders who own more than five percent of our outstanding shares. 
Other than as disclosed below and in "Proposal 1" and "Executive Compensation," from January 1, 2018 to the present, there have been no transactions, and there are currently no proposed transactions, in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000 to which we or any of our subsidiaries was or is to be a party and in which any director, director nominee, executive officer, holder of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of any of these individuals, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest.  
Board of Directors' Committees 
The Board of Directors has established separately designated Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees to assist it in performing its responsibilities. The Board of Directors designates the   members of these committees and the committee chairs annually, based on the recommendations of the Nominating and Governance Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews committee assignments from time to time and considers the rotation of committee chairpersons and members with a view towards balancing the benefits derived from the diversity of experience and viewpoints of the directors. The Board of Directors has adopted written charters for each of these committees, which are available on our website at ir.achievelifesciences.com under "Corporate Governance." The chairperson of each committee develops the agenda for that committee and determines the frequency and length of committee meetings. 
Audit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert 
The Audit Committee has been established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and is currently comprised of Jay Moyes (Chairperson), Donald Joseph, Martin Mattingly and Stewart Parker, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined satisfies the applicable SEC and Nasdaq independence requirements for audit committee members. The Board of Directors has also determined that Mr. Moyes is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the applicable rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee held six meetings during fiscal year 2018.

[END TABLE]
Please see the sections entitled "Report of the Audit Committee" and "Proposal Two: Ratification of Appointment of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" for further matters related to the Audit Committee. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee currently consists of Martin Mattingly (Chairperson), Donald Joseph and Stewart Parker, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined satisfies the applicable SEC and Nasdaq independence requirements. In addition, each member of the Compensation Committee has been determined to be an outside director under Section 162(m), of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, and a non-employee director under Rule 16b-3 as promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Compensation Committee reviews and recommends to the Board of Directors the compensation for our executive officers and our non-employee directors for their services as members of the Board of Directors. The Compensation Committee does not have any explicit authority to delegate its duties. The Compensation Committee held five meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
In 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Radford, an Aon Hewitt company and a provider of compensation market intelligence to the technology and life sciences industries, to provide a report summarizing relevant benchmark data relating to industry-appropriate peers and make recommendations regarding base salary, target total cash (base salary plus target cash incentives), and terms of long-term equity incentive awards for our executives. No work performed by Radford during fiscal year 2018 raised a conflict of interest.  Please see the sections entitled "Executive Compensation" and "Director Compensation" for further matters related to the Compensation Committee and director and executive officer compensation matters. 
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Governance Committee currently consists of Stewart Parker (Chairperson), Martin Mattingly, Jay Moyes and Donald Joseph, each of whom the Board of Directors has determined satisfies the applicable SEC and Nasdaq independence requirements. 
The Nominating and Governance Committee reviews, evaluates and proposes candidates for election to our Board of Directors, and considers any nominees properly recommended by stockholders. The Nominating and Governance Committee promotes the proper constitution of our Board of Directors in order to meet its fiduciary obligations to our stockholders, and oversees the establishment of, and compliance with, appropriate governance standards. The Nominating and Governance Committee held four meetings during fiscal year 2018. 
Board of Directors Leadership Structure 
The positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer are currently filled by the same person, Richard Stewart. Our Board of Directors believes that the current Board leadership structure, coupled with a strong emphasis on Board independence and the role of the lead independent director, provides effective independent oversight of management while allowing the Board of Directors and management to benefit from Mr. Stewart's extensive executive leadership and experience with the development of our lead product candidate, cytisinicline. Independent directors and management sometimes have different perspectives and roles in strategy development. Our independent directors bring experience, oversight and expertise from outside of our company, while Mr. Stewart brings company-specific experience and expertise. Our Board of Directors believes that Mr. Stewart's combined role enables strong leadership, creates clear accountability, and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to stockholders. 
Lead Independent Director 
Because Mr. Stewart is our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, our Board of Directors appointed Donald Joseph to serve as our lead independent director. As lead independent director, among other responsibilities, Mr. Joseph presides over regularly scheduled meetings at which only our independent directors are present, serves as a liaison between the Chief Executive Officer and the independent directors and performs such additional duties as our Board of Directors may otherwise determine and delegate. 
Board of Directors' Role in Risk Oversight 
Consistent with our leadership structure, our management is charged with the day-to-day management of risks that we face or may face and provides our Board of Directors with quarterly risk assessment and mitigation strategy updates, while our Board of Directors and its committees are responsible for oversight of risk management. The Audit Committee has responsibility for oversight of financial reporting related risks, including those related to our accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices. In addition, the Audit Committee annually reviews and assesses the adequacy of our risk management policies and procedures with regard to identifying our management of financial risks, reviews the quarterly updates on these risks that are received from management, and assesses the adequacy of management's implementation of appropriate systems to mitigate and manage financial risks. Furthermore, under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, the Audit Committee is responsible for considering reports of conflicts of interest involving officers and directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee oversees corporate governance risks, including implementing procedures to ensure that the Board of Directors operates independently of management and without conflicts of interest. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Compensation Committee oversees risks associated with our compensation policies, plans and practices. The   Audit Committee, the Nominating and Governance Committee and the Compensation Committee each report to the Board of Directors regarding the foregoing matters, and the Board of Directors approves any changes in corporate policies, including those pertaining to risk management. 
The Board of Directors has also adopted a Whistle Blowing Policy, which provides a means by which concerns about actual and suspected violations of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other public interest matters are to be reported. We recognize that individuals may not feel comfortable reporting a matter directly to the appropriate persons at the company and therefore the Whistle Blowing Policy provides a mechanism by which a person may report a matter to Nasdaq OMX Group Corporate Services, Inc., a third party retained by us. Under the policy, the Chairperson of the Audit Committee determines whether and, if so, how an investigation is to be conducted and, together with the full Audit Committee in certain instances, resolves reported violations. In all cases, a report of the outcome is to be made to the Board of Directors. 
Risk Assessment of Compensation Programs 
We have determined that our compensation policies, plans and practices are appropriately balanced and do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. To make this determination, our management reviewed the compensation policies, plans and practices for our executive officers, as well as for all other employees. We assessed the following features of our compensation, plans and practices: design, payment methodology, potential payment volatility, relationship to our financial results, length of performance period, risk-mitigating features, performance measures and goals, oversight and controls, and plan features and values compared to market practices. Based on this review, we believe that our compensation policies, plans and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our company. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of the Compensation Committee during fiscal year 2018 served as one of our officers, former officers or employees nor received directly or indirectly compensation from the Company, other than in the capacity as a member of our Board and Compensation Committee. There was no direct or indirect control by the members of the Compensation Committee of the Company. No member of the Compensation Committee, directly or indirectly, is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Company's equity, nor are they an executive officer, employee, director, general partner or a managing member of one or more entities that are together the beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's equity. The Compensation Committee members are not aware of any business or personal relationship between (i) a member of the Compensation Committee and any person who has provided or is providing advice to the Compensation Committee; and (ii) an executive officer of the company and any firm or other person who is employed or is employing such person to provide advice to the Compensation Committee. During fiscal year 2018, none of our executive officers served as a member of the compensation committee of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as a member of our Board of Directors or Compensation Committee, and none of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors of any other entity, one of whose executive officers served as a member of our Compensation Committee. As of January 2019, Cindy Jacobs, our Chief Medical Officer, serves on the board of directors of Renown Pharma Limited, of which Richard Stewart, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and Anthony Clarke, our President and Chief Scientific Officer, are executive officers. Dr. Jacobs does not receive any direct or indirect compensation for the Director position of Renown. 
Director Nomination Process 
Director Qualifications 
Members of our Board of Directors must have broad experience and business acumen, a record of professional accomplishment in his or her field, and demonstrated honesty and integrity consistent with our values. In   evaluating director nominees, the Nominating and Governance Committee considers a variety of factors, including, without limitation, the director nominee's skills, expertise and experience, wisdom, integrity, the ability to make independent analytical inquiries, the ability to understand our business environment, the willingness to devote adequate time to Board of Directors' duties, the interplay of the director nominee's experience and skills with those of other directors, and the extent to which the director nominee would be a desirable addition to the Board of Directors and any committees of the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee may also consider such other factors as it may deem are in the best interests of us and our stockholders. Additionally, in accordance with the applicable securities laws and Nasdaq requirements, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors must be "independent." We do not have a policy regarding diversity, but the Nominating and Governance Committee does and will continue to consider each candidate's experiences and qualities as described above and how these experiences and qualities complement the diversity of the Board of Directors. 
Identification of Nominees by the Board of Directors 
The Nominating and Governance Committee identifies nominees by first determining the desired skills and experience of a new nominee based on the qualifications discussed above. The Nominating and Governance Committee will solicit names for possible candidates from other directors, our senior level executives and individuals personally known to the directors, as well as third-party search firms. The Nominating and Governance Committee evaluates all possible candidates, including individuals recommended by stockholders, using the same criteria. 
Stockholder Nominations 
Our bylaws contain provisions that address the process by which a stockholder may nominate an individual to stand for election to the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Governance Committee will consider nominees properly recommended by stockholders. Stockholders wishing to submit nominations must provide timely written notice to our Corporate Secretary containing the following information: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

Code of Ethics 
We believe that sound corporate governance policies are essential to earning and retaining the trust of investors. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that is applicable to our principal executive officer, our principal financial officer and our principal accounting officer, as well as to all of our other employees and directors, and have posted such code on our website at ir.achievelifesciences.com. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
In 2014 and 2017, we held advisory say-on-pay votes to approve the compensation of our executive officers, with approximately 95% and 99%, respectively, of the votes cast in favor of our executive compensation program. In light of the support by our stockholders of our executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee did not make any significant changes to our 2018 executive compensation program. 
In addition, at our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, a majority of our stockholders voted in favor of an advisory vote on executive compensation every three years, and, accordingly, our Board of Directors determined that we will hold an advisory vote on executive compensation at our annual meeting of stockholders every three years. We expect to hold the next vote on executive compensation at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.  PROPOSAL ONE:

Each director is elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders or until a successor has been duly elected and has qualified. 
Biographies of our 2019 director nominees are located above under the heading "Board of Directors – General." 
Director Compensation Overview 
The charter of the Compensation Committee provides that the Compensation Committee is to recommend to the Board of Directors matters related to director compensation. The director compensation package for non-employee directors consists of annual cash compensation and stock options exercisable to purchase shares of our common stock. None of our employees are entitled to receive compensation for service as a director. Our director compensation policy for fiscal year 2018 is set forth below under the heading "Director Compensation Policy – 2018 Director Compensation." 
Director Compensation Policy 
2018 Director Compensation 
As part of its evaluation of compensation levels following our Merger, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors approved the retention of Radford to review compensation levels of our independent directors and committee members. Radford was instructed to benchmark and make recommendations regarding the initial and annual retainer amounts for directors and chairpersons of the Board of Directors and the various committees, as well as the amounts and terms of initial and annual long-term equity incentive awards for directors. In August 2017, based on peer group analyses, our committee member and chair retainers and our equity compensation were adjusted to be more closely aligned with the market. On the recommendation of Radford, we review Board of Directors pay practices every other year. As a result, the compensation for non-employee directors in connection with their service on the Board of Directors has not changed since August 1, 2017 and is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An annual retainer of $60,000 was paid to the Lead Independent Director and $40,000 was paid to all other non-employee directors. These retainers were paid in quarterly installments. Each quarterly  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     payment was conditioned on the director remaining a director on the date of actual payment, which was typically within 10 days following the completion of the respective calendar quarter.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Additional annual cash compensation for the chairpersons and members of each committee as set forth in the  following table and paid on the same schedule and on the same terms as the non-employee director compensation described above:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Committee    $ 15,000      $ 7,500   
 Compensation Committee    $ 10,000      $ 5,000   
 Nominating and Governance Committee    $ 7,500      $ 3,500   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any new director would have received a one-time initial grant of stock  options to acquire 16,400 shares of our common stock upon becoming a director, which would vest monthly over three years from the date of grant.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each director that was re-elected by our stockholders at an annual  meeting was to receive a grant of stock options to acquire 11,000 shares of common stock. Each annual stock option would vest in full on the earlier of the first anniversary of the date of grant or the date immediately prior to our next annual  meeting of stockholders.  
[END TABLE]

RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
On August 1, 2017, we dismissed Ernst & Young LLP, or E&Y, as our independent registered public accounting firm and appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, or PwC, as our new independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, both effective immediately. Our Audit Committee approved the dismissal of E&Y and the appointment of PwC.

During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the subsequent interim period through August 1, 2017, there were no disagreements (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and related instructions) between us and E&Y on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused E&Y to make reference thereto in their reports on the financial statements for such years. 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 and the interim period through August 1, 2017, neither we, nor anyone acting on our behalf, consulted with PwC regarding (i) the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that may be rendered on our financial statements, and PwC did not provide either a written report or oral advice to us that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue, or (ii) any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions) or a reportable event (as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K). 
The Audit Committee has appointed PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. PwC audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. A representative of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting, will be given the opportunity to make a statement, if he or she desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions.

Policy on Audit Committee Pre-Approval of Audit Services and Permissible Non-Audit Services 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and permissible non-audit services performed by our independent registered public accounting firm. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services and other services. For audit services, our independent registered public accounting firm typically provides audit service detail in advance of the second quarter meeting of the Audit Committee, which outlines the scope of the audit and related audit fees. If agreed to by the Audit Committee, an engagement letter is formally accepted by the Audit Committee. 
For non-audit services, our senior management will submit from time to time to the Audit Committee for approval non-audit services that it recommends the Audit Committee engage our independent registered public accounting firm to provide for the fiscal year. Our senior management and our independent registered public accounting firm will each confirm to the Audit Committee that each non-audit service is permissible under all applicable legal requirements. A budget, estimating non-audit service spending for the fiscal year, will be provided to the Audit Committee along with the request. The Audit Committee must approve both permissible non-audit services and the budget for such services. The Audit Committee will be informed routinely as to the non-audit services actually provided by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to this pre-approval process. 
For the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years, the Audit Committee approved all of the services provided by PwC and Ernst & Young LLP described above.

(1)  The dollar amounts in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of equity awards granted during  the fiscal year in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 for stock-based compensation. These amounts do not correspond to the actual cash value that will be recognized by each of the Named Executive Officers when received.  For a discussion of the assumptions and methodologies used to value the awards reported in this column, see note 12 to our audited consolidated financial statements, which are included in our 2018 Annual Report on Form  10-K. In 2016, the 2016 options awards included in this column were cancelled for each of Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Bencich. These options vested upon either the positive results from the AFFINITY or  ENSPIRIT trials, or the consummation of a change in control by December 31, 2016. Neither of these milestones were achieved, and therefore, all of the options granted to Dr. Jacobs and Mr. Bencich in 2016 were cancelled. Additionally,  in 2016, 5,000 performance RSUs were forfeited by Dr. Jacobs, as the AFFINITY trial did not meet its primary endpoint.  
(2)  The dollar amounts in this column reflect the aggregate non-equity  incentive plan compensation earned by each Named Executive Officer in 2018. For more information, see "—2018 Bonuses" below.  
[END TABLE]
 2018 Equity Awards 
Equity awards are granted to executive officers at the discretion of the Compensation Committee. In July 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 20,000 options to purchase common stock to each of Cindy Jacobs and Anthony Clarke, 25,000 stock options to John Bencich and 52,000 to Richard Stewart. The stock options have an exercise price of $3.37 and vest monthly over 48 months commencing July 26, 2018. In September 2018, the Compensation Committee granted 37,000 options to purchase common to each of Cindy Jacobs and Anthony Clarke, 50,000 stock options to John Bencich and 101,000 to Richard Stewart. The stock options have an exercise price of $2.56 and vest monthly over 48 months commencing from September 20, 2018. 
2018 Bonuses 
Annual bonuses for our executive officers are based on the achievement of corporate performance objectives, which in 2017 and in 2018 included the achievement of clinical development and financial milestones. In January 2018, our compensation committee determined that approximately 22.9% of our 2017 corporate performance objectives were achieved, and determined that 22.9% of each executive officer's target bonus should be awarded, provided that a financing was completed. The financing was completed in June 2018 and the 2017 bonuses were awarded in July 2018. 
With respect to the payment of these bonuses, Richard Stewart's target bonus was equal to 50% of his annual base salary of $500,000 and he was awarded $57,640, Anthony Clarke's target bonus was equal to 40% of his annual base salary of $420,000 and he was awarded $38,740, Cindy Jacob's target bonus was equal to 40% of her annual base salary of $413,200 and she was awarded $38,110 and John Bencich's target bonus was equal to 40% of his annual base salary of $375,500 and he was awarded $34,630. Because these bonuses were not earned until the completion of the financing in 2018, we have included them in the 2018 Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation in the Summary Compensation Table above. 
In January 2019, our compensation committee determined that the achievement of our 2018 corporate objectives, being the clinical development of cytisinicline and financial milestones, were approximately 86% achieved, and determined that 86% of each executive officer's target bonus should be awarded. 
With respect to the payment of these bonuses, Richard Stewart's target bonus was equal to 50% of his annual base salary of $500,000 and he was awarded $215,000, Anthony Clarke's target bonus was equal to 40% of his annual base salary of $420,000 and he was awarded $144,480, Cindy Jacob's target bonus was equal to 40% of her annual base salary of $413,200 and was awarded $142,160 and John Bencich's target bonus was equal to 40% of his annual base salary of $375,500 and he was awarded $129,180.

Change of Control Under Our Equity Compensation Plans 
The following discussion sets forth the change of control provisions provided for in our various equity compensation plans. 
2007 Performance Incentive Plan 
Under the 2007 Performance Incentive Plan, or the 2007 Plan, the administrator has the discretion to provide in each award agreement the terms and conditions with respect to a change of control that relate to (1) the vesting of an award and (2) the assumption of an award or issuance of comparable securities under an incentive program. If the terms of an option agreement provide for accelerated vesting in the event of a change of control, or to the extent that an option is vested and not yet exercised, the administrator may provide for the purchase or exchange of each option for an amount of cash or other property. Outstanding options shall terminate and cease to be exercisable upon a change of control except to the extent that the options are assumed by the successor entity, or parent of the successor entity, pursuant to the terms of the change of control transaction. 
As used in the 2007 Plan, the term "change of control" means the occurrence of any of the following:

Outstanding options shall terminate and cease to be exercisable upon a change of control   except to the extent that the options are assumed by the successor entity (or parent of the successor entity) pursuant to the terms of the change of control transaction.

2017 Equity Incentive Plan 
Under the 2017 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2017 Plan, unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, all outstanding awards will be subject to the agreement governing such merger, asset sale or other change of control transaction. Such agreement need not treat all such awards in an identical manner, and it will provide for one or more of the following with respect to each award: the continuation of the award, the assumption of the award, the substitution of the award, the full or partial acceleration of the award, the settlement of the award in cash, equivalents or securities of the successor entity (or its parent, if any) or the cancellation of the award in exchange for no consideration. In the event the successor corporation refuses to either assume, convert, replace or substitute awards, then the compensation committee will notify the award holder in writing or electronically that such award will be exercisable for a period of time determined by the compensation committee (in its sole discretion) and that the award will terminate upon expiration of such period. 
In addition, in the event of a Corporate Transaction, the vesting of all awards granted to our non-employee directors shall accelerate and such awards shall become exercisable (as applicable) in full as of the time of consummation of such change in control transaction.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

2018 Equity Incentive Plan

 Termination and Change of Control Provisions Under Employment Agreements 
As of December 31, 2018, we had employment agreements in place with each of our Named Executive Officers that provided for compensation upon the termination of their employment under certain circumstances, as described below. 
Stewart Agreement 
Our agreement with Richard Stewart, referred to as the Stewart Agreement, provides Mr. Stewart with termination benefits in the event of an involuntary termination, provided that, in the case of termination for good reason, Mr. Stewart has provided us within 60 days of becoming aware of conditions giving rise to a good reason written notice and an opportunity to cure such breach within 30 days of being served the notice. 
The Stewart Agreement provides that if an Involuntary Termination occurs, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Stewart a lump sum payment equal to 18 months of his then-current base salary and continue paying his monthly health insurance premiums for a discretionary period to be decided by us. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, if there is an Involuntary Termination, then the time-based vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on an additional number of shares under all of Mr. Stewart's outstanding compensatory equity awards, which includes outstanding stock options granted to Mr. Stewart under our equity compensation plans, that would have time-vested if Mr. Stewart had continued in employment for 18 months following his Involuntary Termination. 
The Stewart Agreement provides for additional termination benefits for any reason other than cause (as defined in the employment agreement) or if he voluntarily resigns for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement) within 12 months after a change of control of the Company. Upon such a Change in Control Termination, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Stewart 24 months of his then-current base salary, plus a sum equal to 100% of his target annual bonus for the year during which the termination occurs. In addition, we will be obligated to continue payment of his health insurance premiums for a discretionary period to be decided by us, subject to certain limitations. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, upon a Change in Control Termination, all vesting restrictions, if any, including awards that would otherwise vest only upon satisfaction of performance criteria, will immediately lapse on all of Mr. Stewart's compensatory equity effective as of his separation from service. 
All termination benefits in the event of an involuntary termination or change in control termination are subject to Mr. Stewart's execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of all litigation and other claims against us and our affiliates. 
Jacobs Agreement 
Our agreement with Cindy Jacobs, referred to as the Jacobs Agreement, provides Dr. Jacobs with termination benefits in the event of an Involuntary Termination, provided that, in the case of termination for good reason, Dr. Jacobs has provided us with 30 days' advance written notice and an opportunity to cure such breach during such 30-day period. 
The Jacobs Agreement provides that if an Involuntary Termination occurs, we will be obligated to pay Dr. Jacobs a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of her then-current base salary. In addition, if Dr. Jacobs elects to continue her and her dependents' health insurance coverage under COBRA, we must pay up to 12 months of Dr. Jacobs' monthly premium under COBRA, provided that our obligation to pay the monthly premium will cease when Dr. Jacobs becomes eligible to receive substantially equivalent health coverage in connection with new employment. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, if there is an Involuntary Termination, then the time-based vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on an additional number of shares under all of Dr. Jacobs' outstanding compensatory   equity awards, which includes outstanding stock options granted to Dr. Jacobs under our equity compensation plans, that would have time-vested if Dr. Jacobs had continued in employment for 12 months following her Involuntary Termination. 
The Jacobs Agreement provides for additional termination benefits if an Involuntary Termination occurs during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a change in control or if such Involuntary Termination is required by the merger agreement, purchase agreement or other instrument relating to such change in control, or such Involuntary Termination is made at the express request of the other party or parties to the transaction constituting such change in control, each of which events is referred to as a Change in Control Termination. Upon such a Change in Control Termination, we will be obligated to pay Dr. Jacobs 15 months of her then-current base salary, plus a sum equal to 12 months of her average monthly bonus earnings, where such average is calculated over the 24-month period immediately preceding Dr. Jacobs' separation from services and based on Dr. Jacobs' bonuses paid in such 24-month period. In addition, our payment of monthly COBRA premiums as described above will be for up to 15 months instead of up to 12 months. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, upon a Change in Control Termination, all vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on all of Dr. Jacobs' compensatory equity effective as of her separation from service. 
All termination benefits in the event of an Involuntary Termination or Change in Control Termination are subject to Dr. Jacobs' execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of all litigation and other claims against us and our affiliates. 
Clarke Agreement 
Our agreement with Anthony Clarke, referred to as the Clarke Agreement, provides Mr. Clarke with termination benefits in the event of an involuntary termination, provided that, in the case of termination for good reason, Mr. Clarke has provided us within 60 days of becoming aware of conditions giving rise to a good reason written notice and an opportunity to cure such breach within 30 days of being served the notice. 
The Clarke Agreement provides that if an involuntary termination occurs, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Clarke a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of his then-current base salary and continue paying his monthly health insurance premiums for a discretionary period to be decided by us. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, if there is an involuntary termination, then the time-based vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on an additional number of shares under all of Mr. Clarke's outstanding compensatory equity awards, which includes outstanding stock options granted to Mr. Clarke under our equity compensation plans, that would have time-vested if Mr. Clarke had continued in employment for 12 months following his involuntary termination. 
The Clarke Agreement provides for additional termination benefits for any reason other than cause (as defined in the employment agreement) or if he voluntarily resigns for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement) within 12 months after a change of control of the Company. Upon such a Change in Control Termination, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Clarke 15 months of his then-current base salary, plus a sum equal to 100% of his target annual bonus for the year during which the termination occurs. In addition, we will be obligated to continue payment of his health insurance premiums for a discretionary period to be decided by us, subject to certain limitations. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, upon a Change in Control Termination, all vesting restrictions, if any, including awards that would otherwise vest only upon satisfaction of performance criteria, will immediately lapse on all of Mr. Clarke's compensatory equity effective as of his separation from service. 
All termination benefits in the event of an involuntary termination or change in control termination are subject to Mr. Clarke's execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of all litigation and other claims against us and our affiliates.  Bencich Agreement 
Our agreement with John Bencich, referred to as the Bencich Agreement, provides Mr. Bencich with termination benefits in the event of an Involuntary Termination, provided that, in the case of termination for good reason, Mr. Bencich has provided us with 30 days' advance written notice and an opportunity to cure such breach during such 30-day period. We may terminate the Agreement with or without cause by giving Mr. Bencich 30 days' advance written notice, or a cash payment equivalent to 30 calendar days of his then-current base salary in lieu of providing such notice. 
The Bencich Agreement provides that if an Involuntary Termination occurs, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Bencich a lump sum payment equal to 12 months of his then-current base salary. In addition, if Mr. Bencich elects to continue his and his dependents' health insurance coverage under COBRA, we must pay in a lump sum payment the number of months of Mr. Bencich's monthly premium under COBRA, that is equal to the 12 months. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, if there is an Involuntary Termination, then the time-based vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on an additional number of shares under all of Mr. Bencich's outstanding compensatory equity awards, which includes outstanding stock options granted to Mr. Bencich under our equity compensation plans, that would have time-vested if Mr. Bencich had continued in employment for 12 months following his Involuntary Termination. 
The Bencich Agreement provides for additional termination benefits if an Involuntary Termination occurs during the period beginning three months before and ending 12 months after a change in control or if such Involuntary Termination is required by the merger agreement, purchase agreement or other instrument relating to such change in control, or such Involuntary Termination is made at the express request of the other party or parties to the transaction constituting such change in control, each of which events is referred to as a Change in Control Termination. Upon such a Change in Control Termination, we will be obligated to pay Mr. Bencich 15 months of his then-current base salary, plus a sum equal to 15 months of his average monthly bonus earnings, where such average is calculated over the 24-month period immediately preceding Mr. Bencich's separation from services and based on Mr. Bencich's bonuses paid in such 24-month period. In addition, our payment of monthly COBRA premiums as described above will be for up to 15 months instead of up to 12 months. Notwithstanding the terms of any of our equity compensation plans or any agreement in connection with such plans, upon a Change in Control Termination, all vesting restrictions, if any, will immediately lapse on all of Mr. Bencich's compensatory equity effective as of his separation from service. 
All termination benefits in the event of an Involuntary Termination or Change in Control Termination are subject to Mr. Bencich's execution, delivery and non-revocation of a general release of all litigation and other claims against us and our affiliates.

 OTHER MATTERS 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC rules to furnish us with copies of all forms they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we received and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all of our executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders timely filed all reports required to be filed under Section 16(a) during fiscal year 2018. 
Delivery of Documents to Stockholders Sharing an Address 
We have adopted a process for delivering documents to stockholders that has been approved by the SEC called "householding." Under this process, stockholders of record who have the same address and last name will receive only one copy of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement, unless we or one of our mailing agents has received contrary instructions from any stockholder at that address. We will continue to mail a proxy card to each stockholder of record. 
If you prefer to receive multiple copies of the Annual Report and this Proxy Statement at the same address, additional copies will be provided to you promptly upon either written or oral request. If you are a stockholder of record, you may contact us by writing to Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., Attention: Secretary, 1040 West Georgia Street, Suite 1030, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 4H1 or calling (425) 686-1500. Eligible stockholders of record receiving multiple copies of our Annual Report and this Proxy Statement who wish to only receive one copy in the future, can request householding by contacting us in the same manner. 
If you are a beneficial owner holding shares through your broker, bank or other nominee, you may request additional copies of the Annual Report or this Proxy Statement, or you may request householding, by notifying your broker, bank or other nominee. 
Stockholder Proposals to Be Presented at 2020 Annual Meeting 
Our bylaws provide that, for stockholder nominations to the Board of Director or other proposals to be considered at an annual meeting, the stockholder must give timely notice thereof in writing to our Secretary at 1040 West Georgia Street, Suite 1030, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6E 4H1, Attn: Secretary. 
To be timely for our 2019 annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to or mailed and received by our Secretary at our principal executive offices not earlier than the close of business on January 15, 2020 and not later than the close of business on February 14, 2020. A stockholder's notice to our Secretary must set forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting the information required by our bylaws. 
Stockholder proposals submitted pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act and intended to be presented at our 2020 annual meeting must be received by us not later than November 29, 2019 in order to be considered for inclusion in our proxy materials for our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.  Transaction of Other Business 
At the date of this Proxy Statement, the only business that the Board of Directors intends to present or knows that others will present at the Annual Meeting is as set forth above. If any other matter or matters are properly brought before the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment or postponement of the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named in the accompanying form of proxy to vote the proxy on such matters in accordance with their best judgment.
