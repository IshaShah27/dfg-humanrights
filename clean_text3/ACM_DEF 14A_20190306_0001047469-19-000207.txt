 Significant Recent Executive Compensation Design Improvements  
Senior management and directors of the Company frequently engage directly with stockholders to help inform our continuous evaluation of our compensation plans. Engagement is focused on strengthening the link between pay and performance, and aligning management and stockholder interests. 
In response to this engagement and direct stockholder feedback, the Compensation/Organization Committee ("Compensation Committee") made significant design improvements to fiscal year 2019 compensation plans to best align our incentive programs with our long-term strategy and the feedback gathered from stockholder engagement. Furthermore, when setting goals and reviewing performance, the Compensation Committee considered numerous factors including how best to align pay with achieving our long-term strategic objectives and five-year financial plan that includes specific revenue, EBITDA, earnings per share ("EPS") and free cash flow objectives, as well as a continued emphasis on incentivizing industry-leading cash flow performance. 
Below highlights the key changes adopted by the Compensation Committee that will be implemented in fiscal year 2019 in response to stockholder feedback and ongoing plan design evaluation: 
Added ROIC as a performance metric to our long-term incentive performance equity awards 
The Compensation Committee selected Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") as a performance metric to incentivize management to deliver long-term profitability consistent with the Company's five-year financial plan, and because of existing evidence that ROIC is recognized as highly correlated with long-term stock price performance. 
All performance metrics for our long-term incentive performance equity awards are now measured  on three-year cumulative performance 
The Compensation Committee believes that Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") should be incentivized to create sustained long-term value, and that cumulative metrics best measure long-term performance. Commencing with fiscal year 2019 awards, all long-term equity incentive award metrics are measured based on three-year cumulative performance. The Compensation Committee replaced the prior design that included three, annual performance periods with one, three-year performance period in response to stockholder feedback that metrics measured on a cumulative basis best align compensation with our stockholders interests for long-term value creation. 
Eliminated duplicative metrics between the short- and long-term incentive plans 
The Compensation Committee eliminated duplicative metrics by removing the adjusted EPS metric in long-term performance equity awards. As a result, our incentive plans no longer contain any duplicative metrics. 
Increased the rigor of the cash flow goals to continue to reward industry-leading cash flow  conversion performance 
As part of our objective to continue to deliver industry-leading cash flow performance, the Compensation Committee reviewed cash flow conversion rates (i.e., the rate at which adjusted earnings convert to free cash flow), and subsequently increased the rigor of our NEOs cash flow goal beginning in fiscal year 2019. The Compensation Committee believes rewarding industry-leading cash flow conversion is critical to long-term stockholder value creation. Incentivizing the conversion of earnings to cash flow places a strong emphasis on risk management and underlying project execution, which are of particularly greater importance in the Engineering and Construction ("E&C") industry. Target performance now requires 100% conversion of adjusted net income to free cash flow, versus 90% in fiscal year 2018, and exceeds the three-year median performance of the E&C industry (81%).

As more fully described in the Notice, all stockholders may choose to access our proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or may request a printed set of our proxy materials.

Internet and telephone voting will also be offered to stockholders owning shares through certain banks and brokers. 
You may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised at the 2019 Annual Meeting by (1) giving our Corporate Secretary written notice of revocation, (2) delivering to us a signed proxy card with a later date, (3) granting a subsequent proxy through the Internet or telephone or (4) attending the 2019 Annual Meeting and voting in person.

All shares represented by valid proxies received and not revoked before they are exercised will be voted in the manner specified in the proxy. Other than with respect to certain trustees who hold our shares in trust, if you submit proxy voting instructions but do not direct how to vote on each item, the persons named as proxies will vote in favor of each of the proposals. Our Board is unaware of any matters other than those described in this Proxy Statement that may be presented for action at our 2019 Annual Meeting. If other matters do properly come before our 2019 Annual Meeting, however, it is intended that shares represented by proxies will be voted in the discretion of the proxy holders. 
If you are a beneficial owner and hold your shares in the name of a bank, broker or another holder of record and do not return the voting instruction card, the broker or another nominee may vote your shares on each matter at the 2019 Annual Meeting for which he or she has the requisite discretionary authority. Under applicable rules, brokers have the discretion to vote on routine matters, which include the ratification of the selection of the independent registered public accounting firm.

   Record Date and Voting Rights    
[END TABLE]
Our Board has fixed January 9, 2019, as the record date for determining the stockholders who are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, our 2019 Annual Meeting. Only common stockholders of record at the close of business on the record date will receive notice of, and be able to vote at, our 2019 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were 156,331,779 shares of our common stock outstanding held by 2,214 record holders. A majority of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote must be present at our 2019 Annual Meeting, either in person or by proxy, in order for there to be a quorum at the meeting. Each share of our outstanding common stock entitles its holder to one vote. Shares of our common stock with respect to which the holders are present in person at our 2019 Annual Meeting but not voting, and shares for which we have received proxies but with respect to which holders of the shares have abstained, will be counted as present at our 2019 Annual Meeting for the purpose of determining whether or not a quorum exists. "Broker non-votes" will also be counted as present for the purpose of determining whether a quorum exists. Broker non-votes are shares of common stock held by brokers or nominees over which the broker or nominee lacks discretionary power to vote and for which the broker or nominee has not received specific voting instructions from the beneficial owner. 
Our Board urges you to vote promptly by either (1) electronically submitting a proxy or voting instruction card over the Internet, (2) by telephone or (3) by delivering to us or to your broker, as applicable, a signed and dated proxy card. 
Votes will be tabulated by the inspector of election appointed for the 2019 Annual Meeting, who will separately tabulate affirmative and negative votes, abstentions and broker non-votes.

   Majority Voting; Director Resignation Policy    
[END TABLE]
On November 14, 2018, the Company adopted majority voting in the uncontested election of directors and plurality voting in contested elections, commencing with the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In uncontested elections, directors will be elected by a majority of the votes cast, which means that the number of shares voted "for" a director must exceed the number of shares voted "against" that director. Commencing with the Company's 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, in uncontested elections, any director who is not elected by a majority of the votes is expected to tender his or her resignation to the Nominating/Governance Committee ("Nominating Committee"). The Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the resignation offer, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the Nominating Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the election results.     Table of Contents 
   PROPOSAL 1  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS  
We are nominating 10 directors for election to our Board, nine of whom are current members of our Board that are standing for re-election at the 2019 Annual Meeting and one new director nominee. Directors elected at the 2019 Annual Meeting will serve until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until their successors are duly elected and qualified. If a quorum is present at our 2019 Annual Meeting, the 10 nominees receiving the greatest number of votes will be elected. 
Shares represented by proxies will be voted, if authority to do so is not withheld, for the election of each of the 10 nominees named in this Proxy Statement. Each of the nominees has consented to serve as a director if elected, and management has no reason to believe that any nominee will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected as a director. In the event that any nominee is unavailable for re-election as a result of an unexpected occurrence, shares will be voted for the election of such substitute nominee as our Board may propose. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Director Qualifications    
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that, as a whole, Board members should possess a combination of the skills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee the Company's business. The Nominating Committee is responsible for developing and recommending Board membership criteria to the full Board for approval. The criteria, which are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, include the highest professional and personal ethics and values, commitment to enhancing stockholder value with sufficient time to effectively carry out his or her duties and business acumen. In considering director candidates, the Nominating Committee looks for business experience and skills, judgment, integrity, an understanding of such areas as finance, marketing, regulation and public policy and the absence of potential conflicts with the Company's interests. In particular, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates that have skills/experience in the following areas, each of which it is views as particularly important: senior leadership experience, industry experience, public/private company board experience, financial expertise, government/regulatory expertise and international expertise. The Nominating Committee believes that it is essential that Board members represent diverse viewpoints and backgrounds. 
The Nominating Committee periodically reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating Committee considers diversity, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capabilities. This periodic assessment enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board, as a whole and in individual directors, as the Company's needs evolve over time and to assess the effectiveness of efforts at pursuing diversity. From time to time, while identifying director candidates, the Nominating Committee may establish specific skills and experience that it believes the Company should seek in order to constitute a balanced and effective Board. 
The following section sets forth certain background information on the 10 nominees for election as directors as well as each individual's specific experience, qualifications and skills that led our Board to conclude that each such director nominee should serve on our Board.

      PROPOSAL 2   RATIFICATION OF SELECTION OF INDEPENDENT   REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM     
The Audit Committee of our Board has retained Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. Ernst & Young LLP has served as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm since 1990. A representative of Ernst & Young LLP is expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and will have an opportunity to make a statement if the representative so desires, and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Reasons for the Proposal    
[END TABLE]
The selection of our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to be submitted for stockholder approval, but the Audit Committee of our Board is seeking ratification of its selection of Ernst & Young LLP from our stockholders as a matter of good corporate practice. If stockholders do not ratify this selection, the Audit Committee of our Board will reconsider its selection of Ernst & Young LLP and will, in its sole discretion, either continue to retain this firm or appoint a new independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee may, in its discretion, appoint a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the fiscal year if it determines that such a change would be in the Company's best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Reasons for Recommendation to Appoint Ernst & Young as the Company's Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm    
[END TABLE]
As with previous years, the Audit Committee undertook a review of Ernst & Young LLP in determining whether to select Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019 and to recommend ratification of its selection to the Company's stockholders. In that review, the Audit Committee considered a number of factors including:
Based upon this review, the Audit Committee believes that Ernst & Young LLP is independent and that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to retain Ernst & Young LLP to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019.  Table of Contents
In accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related SEC rules, the Audit Committee limits the number of consecutive years an individual partner may serve as the lead audit engagement partner to the Company.

   PROPOSAL 3  APPROVAL OF AMENDED & RESTATED  EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN  
   Overview  
On November 14, 2018, the Board of Directors unanimously adopted and approved the Amended & Restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to increase the number of shares issuable under the ESPP by ten million shares. The Company is submitting the ESPP to stockholders for their approval at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 
   Why You Should Vote to Approve the ESPP  
The Board of Directors believes that the Company's interests are best advanced by aligning stockholder and employee interests. The ESPP is intended to provide the Company's eligible employees with an opportunity to participate in the Company's success by permitting them to acquire an ownership interest in the Company through periodic payroll deductions that will be applied towards the purchase of shares of our common stock at a discount from the market price. 
As of December 31, 2018, 1,658,677 shares remained available for issuance under the ESPP. Based upon historical levels of participation under the ESPP and assumptions about the Company's stock price, we expect the additional ten million shares will be sufficient to cover purchases under the ESPP for at least 10 years. 
The proposed additional ten million shares that the Company is seeking stockholder approval for represents potential dilution of approximately 6.4% based on the Company's 156,962,947 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Together with the 1,658,677 shares remaining available for purchase under the ESPP as of that date, the potential dilution is approximately 7.4%. In 2018, the dilution attributable to the ESPP (based on shares purchased under the plan during the year) was 0.7%. The Board of Directors believes that these dilution levels are reasonable and generally in line with that of the Company's peers. 
The following is a summary of the principal features of the ESPP. The following summary does not purport to be a complete description of all provisions of the ESPP and is qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the ESPP, which is attached to this Proxy Statement as Annex A. Stockholders are urged to read the ESPP in its entirety. Any capitalized terms which are used in this summary description but not defined here or elsewhere in this Proxy Statement have the meanings assigned to them in the ESPP. 
   ESPP Summary  
 Purpose.    The purpose of the ESPP is to encourage ownership of our common stock by all eligible employees and to align such persons' interests with the success of the Company. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. 
 Eligibility.    Most full time and part-time employees of the Company and its participating subsidiaries who are eighteen (18) years of age or older and whose customary employment is at least twenty (20) hours a week are eligible to participate in the ESPP. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 39,000 employees would have been eligible to participate in the ESPP. 
 Administration, Amendment and Termination.    The Compensation Committee administers the ESPP. Subject to the terms of the ESPP, the Compensation Committee has all discretion and authority necessary or appropriate to control and manage the operation and administration of the ESPP. The Compensation Committee may establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration of the ESPP that it considers appropriate to promote the Company's best interests, including establishing terms under which common stock may be purchased, and to ensure that the ESPP remains qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. The Compensation Committee may also adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation of the ESPP to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures, and sub-plans applicable  Table of Contents to particular subsidiaries or locations. The Compensation Committee may delegate administrative matters relating to the ESPP to the Company's officers or employees. 
The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the ESPP at any time and for any reason, provided no such action may adversely affect the participants' rights and obligations with respect to purchase rights which are at the time outstanding under the ESPP, except with the participants' consent or as necessary to comply with any laws or regulations, including Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. In addition, as required by Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, and the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") listing requirements, certain material amendments must be approved by the Company's stockholders. 
 Number of Shares of Common Stock Available under the ESPP.    A maximum of 18,000,000 shares will be available for issuance pursuant to the ESPP. Shares issued under the ESPP may be unissued shares, treasury shares or shares bought in the market. In the event there is any change in the shares of the Company through the declaration of stock dividends or a stock split-up, or through recapitalization resulting in share split-ups, or combinations or exchanges of shares, or otherwise, the Compensation Committee will make appropriate adjustments in the number of shares available for purchase under the ESPP, and the purchase price and the number of shares subject to any purchase rights which have not yet been exercised, and will take any further action that it determines in its discretion may be necessary or appropriate. 
 Enrollment and Contributions.    Eligible employees voluntarily elect whether or not to enroll in the ESPP. Unless and until the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, there will be six offering periods during each calendar year with each such offering period lasting for a two-month duration: (1) commencing on the first trading day of January and ending on the last trading day of the next following February; (2) commencing on the first trading day of March and ending on the last trading day of the next following April; (3) commencing on the first trading day of May and ending on the last trading day of the next following June; (4) commencing on the first trading day of July and ending on the last trading day of the next following August; (5) commencing on the first trading day of September and ending on the last trading day of the next following October; and (6) commencing on the first trading day of November and ending on the last trading day of the next following December. An employee may cancel his or her enrollment at any time, subject to the plan rules. 
Employees contribute to the ESPP through payroll deductions or, if payroll withholding is not permitted under local laws, through such other means as specified by the Compensation Committee. Participating employees may contribute not less than 1% and up to 10% of their eligible compensation through after-tax payroll deductions. The Compensation Committee may establish different minimum and maximum permitted contribution percentages, or change the length of the offering periods or the number of shares purchasable in an offering period. After an offering period has begun, an employee may decrease, but not increase, his or her contribution percentage, subject to ESPP rules. 
 Purchase of Shares.    On the last business day of each offering period, each participating employee's payroll deductions are used to purchase shares for the employee. Unless and until the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, the purchase price for the shares so purchased will be 88% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period. In no event will the purchase price be less than 85% of the lower of (1) the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first day of the offering period, or (2) the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the last day of the offering period. Fair market value under the ESPP means the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE for the day in question. As of December 31, 2018, the fair market value of our common stock was $26.50 per share. During any single year, no employee may purchase more than $25,000 of shares under the ESPP (based on market value on the applicable enrollment date(s)). Unless and until the Compensation Committee determines otherwise, a participant may not purchase more than 1,300 shares during any single offering period. 
 Termination of Participation.    Participation in the ESPP terminates when a participating employee's employment with the Company ceases for any reason, the employee withdraws from the ESPP, or the ESPP is terminated or amended such that the employee no longer is eligible to participate. 
 New Plan Benefits.    The actual number of shares that may be purchased by any individual under the ESPP is not determinable in advance because the number is determined, in part, on the participant elections, contributed amount and the purchase price.  Table of Contents
 U.S. Federal Taxes.    The following is a summary of the general U.S. federal income tax consequences to U.S. citizens and the Company of the purchase of shares under the ESPP. Tax consequences for any particular individual may be different. 
The ESPP, and the right of participants to make purchases thereunder, is intended to qualify under the provisions of Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended. Under these provisions, no income generally will be taxable to a participant until the shares purchased under the ESPP are sold or otherwise disposed of. Upon sale or other disposition of the shares, the participant will generally be subject to tax in an amount that depends upon how long the shares have been held by the participant. If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of more than two years after the first day of the applicable offering period in which such shares were acquired and more than one year after the applicable date of purchase, the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the lesser of (1) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such sale or disposition over the purchase price, or (2) an amount equal to 12% (or such other discount established by the Compensation Committee for the applicable offering period) of the fair market value of the shares as of the first day of the applicable offering period in which such shares were acquired. Any additional gain will be treated as long-term capital gain. If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of the aforementioned periods (a "disqualifying disposition"), the participant will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess of (1) the fair market value of the shares on the date the shares are purchased over (2) the purchase price. Any additional gain or loss on such sale or disposition will be capital gain or loss, which will be long-term if the shares are held for more than one year. The Company generally is not entitled to a deduction for amounts taxed as ordinary income or capital gain to a participant except to the extent of ordinary income recognized by participants upon a disqualifying disposition.

      PROPOSAL 4   ADVISORY RESOLUTION TO APPROVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION     
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to approve, on an advisory basis, AECOM's executive compensation as reported in this Proxy Statement. 
At AECOM, executive compensation plans are driven by both short- and long-term financial performance metrics that are designed to incentivize our NEOs to maximize long-term stockholder value creation. As such, based on direct stockholder feedback, AECOM's executives are incentivized via an annual cash bonus plan and the grant of certain long-term equity awards that include the following performance metrics: adjusted earnings per share, free cash flow per share and total stockholder return. 
We urge stockholders to read the "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" section in this Proxy Statement, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the "SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE" and related compensation tables and narrative, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our NEOs. The Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the policies, procedures and programs articulated in the "COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS" are effective in achieving our goals and that the compensation of our NEOs reported in this Proxy Statement has supported and contributed to the Company's success. 
We are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 Annual Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of AECOM (the "Company") approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers set forth in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the related compensation tables and narrative in the Proxy Statement for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. 
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "Say-on-Pay" resolution, is non-binding on the Company, the Board and the Compensation Committee and will not be construed as overruling a decision by, nor creating nor implying any additional fiduciary duty for the Company, the Board of the Directors or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results on this proposal when evaluating our executive compensation program. The Board of Directors has adopted a policy of providing for annual "Say-on-Pay" advisory votes. Unless the Board of Directors modifies its policy on the frequency of holding "Say-on-Pay" advisory votes, the next "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote will occur in 2020.

   Director Independence    
[END TABLE]
Eight of the 10 director nominees are independent directors as defined in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, David W. Joos, who is no longer a member of the Board but who served on the Board until February 28, 2018, was an independent director as defined in accordance with the listing standards of the NYSE. These standards provide that a director is independent only if our Board affirmatively determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with the Company. They also specify various relationships that preclude a determination of director independence. Material relationships may include commercial, industrial, consulting, legal, accounting, charitable, family and other business, professional and personal relationships. 
Applying these standards, our Board, upon the recommendation of our Nominating Committee, annually reviews the independence of our directors. In its most recent review, our Board considered, among other things, the employment relationships between the Company and our directors and their families; the other specific relationships that would preclude a determination of independence under the NYSE independence rules; any affiliation of the Company's directors and their families with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, compensation consultants, legal counsel and other consultants and advisors; any transactions with directors and members of their families that would require disclosure in this Proxy Statement under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules regarding related person transactions; and the modest amount of our contributions to non-profit organizations of which some of our directors or members of their families are associated. 
Our Nominating Committee and the Board determined that the following director nominees were independent as determined by the standards of the NYSE: James H. Fordyce, Senator William H. Frist, Linda Griego, Steven A. Kandarian, Dr. Robert J. Routs, Clarence T. Schmitz, Douglas W. Stotlar, General Janet C. Wolfenbarger and that David W. Joos was independent as determined by the standards of the NYSE during his term of service on the Board.

   Board Leadership Structure    
[END TABLE]
The Board has been, and continues to be, a proponent of Board independence. As a result, the Company's corporate governance structures and practices provide for a strong, independent Board and include several independent oversight mechanisms, including a lead independent director, only independent directors serving as committee chairs and the directors' and committees' ability to engage independent consultants and advisors. 
The Audit, Compensation and Nominating Committees are composed entirely of independent directors. The Nominating Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment of a lead independent director, which is appointed by the Board. 
James H. Fordyce has served and been reappointed as the lead independent director since fiscal year 2016. Mr. Fordyce brings considerable financial expertise from his past business experience as well as essential corporate governance experience from his current and prior service on private and public company boards. 
The intended purpose of establishing the position of lead independent director is to expand lines of communication between the Board and members of management. It is not intended to reduce the free and  Table of Contents open access and communications that each independent board member has with other board members and members of management. The lead independent director has the following duties:
To complement this structure, the Board believes it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer in the best interests of the Company. The Board believes that the decision as to who should serve in those roles, and whether such offices should be combined or separate, should be assessed periodically by the Board, and that the Board should not be constrained by a rigid policy mandate when making these determinations. Additionally, the Board believes that it needs to retain the ability to balance the independent Board structure with the flexibility to appoint as Chairman of the Board someone with hands-on knowledge of, and experience in, the operations of the Company. 
Effective as of our 2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board determined that the positions of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer would be held by Michael S. Burke. Mr. Burke has served as a key executive at the Company since 2005 where he gained unique insights into our business and the complex challenges we face, including being directly involved in the evolution of AECOM from a private company with approximately 22,000 employees into a public company with approximately 87,000 employees. The Board continues to believe that Mr. Burke is uniquely positioned to identify, lead and oversee the execution of our future strategic initiatives. The Board also believes that the established role of the lead independent director will continue to help ensure the effective independent functioning of the Board in fulfilling its oversight role. Therefore, in light of Mr. Burke's past tenure and his unique knowledge of the long-term goals of the Company, and because the lead independent director is empowered to play a significant role in the Board's oversight, the Board continues to believe that it is advantageous to continue to combine the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.

   Executive Sessions

   Board's Role in Risk Oversight    
[END TABLE]
The Board plays an active role, both as a whole and at the committee level, in overseeing management of the Company's risks. Management is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk-management activities. The Company relies on a comprehensive risk management process to aggregate, monitor, measure and manage risks. The risk management process is designed to enable the Board to establish a mutual understanding with management of the effectiveness of the Company's risk management practices and capabilities, to review the Company's risk exposure and to elevate certain key risks for discussion at the Board level. The full Board monitors risk through regular reports from each of the committee chairs and is apprised of particular risk  Table of Contents management matters in connection with its general oversight and approval of corporate matters, as disclosed in the below chart: 
We believe the division of risk management responsibilities described above provides an effective framework for evaluating and addressing the risks facing the Company, and that our Board leadership structure supports this approach because it allows our independent directors, through the independent committee chairs, to exercise effective oversight of the actions of management. The Strategy, Risk and Safety Committee, as well as other members of the Board, receive regular updates from the Company's Chief Information Security Officer on the overall cybersecurity risk environment including the Company's enterprise-wide cybersecurity risk assessment results and key initiatives.

   Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices    
[END TABLE]
In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee's independent consultant, Exequity LLP, conducted a risk assessment of the Company's compensation policies and practices as they apply to all employees, including executive officers. Exequity LLP reviewed the design features and performance metrics of our cash and stock-based incentive programs, along with the approval mechanisms associated with each, to determine whether any of these policies and practices could create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
As part of the review, several factors were noted that reduce the likelihood of excessive risk-taking: Table of Contents
Based on this assessment, the Company concluded that its compensation policies and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.

   Director Nominations, Board Refresh and Succession Planning    
[END TABLE]
The Nominating Committee is charged with identifying, reviewing and recommending to the Board qualified individuals to become directors and regularly assessing the size and composition of the Board and recommending any changes to the Board. The Nominating Committee also engages in succession planning for the Board and key leadership roles on the Board and its committees. 
The Nominating Committee reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of Board members in the context of the current composition of the Board, the operating requirements of the Company and the long-term interests of the Company's stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating Committee considers diversity, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capabilities. This periodic assessment enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board, as a whole and in individual directors, as the Company's needs evolve over time and to assess the effectiveness of efforts at pursuing diversity. From time to time, while identifying director candidates, the Nominating Committee may establish specific skills and experience that it believes the Company should seek to constitute a balanced and effective Board. 
It is our belief that members of the Board should have the highest professional and personal ethics and values. We believe that the Board should be comprised of individuals who are committed to enhancing stockholder value with sufficient time to effectively carry out their duties. While all directors should possess business acumen, the Board endeavors to include an array of targeted skills and experience in its overall composition. Criteria that the Nominating Committee looks for in director candidates include business experience and skills, judgment, integrity, an understanding of such areas as finance, marketing, regulation, end markets and public policy and the absence of potential conflicts with the Company's interests. In particular, the Nominating Committee seeks candidates that have skills/experience in the following areas, each of which it is views as particularly important: Table of Contents
The Nominating Committee believes that it is essential that Board members represent diverse viewpoints and backgrounds. 
Incumbent directors initially identified Mr. Kandarian as a potential director candidate. Mr. Kandarian was nominated as a director after all members of the Nominating Committee met with Mr. Kandarian and discussed his qualifications. 
Our Nominating Committee will consider stockholder nominations for directors. The Nominating Committee evaluates any such nominees that are properly submitted using the same criteria it otherwise employs, as described in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. Any recommendation submitted by a stockholder must include the same information concerning the potential candidate as is required when a stockholder wishes to nominate a candidate directly. In addition, any such recommendation must be received in the same time frame as is required by our Bylaws when a stockholder wishes to nominate a candidate directly. To be timely, the notice must be received by the close of business no fewer than 90 and no more than 120 days prior to the date of the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, in the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced more than 30 days prior to such anniversary date or delayed more than 30 days after such anniversary date, or no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be received no more than 120 days prior to the date of the annual meeting and not less than the later of the close of business (a) 90 days prior to the date of the annual meeting and (b) on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting was first made by the Company. 
To be in proper form, the notice must, as to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director, set forth all information concerning such person as would be required in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of directors in a contested election pursuant to Section 14 of the Exchange Act and all written and signed representations and all completed and signed questionnaires required pursuant to our Bylaws. In addition, as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination is being made, the notice must also state the name and address, as they appear on the Company's books, of such stockholder and such beneficial owner and the class or series and number of shares of the Company that are owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder and such beneficial owner. 
As to the stockholder giving the notice, or if the notice is on behalf of a beneficial owner on whose behalf the nomination is being made, as to such beneficial owner, and if such beneficial owner is an entity, as to each control person of such entity, the notice must state the class or series and number of shares of the Company that are owned of record and beneficially by such stockholder or beneficial owner and by any control person, a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination between such stockholder or beneficial owner and any other person and by any control person, including, without limitation, any agreements that would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 5 or Item 6 of Schedule 13D (regardless of whether the requirement to file a Schedule 13D is applicable) of the Exchange Act, and a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including, without limitation, any derivative or short positions, profit interests, options, hedging transactions, and borrowed or loaned shares) that has been entered into as of the date of the stockholder's notice by, or on behalf of, such stockholder, beneficial owner or control person, the effect or intent of which is to mitigate loss, manage risk or benefit from changes in the share price of any class or series of the Company's capital stock, or maintain, increase or decrease the voting power of the stockholder, beneficial owner or control person with respect to shares of stock of the Company. Stockholders who wish to nominate candidates for director must do so pursuant to these procedures.  Table of Contents

    Stock Ownership Guidelines for Non-Employee Directors    
[END TABLE]
Non-employee directors are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which are intended to align their interests with those of our stockholders.

   COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS ("CD&A")  
This Compensation Discussion and Analysis section outlines the compensation philosophy and decisions for the following Named Executive Officers, or NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Performance Review    
[END TABLE]
Revenue, operating cash flow and free cash flow increased in fiscal year 2018. However, profitability decreased primarily due to execution challenges on a handful of projects in the Construction Services segment and a timing related impact from a planned AECOM Capital transaction that did not close as expected prior to year end, which resulted in stock price underperformance. 
Importantly, we had many successes in fiscal year 2018 that built a foundation for continued growth, including record wins and backlog, which support our expectations for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in fiscal year 2019. Winning work and increasing the value of our backlog of future work, including a favorable mix shift to higher-margin segments, are critical elements towards achieving our five-year financial targets and stockholder value creation.

   Fiscal Year 2018 Pay for Performance    
[END TABLE]
A significant majority of our NEOs' compensation is "performance based" (i.e., subject to the accomplishment of individual and the Company's objectives) and stock based (i.e., aligned with stockholders' interests). 
    CEO Target Compensation         
   2018 Pay for Performance and Application of Committee Discretion  
For fiscal year 2018, the incentive programs for our CEO were determined by performance against adjusted EPS, operating cash flow per share, free cash flow per share, and total stockholder return targets. Our performance in fiscal year 2018 was mixed with significant increases in revenue, cash flow, wins and backlog, which were offset by a decline in profitability due to execution challenges on a handful of projects in the CS segment and the timing of an AECOM Capital sale that was expected to close in fiscal year 2018 but was delayed, which contributed to a decline in the stock price. 
Because of this varied performance, the Compensation Committee deemed it appropriate to exercise discretion and reduce the CEO's fiscal year 2018 annual cash bonus from 131.8% of target to 100% of target to best  Table of Contents align pay with performance and demonstrate organizational accountability for stockholders. As a result, year-over-year, the CEO's annual cash bonus decreased as follows:

Because equity awards comprise 74% of our CEO's total compensation, pay for performance and alignment with stockholders' interests is best exhibited in the CEO's realizable pay compared to target pay, which reflects the impact of changes in the stock price since the grant date: 
    CEO Target and Realizable Pay         
Target pay reflects base salary, target bonus and grant value of our CEO's equity awards. Realizable pay reflects base salary, actual cash bonuses paid and the realizable value of our CEO's equity awards based on a $26.50 stock price, the December 31, 2018 closing stock price. The realizable value of our CEO performance equity awards is based on actual performance of 125% for PEP16 and estimated performance of 83.7% and 86.4% for PEP17and PEP18, respectively, both reflecting TSR underperformance in fiscal years 2017 and 2018. 
   2019 Pay for Performance, Design and Rigor of Goal Enhancements  
Senior management and directors, including the Chair of the Compensation Committee, directly received and incorporated stockholder input to help inform our ongoing evaluation of our compensation plans with a focus on strengthening the link between pay and performance and best aligning management and stockholder interests.  Table of Contents
This feedback helped inform the Compensation Committee's review of plan design and the rigor of goals, leading to changes to fiscal year 2019 plan design. 
First, the Compensation Committee held flat the CEO's target pay for fiscal year 2019. 
    CEO Target Pay         
Additionally, the Compensation Committee made significant design changes to fiscal year 2019 compensation metrics to best align our incentive programs with our long-term strategy and profitable growth. Notable design changes include:
Finally, when setting goals and reviewing performance, the Compensation Committee considered numerous factors to best align pay with progress towards achieving our long-term strategy objectives and profitable growth. Specifically, in setting fiscal year 2019 metrics and goals, the Compensation Committee considered and incorporated elements from AECOM's five-year financial plan and continued to focus on incentivizing industry-leading cash flow performance. The Compensation Committee increased the rigor of its cash flow goals by setting performance targets for free cash flow at 100% of adjusted earnings per share (increased from 90%). Since the operating cash flow goal in the short-term incentive plan is directly derived from the free cash flow goal, the rigor of the operating cash flow target also increased. 
As a result of the above actions, the Compensation Committee believes our incentive programs will best incentivize NEOs and reward financial performance that is most likely to maximize stockholder value creation.  Table of Contents

Following the 2018 Annual Meeting, in which we received less than a majority vote on Say-on-Pay, we broadened our stockholder outreach to include direct engagement with directors and stockholders, whose ownership combined represent approximately 75% of shares outstanding.     Table of Contents

 What we heard              Our Response              Our Reasoning 
   Compensation/Organization Committee Outreach 
 Compensation Committee members should engage directly with stockholders                    ✓ The Compensation Committee has engaged directly with stockholders.              Direct Compensation Committee engagement with stockholders provides further opportunities to align management and stockholders' interests.

Direct Compensation Committee engagement with stockholders provides further opportunities to align management and stockholders' interests. 
 Better align Pay with Performance                    ✓ The Compensation Committee exercised discretion to reduce the CEO's fiscal year 2018 annual bonus from 131.8% to 100.0% to reflect execution challenges that led to  adjusted operating profit below plan and underperformance of the Company's stock price.              Exercising discretion to reduce the CEO's annual bonus for fiscal year 2018 better aligned pay with performance given the unique set of circumstances that negatively impacted fiscal year 2018 financial performance,  including execution challenges in the CS segment.

 Operating cash flow metrics continued to earn above 100%                    ✓ AECOM continues to deliver industry- leading cash flow performance, and performance at target levels has historically and continues to require cash flow conversion  above the median of the E&C industry. However, in response to investor feedback, beginning fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee increased the target level of the conversion rate to further enhance the rigor of the goal and to reflect  recent cash flow outperformance.              Increasing the conversion target used to determine the cash flow target continues to incentivize and reward cash flow performance that is above the median of peers and ensures management remains focused on delivering  industry-leading cash flow. 
         Long-Term Incentives (Equity Awards) 
 The equity performance awards vest in three years but certain metrics include three annual performance periods                    ✓ Revised fiscal year 2019 equity performance awards to replace three, annual performance periods with a single, three-year performance period for all financial  metrics.              Three-year cumulative metrics challenges management to focus on long-term value creation.

 The annual cash bonus and equity performance awards contain duplicative metrics                    ✓ Revised fiscal year 2019 equity performance awards to remove adjusted EPS, thus removing the duplicative metrics in our short and long-term incentive  plans.              We believe that with ROIC and free cash flow in the long-term equity incentive plan and adjusted EPS and operating cash flow in the annual cash bonus plan, management is incentivized to maximize stockholder value.

 Incentive plans should support long-term strategy                    ✓ Revised fiscal year 2019 equity performance awards to add ROIC with underlying profit growth assumptions that are consistent with our five-year financial  targets.              We believe ROIC is a strong measure of long-term profitable growth and value creation, and evidence supports the Compensation Committee's view that a company's ROIC is highly correlated with TSR. Additionally, ROIC is  superior to TSR as an incentive metric by focusing attention on driving earnings growth and working capital efficiencies while eliminating the impact of short-term stock market volatility from compensation outcomes and performance measures.

   COMPENSATION GOVERNANCE, PROCESS AND DECISIONS  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 Compensation/Organization Committee's Process    
[END TABLE]
Compensation decisions are made as part of a year-long review process: 
The Compensation Committee, which is composed solely of independent directors, has been authorized to determine and approve compensation for AECOM's executive officers. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for reviewing the compensation for the members of the Company's Board and submits any modifications for approval by the Board. 
As part of the annual compensation planning process, the Compensation Committee reviews the NEOs' base salary, as well as short-term and long-term incentive compensation, with a focus on the total reward package. The Compensation Committee looks to AECOM's compensation peer group of companies, as well as the broader market, as a baseline for compensation decisions for NEOs. However, AECOM does not target executive officer compensation at a specific level or percentage relative to compensation provided by the companies in the compensation peer group or broader market. Instead, when determining compensation for executive officers, the Compensation Committee takes into account a broad array of factors, including the experience level of the individuals in their current positions, the overall financial and strategic performance of the Company during the year and the performance and contribution of each executive during the year relative to individual, pre-defined goals and objectives. Differences in compensation levels for our NEOs are driven by the Compensation Committee's assessment, in its judgment, of each of our executive's responsibilities, experience and compensation levels for similar positions at peer companies. Except as otherwise noted in this CD&A, the Compensation Committee's determinations are subjective and the result of business judgment informed by members' experiences, analysis of peer company data, input from the independent consultant, and overall compensation trends. 
Each fiscal year, the Compensation Committee: Table of Contents
With respect to long-term incentive equity awards, the initial step in determining the awards is the Compensation Committee's determination of an overall pool for long-term incentive equity awards. This determination is based on a recommendation from the CEO, which takes into account the size of previous pools relative to the growth in the Company's earnings and in eligible employees, the accounting expense, the potential dilutive effects on stockholders and the external competitiveness of individual awards. The Compensation Committee considers market data, including compensation for comparable positions at peer companies, and the strategic importance of a position to determine the long-term incentive equity value to be awarded to each NEO. In making these decisions, the Compensation Committee takes into account the impact of the awards to the NEOs on the remaining pool available for allocation to other executives. The dollar value awarded by the Compensation Committee to each NEO is then converted into a specific number of units, based on the fair market value of AECOM common stock on the date of grant.

   2018 Compensation/Organization Committee's Independent Compensation Consultant    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain the services of outside consultants to assist it in performing its responsibilities. The Compensation Committee engaged the services of the consulting firm Exequity LLP. During fiscal year 2018, the consultant provided data on the compensation and relative performance of compensation peer group companies as well as general industry data to the Compensation Committee, made presentations on regulatory and legislative matters affecting executive compensation, provided opinions on the degree to which compensation arrangements are consistent with market practices, and consulted on other compensation matters as needed. Exequity LLP does not provide any additional services to the Company. 
The Compensation Committee has assessed the independence of Exequity LLP, considering the following six factors and other factors that it deemed relevant: (1) other services provided to the Company by Exequity LLP, (2) the amount of fees paid by the Company to Exequity LLP as a percentage of Exequity LLP's total revenue, (3) the policies or procedures maintained by Exequity LLP that are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, (4) any business or personal relationships between the individual employees of Exequity LLP involved in the engagement and a member of the Compensation Committee, (5) any AECOM stock owned by Exequity LLP's employees involved in the engagement and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and Exequity LLP or the employees of Exequity LLP involved in the engagement. Following such assessment, the Compensation Committee concluded that Exequity LLP is independent and that Exequity LLP's work raises no conflicts of interest.

   2018 Assessing Competitive Practice    
[END TABLE]
As part of its due diligence when making compensation decisions, the Compensation Committee examines pay data for a group of companies to stay current with market pay practices and trends and to understand the competitiveness of the Company's total compensation and its components of pay.  Table of Contents
Compensation peer group data is also supplemented with broader market survey data from the Aon Hewitt U.S. Total Compensation Executive survey. The Compensation Committee uses the compensation peer group and market survey data for informational purposes. The Company does not target a specific percentile or make significant pay decisions based on market data alone. The Compensation Committee considers Company performance as well as the level of responsibility, experience and tenure of the individual and performance in the role. 
Our below compensation peer group, which remains unchanged from the 2017 compensation peer group, not only includes engineering & construction and defense companies, but also companies in other industries that the Compensation Committee considered to be of similar size, international presence and complexity. The Compensation Committee, when developing the compensation peer group, identified its competitors for talent and considered other various measures of size, scope and complexity, such as industry, sales, net income, market capitalization and enterprise value. 
For fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee updated the Company's compensation peer group to replace Accenture Plc with DXC Technology since DXC Technology is a competitor for talent as a technical service provider.

   2018 Performance Measures    
[END TABLE]
AECOM used specific measures to drive and reward performance in fiscal year 2018:
In fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a pre-determined framework of adjustments to our financial results for our short-term and long-term incentive plans to the extent consistent with Section 162(m) of the Code, to ensure our executive compensation is aligned with our business performance. Generally, these adjustments may include unusual items, both positive and negative, that are inconsistent with the assumptions reflected in our financial plans. These adjustments under our formulaic framework may vary from year to year and include unplanned acquisitions and other acquisition-related matters, accounting changes and other unusual items. 
While our reported financial results are made according to GAAP for fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee concluded that for the purposes of our short-term incentive and long-term incentive equity awards, it is appropriate to use certain Non-GAAP measures which have been reconciled to their GAAP equivalent, see Annex B, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items.

    2018 Aligning Pay with Performance and Strategy    
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation program is designed to support its strategy for long-term profitable growth and stockholder value creation. With this in mind, for fiscal year 2018 the Compensation Committee selected earnings and cash flow metrics to align pay with its long-term strategy as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 Rigorous Goal Setting    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the financial, strategic and operational goals of the Company's annual financial plan when determining the financial targets for its NEOs. Financial performance goal setting is built upon a rigorous, bottom-up financial planning process across the entire organization. 
   Earnings Metrics Consistent with Financial Guidance  
For fiscal year 2018, the adjusted EPS target for the NEOs' annual cash bonus award was consistent with the Company's 2018 financial plan and consistent with financial guidance presented to investors. 
   Incentivizing Continued E&C Industry Leading Cash Flow Performance  
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee set the free cash flow per share target at 90% of its adjusted earnings per share target. Targeting 90% free cash flow conversion rates exceeds the E&C industry historical median conversion rates (81%). The operating cash flow per share goal was then derived by adding capital expenditures per share, net of proceeds from disposals, to the free cash flow per share target. 
   Aligning Pay for Performance in Fiscal Year 2018  
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee exercised discretion to reduce the CEO's annual bonus from 131.8% to 100.0% to reflect execution challenges that led to operating profit below plan and the resulting underperformance of the Company's stock price.  Table of Contents
[BEGIN TABLE]
    2019 Rigorous Goal Setting    
[END TABLE]
In response to last year's Say-on-Pay results and feedback from investors, the Compensation Committee revisited how it set its goals for the fiscal year 2019 annual incentive program. 
   Increased Rigor of Operating Cash Flow per Share Goals  
For fiscal year 2019, the Compensation Committee increased the rigor of the free cash flow per share target by setting target performance at 100% (as opposed to 90%) of its adjusted earnings per share target, which exceeds the median three-year performance of the E&C industry (81%). The operating cash flow per share goal is derived by adding capital expenditures per share, net of proceeds from disposals, to the free cash flow per share target. As a result, the rigor of the operating cash flow target also increased. The Compensation Committee believes that targets requiring the Company to outperform the historical performance of its peers maximizes long-term stockholder value. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2018 Pay for Performance    
[END TABLE]
For fiscal year 2018, the NEOs' actual bonus paid as a percentage of target bonus under the annual incentive plan declined due to financial performance that varied across metrics, which resulted in a decline in TSR. 
    Annual Cash Bonus Paid Percentage of Target         
The NEOs' annual cash bonus payouts can range from 0%, if the minimum performance threshold is not achieved, to 200% if the maximum performance standards are met or exceeded. For fiscal year 2018, our NEOs' performances were measured with the following performance metrics and weightings.     Table of Contents 
Based on the above, for Messrs. Burke and Rudd, the annual cash bonus calculation is as follows:

   Key Performance Indicator ("KPI") Assessment  
In determining each NEO's performance against their KPIs, the Compensation Committee assessed each NEO's individual performance as well as the Company's overall 2018 business performance.  Table of Contents

   Long-Term Incentive Equity Awards    
[END TABLE]
We believe that long-term equity awards enable us to deliver competitive compensation value to the NEOs at levels sufficient to attract and retain top talent while aligning their interests with that of our stockholders by incentivizing and rewarding increases in stockholder value. Long-term incentive equity awards align our NEOs' interests with those of our stockholders by linking the final value to AECOM's stock price and, for PEP awards, establishing performance metrics that drive long-term stockholder value. Because vesting is based on continued employment over three years, our long-term equity incentives not only serve to help retain our NEOs through the award vesting period but also ensure NEOs are focused on long-term value creation and building sustainable growth.

[END TABLE]
As part of its review of fiscal year 2018 performance, the Compensation Committee analyzed the role and responsibilities of each NEO, including their past and current performance history, and prevailing market practices with respect to the Company's compensation peer group and across industries. Annual equity awards were not determined based on the attainment of any particular individual, Company or third party performance metric but were instead based on a consideration of all relevant factors as applied to each NEO (taking into consideration the Compensation Committee's collective experience regarding appropriate annual equity grant levels). Based on this assessment, the Compensation Committee approved the following equity awards in fiscal year 2018:

   2018 Goal Setting    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee reviews the financial, strategic and operational goals of the Company's long-term plan when determining the financial targets for its NEOs. Financial performance goal setting is built upon a rigorous, bottom-up financial planning process across the entire organization. 
   Adjusted EPS  
The adjusted EPS target was consistent with the Company's 2018 financial plan and consistent with fiscal year 2018 financial guidance presented to investors.  Table of Contents
   Free Cash Flow per Share  
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee set the free cash flow per share targets at 90% of its adjusted earnings per share target. The target exceeds the median cash flow conversion rates of the E&C industry (81%) and appropriately challenges and rewards industry leading performance without disincentivizing prudent investments necessary to long-term earnings growth. 
   Relative TSR  
For fiscal year 2018, the Compensation Committee set the relative TSR metric target at the median of its Compensation Peer Group. The Compensation Committee noted that the Compensation Peer Group includes companies heavily weighted in the defense industry, which has significantly outperformed the S&P500 in recent years. This metric is projected to pay out at zero for PEPs granted in fiscal year 2017 and 2018. Below are the goals established for these PEPs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2019 New Metric and Increased Rigor of Goals    
[END TABLE]
In response to last year's Say-on-Pay results and feedback from investors, the Compensation Committee selected ROIC as a new performance metric with the profitability goals of the ROIC target aligned with the growth forecasts supporting the Company's five-year financial plan, which requires an improvement in ROIC from the prior three years and most-recently completed fiscal year. 
   Return on Invested Capital  
For PEP19, the ROIC target was based on a holistic approach considering multiple factors. Key factors included (1) the Company's 2019 financial plan and financial guidance presented to investors including forecasts for EBITDA and EBITDA growth rates; (2) the expected stock price performance and market cap creation if we achieved our goals; (3) improvement over the current trailing 3-year average ROIC performance; (4) continued improvement over the life of the plan; (5) returns measured against a reasonable estimate of our weighted average cost of capital; and (6) the performance and goals of our peers, where publicly available. 
   Increased Rigor of Free Cash Flow per Share Goals  
For PEP19, the Compensation Committee increased the rigor of the free cash flow per share target by setting target performance at 100% (as opposed to 90%) of its adjusted earnings per share target. Target performance at 100% conversion exceeds the three-year median performance of the E&C industry (81%). The Compensation Committee's expects to continuously challenge management to surpass its peers on a consistent basis.  Table of Contents

   Fiscal Years 2016-2018 (PEP2016)    
[END TABLE]
AECOM's PEP2016 had two one-year performance periods, the second of which ended in fiscal year 2017. Performance was measured with a 50% emphasis on adjusted EPS and a 50% emphasis on free cash flow ("FCF") per share. Given AECOM's achievement of the PEP2016 goals as disclosed in our prior Proxy Statements, NEOs received PEP2016 payouts at 125% of the target award amounts. Although the performance period for PEP2016 ended at the end of fiscal year 2017, continued employment through December 15, 2018 was required before the PEP2016 awards became vested.

   OTHER PROGRAMS, POLICIES AND GUIDELINES  
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Stock Ownership Guidelines for Named Executive Officers    
[END TABLE]
NEOs are subject to stock ownership guidelines, which helps to ensure that their interests are aligned with those of stockholders. Under the guidelines, AECOM's CEO is required to maintain ownership of AECOM stock at six times base salary and the other NEOs at three times base salary. The minimum number of shares required to meet the guideline is updated annually based on each executive's salary and the 12-month trailing average AECOM stock price. Shares owned directly and indirectly, unvested PEP units and other restricted stock units and vested stock options/shares are counted toward the guidelines. Executives have five full fiscal years, starting from the date an executive is first subject to the guidelines, to comply. 
The following table outlines the stock ownership of AECOM's NEOs as of September 30, 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Named Executive Officers       Guideline —   Salary Multiple       Actual —   Salary Multiple

   Benefit, Retirement and Perquisite Programs    
[END TABLE]
To protect the Company's executives' health and well-being, facilitate the operation of the business, assist in the retention of current executives and aid in the recruitment of new executives, AECOM's NEOs are eligible to participate in benefit plans that are available to a substantial amount of all employees, including participation in retirement plans, medical insurance, dental insurance, life insurance and disability insurance programs. Further, the Company offers certain additional benefits only to executive officers and other senior officers, where applicable, which consist of the following:  Table of Contents
Pursuant to this Security Arrangement, the Board requires that the CEO use private air travel for purposes of security, rapid availability and communications connectivity. This program is not designed to provide a personal benefit (other than the intended security). If, as a result, the CEO uses private air travel for personal reasons, then the reported amount is calculated at the aggregate incremental cost. 
We regularly review the nature of the threat and associated vulnerabilities with law enforcement and security specialists and will continue to revise our security program as appropriate. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Change in Control Provisions, Severance Benefits and Employment Agreements    
[END TABLE]
Effective March 5, 2009, the Company adopted the AECOM Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives. The policy was created to provide severance benefits to key executives and to make certain that those executives would remain focused on stockholder interests in the event of a corporate transaction or in connection with a change in control of the Company. 
The policy provides for the following benefits upon termination without Cause or for Good Reason following a Change in Control (as such terms are defined in the policy) ("double trigger" for cash and equity):
The policy does not provide a gross-up for excise or other taxes. 
The Company also entered into agreements with Messrs. Burke and Wotring that provide certain severance benefits to them in the event of an involuntary termination that is not covered by the Change in Control Severance Policy. A summary of the key terms of these agreements, as well as additional details, can be found under the "PAYMENTS AND BENEFITS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL" section of this Proxy Statement.

    Clawback Provisions    
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee maintains a clawback policy applicable to all current and former Section 16 officers that will apply if there is an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws. The Company is authorized to recover a portion of the incentive awards paid to current or former executive officers during the three full fiscal years prior to the date of the covered event.

   Hedging and Pledging    
[END TABLE]
The Company's insider trading policy prohibits all directors, executive officers (as defined by Section 16 of the Exchange Act) and certain other employees designated as insiders from engaging in any hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward-sale contracts, involving Company securities.  Table of Contents
In addition, the policy prohibits buying shares on margin and the pledging of Company securities by NEOs except in certain limited circumstances subject to Company approval and demonstration of the NEO's ability to repay the applicable loan without selling such securities. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Tax Treatment    
[END TABLE]
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes limitations on the deductibility for corporate federal income tax purposes of remuneration in excess of $1 million paid to the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and each of the three next most highly compensated executive officers of a public company. Prior to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law on December 22, 2017, compensation that satisfied conditions set forth under Section 162(m) to qualify as "performance-based compensation" was not subject to the limitation, and the limitation did not apply to compensation paid to the Chief Financial Officer. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act eliminated the performance-based compensation exception beginning January 1, 2018, but provided a transition rule with respect to remuneration provided pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and not materially modified after that date. 
We monitor the application of Section 162(m) and the associated Treasury regulations on an ongoing basis and the advisability of qualifying executive compensation for deductibility. Notwithstanding the repeal of the exemption for "performance-based compensation," the Compensation Committee intends to maintain its commitment to structuring the Company's executive compensation programs in a manner designed to align pay with performance.

    Pension Benefits for Fiscal Year 2018    
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth information with respect to the present value of the accumulated pension benefits for the NEOs during fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. In October 2014, AECOM acquired URS' Federal Services Division (the "Management Services business segment") which maintained a tax-qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan under which certain Management Services business segment employees receive annual retirement benefits at the employee's normal retirement age, which is calculated based on the employee's year of birth.

[END TABLE]
 Table of Contents noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan, under which certain eligible Management Services business segment employees receive annual retirement benefits at the employee's normal retirement age, which is calculated based on the employee's year of birth. The plan's benefit formula is integrated with Social Security and is based on the participant's years of service for the Company and career average compensation. For purposes of the plan, compensation generally means regular base salary (including deferrals made under our 401(k) plan, Section 125 flexible benefit plan and qualified transportation fringe benefit plan), commissions and severance pay, but excludes bonus, overtime pay, incentive pay reimbursements or other expense allowances or other adjustments, fringe benefits and any other type of special or nonrecurring pay. The employees who were eligible to participate were those employees who were hired by the Management Services business segment prior to June 30, 2003, and who were not in a position covered under certain contracts or in a unit of employment covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. Participants become 100% vested in their accrued benefits upon the earlier of (i) five years of service or (ii) attainment of age 45 while employed by the Management Services business segment. A participant will receive his or her normal retirement benefit upon attainment of his or her normal retirement age, which is based upon the applicable social security retirement age (which for Mr. Wotring is approximately age 66 and for Mr. Vollmer is approximately age 67), unless early retirement benefits are elected within 10 years of normal retirement age for a participant with at least 10 years of service at termination. A participant may postpone the receipt of his normal retirement benefit after attainment of normal retirement age if the participant continues working for the Management Services business segment. The plan was frozen effective January 31, 2016.

   Executive Nonqualified Deferred Compensation for Fiscal Year 2018    
[END TABLE]
The following table sets forth information with respect to activity in the AECOM Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ("EDCP") during fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. The EDCP is a non-qualified plan that enables eligible employees to defer compensation that they might otherwise have contributed to the tax-qualified RSP. Participants were allowed to defer the same elements of base salary into the EDCP as are allowed to be deferred under the RSP. The EDCP also allowed for sign-on bonuses and annual incentive bonuses to be deferred. Up to 50% of base salary and 100% of any eligible bonus may be deferred into the EDCP. The EDCP offers a fixed rate of return, which will be determined each year.

   Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives    
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to the AECOM Technology Corporation Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives, the NEOs in the table below will receive the following benefits in connection with a Change in Control:
Additional details regarding the Company's Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives are provided below: Table of Contents covering the executive; or (iv) the transfer of the executive's primary workplace by more than 50 miles from the executive's then-existing primary workplace; provided, however, that in each case, the executive resigns within 30 days after the expiration of the Company's cure period referred to above. 
   Michael S. Burke Letter Agreements  
Pursuant to a letter agreement dated March 6, 2014 between the Company and Mr. Burke, in addition to Mr. Burke's participation in the Company's Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives, in the event that his employment is terminated (i) by the Company for any reason other than "Cause" (as defined in the policy) or his death or disability or (ii) by Mr. Burke for "Good Reason" (as defined in the policy), and such termination does not occur within the "protection period" (as defined in the policy) then, the Company will pay to Mr. Burke his accrued compensation, a pro-rata portion of the annual cash incentive award he would have received for the fiscal year in which employment terminates (based on the Company's actual performance over the entire year and the number of full months of actual service during such fiscal year), a lump-sum cash payment equal to two times the sum of his base salary plus the average annual cash incentive award he earned for the three fiscal years preceding the fiscal year in which such termination occurs, twenty-four months of COBRA coverage premiums, and additional vesting of then-outstanding equity awards as follows: 
In addition, in the event of a termination due to Mr. Burke's retirement, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in an award agreement, Mr. Burke will be entitled to full vesting of the then-unvested portion of any award granted in conjunction with or following his promotion to CEO, as if he had remained employed through the end of each applicable vesting period (and based on actual performance). For this purpose, the letter agreement between the Company and Mr. Burke defines retirement to include Mr. Burke's voluntary termination of employment after attaining the age of 60 or his resignation at any time if the Board determines, in its sole discretion, that an adequate succession is in place and that Mr. Burke and the Board mutually agree that his separation from service is in the best interests of AECOM. Any and all severance payments or benefits provided under the letter agreement are contingent upon the execution of a general release. 
On May 8, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement to allow Mr. Burke and his eligible dependents to receive certain post-employment health insurance benefits (the "Amended Letter Agreement"). The Amended Letter Agreement, which updated the terms and conditions of Mr. Burke's post-employment insurance benefits as set forth in the 2014 letter agreement, provides that in the event Mr. Burke is terminated by AECOM for any reason other than Cause, or by Mr. Burke for Good Reason, Retirement or Total and Permanent Disablement (each a "Status Change"), then AECOM shall extend health plan coverage and pay insurance premiums for a period of 24 months to Mr. Burke and his eligible dependents (the "Eligible Dependents"). Health plan coverage will be provided at the expense of Mr. Burke and/or the Eligible Dependents commencing twenty-five months after a Status Change. AECOM's obligation to provide health plan coverage to Mr. Burke and any of the Eligible Dependents will cease when Mr. Burke or any of the Eligible Dependents becomes eligible for comparable health insurance coverage at another employer or any of the Eligible Dependents becomes ineligible for coverage under the Company's health insurance plans. 
   Employment Agreement — Randall A. Wotring  
In addition to Mr. Wotring's participation in the Company's Change in Control Severance Policy for Key Executives, the Company and Mr. Wotring also entered into an employment agreement on January 1, 2015 (the "Wotring Employment Agreement"). According to the terms of the Wotring Employment Agreement, if Mr. Wotring voluntarily resigns his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the Wotring Employment Agreement) or if the Company terminates Mr. Wotring's employment without Cause (as defined in the Wotring  Table of Contents
Employment Agreement), then Mr. Wotring shall be entitled to an amount equal to one times Mr. Wotring's base salary in effect immediately prior to the termination date as well as twelve months of paid COBRA coverage premiums and long-term disability and term life insurance coverage. 
   Regular U.S. Severance Policy  
Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations of the Company's U.S. severance program, regular full-time and regular part-time fixed-schedule employees are eligible for severance pay if their employment in the U.S. is terminated or their status is converted to part-time for reasons the Company determines, in its discretion, to be severance-qualifying under the following circumstances: lack of work, reorganization or restructuring of a unit or group, reduction in force, or elimination of job or position. Employees who are offered a comparable position with a successor, vendor, contractor, or customer or who decline a reasonable opportunity for an internal transfer are not eligible for severance. The Company retains the right to amend or terminate its severance pay plan at any time without advance notice. 
Severance benefits are computed on the basis of the employee's base rate of pay, regular full-time or part-time fixed classification, most recent date of hire and regular work schedule at the time of termination, excluding all other types of compensation, such as overtime, shift differential or other salary uplifts, bonuses, commissions and incentives. NEOs are eligible for 12 weeks of base pay regardless of years of service. 
   Long-Term Incentive Equity  
Pursuant to the terms of each of the restricted stock unit and PEP awards ("Long-Term Incentive Equity" in the tables below) held by our NEOs, upon the date of a termination of the executive's employment as a result of death or disability, all unvested restricted stock unit and PEP awards will vest in full. Disability means the inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months. Upon the date of a termination of the executive's employment as a result of Retirement, a pro rata vesting portion of then unvested restricted stock unit and PEP awards will vest. The proration will be calculated as a percentage where the denominator is the number of months in the performance cycle of the relevant award and the numerator is the number of whole months from the beginning date of the performance cycle through the date of the executive's termination.

To determine our median compensated employee, we used a Consistently Applied Compensation Measure (CACM). As our CACM, we used Annual Base Compensation, defined as base salary rate taking into account the employee's full-time or part-time status and the employee's scheduled hours of employment, plus any guaranteed 13th month period pay, as of the Determination Date. We exchanged non-U.S. compensation to US dollars applying the same fixed annual exchange rate used in our filed periodic reports. 
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.

      DIRECTORS' COMPENSATION     
The following table sets forth information with respect to the compensation that certain members of the AECOM Board received in fiscal year 2018. Mr. Burke is an employee and did not receive separate compensation for Board member activities. In addition, Mr. Tishman was an employee during part of fiscal year 2018 for which he did not receive separate compensation for Board member activities. Generally, the annual aggregate dollar value of equity-based and cash compensation granted under our Amended and Restated 2016 Stock Incentive Plan or otherwise to any non-employee director may not exceed $600,000. 
All non-employee directors are paid a retainer of $100,000 per year. In addition, these non-employee directors receive the following retainers for their service on the Board:
Each non-employee director also receives a $1,000 fee per day, plus reimbursement for travel for attendance at other qualifying Board-related functions in his or her capacity as a Director. 
Each non-employee director receives an annual long-term equity award of $160,000 composed 100% of time-vested restricted stock units. Each non-employee director who joins our Board receives an annual long-term equity award pro-rated for the number of quarters he or she serves. In November 2018, Exequity presented a report to the Compensation Committee concluding that the total compensation for non-employee directors approximated the median of our compensation peer group and the broader market (S&P 500).

      REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS     
The Audit Committee is comprised of three non-employee directors, all of whom are "independent" under the applicable listing standards of the NYSE and the applicable rules of the SEC. The Audit Committee is governed by a written charter, as amended and restated, which has been adopted by the Board. A copy of the current Audit Committee Charter is available for viewing on the "Corporate Governance" area of the "Investors" section of our website at www.aecom.com 
Management of the Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of the consolidated financial statements, maintaining a system of internal controls and having appropriate accounting and financial reporting principles and policies. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for planning and carrying out an audit of the consolidated financial statements and an audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and expressing an opinion as to the consolidated financial statements' conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and as to internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors and oversees these processes and is responsible for selecting and overseeing the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
As part of the oversight process, the Audit Committee met five times during fiscal year 2018. Throughout the year, the Audit Committee met with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, management and internal auditors, both together and separately in closed sessions, to review accounting, auditing, internal controls and financial reporting matters. In the course of fulfilling its responsibilities, the Audit Committee did, among other things, the following: Table of Contents
The Audit Committee also met with representatives of management, the internal auditors, legal counsel and the Ernst & Young LLP on a regular basis throughout the year to discuss the progress of management's testing and evaluation of the Company's system of internal control over financial reporting in response to the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. At the conclusion of this process, the Audit Committee received from management its assessment and report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee received from Ernst & Young LLP its attestation report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. These assessments and reports are as of September 30, 2018. The Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the results of management's assessment and Ernst & Young LLP's attestation. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Audit Committee also approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accountants for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and recommended that the Board submit this appointment to the Company's stockholders for ratification at the 2019 Annual Meeting.

"Eligible Employee" means an Employee eligible to participate in the Plan under the terms of Section 6.

Reg. § 1.421-1(h). 
"Offering Period" means a period during which contributions may be made toward the purchase of Common Stock under the Plan, as determined pursuant to Section 6.

   STOCK SUBJECT TO THE PLAN  
Subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Section 8, the total number of shares of Common Stock which may be issued under the Plan is 18,000,000, which may be unissued shares, treasury shares or shares bought on the market. 
   ADMINISTRATION  
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee. The Committee may delegate administrative matters relating to the Plan (for the avoidance of doubt, including its authority under Sections 3(l) and 5(b)(i) of this Plan, but excluding its authority under Section 5(b)(ii) of this Plan), to such of the Company's officers or employees as the Compensation Committee so determines. 
The Plan Administrator shall have the plenary power, subject to and within the limits of the express provisions of the Plan: 
to construe and interpret the Plan and to establish, amend, and revoke rules and regulations for its administration, including determining all questions of policy and expediency that may arise, and correcting any defect, supplying any omission, reconciling any inconsistency and interpreting or resolving any ambiguity in the Plan or in any instrument associated with the Plan in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or appropriate to the operation of the Plan; and to the extent not provided in this Plan, to establish the terms under which Common Stock may be purchased, including but not limited to: the purchase price of Common Stock, the commencement date of an Offering Period, the duration of an Offering Period, the number of Offering Periods per year, the minimum and maximum amount of contributions allowable per Participant in an Offering Period, and the number of shares purchasable in an Offering Period. 
The Plan Administrator may adopt rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Plan Administrator is specifically authorized to adopt rules and procedures regarding handling of payroll deductions or other contributions by Participants, payment of interest, conversion of local currency, data privacy security, payroll tax, withholding procedures and handling of stock certificates which vary with local requirements; however, if such varying provisions are not in accordance with the provisions of Section 423(b) of the Code, including but not limited to the requirement of Section 423(b)(5) of the Code that all options granted under the Plan shall have the same rights and privileges unless otherwise provided under the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder, then the individuals affected by such varying provisions shall be deemed to be participating under a sub-plan and not in the Plan. 
The Plan Administrator may adopt sub-plans applicable to particular Subsidiaries or locations, which sub-plans may be designed to be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code and shall be deemed to be outside the scope of Section 423 of the Code unless the terms of the sub-plan provide to the contrary. The rules of such sub-plans may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Section 4, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan, the provisions of this Plan shall govern the operation of such sub-plan. The Plan Administrator shall not be required to obtain the approval of stockholders prior to the adoption, amendment or termination of any sub-plan unless required by the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in which Eligible Employees participating in the sub-plan are located. 
   ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION  
The persons eligible to participate in the Plan (Eligible Employees) shall consist of all Employees of the Company and/or a Subsidiary whose customary employment is at least 20 hours per week. 
Unless and until the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, there will be six Offering Periods during each calendar year with each such Offering Period lasting for a 2-month duration: (1) commencing on the first trading 
A-2
Table of Contents day of January and ending on the last trading day of the next following February; (2) commencing on the first trading day of March and ending on the last trading day of the next following April; (3) commencing on the first trading day of May and ending on the last trading day of the next following June; (4) commencing on the first trading day of July and ending on the last trading day of the next following August; (5) commencing on the first trading day of September and ending on the last trading day of the next following October; and (6) commencing on the first trading day of November and ending on the last trading day of the next following December. In order to participate in the Plan for a particular Offering Period, an Eligible Employee must complete the required enrollment forms and file such forms with the Plan Administrator or its designee no later than the due date prescribed by the Plan Administrator. The enrollment forms will include a payroll deduction authorization directing the Company to make payroll deductions from the Participant's Compensation, designated in whole percentages, at a rate of not less than one percent (1%) of such Compensation and not to exceed ten percent (10%) of such Compensation per pay period unless and until, in each case, the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, for purposes of acquiring Common Stock under the Plan. A Participant may discontinue his or her participation in the Plan as provided in Section 7(d), or may decrease (but not increase) the rate of his or her payroll deductions during the Offering Period by completing or filing with the Company a new enrollment form authorizing a change in payroll deduction rate. The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, limit the number of deduction rate changes during any Offering Period. The change in rate shall be effective with the first full payroll period following five (5) business days after the Company's receipt of the new deduction authorization form unless the Company elects to process a given change in participation more quickly. Unless the Plan Administrator provides otherwise, a Participant's deduction authorization will continue in effect from Offering Period to Offering Period, unless the Participant ceases participation in the Plan or elects a different rate by filing the appropriate form with the Plan Administrator on the due date designated by the Plan Administrator prior to the first day of the Offering Period for which the new rate is to become effective. Payroll deductions, however, will automatically cease upon termination of the Participant's right to purchase Common Stock under this Plan. 
Each Participant will receive statements, at least annually, which set forth the following: 
the amount of the Participant's contributions to the Plan, the amount of the contributions applied to the purchase of Common Stock, and the purchase price per share at which Common Stock was purchased and the number of shares so purchased. 
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS  
An Eligible Employee who participates in this Plan for a particular Offering Period will have the right to acquire Common Stock upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Plan, and must enter into an agreement (which may be the payroll deduction authorization) with the Company setting forth such terms and conditions and such other provisions, not inconsistent with the Plan, as the Plan Administrator may deem advisable. 
PURCHASE PRICE.    Unless and until the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, the purchase price per share for an Offering Period will be eighty-eight percent (88%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the last day of the Offering Period. In no event shall the purchase price be less than the lesser of (i) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the Offering Period commences or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of the Common Stock on the last day of the Offering Period. The fair market value of a share of Common Stock on any relevant date shall be the closing price of the Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date in question (or if there shall be no trading on such date, then on the first previous date on which there is trading). 
NUMBER OF SHARES.    The number of shares purchasable per Participant per Offering Period will be the number of shares obtained by dividing the amount collected from the Participant through payroll deductions during that Offering Period by the purchase price in effect for such Offering Period. Subject to Section 7(k), unless and until the Plan Administrator determines otherwise, the maximum number of shares that may be purchased by an Eligible Employee with respect to an Offering Period is 1,300 shares. 
PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS.    The amounts collected from a Participant through payroll deductions will be credited to the Participant's individual account maintained on the Company's books, but no separate account will actually be established to hold such amounts. Interest will not be credited or paid on any amounts held for, 
A-3
Table of Contents credited or recorded, refunded or otherwise paid over to, for or on behalf of a Participant. The amounts collected from each Participant may be commingled with the general assets of the Company and may be used for any corporate purpose. 
TERMINATION OF PURCHASE RIGHTS.    A Participant may, through notification to the Plan Administrator or its designee by the due date specified by the Plan Administrator prior to the close of the Offering Period, terminate his or her outstanding purchase right and receive a refund of the amounts deducted from his or her earnings under the terminated right. The Participant will not be eligible to rejoin the Offering Period following the termination of the purchase right and will have to re-enroll in the Plan in accordance with the requirements outlined in Section 6 should he or she wish to resume participation in a subsequent Offering Period. 
TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.    If a Participant ceases to be an Employee for any reason during an Offering Period, his or her outstanding purchase right will immediately terminate and all sums previously collected from the Participant under the terminated right will be refunded. 
EXERCISE.    Each outstanding purchase right will be exercised automatically as of the last day of the Offering Period. The exercise of the purchase right is to be effected by applying the amount credited to each Participant's account on the last day of the Offering Period to the purchase of a number of whole shares of Common Stock at the purchase price in effect for the Offering Period. No purchase rights granted under the Plan may be exercised to any extent unless the shares of Common Stock to be issued upon such exercise under the Plan are covered by an effective registration statement pursuant to the Securities Act and the Plan is believed by the Plan Administrator to be in material compliance with all applicable federal, state, foreign, and other securities and other laws applicable to the Plan. If, on the purchase date during any Offering Period hereunder the shares of Common Stock are not so registered or the Plan is not in such compliance, no purchase rights granted under the Plan or any Offering Period shall be exercisable on such purchase date. If, on the purchase date under any Offering Period hereunder, the shares of Common Stock are not registered and the Plan is not in such compliance, purchase rights granted under the Plan which are not in compliance shall not be exercisable and all payroll deductions and/or other contributions accumulated during the Offering Period shall be refunded to the Participants, unless the Plan Administrator determines to extend the Offering Period. The provisions of this Section 7(f) shall comply with the requirements of Section 423(b)(5) of the Code to the extent applicable. 
PRORATION OF PURCHASE RIGHT.    Should the total number of shares of Common Stock for which the outstanding purchase rights are to be exercised on any particular date exceed the number of shares then available for issuance under the Plan, the available shares will be allocated pro-rata on a uniform and non-discriminatory basis, and any amounts credited to the accounts of Participants will, to the extent not applied to the purchase of Common Stock, be promptly refunded. 
RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER.    A Participant will have no rights as a stockholder with respect to shares subject to any purchase right held by such individual under the Plan until that right is exercised and Common Stock is credited to the Participant's account. No adjustments will be made for any dividends or distributions for which the record date is prior to such date. 
RECEIPT OF STOCK.    As soon as practicable after the end of the Offering Period, the Participant will be entitled to receive either a stock certificate for the number of purchased shares or confirmation from a broker designated by the Company that the Participant's account at the broker has been credited with the number of purchased shares. 
ASSIGNABILITY.    No purchase right granted to a Participant will be assignable or transferable and a purchase right will be exercisable only by the Participant. 
LIMITATIONS.    Payroll deductions for purchase rights during a calendar year shall cease when such deductions for a Participant exceed $25,000 (or such other maximum as may be prescribed from time to time by the Code) in accordance with the provisions of Section 423(b)(8) of the Code. No Participant shall be granted a right to purchase Common Stock under this plan: 
if such Participant, immediately after his or her election to purchase the Common Stock, would own stock possessing more than five percent of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or its parent or subsidiary, computed in accordance with Section 423(b)(3) of the Code; or 
A-4
Table of Contents if under the terms of the Plan the rights of the Participant to purchase stock under this and all other qualified employee stock purchase plans of the Company would accrue at a rate which exceeds $25,000 of fair market value of the Common Stock (determined at the time such right is granted) for each calendar year for which such right is outstanding at any time. 
NO RIGHT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT.    Nothing in this Plan or in any purchase right under the Plan shall confer on any Employee any right to continue in the employment of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or to interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate his or her employment at any time. 
   ADJUSTMENT IN NUMBER OF SHARES AND IN PURCHASE PRICE  
In the event there is any change in the shares of the Company through the declaration of stock dividends or a stock split-up, or through recapitalization resulting in share split-ups, or combinations or exchanges of shares, or otherwise, the Committee shall make appropriate adjustments in the number of shares available for purchase under the Plan, as well as the shares subject to purchase rights and purchase price thereof, and shall take any further actions which, in the exercise of its discretion, may be necessary or appropriate under the circumstances, and its determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. 
   AMENDMENT OF THE PLAN.  
The Committee at any time, and from time to time, may amend the Plan, provided, that no amendment will be made without shareholder approval, where such approval is required under Section 423 of the Code or other applicable laws or regulations, including the rules and regulations of any applicable securities exchange. 
The rights and obligations with respect to purchase rights at any time outstanding under the Plan may not be altered or impaired by any amendment of the Plan, except (i) with the consent of the person to whom such purchase rights were granted, (ii) as necessary to comply with any laws or regulations, or (iii) as necessary to ensure that the Plan and/or purchase rights granted under the Plan comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. 
   TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION OF PLAN  
The Committee may at any time suspend or terminate the Plan, but no such action may adversely affect the Participants' rights and obligations with respect to purchase rights which are at the time outstanding under the Plan, except (i) with the consent of the person to whom such purchase rights were granted, (ii) as necessary to comply with any laws or regulations, or (iii) as necessary to ensure that the Plan and/or purchase rights granted under the Plan comply with the requirements of Section 423 of the Code. No Offering Period may commence while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. 
   GOVERNING LAW  
To the extent not preempted by federal law, the Plan shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware. 
   EFFECTIVE DATE  
This Plan was originally adopted by the Board on December 3, 2009, subject to approval by the Company's stockholders in accordance with Section 423 of the Code.

   Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Items    
[END TABLE]
Our proxy contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). In particular, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted net income and free cash flow per share provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted net income to exclude the impact of prior acquisitions and dispositions. We use free cash flow to represent the cash generated after capital expenditures to maintain our business. Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
