 About the Meeting (FAQs) 
ABOUT THE MEETING (FAQs) 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE 2019 ANNUAL MEETING AND VOTING 
Why am I receiving this proxy statement? 
This proxy statement contains information related to the solicitation of proxies for use at our Annual Meeting, to be held at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at the offices of Bank of America Conference Center, 114 West 47th Street, 1st Floor, New York, New York 10036, for the purposes stated in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This solicitation is made by Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. on behalf of our Board. This Proxy Statement, the enclosed proxy card and our 2018 annual report to stockholders ("Annual Report") are first being mailed to stockholders on or about March 27, 2019. 
Who is entitled to vote at the annual meeting? 
Only holders of record of our Class A common stock, $0.01 par value ("common stock") at the close of business on March 19, 2019, the Record Date for the Annual Meeting, are entitled to receive notice of the annual meeting and to vote at the meeting. Our common stock constitutes the only classes of securities entitled to vote at the meeting. 
What are the voting rights of stockholders? 
Holders of our common stock vote together on all proposals for consideration at the annual meeting. Each holder of our common stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled to one vote per share on each proposal to be voted on. 
Who can attend the annual meeting? 
All holders of our common stock at the close of business on March 19, 2019, the Record Date for the annual meeting, or their duly appointed proxies, are authorized to attend the annual meeting. If you attend the meeting, you may be asked to present valid picture identification, such as a driver's license or passport, before being admitted. Cameras, recording devices and other electronic devices will not be permitted at the meeting. 
Please also note that if you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, your shares are held through a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee), you will need to bring a copy of a recent bank or brokerage statement evidencing your ownership of our common stock as of the Record Date. 
What will constitute a quorum at the annual meeting? 
The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of holders of our common stock entitled to cast a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting will constitute a quorum. We will include abstentions and broker non-votes in the calculation of the number of votes considered to be present and entitled to vote at the meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. Under applicable New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules (the exchange on which shares of our common stock are traded), brokers holding shares of our common stock for beneficial owners in nominee or "street name" must vote those shares according to the specific instructions they receive from the beneficial owners. However, brokers or nominees holding shares for a beneficial owner who do not receive voting instructions from the beneficial owner may not under the NYSE's rules have discretionary voting power on non-routine matters. In these cases, if no specific voting instructions are provided by the beneficial owner, the broker may not vote on non-routine proposals. This results in what is known as a "broker non-vote." 
Broker non-votes may arise in the context of voting for the election of directors and on the advisory vote regarding "say-on-pay frequency" described in this proxy statement, because such proposals are considered non-routine matters. Unless specific voting instructions are provided by the beneficial owner, the broker will be unable to vote for the election of directors and on the "say-on-pay frequency" proposal. Accordingly, we urge stockholders who hold their shares through a broker or other nominee to provide voting instructions so that your shares of common stock may be voted on these proposals. 
The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 is a matter considered routine under applicable NYSE rules. A broker or other nominee may generally vote on routine matters and, therefore, no broker non-votes are expected to exist in connection with this proposal.  About the Meeting (FAQs) 
As of the Record Date, there were 128,513,280 shares of our common stock outstanding. 
How do I vote shares that are held in my name? 
If your shares of common stock are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you may vote by any of the following means: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Internet: You may vote by internet by visiting the applicable voting website and following the on-screen instructions.  
• Telephone: You may vote by telephone by calling  1-800-proxies in the United States and +1 (718) 921-8500 in foreign countries.  
• Mail: You may vote by mail by completing and signing your proxy card and returning it in the enclosed, prepaid and  addressed envelope.  
• In Person at the Annual Meeting: You may vote by attending the meeting and voting in person  
[END TABLE]
How do I vote my shares that are held by my broker? 
If your shares are held by a bank, broker, trustee or other nominee, you should follow the instructions provided to you by the bank or broker. Although most banks and brokers offer voting by mail, telephone and on the Internet, availability and specific procedures will depend on their voting arrangements and will be included in the voter instruction form. 
How are votes counted? 
Proxies submitted properly by one of the methods discussed above and not subsequently revoked, will be voted as directed by you. If your properly signed proxy does not provide specific voting instructions, the persons designated as proxy holders on the proxy card will vote (1) "FOR" each nominee for director, (2) "EVERY YEAR" on the advisory vote recommending the frequency of the advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers, (3) "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and (4) as recommended by our Board with regard to any other matters that may properly come before the meeting, or, if no such recommendation is given, in such proxy holder's own discretion. 
May I revoke my vote after I return my proxy card? 
Yes. You may revoke a previously granted proxy at any time before it is exercised by (i) filing with David A. Palamé, our General Counsel and Secretary, a notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or (ii) attending the meeting and voting in person. Attendance at the meeting alone will not act to revoke a prior proxy. Notices of revocation or later dated proxies should be sent to the following address: David A. Palamé, General Counsel and Secretary, Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc., 590 Madison Ave., 34th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
Who pays the costs of soliciting proxies? 
We will pay the costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to soliciting proxies by mail, our officers, directors and other employees, without additional compensation, may solicit proxies personally or by other appropriate means. It is anticipated that banks, brokers, fiduciaries, custodians and nominees will forward proxy soliciting materials to their principals, and that we will reimburse such persons' out-of-pocket expenses. We have retained D.F. King & Co., Inc. at an aggregate estimated cost of $10,000, plus out-of-pocket expenses, to assist in the solicitation of proxies. 
How many votes are required to approve the proposals? 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the total votes cast for and against such nominee at a meeting duly called and at which a quorum is present is required for the election of a director, unless there is a contested election, in which case directors shall be elected by a plurality of votes cast at a meeting. For purposes of the foregoing, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares that are cast and are voted "for" the election of a director must exceed the number of shares that are cast and are voted "against" the election of a director. In any uncontested election of a director, any incumbent director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast with respect to the election of such director shall tender his or her resignation within three (3) days after certification of the results, in accordance with the Company's written corporate governance guidelines. For purposes of the election of directors, pursuant to our organizational documents and Maryland state law, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum.  About the Meeting (FAQs) 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required for approval, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of holding the say-on-pay vote in the future. Because stockholders have several voting choices, it is possible that no single choice will receive a majority of the votes cast. In the event no option receives a majority of the votes cast, the option receiving the most votes cast on the proposal will be deemed the preferred option of stockholders. For purposes of the vote on this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes, if any, will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting is required for approval of the ratification of the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. For purposes of the foregoing, a majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares that are cast and are voted "for" the resolution must exceed the number of shares that are cast and are voted "against" the resolution. For purposes of the vote on this proposal, pursuant to our organizational documents and Maryland state law, abstentions will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
What are the Board's recommendations? 
The Board's recommendations are set forth together with the description of each item in this proxy statement. In summary, the Board recommends a vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Proposal 1: FOR the election of directors each of the nominees specified in this proxy statement;   
• Proposal 2: EVERY YEAR on the non-binding advisory vote on the  frequency of the advisory vote on compensation for our named executive officers; and

 Company Overview 
COMPANY OVERVIEW 
OUR BUSINESS 
Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc. is a commercial real estate ("CRE") credit real estate investment trust ("REIT") focused on originating, acquiring, financing and managing a diversified portfolio consisting primarily of CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, debt securities and net leased properties predominantly in the United States. The Company is focused on consistently providing attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders primarily through cash distributions and the preservation of invested capital, and secondarily through capital appreciation. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 160 investments representing approximately $8.4 billion in book value (excluding cash, cash equivalents and certain other assets). For additional information regarding the Company and its management and business, please refer to www.clncredit.com. 
The Company is externally managed by CLNC Manager, LLC (the "Manager"), a subsidiary of Colony Capital, Inc. ("Colony Capital"), a NYSE-listed global real estate and investment management firm. The real estate credit markets continually evolve, and we believe the 27-year track record of Colony Capital and its affiliates of successfully investing across the real estate capital structure uniquely positions the Company to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. Colony Capital has a highly experienced management team of diverse backgrounds with a demonstrated track record of success at asset managers and investment firms, private investment funds, investment banks and other financial service companies, which provides an enhanced perspective for managing our portfolio. Kevin P. Traenkle, a 25-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President, and Neale W. Redington, a 10-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. In addition, supporting our business, David A. Palamé, a 12-year veteran of Colony Capital, serves as our General Counsel and Secretary. 
The Company conducts all of its activities and holds substantially all of its assets and liabilities through Credit RE Operating Company, LLC (the "Operating Partnership"), a Delaware limited liability company. As of December 31, 2018, the Company owned 97.6% of the Operating Partnership, as its sole managing member. The remaining 2.4% is owned by an affiliate of the Company as non-controlling interests. 
The Company intends to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2018. We are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a REIT and generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable income to stockholders and maintain qualification as a REIT (although we are subject to U.S. federal income tax on income earned through our taxable subsidiaries). We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 
Our principal executive offices are located at 515 S. Flower St., 44th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90071. Our telephone number is 1-310-282-8820, and our website address is www.clncredit.com. 
OUR INVESTMENT STRATEGY 
Our objective is to generate consistent and attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders. We seek to achieve this objective primarily through cash distributions and the preservation of invested capital and secondarily through capital appreciation. We believe our diversified investment strategy across the CRE capital stack provides flexibility through economic cycles to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns. This approach is driven by a disciplined investment strategy, focused on: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• capitalizing on asset level underwriting experience and market analytics to identify investments with pricing dislocations  and attractive risk-return profiles;  
• originating and structuring CRE senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans and preferred equity with attractive return profiles  relative to the underlying value and financial operating performance of the real estate collateral, given the strength and quality of the sponsorship;  
• identifying appropriate CRE debt securities investments based on the performance of the underlying real estate assets, the  impact of such performance on the credit return profile of the investments and our expected return on the investments;  
• identifying net leased real estate investments based on property location and purpose, tenant credit quality, market lease  rates and potential appreciation of, and alternative uses for, the real estate;

• creating capital appreciation opportunities through active asset management and equity participation opportunities; and   
• structuring transactions with a prudent amount of leverage, if any, given the risk of the underlying asset's cash  flows, attempting to match the structure and duration of the financing with the underlying asset's cash flows, including through the use of hedges, as appropriate.  
[END TABLE]
The period for which we intend to hold our investments will vary depending on the type of asset, interest rates, investment performance, micro and macro real estate environment, capital markets and credit availability, among other factors. We generally expect to hold debt investments until the stated maturity and equity investments in accordance with each investment's proposed business plan. We may sell all or a partial ownership interest in an investment before the end of the expected holding period if we believe that market conditions have maximized its value to us or the sale of the asset would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders. 
For 2019, we have adopted a portfolio rationalization strategy to divest certain inherited investments, which include non-core assets and investments that have experienced recent credit events and are meaningfully low- or no-yielding. Specifically, we combed through the portfolio and identified assets where rationalization and redeployment will lead to accretive, higher yielding returns on equity. The strategy also identified refinancing opportunities, which will take advantage of the current credit markets and create additional investable capital in our portfolio. 
Our investment strategy is dynamic and flexible, enabling us to adapt to shifts in economic, real estate and capital market conditions and to exploit market inefficiencies. We may expand or change our investment strategy or target assets over time in response to opportunities available in different economic and capital market conditions. This flexibility in our investment strategy allows us to employ a customized, solutions-oriented approach, which we believe is attractive to borrowers and tenants. We believe that our diverse portfolio, our ability to originate, acquire and manage our target assets and the flexibility of our investment strategy positions us to capitalize on market inefficiencies and generate attractive long-term risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a variety of market conditions and economic cycles. 
As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of the following investments (dollars in thousands):

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE AND HIGHLIGHTS 
At the closing of the Mergers (as described in "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below), the Company adopted the following corporate governance features. The Board and management believe that having these additional stockholder-focused corporate governance elements has the opportunity to enhance the Company's business and value to stockholders. 
1.        Majority Independent Directors with Extensive Real Estate and Board Governance Experience; Non-Executive Chairman. Our Board includes seven directors, four of which are independent, who are each highly respected and recognized leaders in commercial real estate and related industries. All of our NYSE-required Board committees consist solely of independent directors. In addition, the Chairman of the Company's Board is not an executive or employee of the Company or our Manager. 
2.        No Classified Board. All of the Company's directors stand for election annually. 
3.        Majority Voting Standard for Election of Directors. In uncontested elections, our Board will be elected by majority vote, with incumbent directors who are not re-elected being required to submit a resignation. A plurality voting standard will apply to contested elections. 
4.        Anti-Hedging Policy. The Company adopted a robust policy on inside information and insider trading, to which all "covered persons" (as defined therein), including all directors and executive officers of the Company, are subject. In part, this policy strictly prohibits, at all times, the trading in call or put options involving the Company's securities and other derivative securities; engaging in short sales of the Company's securities; holding the Company's securities in a margin account; and, except in limited circumstances, pledging the Company's stock to secure margin or other loans. 
5.        Board Leadership. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are separate. The Chairman of the Company's Board is not an executive or employee of the Company or the Company's Manager. 
6.        Independent Director Meetings. Independent Directors meet regularly in executive session (separate from management). 
7.        Outside Advisor Guidance. The Board and each committee have express authority to retain outside advisors. 
8.        Compensation Review. Independent directors conduct an annual review of the CEO, Manager and Company performance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE GUIDELINES, CODES OF ETHICS AND COMMITTEE CHARTERS 
We are committed to strong corporate governance practices and, as such, we have adopted our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Codes of Ethics discussed below to enhance our corporate governance effectiveness. Our Board maintains charters for all Board committees. These guidelines, codes and our committee charters are available on our website at www.clncredit.com under the heading "Shareholders—Corporate Governance." You can also receive a copy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Codes of Ethics, without charge, by writing to the General Counsel at Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc., 590 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines are designed to assist our Board in exercising its responsibilities. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines govern, among other things, Board composition, Board member qualifications, responsibilities and education, management succession and self-evaluation. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics relates to the conduct of our business by our officers and directors and the employees, officers and directors of our Manager (and Colony Capital) who provide services to us. We seek to maintain high standards of ethical business practices and compliance with all laws and regulations applicable to our business, including those related to doing business outside the United States. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to avoid situations in which personal interests conflict, or have the appearance of conflicting, with those of the Company. Among other things, our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics prohibits our directors, executive officers and employees and employees and officers of our Manager, among other persons ("covered persons") from providing gifts, meals or anything of value to government officials or employees or members of their families in connection with our business without prior written approval from the Company's General Counsel or Chief Executive Officer. We have also adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which applies to our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and other senior financial and accounting officers of the Company performing similar functions who have been identified by the Chief Executive Officer from time to time. Any waiver of the code of business conduct and ethics for our executive officers or directors may be made only by the Audit Committee or another committee of the Board of Directors comprised solely of independent directors or a majority of independent directors. We will disclose on our website any amendments to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Codes of Ethics or committee charters or waivers from our Codes of Ethics applicable to any of our directors and executive officers that would otherwise be required to be disclosed under the rules of the SEC or the NYSE. 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
Of our seven directors being nominated for re-election by our Board, our Board has affirmatively determined that Ms. Rice and Messrs. Schwartz, Westerfield and Wilson are independent under the NYSE rules and under applicable rules of the SEC. In determining director independence, our Board reviewed, among other things, any transactions or relationships that currently exist or that have existed since our incorporation, between each director and the Company and its subsidiaries, affiliates and equity investors, independent auditors or members of senior management. In particular, our Board reviewed current or recent business transactions or relationships or other personal relationships between each director and the Company, including such director's immediate family and companies owned or controlled by the director or with which the director was affiliated. The purpose of this review was to determine whether any such transactions or relationships failed to meet any of the objective tests under the NYSE rules for determining independence or were otherwise sufficiently material as to be inconsistent with a determination that the director is independent. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
Our Board believes it is important to select its Chairman and the Company's Chief Executive Officer in the manner it considers to be in the best interests of the Company at any given point in time. The members of our Board possess considerable business experience and in-depth knowledge of the issues the Company faces, and are therefore in the best position to evaluate the needs of the Company and how best to organize the Company's leadership structure to meet those needs. 
After careful consideration, our Board believes that the most effective leadership structure for the Company at this time is to maintain separate the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Currently, Mr. Saltzman serves as our Non-Executive Chairman and Mr. Traenkle serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President. With Mr. Saltzman as our Non-Executive Chairman, we are able to benefit from his experience, knowledge, leadership and vision. Our Board believes that having Mr. Traenkle as Chief Executive Officer, with extensive commercial real estate industry knowledge and relationships, currently  Corporate Governance best serves the interests of the Company. Our Board periodically evaluates the Company's leadership structure and will periodically evaluate the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer positions, including determining whether the separate roles continue to serve the best interests of the Company. 
To promote the independence of our Board and appropriate oversight of management, the independent directors select annually a Lead Independent Director, currently Ms. Rice, to facilitate free and open discussion and communication among the independent directors of our Board and management. The Lead Independent Director presides at all executive sessions at which only non-management directors are present. These meetings are held in conjunction with the regularly scheduled quarterly meetings of our Board, but may be called at any time by our Lead Independent Director or any of our other independent directors. In 2018, our independent directors met nine times in executive session without management present following Board and/or committee meetings and met outside of regularly scheduled Board and committee meetings on certain occasions. If applicable, our Lead Independent Director will discuss issues that arise during those meetings with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Our Lead Independent Director also discusses Board meeting agendas with our Chairman and Secretary and may request the inclusion of additional agenda items for meetings of our Board. 
BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT 
Risk is inherent with every business and how well a business manages risk can ultimately determine its success. Our management team is responsible for our risk exposures on a day-to-day basis by identifying the material risks we face, implementing appropriate risk management strategies that are responsive to our risk profile, integrating consideration of risk, risk ratings and risk management into our decision-making process and, if necessary, promulgating policies and procedures to ensure that information with respect to material risks is communicated to our Board. Our Board, as a whole and through its committees, has the responsibility to oversee and monitor these risk management processes by informing itself of material risks and evaluating whether management has reasonable controls in place to address the material risks. Our Board is not responsible, however, for defining or managing our various risks. Our Board is regularly informed by management of potential material risks and activities related to those risks at Board and/or committee meetings. Members of our management team generally attend all Board meetings and are readily available to our Board to address any questions or concerns raised by our Board on risk management and any other matters. 
Our Audit Committee assists the Board's oversight of the integrity of our financial statements and financial reporting process, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, the qualifications and independence of our independent registered public accounting firm, and the performance of our internal audit function and independent registered public accounting firm. In addition, the Audit Committee has established and maintains procedures for the receipt of complaints and submissions of concerns regarding accounting and auditing matters. Pursuant to its charter, the Audit Committee also considers our policies with respect to financial reporting risk assessment and risk management. 
In addition, the Compensation Committee shall also ensure that compensation plans are designed with an appropriate balance of risk and reward in relation to the Company's overall business strategy and do not encourage excessive or unnecessary risk-taking behavior. 
VOTING STANDARD FOR ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Our bylaws provide that, in any uncontested election of directors, a director nominee will be elected by a majority of all of the votes cast for and against such nominee at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present. If in any uncontested election of directors an incumbent director does not receive a majority of the votes cast by stockholders entitled to vote with respect to the election of that director, our corporate governance guidelines require such director to tender his or her resignation within three days after certification of the results. To the extent that one or more directors' resignations are accepted by the Board, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will recommend to the Board whether to fill such vacancy or vacancies or to reduce the size of the Board. In any contested election of directors, directors will be elected by a plurality of votes cast at a meeting of stockholders. 
DIRECTORS OFFER OF RESIGNATION POLICY 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, whenever a member of the Board (i) accepts a position with a company that is competitive to the business(es) then engaged in by the Company or (ii) violates the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines or any other Company policy applicable to the members of the Board  Corporate Governance from time to time, he or she shall offer his or her resignation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The director shall be expected to act in accordance with the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation in this regard. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCEDURES 
The Board has adopted the charter of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to be used for considering potential director candidates to further the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's goal of ensuring that our Board consists of a diversified group of qualified individuals that function effectively as a group. The policy provides that qualifications and credentials for consideration as a director nominee may vary according to the particular areas of expertise being sought as a complement to the existing composition of the Board. However, at a minimum, candidates for director must have the highest personal and professional integrity, a demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and an ability to be most effective, in conjunction with the other nominees to the Board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
In addition to the aforementioned qualifications, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall assess the nominee's independence and may consider, among other things, the following, all in the context of an assessment of the perceived needs of the Board at that time: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• diversity, age, background, skill and experience;  
• personal qualities, high ethical standards and characteristics, accomplishments, and reputation in the business community;   
• knowledge and contacts in the communities in which the Company conducts business and in the Company's industry or other  industries relevant to the Company's business;  
• ability and willingness to devote sufficient time to serve on the Board and committees of the Board;  
• knowledge and expertise in various areas deemed appropriate by the Board; and  
• fit of the individual's skills, experience, and personality with those of other directors in maintaining an effective,  collegial, and responsive Board.  
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will seek to identify director candidates based on input provided by a number of sources, including (a) Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee members, (b) other members of the Board and (c) stockholders of the Company. All candidates submitted by stockholders will be evaluated in the same manner as all other director candidates, provided that the advance notice and other requirements set forth in our bylaws have been followed. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also has the authority to consult with or retain advisors or search firms as it deems necessary or appropriate in its sole discretion, including any search firm to assist in the identification of qualified director candidates; however, we do not currently employ a search firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to locate qualified director candidates. 
COMMUNICATIONS WITH OUR BOARD 
Our Board has established a process to receive communications from interested parties, including stockholders. Interested parties may contact the Lead Independent Director, any member or all members of our Board by writing to any of them at c/o General Counsel at Colony Credit Real Estate, Inc., 590 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor, New York, New York 10022. All such communications received by the office of our General Counsel will be opened solely for the purpose of determining whether the contents represent a message to our directors. Any contents that are not in the nature of advertising, promotions of a product or service or patently offensive material will be forwarded promptly to the addressee(s). The Lead Independent Director will decide what action should be taken with respect to the communication, including whether such communication should be reported to the Board. 
POLICY FOR REVIEW OF RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Pursuant to our Audit Committee's charter, our Audit Committee must review reports and disclosures of related party transactions and consider any potential conflicts of interest involving our executive officers or any member of our Board. The Audit Committee must review and consider for approval any related party transaction between us and any executive officer or director. When reviewing and evaluating a related party transaction, our Audit Committee may consider, among other things, any effect a transaction may have upon a director's independence, whether the transaction involves terms and conditions that  Corporate Governance are no less favorable to us than those that could be obtained in a transaction between us and an unrelated third party and the nature of any director's or officer's involvement in the transaction. In the event any such related party transaction involves a member of the Audit Committee, the transaction must be approved by a majority of the disinterested members of the Audit Committee. 
To facilitate our Audit Committee's review of related party transactions, on an annual basis, each director and executive officer is obligated to complete a director and officer questionnaire which requires disclosure of any transactions with us in which the director or executive officer or any member of his or her immediate family, has an interest. In addition, pursuant to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, all potential conflict of interest situations, including related party transactions, must be disclosed to our General Counsel. To the extent any such potential conflict of interest disclosed to our General Counsel is a proposed related party transaction, the General Counsel will communicate such conflict and the proposed transaction to the Audit Committee. Further, our General Counsel will notify the members of our Audit Committee promptly of any material changes to previously approved or conditionally approved related party transactions. 
See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" for a description of our related party and certain other transactions. 
POLICY ON HEDGING AND PLEDGING OF COMPANY SECURITIES 
Pursuant to our Policy on Inside Information and Insider Trading, our directors and employees, including our named executive officers, are prohibited from engaging in the following transactions: (i) trading in call or put options involving our securities and other derivative securities; (ii) engaging in short sales of our securities; (iii) holding our securities in a margin account and (iv) pledging our securities to secure margins or other loans, subject to limited exceptions. 
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file reports of beneficial ownership of such securities on Forms 3, 4 and 5 with the SEC. Officers, directors and persons who own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities are required to furnish us with copies of all Forms 3, 4 and 5 that they file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms we received or written representations from certain reporting persons that no filings on such forms were required for those persons, Except for a late Form 3 filing made December 3, 2018 in connection with our chief accounting officer's appointment on November 9, 2018, we believe that all such filings required to be made during and with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act were timely made.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
During 2018, the following directors, all of whom are independent directors, served on our Compensation Committee: Ms. Rice and Messrs. Schwartz, Westerfield and Wilson. None of our executive officers serve as a member of a board of directors or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any other entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of our Board or Compensation Committee.  Director Compensation 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
DETERMINATION OF COMPENSATION AWARDS 
The Compensation Committee has responsibility for making recommendations to our Board regarding non-employee director compensation. Our goal is the creation of a reasonable and balanced Board compensation program that aligns the interests of our Board with those of our stockholders. We use a combination of cash and stock-based compensation to attract and retain highly-qualified candidates to serve on our Board. In setting director compensation, we consider the significant amount of time that directors expend in fulfilling their duties to us, the skill level required by us of members of our Board and competitive pay practice data. The Compensation Committee discusses its recommendations with the Company's Chief Executive Officer and ultimately makes a recommendation to our Board with respect to all non-employee director compensation. In 2018, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee engaged FPL Associates as compensation consultant to assist it in reviewing competitive practice data regarding non-employee director compensation and to advise it in connection with making recommendations to our Board with respect to the amount and form of such compensation. 
NON-EXECUTIVE NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY 
Effective February 2018, the Board adopted a "Non-Executive Independent Director Compensation Policy" that provides that each non-executive director of the Board receives an annual base fee for his or her services of $180,000, with $80,000 payable in cash in quarterly installments in conjunction with quarterly meetings of the Board and $100,000 payable in the form of an annual award of restricted shares of Class A common stock, which will vest in full on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant (anticipated to occur shortly after each annual election of directors), subject to the director's continued service on the Board. In addition, in 2018, the chairs of each of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees receives an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000, $15,000 and $15,000, respectively, and the Lead Independent Director receives an additional annual cash retainer of $20,000. 
With respect to the period between the consummation of the Company's merger on February 1, 2018 and the Annual Meeting, each director receives a ratable allocation of compensation based on the annual cash and equity based compensation to be paid in accordance with the Non-Executive Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy summarized above, with such stock grant vesting May 3, 2019. The Company also reimburses each of the directors for their travel expenses incurred in connection with their attendance at Board and committee meetings. 
From and after Mr. Saltzman's resignation as an employee of Colony Capital on November 6, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the Company compensating Mr. Saltzman as a non-executive, non-employee director in accordance with the foregoing policy. Mr. Saltzman did not receive compensation for his services as a director prior to his resignation. 
Messrs. Tangen and Traenkle did not receive compensation for their services as directors during 2018.

 Executive Compensation 
EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Until the end of fiscal year 2018, we were an "emerging growth company" as defined under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, also known as the JOBS Act. As a result, we are only required at this time to submit an advisory (non-binding) vote for "say-on-pay frequency", included as Proposal No. 2 in this Proxy Statement. Given that 2019 will be the first full year of operations, the Company will hold its initial required advisory (non-binding) vote for "say-on-pay" at the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
We have no employees and are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to a management agreement (the "Management Agreement"). All of our named executive officers are employees of our Manager or one or more of its affiliates and, in such capacity, devote a portion of their time to our affairs as is required pursuant to the Management Agreement. 
Because the Management Agreement with the Manager provides that the Manager is responsible for managing the affairs of the Company, we do not pay, award or provide our executive officers any cash compensation or benefits, and we have no compensation agreements with our executive officers. Additionally, we do not determine the form and amount of compensation and benefits awarded by our Manager or its affiliates to our executive officers for their services to us. Instead, our Manager or its affiliates have discretion to determine the form and level of cash compensation and other benefits paid to and earned by our executive officers for their services to us. Our Manager or its affiliates also determine whether and to what extent our executive officers will be provided with pension, deferred compensation and other employee benefits plans and programs. Instead, the Company pays the Manager management fees and reimbursement amounts, as described below under "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions—Management Agreement with our Manager". 
Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, we reimburse our Manager or its affiliates for our allocable share of the compensation (including annual base salary, bonus and any related withholding taxes and employee benefits) our Manager pays to its personnel serving as our Chief Financial Officer based on the percentage of such officer's time spent on our affairs. Our Chief Financial Officer receives no pension or retirement benefits or nonqualified deferred compensation in connection with his service to us, and there are no severance arrangements to make cash payments to our Chief Financial Officer upon his termination or in the event of our change in control. 
Our Manager is responsible, and we do not reimburse our Manager or its affiliates, for the cash compensation and benefits awarded to personnel of our Manager and its affiliates who serve as our named executive officers other than that for our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Management Agreement does not require that any of our named executive officers dedicate a specific amount of time to fulfilling our Manager's obligations to us under the Management Agreement and does not require a specified amount or percentage of the fees we pay to our Manager to be allocated to our named executive officers. Instead, members of our management team are required to devote such amount of their time to our management as necessary and appropriate, commensurate with our level of activity, noting these individuals also provide investment management and other services to Colony Capital and other investment vehicles that are sponsored, managed or advised by affiliates thereof. 
Colony Capital's compensation philosophy is to seek to align the interests of its professionals (including our executive officers) with those of its investors and investors in the vehicles that it manages, including us. In setting compensation for its professionals, Colony Capital takes into consideration various factors in determining the total compensation payable to its professionals including the type, scope and level of responsibility of the professional on behalf of Colony Capital, the Company, and other managed affiliates, as applicable. Colony Capital evaluates market conditions and individual contributions made by the professional. With regard to the compensation that was paid by Colony Capital to our named executive officers, Colony Capital also evaluated contributions to Company performance during 2018, including the consummation of the Mergers, deployment of capital in new investments, portfolio management and asset rationalization activities, and overall efforts to strengthen our balance sheet and maintain focused risk management activities. 
In setting compensation for its professionals, including our named executive officers, Colony Capital did not take into account the amount of the management fee we pay to our Manager. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred a total management fee expense of $43.2 million. We did not pay any incentive compensation fees to our Manager during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the total reimbursements of expenses incurred by the Manager on behalf of the Company and reimbursable in accordance with the Management Agreement was $10.4 million.  Executive Compensation 
 Of the reimbursement amount, $0.7 million represented our aggregate reimbursement for the salary and other compensation/benefits earned by each of the individuals serving in the capacity of Chief Financial Officer in 2018. 
Our named executive officers for 2018 were Kevin P. Traenkle, our Chief Executive Officer and President; Neale W. Redington, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; David A. Palamé, our General Counsel and Secretary; and Sujan S. Patel, our former Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. On November 9, 2018, Mr. Patel resigned from his positions with the Company, and Mr. Redington succeeded Mr. Patel in these capacities. 
EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION 
We have adopted an incentive plan, the CLNC Incentive Plan, under which we may award equity-based and cash-based awards to our and our subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors and directors, officers and employees of our Manager and its affiliates that are providing services to us and our subsidiaries. These awards are designed to align the interests of such individuals with those of our stockholders and to provide incentive to eligible persons (including at our Manager and its affiliates) to stimulate their efforts towards the success of the Company and to operate and manage its business in a manner that will provide for the long term growth and profitability of the Company. 
Our Compensation Committee may, from time to time, grant our named executive officers and Manager (and/or employees of its affiliates) equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted shares of our common stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights and other equity-based awards that are exercisable for or settle in shares of our common stock. These awards are designed to align the interests of our named executive officers and such other recipients with those of our stockholders, by allowing each to share in the creation of value for our stockholders through capital appreciation and dividends. These equity awards are generally subject to vesting requirements over a number of years, and are designed to promote the retention of management and achievement of strong performance for the Company. These awards provide a further benefit to us by enabling our Manager to attract, motivate and retain talented individuals to serve as our executive officers and other personnel to the Company. The Compensation Committee reviews the recommendations of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, the Manager and outside compensation consultant in determining the appropriate size of the equity award for each executive officer, the Manager (and/or employees of its affiliates), as applicable. These recommendations take into account the financial performance of the Company during the prior fiscal year, current market conditions, the performance of each executive officer or other persons and the desire to continue to align the interests of each recipient with our stockholders. 
In 2018, our named executive officers were granted restricted common stock awards in the following amounts: 58,689 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Traenkle, 12,508 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Redington, 12,809 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Palamé and 34,737 shares of restricted common stock to Mr. Patel. These restricted stock awards generally vest in three substantially equal installments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. In connection with his separation from the Company on November 9, 2018, Mr. Patel's stock awards, all of which remained unvested as of the date of his departure, were forfeited.

Upon a named executive officer's termination of employment other than for death or "disability" (as defined in the CLNC Incentive Plan), vesting generally ceases for such person's restricted stock awards that have not vested. Upon a named executive officer's death or disability, any of such person's unvested restricted stock awards will immediately vest. 
Upon a "change in control" (as defined in the CLNC Incentive Plan) in which all or a portion of the restricted stock awards and other awards, in each case, with the exception of any "performance award" (as defined in the CLNC Incentive Plan) are not being assumed or continued, all restricted stock shall be deemed to have fully vested effective immediately prior to the occurrence of a change in control. Upon the occurrence of a "change in control" (as defined in the CLNC Incentive Plan) in which certain outstanding awards are being assumed or continued, those awards shall continue in the manner and under the same terms and conditions provided under the CLNC Incentive Plan and applicable award agreement in the event of any change in control to the extent that provision is made in writing in connection with such change in control for the assumption or continuation of such awards, or for the substitution of such awards for new cash-denominated awards of equivalent economic value or common stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, stock units, dividend equivalent rights, profits interests, and other equity-based awards relating to the stock or other equity interest of a successor entity or a parent or subsidiary thereof, with appropriate adjustments as to the number of shares or units and option and stock appreciation rights exercise prices.

 Proposal No. 2: Advisory Vote on the Frequency of the Vote on Executive Compensation 
We are seeking an advisory vote on the frequency with which say-on-pay votes should be held in the future. This advisory vote is commonly referred to as "say-on-pay frequency." Stockholders may vote to indicate their preference for conducting a say-on-pay vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Every year;  
• Every two years;  
• Every three years; or  
• Abstain from voting on this proposal.  
[END TABLE]
The Board has determined that holding a say-on-pay vote every year is the most appropriate recommendation for the Company. In recommending an annual advisory vote on executive compensation beginning in 2020, the Board considered that an annual vote will allow our stockholders to provide us with timely feedback on our compensation policies and practices as disclosed in the proxy statement every year, which will allow us to take action, if appropriate, on a real-time basis. Additionally, an annual say-on-pay vote will further our general policy of seeking regular input from, and engaging in discussions with, our stockholders on corporate governance matters and our executive compensation policies and practices. 
Because this proposal is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company, and the Board may determine to hold an advisory vote on executive compensation more or less frequently than the option selected by our stockholders. However, the Board values our stockholders' opinions, and the Board will consider the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Vote Required and Recommendation 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast is required for approval, on an advisory basis, of the frequency of holding the say-on-pay vote in the future. Because stockholders have several voting choices, it is possible that no single choice will receive a majority of the votes cast. In the event no option receives a majority of the votes cast, the option receiving the most votes cast on the proposal will be deemed the preferred option of stockholders. For purposes of the vote on this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. See "About the Meeting (FAQs) - How many votes are required to approve the proposals?" for additional information regarding the required vote for this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS THAT YOU SELECT "EVERY YEAR" ON THE ADVISORY VOTE RECOMMENDING THE FREQUENCY OF ADVISORY VOTES ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  Proposal No. 3: Ratification of Appointment of Our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The Audit Committee of our Board has appointed Ernst & Young LLP ("EY") as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. After careful consideration of the matter and in recognition of the importance of this matter to our stockholders, the Board has determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to seek the ratification by our stockholders of our Audit Committee's selection of our independent registered public accounting firm. A representative of EY will be present at the annual meeting, will have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Even if the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm is ratified, our Board and the Audit Committee may, in their discretion, change that appointment at any time during the year should they determine such a change would be in our and our stockholders' best interests. In the event that the appointment of EY is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm, but will not be required to appoint a different firm. 
Vote Required and Recommendation 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the meeting is required for approval of the ratification of the appointment of EY as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. For purposes of the vote on this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote, although they will be considered present for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. See "About the Meeting (FAQs) - How many votes are required to approve the proposals?" for additional information regarding the required vote for this proposal. 
OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  Audit Committee Report
