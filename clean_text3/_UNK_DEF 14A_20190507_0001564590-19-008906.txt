[BEGIN TABLE]
 QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THIS PROXY MATERIAL AND VOTING 
[END TABLE]
We are providing you with this proxy statement, which contains information about the items to be voted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting"). Our principal executive offices are located at 800 Clinton Square, Rochester, New York 14604. The words "we," "us," "our," or "Company," refer to Broadstone Net Lease, Inc.
When and where is the Annual Meeting?
The Annual Meeting will be held on Tuesday, May 7, 2019, at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, at the Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum, 900 East Avenue, Rochester, New York.
What is this document and why did I receive it?
This proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card are being furnished to you as a stockholder of Broadstone Net Lease, Inc. because our Board of Directors is soliciting your proxy to vote at the Annual Meeting. This proxy statement contains information that stockholders should consider before voting on the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting.
We intend to mail this proxy statement and accompanying proxy card on or about March 22, 2019, to all stockholders of record entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting.
What is a Proxy?
A proxy is a person who votes the shares of stock of another person who is not able to attend a meeting. The term "proxy" also refers to the proxy card or other method of appointing a proxy. When you submit your proxy, you are appointing the designated officers of the Company as your proxy and you are giving them authority to vote your shares of common stock at the Annual Meeting. The appointed proxies will vote your shares of common stock as you instruct, unless you submit your proxy without instructions. If you submit your proxy without instructions, the proxies will vote in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors with respect to any proposals to be voted upon or, in the absence of such a recommendation, in their discretion. If you do not submit your proxy, the proxies will not vote your shares of common stock. Therefore, it is important for you to return the proxy card to us (or submit your proxy via telephone or electronically) as soon as possible, regardless of whether you plan on attending the meeting.
What is the purpose of the Annual Meeting?
At the Annual Meeting, stockholders will vote upon the following two proposals:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  the election of directors to our Board of Directors for the ensuing year; and 
    2.  the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
   1  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Our management will also provide attendees with a presentation and respond to questions from our stockholders. In addition, representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, are expected to be available during the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will be available to respond to questions from our stockholders.
How is this solicitation being made and who will bear the costs of soliciting votes?
Solicitation of proxies will be primarily by mail. Our directors, officers, and our manager's employees, none of who will receive additional compensation for their services, may also solicit proxies by telephone, in person, or by e-mail. We have hired Donnelley Financial Solutions ("Donnelley") and Mediant Inc. ("Mediant") to assist us in the distribution of our proxy materials and for the solicitation of proxy votes.
All the expenses of soliciting proxies, including preparing, assembling, printing, and mailing the materials used in the solicitation of proxies, will be borne by us, and we will pay Donnelley and Mediant customary fees and expenses for these services.
Will my vote make a difference?
Yes! Your vote is needed to ensure that the proposals can be acted upon. YOUR VOTE IS VERY IMPORTANT! Your immediate response will help avoid potential delays and may save us significant additional expenses associated with soliciting stockholder proxies. We encourage you to participate in the governance of our Company.
Who is entitled to vote?
Holders of record of our shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the "Common Stock"), as of the close of business on March 1, 2019 (the "Record Date"), are entitled to receive notice of the Annual Meeting and to vote at the Annual Meeting, or any postponements or adjournments of the Annual Meeting. As of the Record Date, there were 22,597,882.214 shares of our Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. Each such outstanding share of Common Stock entitles its holder to cast one vote on each proposal to be voted on during the Annual Meeting.
What constitutes a quorum?
The presence, either in person or by proxy, of at least a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting on any matter will constitute a quorum. If a quorum is not present at the Annual Meeting, or if a quorum is present but sufficient votes to approve a proposal are not received, the chairman of the Annual Meeting may adjourn the Annual Meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days from the original Record Date to permit further solicitation of proxies.
How is quorum determined?
For the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the Annual Meeting, we will count shares represented in person or by properly executed proxy. We will treat shares that abstain from voting as to a particular matter and broker non-votes (defined below) as shares that are present at the Annual Meeting for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists, but we will not count them as votes cast on such matter. A "broker non-vote" occurs when a broker does not vote on a matter on the proxy card because the broker does not have discretionary voting power for that particular matter and has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner.
How Many Votes Are Required to Approve Each Proposal?
Election of Directors. Under Maryland law and the Company's Amended and Restated Bylaws ("Bylaws"), Directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting. Two of the nominees to our Board of Directors have been nominated by Broadstone Asset Management, LLC, the Company's asset manager (the "Asset Manager"). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy contained in your Subscription Agreement for shares of Common Stock, you have designated officers of the Company to vote your shares in favor of the election of these nominees. With respect to the remaining seven nominees, the officer holding the proxies solicited in connection with this Annual Meeting will vote the shares as designated on the proxy, or if no such designation is made, in favor of the election of the nominees.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   2  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
Ratification of Auditors. The ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019, requires the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting in person or by proxy. Any shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote or otherwise) will have no impact on the vote.
How do I vote?
If you are a registered stockholder as of the Record Date, you may vote in person by attending the Annual Meeting. If you intend to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must bring a valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or a passport. Additionally, you may use any of the following options for authorizing a proxy to vote your shares prior to the Annual Meeting:
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  by mail by completing, signing, dating, and returning the enclosed proxy card;  
    2.  by telephone by calling 1-866-390-5372 and following the instructions; or 
    3.  via the Internet by going to www.proxypush.com/broadstone and following the on-screen instructions. 
[END TABLE]
If you authorize a proxy by telephone or internet, you are not required to mail your proxy card. See the attached proxy card for additional instructions on how to vote.
All proxies that are properly executed and received by us prior to the Annual Meeting, and are not revoked, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions on those proxies. If no instructions are specified on a properly executed proxy, it will be voted FOR the election of each of the Director nominees set forth in Proposal No. 1 and FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm as set forth in Proposal No. 2.
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person, we urge you to submit a proxy by mail, telephone, or via the internet to ensure the representation of your shares at the Annual Meeting.
How do I vote if I hold my shares in "street name"?
If your shares are held by your bank or broker as your nominee (that is, in "street name"), you are considered the beneficial owner of your shares, but your bank or broker are considered the record owner. You should receive a proxy or voting instruction form from the institution that holds your shares. Follow the instructions included on that form regarding how to instruct your broker to vote your shares.
If your shares are held in street name and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and/or vote in person, you must bring your broker or bank voting instruction card and a proxy, executed in your favor, from the record holder of your shares. In addition, you must bring a valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or a passport.
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote?
Unless you give other instructions on your proxy card, the individuals named on the card as proxy holders will vote in accordance with the recommendation of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors recommends that you vote your shares as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• FOR the election of each of the nominees to our Board of Directors; and 
• FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
Can I change or revoke my vote?
Any stockholder giving a proxy has the power to revoke it at any time before it is exercised. You may revoke your proxy by: (i) delivering a written statement to the Secretary of the Company stating that the proxy is revoked, which must be received prior to the Annual Meeting; (ii) submitting a subsequent proxy with a later date (provided such proxy is received prior to the Annual Meeting); or (iii) attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person (although attendance at the Annual Meeting will not cause your previously granted proxy to be revoked unless you specifically so request).
[BEGIN TABLE]
   3  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
If we receive your proxy authorization by telephone or over the internet, we will use procedures reasonably designed to authenticate your identity, to allow you to authorize the voting of your shares in accordance with your instructions and to confirm that your instructions have been properly recorded. To revoke a proxy previously submitted by mail, telephone or internet you may simply authorize a proxy again at a later date using the procedures set forth above, but before the deadline for mail, telephone or internet voting, in which case the later submitted proxy will be recorded and the earlier proxy revoked. 
If your shares are held by your broker or bank as a nominee or agent, you will need to contact the institution that holds your shares and follow its instructions for revoking a proxy.
What happens if an incumbent nominee for our Board of Directors does not receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting?
If an incumbent nominee for our Board of Directors does not receive the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting, then under Maryland law, he or she will continue to serve as a "holdover director" until his or her successor is duly elected. In addition, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors and our Board of Directors will take the information into account in connection with future director nominee discussions.
What happens if stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm?
The stockholder vote on the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not binding on the Company. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if they determine that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.
What happens if additional proposals are presented at the Annual Meeting?
Other than the matters described in this proxy statement, we do not expect any additional matters to be presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. If other matters are presented and you are voting by proxy, your proxy grants the individuals named as proxy holders the discretion to vote your shares on any additional matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting.
Where can I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting?
We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and then disclose the final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") within four business days after the date of the Annual Meeting. If final voting results are not known when such Form 8-K is filed, they will be announced in an amendment to such Form 8-K within four business days after the final results become known.

 PROPOSAL NO. 1: ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
[END TABLE]
Background
Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws provide that the number of our directors may be established by a majority of our Board of Directors from time to time, provided that the number of directors constituting our Board of Directors may never be less than the minimum number required by law in Maryland, our state of incorporation, or more than twelve. Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of nine directors, six of whom are independent directors, as defined by our Articles of Incorporation ("Independent Directors").
At the Annual Meeting, nine directors are to be elected for the ensuing year and until their successors are elected and qualify. Each of the nominees for director currently serves as a director of the Company and has consented to be named in this proxy statement and to continue to serve as a director if elected.  If any nominee becomes unavailable for any reason, the shares represented by proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee designated by our Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Voting Agreement and Irrevocable Proxy contained in the Subscription Agreement for shares of the Common Stock executed by each stockholder, each stockholder has designated officers of the Company to vote the stockholder's shares in favor of the election of two individuals to be nominated by the Asset Manager. Accordingly, while nine directors are to be elected at the Annual Meeting, only seven nominees for director appear on the enclosed proxy card because an irrevocable proxy to vote for the two Asset Manager nominees has already been granted.
The following individuals have been nominated by the Board of Directors to serve as directors of the Company until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors have been elected and qualified: Amy L. Tait, Christopher J. Czarnecki, Laurie A. Hawkes, David M. Jacobstein, Agha S. Khan, Thomas P. Lydon, Jr., Geoffrey H. Rosenberger, Shekar Narasimhan, and James H. Watters. Ms. Tait and Mr. Khan have been nominated by the Asset Manager and, accordingly, the designated officers of the Company shall vote all stockholders' shares in favor of their election. Each of the seven other nominees are listed on the enclosed proxy card.
Information About Director Nominees
The table set forth below lists the names and ages of each of the nominees as of the date of this proxy statement and the position and office that each nominee currently holds with the Company. We are not aware of any family relationship among any of the nominees to become members of our Board of Directors.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
      Laurie A. Hawkes serves as our Lead Independent Director, as chairman of the Independent Directors Committee, and as a member of the Audit Committee and has served on our Board of Directors since May 2016. With over 35 years of business experience, Ms. Hawkes has held executive leadership positions as an investment banker, private real estate equity investor, and successful principal and entrepreneur. She has extensive expertise in raising capital in the public and private markets, executing real estate acquisition strategies to drive portfolio growth, developing strategic business plans, and creating scalable operational platforms. Throughout her career, Ms. Hawkes has structured and negotiated more than $25 billion in corporate finance and real estate transactions. Ms. Hawkes was a pioneer in bringing institutional capital to the single-family rental sector. In 2008, she co-founded American Residential Properties, LLC, ARP Phoenix Fund I, and American Residential Management, Inc., to acquire, operate, and manage single-family rental housing. In 2012, Ms. Hawkes co-founded American Residential Properties, Inc., a REIT, and led the capital raising and operations from a start-up entity to a $2.4 billion enterprise. She co-led the company's IPO, which was listed on the NYSE under the ticker ARPI in May 2013. Ms. Hawkes served as President and member of the board of directors of ARPI, responsible for its financing, capital markets strategy, and operational platform from the Company's formation in May 2012. In March 2013, she was formally named ARPI's President and Chief Operating Officer. ARPI merged with American Homes 4 Rent in March 2016. The merger of these two publicly traded companies created an $8 billion enterprise with over 47,000 homes, which now trades under the ticker NYSE: AMH. Ms. Hawkes began her career in 1979 as an investment banker at Salomon Brothers Inc, becoming a director specializing in real estate acquisitions and mortgage finance.

 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
[END TABLE]
Role of the Board of Directors
We operate under the direction of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for the management and control of our affairs. Our Board of Directors has retained the Manager and the Asset Manager to manage our day-to-day affairs, to implement our investment strategy, and to provide certain property management services for our properties, with both subject to our Board of Directors' direction, oversight, and approval.
Board Leadership Structure
To reduce or eliminate certain potential conflicts of interest in our operations, our Articles of Incorporation require that a majority of our directors be Independent Directors, as discussed in detail below. In addition, the Articles of Incorporation require that so long as we are externally advised by the Asset Manager, our Board of Directors must maintain an Independent Directors Committee comprised entirely of our Independent Directors. Additionally, although our governance documents do not require the separation of the offices of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, our Company and Board of Directors currently operates under a leadership structure with separate roles for our Chairman of the Board and our Chief Executive Officer. Ms. Tait, as our Chairman, presides over meetings of the Board of Directors and is responsible for our overall strategic direction, and Mr. Czarnecki, as our Chief Executive Officer, is responsible for the general management of our business, financial affairs, and day-to-day operations.
Our Independent Directors have appointed Ms. Hawkes to serve as our Lead Independent Director and as Chair of the Independent Directors Committee. Key responsibilities of our Lead Independent Director include, among others, presiding at meetings of the Independent Directors Committee, facilitating communications between the Independent Directors and the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, and other members of management, and calling meetings of the Independent Directors Committee, as necessary.
Oversight of Risk Management by the Board of Directors and Audit Committee
As part of their oversight functions, the Board of Directors and Audit Committee receive and review various reports from Company management relating to risk management matters. Because risk management is a broad concept comprised of many different elements (including, among other things, investment risk, valuation risk, credit risk, compliance and regulatory risk, business continuity risks, operational risk, and insurance matters), our Board of Directors and Audit Committee handle oversight of different types of risks in different ways. For example, the full Board of Directors receives and reviews reports from senior personnel of our Manager (including senior compliance, financial reporting, and investment personnel) or its affiliates regarding various types of risks, such as operational, compliance, and investment risk, and how they are being managed. Much of this is covered by the enterprise risk management process utilized by our Manager for our benefit, an overview of which is presented to our Board of Directors annually and as needed for review. The Audit Committee supports the oversight of risk management by the Board of Directors in a variety of ways, including (i) participation in and receipt and review of reports regarding our disclosure controls and procedures prior to the issuance of our annual and quarterly financial reports, (ii) meetings with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Accounting Officer, Deloitte & Touche LLP, our independent public accountants, and Protiviti, Inc., our outsourced internal audit consultant, to discuss, among other things, the internal control structure of our financial reporting function and compliance with certain requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended ("Sarbanes-Oxley") and (iii) reporting to our Board of Directors as to these and other matters.

Our Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Jacobstein and Mr. Rosenberger each qualify as an audit committee financial expert, as defined in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K, and that all members of the Audit Committee meet the SEC's independence requirements for audit committee membership.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee (the "Governance Committee") must at all times be comprised of at least two members, and each member of the Governance Committee must be an Independent Director. The purpose of the Governance Committee is to assist our Board of Directors in fulfilling its duties and responsibilities regarding, in addition to other related matters: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the identification of individuals qualified to become directors and the diligence process of evaluating candidates to become directors;  
• the selection of director nominees for approval by our Board of Directors and presentation as nominees for election at the next annual meeting of our stockholders or special meeting of our stockholders at which directors are to be elected;  
• in the event of any director vacancy on our Board of Directors, the selection and recommendation to our Board of Directors of qualified director candidates to fill such vacancy; and  
• the development and recommendation to our Board of Directors of corporate governance guidelines and principles. 
[END TABLE]
The Governance Committee may additionally exercise any other powers and carry out any other responsibilities delegated to it by our Board of Directors. The Governance Committee will exercise any powers and responsibilities delegated to it by our Board of Directors in the best interest of our company and its stockholders and consistent with the provisions of our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws.
The Governance Committee may identify potential candidates for our Board of Directors from other members of the Board of Directors, executive officers, and other contacts. Further, the Governance Committee may engage the services of an independent third-party search firm to assist it in identifying and evaluating potential director candidates who will bring to the Board of Directors specific skill sets as established by the Governance Committee. While we do not have any minimum qualifications with respect to director nominees, the Governance Committee considers many factors in connection with each candidate, including but not limited to the candidate's character, wisdom, judgment, ability to make independent analytical inquiries, business experiences, understanding of our business environment, acumen, and ability to devote the time and effort necessary to fulfill his or her responsibilities, all in the context of the perceived needs of our Board of Directors at that time. While individual diversity as well as diversity in experience and areas of expertise are factors that are considered by the Governance Committee in its 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   17  2019 Proxy Statement 
[END TABLE]
assessment of candidates, neither the Board of Directors nor the Governance Committee has adopted any specific diversity-driven criteria or composition requirements. Our Board of Directors seeks individuals having knowledge and experience in finance and accounting, corporate governance, risk management and senior leadership. The Governance Committee also considers factors such as experience in the Company's industry and experience as a board member of another corporation. The Board of Directors also seeks individuals who bring unique and varied perspectives and life experiences to the Board of Directors. As such, the Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors by selecting or recommending candidates who it believes will enhance the overall diversity of the Board of Directors.
The Governance Committee does not have a policy with regard to the consideration of any director candidates recommended by stockholders. The Governance Committee believes that such a policy is not necessary because the members of our Board of Directors have access to a sufficient number of excellent candidates from which to select a nominee if and when a vacancy occurs on the Board of Directors, and because two members of our Board of Directors are appointed by the Asset Manager. However, the Governance Committee will consider stockholder recommendations for candidates for our Board of Directors. Nominations by stockholders must be provided in a timely manner and must include sufficient biographical information so that the Governance Committee can appropriately assess the proposed nominee's background and qualifications. For a stockholder to have his or her candidate considered by the Governance Committee for inclusion as a director nominee at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, stockholder submissions of candidates for nomination to the Board must be received in writing at our offices by the Company's Secretary, 800 Clinton Square, Rochester, New York 14604 no later than November 23, 2019. Potential nominees recommended by a stockholder in accordance with these procedures will be considered and evaluated in the same manner as other potential nominees.
Director Orientation and Continuing Education
We provide each director who joins our Board of Directors with an initial orientation about our Company, including our business operations, strategy, policies, and governance. We also provide all of our directors with resources and ongoing education opportunities to assist them in staying educated and informed with respect to real estate markets, developments in corporate governance, and critical issues relating to the operation of boards of public companies and their committees.
Code of Ethics
We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct Policy ("Code of Ethics"), which is available on our website at http://investors.bnl.broadstone.com. The purpose of the Code of Ethics is to ensure that our business is conducted in accordance with the highest moral, legal, and ethical standards by our officers and directors as well as the Manager, the Asset Manager, and the Manager's employees. The Code of Ethics promotes honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships; full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in our reports and other public communications; compliance with applicable laws and governmental rules and regulations; the prompt internal reporting of violations of the Code of Ethics; and accountability for adherence to the Code of Ethics.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
[END TABLE]
The information contained in this report shall not be deemed to be "soliciting material" or to be "filed" with the SEC, nor shall such information be incorporated by reference into any previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), except to the extent that the Company incorporates it by specific reference.
Management is responsible for the Company's financial statements, internal controls, and financial reporting process. The independent registered public accounting firm is responsible for performing an independent audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee's responsibility is to monitor and oversee these processes. The Audit Committee is governed by a charter, a copy of which is available on our website. The Audit Committee charter is designed to assist the Audit Committee in complying with applicable provisions of the Exchange Act, which relate to corporate governance and many of which directly or indirectly affect the duties, powers, and responsibilities of the Audit Committee.
Review and Discussions with Management and Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm. In this context, the Audit Committee has met and held discussions with management, the independent registered public accounting firm, and the Company's outsourced internal audit consultant regarding the Company's financial statements and internal controls. Management represented to the Audit Committee that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 1301 Communications with Audit Committees, issues regarding accounting and auditing principles and practices, and the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting that could significantly affect the Company's financial statements.
The Company's independent registered public accounting firm also provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and letters required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Audit Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm that firm's independence. The Audit Committee has reviewed the original proposed scope of the annual audit of the Company's financial statements and the associated fees and any significant variations in the actual scope of the audit and fees.
Conclusion. Based on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended that the Board of Directors include the audited consolidated financial statements in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, as filed with the SEC on March 14, 2019.

 COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS

Director Compensation
On November 7, 2017, the Board of Directors approved an amendment, effective as of January 1, 2018, to its director compensation and stock ownership policy (the "Policy") regarding the compensation the Company pays to its Independent Directors. For 2018, we paid our Independent Directors or their nominees for their service as our directors an annual retainer of $100,000, payable in arrears in equal quarterly installments. In addition, we paid the following additional annual retainers: (a) $10,000 to the chairperson of each of the Board's Independent Directors Committee (the Company's Lead Independent Director) and Audit Committee, (b) $5,000 to each of the chairperson of the Board's Governance Committee and the Independent Director serving as board observer on the board of managers of the Manager, and (c) $5,000 to each non-chairperson member of the Board's Audit Committee. Effective July 31, 2018, the role of board observer on the board of managers of the Manager was eliminated as a result of the Company's sale of its non-voting convertible preferred units (the "Convertible Preferred BRE Units") of the Manager. Accordingly, no annual retainer shall be paid to an Independent Director for such role in 2019.  Please refer to the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below for additional information regarding the Company's sale of the Convertible Preferred BRE Units.  
The retainers payable to our Independent Directors described above were paid in the form of shares of our Common Stock with a value equal to the amount of the applicable retainer payment, provided that, in accordance with the terms of the Policy, one of our Independent Directors elected to receive 30% of such compensation in the form of cash. In order for an Independent Director to elect to receive such compensation in the form of a mixture of shares of our Common Stock and cash, the Independent Director must maintain the minimum stock retention limit established by the Board of Directors from time to time. Pursuant to the Policy, each of our Independent Directors has acquired and retained ownership of a minimum of $250,000 in shares of our Common Stock. Shares of our Common Stock owned indirectly by an Independent Director (e.g., through a spouse) count towards meeting this stock ownership requirement.
The table below sets forth certain information regarding the compensation earned by or paid to our directors during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Compensation Committee Report
SEC regulations require the disclosure of the compensation policies applicable to executive officers in the form of a report by the compensation committee of the board of directors (or a report of the full board of directors in the absence of a compensation committee). 
As noted above, we are externally managed by the Manager and have no employees. As a result, we pay no direct compensation to our executive officers and therefore have no separate compensation committee. The Board of Directors has not considered a compensation policy for employees and has not included a report with this proxy statement. Please refer to the section entitled "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions" below for additional details regarding compensation paid to the Manager and Asset Manager.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
[END TABLE]
We do not currently have any employees. Our executive officers are compensated by the Manager and not by us; therefore, none of our executive officers participated in any deliberations regarding executive compensation. In 2018, our Board of Directors determined the compensation of our Independent Directors. 
There are no interlocks or insider participation as to compensation decisions required to be disclosed pursuant to SEC regulations. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, none of our executive officers served as: (i) a member of the compensation committee (or other committee of the board of directors performing equivalent functions or, in the absence of any such committee, the entire board of directors) of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our board of directors; or (ii) a director of another entity, one of whose executive officers served on our board of directors.

Fees Paid to our Asset Manager 
Pursuant to the Asset Management Agreement, we pay the Asset Manager the fees described below. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• An asset management fee, payable quarterly in advance, equal to 0.25% of the aggregate Determined Share Value as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter, on a fully diluted basis as if all membership units in the Operating Company had been converted into shares of Common Stock on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid our Asset Manager asset management fees of approximately $18.2 million and $14.8 million, respectively.  
• An acquisition fee equal to 1% of the gross purchase price paid for each property we acquire (including properties contributed in exchange for membership units in the Operating Company); provided, however, that in the event that our acquisition of a property requires a new lease (as opposed to taking an assignment of an existing lease), such as in the case of a sale-leaseback transaction, the Asset Manager is entitled to an acquisition fee equal to 2% of the gross purchase price as a result of the additional leasing services required. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid our Asset Manager aggregate acquisition fees of approximately $7.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively, which was comprised of base acquisition fees of approximately $5.9 million and $6.6 million, respectively, and approximately $1.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, in additional fees for sale-leasebacks and the additional leasing services provided in those transactions.  
• In exchange for disposition services provided in connection with the disposition of any individual property or properties, a property sale disposition fee equal to 1.0% of the gross sales price received by the Operating Company for any such disposed of property. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid our Asset Manager property sale disposition fees of approximately $573,000 and $605,000, respectively. 
• A disposition event fee equal to 1.0% of the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below) received in connection with the (i) acquisition by any person of direct or indirect beneficial ownership of all or substantially all of our outstanding common stock or outstanding ownership interests in the Operating Company; (ii) any merger, consolidation or other similar transaction in which we are merged with or into, or otherwise acquired by, another entity; or (iii) the direct or indirect sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the Operating Company (a "Disposition Event"). A disposition event fee will not, however, be paid in connection with a listing of our Common Stock or other equity securities on a securities market or exchange, and the Asset Manager will not be entitled to receive both property sale disposition fees and a disposition event fee in connection with a Disposition Event. The Asset Management Agreement defines "Aggregate Consideration" as, with respect to a Disposition Event, the aggregate consideration, including cash, assumed debt, and the value (as determined by the Independent Directors Committee) of any securities paid or issued to us or our stockholders in connection with such Disposition Event, net of (i) all fees and transaction expenses and (ii) the value of all cash held by us (and the Operating Company) as of the time of the Disposition Event. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we did not pay our Asset Manager any disposition event fees. 
• A marketing fee equal to 0.5% of all contributions of cash or property to us or the Operating Company (excluding reinvestments of distributions pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan), as compensation for its internal and third party offering and marketing costs and expenses. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we paid our Asset Manager marketing fees of approximately $1.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively.  
• In certain circumstances, upon the termination of the Asset Management Agreement, we will pay the Asset Manager a termination fee (as discussed below).

Term of Asset Management Agreement
The Asset Management Agreement's initial term ran through December 31, 2018. On January 1, 2019, the Asset Management Agreement automatically renewed for an additional three-year term expiring on December 31, 2021. Thereafter, the Asset Management Agreement will automatically renew for successive additional three-year terms, with each such renewal term commencing on January 1st and ending on December 31st of the third fiscal year of each renewal term, unless terminated by us or the Asset Manager pursuant to the Asset Management Agreement.
Termination of Asset Management Agreement
The Asset Management Agreement provides that it may be terminated (i) immediately by the Independent Directors Committee for Cause (as defined below), (ii) by the Independent Directors Committee, upon 30 days written notice to the Asset Manager, in connection with a change in control of the Manager, (iii) by the Independent Directors Committee, by providing the Asset Manager with written notice of termination not less than one year prior to the last calendar day of any renewal term of the Asset Management Agreement (i.e., December 31st of the third fiscal year of any renewal term), and (iv) by the Asset Manager upon written notice to us not less than one year prior to the last calendar day of any renewal term of the Asset Management Agreement.

Upon receipt of the Replacement Nominees, the Independent Directors Committee will have a period of up to six months (the "Review Period") to consider the Replacement Nominees and to reasonably request additional information regarding the Replacement Nominees. If, prior to the expiration of the Review Period, (i) the Independent Directors Committee elects not to approve the Replacement Nominees and (ii) the Asset Manager and the Independent Directors Committee have been unable, despite mutual good faith efforts, to agree upon suitable alternative individuals to appoint as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Manager, the Independent Directors Committee will have the right to terminate the Asset Management Agreement upon written notice to the Asset Manager on or prior to the last day of the Review Period, with such termination effective 12 months from the date of such notice. 
The Asset Management Agreement defines a "Key Person Event" as any event or circumstance which results in both of Amy L. Tait, our Chairman and Founder, and Christopher J. Czarnecki, our Chief Executive Officer, President and a member of our Board of Directors (or their respective successors and replacements, as approved by the Independent Directors Committee) no longer continuing to serve as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (or comparable executive positions), respectively, of the Manager for a continuous period of 60 days. 
Asset Management Agreement Termination Fee

Policies with Respect to Transactions with Related Persons
We are subject to potential conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with our Manager and Asset Manager and their respective affiliates. These potential conflicts may relate to our compensation arrangements with the Manager and Asset Manager and the other terms of our agreements with the Manager and Asset Manager, which were not determined by arm's-length negotiations, the allocation of investment opportunities between us and the Manager and Asset Manager and their affiliates, and other situations in which our interests may differ from those of our Manager or Asset Manager or their affiliates. The Manager and Asset Manager may sponsor and provide services to additional entities in the future. We have adopted the policies and procedures set forth below to help address certain of these potential conflicts of interest.
Allocation of Investment Opportunities
Pursuant to the Asset Management Agreement, in the event that our Asset Manager or one of its affiliates (including the Manager) wishes to invest in, or recommend to others for investment, a real estate investment opportunity (i) which is within our then-current Investment Policy and Property Selection Criteria and (ii) with respect to which we have adequate funds, the Asset Manager is required to first offer the investment opportunity to us. In addition, if the Asset Manager or any of its affiliates (including the Manager) is presented with a potential investment opportunity that would be suitable for another investment program which the Asset Manager or its affiliates advises or manages, the investment opportunity will first be offered to us, provided that we have adequate funds available for the investment. The foregoing obligations of the Asset Manager will terminate if we terminate the Asset Management Agreement.
Independent Directors
In order to reduce or eliminate certain potential conflicts of interest in our operations, our Articles of Incorporation require that a majority of our directors be Independent Directors. In addition, our Articles of Incorporation require that so long as we are externally advised by the Asset Manager, our board of directors will maintain an Independent Directors Committee comprised entirely of our Independent Directors.
The Independent Directors Committee is authorized to retain their own legal and financial advisors. Among the matters we expect the Independent Directors Committee to act upon include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving the terms of the Asset Management Agreement and Property Management Agreement and any amendments thereto; 
• approving the Manager's or Asset Manager's independent pursuit of a real estate investment opportunity, for its own account or for the account of one of its affiliates, that falls within our then-current Investment Policy and Property Selection Criteria; 
• reviewing all conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with any of our directors or officers, the Manager, Asset Manager or any of their affiliates; and 
• reviewing our total fees, expenses, assets, revenues, and availability of funds for distribution at least annually or with sufficient frequency to determine that the expenses incurred are reasonable in light of our investment performance and that the assets, revenues and funds available for distribution are in accordance with our policies.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services that may be provided by our independent registered public accounting firm. Committee pre-approval is not required for all audit and non-audit services customarily included in the performance of independent audit engagements related to the review and issuance of annual financial statements and opinion letters, so long as the services to be performed are included in the audit engagement letter. All audit and non-audit services performed by Deloitte & Touche LLP during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were pre-approved in accordance with this policy. These services have included audit services, tax services, and all other services.
