Whether you choose to vote in person, by telephone, over the Internet or by mail, you can specify whether your shares should be voted for all, some or none of the director nominees. You can also specify whether you want to vote for or against, or abstain from voting on: 
Beneficial Owner. If your stock is held in your brokerage account, also known as "street name," you should instruct your broker how your shares should be voted. If you fail to give your broker instructions, in some cases but not others the broker may submit a "broker non-vote," which is explained below. 
If you are a beneficial owner whose shares are held of record directly in your name by a broker, you will receive instructions from the broker describing how to direct the voting of or vote your shares. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote your shares, it may vote your shares as it decides with respect to any matter for which it has discretionary authority under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). 
There are also non-discretionary matters for which your broker does not have discretionary authority to vote unless it receives timely instructions from you.

Questions and Answers About the Annual Meeting broker should vote your shares and the broker indicates it does not have authority to vote such shares on its proxy. Although broker non-votes will be counted as present at the annual meeting for purposes of determining a quorum, they will be treated as shares not entitled to vote on the proposal. 
If your shares are held in street name and you do not give voting instructions, the broker will only be entitled to vote your shares in its discretion with respect to the ratification of the appointment of our independent registered public accounting firm. Without voting instructions from you, the record holder will not be permitted to vote your shares with respect to the election of directors or the advisory vote on executive compensation. Your shares would therefore be considered broker non-votes with respect to these proposals and would have no effect on the proposal. Accordingly, it is important for you to instruct your broker how you wish to vote your shares. 
Can I change my mind after I vote? 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Yes, you may change your mind at any time before the polls close at the annual meeting, which will be at 8:30 a.m. CDT on  May 3, 2019. If you hold your shares directly in record name, you can change your vote by:

Proposal 2—Ratification of The Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019 
The Audit Committee has appointed the firm of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm ("Ernst & Young"), as the Company's auditors for 2019. Ernst & Young has served as our auditors for more than five years, including the fiscal year most recently completed. If the stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee will reconsider the appointment and may or may not consider the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for 2019 or future years. 
Consistent with past practices, it is expected that one or more representatives of Ernst & Young will attend the annual meeting and will be available to respond to appropriate questions or make a statement should they desire to do so. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019. 
Proposal 3—Advisory Vote to Approve Named Executive Officer Compensation 
We are asking our stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution related to the compensation of the Company's named executive officers commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, and the compensation tables, and the related narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement. 
Our stockholders' opinions are important to us and we hold this advisory vote annually in order to get a better understanding of their views on the compensation of our named executive officers and its alignment with stockholder interests. The Board and the Compensation Committee, which is composed of independent directors, will review and take into account the outcome of this vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. Stockholders are encouraged to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the accompanying compensation tables, and the narrative disclosure related to executive compensation disclosure, in this Proxy Statement, which provide information about our compensation policies and the compensation of our named executive officers. Stockholders should note that, because the advisory vote on executive compensation occurs well after the beginning of the compensation year, and because the different elements of our executive compensation programs are designed to operate in an integrated manner and to complement one another, it may not be appropriate or feasible to change our executive compensation programs in consideration of any one year's advisory vote on executive compensation by the time of the following year's annual meeting of stockholders. 
The Board intends to hold this vote annually, and the next advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation will occur in 2020. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL, ON AN ADVISORY BASIS, OF THE RESOLUTION TO APPROVE THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION.

Audit Committee Financial Expert 
In 2018, the Board evaluated the members of the Audit Committee and believes that each member of the Audit Committee is financially literate and that each member has sufficient background and experience to fulfill the duties of the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee Report 
LSB's Audit Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board that outlines the responsibilities of, and practices followed by the Committee. A copy of the Charter is available on LSB's website, www.lsbindustries.com, by choosing "Investors", then selecting "Corporate Governance." We review and reassess the charter annually and recommend any changes to the Board of Directors for approval. We met seven times in 2018 and this report summarizes the activities of the Committee during those meetings. 
LSB's management is responsible for preparing LSB's financial statements and the principal independent accountants are responsible for auditing those financial statements. The Audit Committee's role is to provide oversight of management in carrying out management's responsibility and to appoint, compensate, retain and oversee the work of the principal independent accountants.

Oversight of Independent Auditors 
In addition to the responsibilities described above, the Audit Committee oversees the audits of the Company's financial statements and the independence, qualifications, and performance of the independent auditors. In fulfilling our oversight role for the year ended December 31, 2018, under the Audit Committee's charter, among other things, we reviewed and discussed with Ernst & Young LLP, the Company's independent auditors and principal independent accountants, as well as with senior members of the Company's financial management team, the overall audit scope and plan, the results of the external audit, and evaluations by Ernst & Young LLP of the Company's internal controls over financial reporting, the quality of the Company's financial reporting, and the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Ernst & Young LLP also reported to us on significant accounting judgments and estimates made by management in preparing the financial statements as well as their analysis and assessment of significant risks. We also discussed with Ernst & Young LLP the matters required to be communicated pursuant to the standards promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the SEC. 
We discussed with Ernst & Young LLP their assessment of their independence, including with respect to the tax services provided by them, and received the written disclosures and letter required by the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with us concerning independence. In light of the required rotation of the independent auditor's lead partner and SEC partner following the audit of the Company's 2018 financial statements, we met with the proposed new lead partner, and reviewed his experience and qualifications. 
2018 Audited Financial Statements 
Based on our review of the audited financial statements, discussions with management and with Ernst & Young LLP, and our review of Ernst & Young LLP's written disclosures and letter, we recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC. Our recommendation considers our review of that firm's qualifications as independent accountants for the Company. Our review also included matters required to be considered under SEC rules on auditor independence, including the nature and extent of non-audit services. In our judgment the nature and extent of non-audit services performed by Ernst & Young LLP during the year did not impair the firm's independence. 
After discussions with management, considering Ernst & Young LLP's historical and recent performance of the Company's audit, the capabilities and performance of the audit team, and Ernst & Young LLP's independence, the Committee concluded that it would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to retain Ernst & Young LLP to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements for the Company for 2019 and recommend that such appointment be ratified by stockholders at the 2019 annual meeting of the company.

Engagement of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

All of the services outlined under the headings "Audit Related Fees," "Tax Fees," and "All Other Fees," above were approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee of our Board has considered whether Ernst & Young's provision of the services described above for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is compatible with maintaining its independence. 
Audit Committee's Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
All audit and non-audit services that may be provided to us by our principal accountant, Ernst & Young, require pre-approval by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee delegates such pre-approval of services to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee or the Chairman of the Audit Committee evaluates the pre-approval request to determine the appropriateness of the proposed project and proposed fee. Further, Ernst & Young may not provide to us those services specifically prohibited by the SEC. 
Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board oversees management's risk management activities, including those relating to credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk, through a combination of processes. The Board believes effective risk management will enable us to accomplish the following: 
In addition to the Company's compliance program, the Board encourages management to promote a corporate culture that incorporates risk management into the Company's corporate strategy and day-to-day business operations. The Board also continually works, with the input of the Company's executive officers, to assess and analyze the most likely areas of future risk for the Company. 
The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management relating to the Company's major financial risk exposures and to review and discuss such material risks and the steps taken to monitor and control such exposures. 
Code of Ethics 
The Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the principal accounting officer, and the controller of the Company and the controllers of each of our subsidiaries, or persons performing similar functions, are subject to our Code of Ethics and our Statement of Policy Concerning Business Conduct. We and each of our subsidiary companies have adopted a Statement of Policy Concerning Business Conduct applicable to all of the employees, officers and directors of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Our Code of Ethics and Statement of Policy Concerning Business Conduct are available on our website at www.lsbindustries.com. We will post any amendments to these documents, as well as any waivers that are required to be disclosed pursuant to the rules of either the SEC or the NYSE, on our website (to the extent applicable to the Company's executive officers, senior financial officers or directors).

Corporate Governance 
Compensation Committee 
Our Compensation Committee is comprised of non-employee, independent directors in accordance with the rules of the NYSE. During 2018, the Compensation Committee held 8 meetings. 
The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include, among other duties: 
Recommendations regarding non-equity compensation of our non-executive officers and our named executive officers are made by our Chief Executive Officer, other than decisions related to his own compensation, and are presented for approval or modification by the Compensation Committee. 
During 2018, the agenda for meetings of the Compensation Committee was determined by its Chairman with the assistance of our Chief Executive Officer. Compensation Committee meetings are regularly attended by the Chief Executive Officer. At each Compensation Committee meeting, the Compensation Committee also meets in executive session without the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee may delegate authority to the Chief Executive Officer in order to fulfill certain administrative duties regarding the compensation programs. 
The Compensation Committee has authority under its charter to retain, approve fees for, and terminate advisors, consultants and agents as it deems necessary to assist in the fulfillment of its responsibilities. If a compensation consultant is engaged, the Compensation Committee reviews the total fees paid to such outside consultant by the Company to ensure that the consultant maintains its objectivity and independence when rendering advice to the Compensation Committee. During 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Steven Hall & Partners as independent compensation consultants to advise the Compensation Committee on matters related to executive and non-employee director compensation. For information regarding compensation consultants, please see "Executive Compensation-Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Role of Compensation Consultants in Compensation Decisions" in this Proxy Statement. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to set the compensation of all of our officers. The Compensation Committee considered the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer when setting the compensation of our officers. During 2018 the Chief Executive Officer did not make any recommendation regarding his own compensation. None of the members of the Compensation Committee is, or ever has been, an officer or employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or had any relationship requiring disclosure by the Company under Item 404 of Regulation S-K during 2018. No executive officer of the Company served on any board of directors or compensation committee of any other company for which any of our directors served as an executive officer at any time during 2018. 
Board Independence 
The Board has determined that Messrs. Roedel, White, Bobb, and Sanders and Ms. Kitamura are "independent" in accordance with the current listing standards of the NYSE. Our independent directors are regularly scheduled to meet in executive session following each meeting of the Board. 
The Board has affirmatively determined that each of the independent directors had no material relationship with the Company whether directly or as a partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that had a relationship with the Company during 2018. Directors responded to a questionnaire asking about their relationships (and those of their immediate family members) with us and other potential conflicts of interest. 
The Board determined that the members of the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating Committees meet the 
LSB Industries Proxy Statement    17 
Corporate Governance independence tests of the NYSE and the SEC. In connection with the independence of each non-employee director, the Board also determined that each member of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee meets the additional independence standards of the NYSE and SEC applicable to members of the respective committees. 
Communication with the Board 
Our Board believes that it is important for us to have a process whereby stockholders may send communications to the Board.

Executive Compensation 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has adopted and implemented core principles that form the framework for our executive compensation program. In 2018, the Compensation Committee commenced a process to review the Company compensation program to determine if significant structural changes were warranted. The Compensation Committee initiated its review partially in response to input from stockholders and other constituents but also as a normal review of executive employment agreements that were due to renew at the end of 2018. As part of its review, the Compensation Committee continued its engagement of Steven Hall & Partners as its compensation consultant to review CEO compensation plans, provide input on incentive plan design and compensation competitiveness now and for the future. Ultimately the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the management team, determined that changes to the Long-Term Incentive Plan and the form and structure of the Company's employment agreements with the CEO and other executive officers were appropriate. These changes are discussed in greater detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of this Proxy Statement. While it always has been the philosophy of the Compensation Committee to align our executive compensation program with our stockholders, we believe that the updated compensation program more clearly aligns executive compensation opportunities with our long-term strategic plan and provides greater accountability for long-term results. 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the following Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and, based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement, and we encourage you to read it.

[END TABLE]
Our long-term success depends on our ability to efficiently operate our facilities, to continue to develop our product lines and technologies, and to focus on developing our product markets. To achieve these goals, it is important that we attract, motivate, and retain highly talented individuals who are committed to our values and goals. 
The Compensation Committee has the responsibility to establish, in consultation with management, our compensation philosophy for our senior executive officers and to implement and oversee a compensation program consistent with such philosophy. This group of 
20    LSB Industries Proxy Statement 
Executive Compensation senior executive officers includes the named executive officers, as well as our other executive officers. 
A primary objective of the Compensation Committee is to ensure that the compensation paid to the senior executive officers provides appropriate incentives for superior performance, aligns their interests with our stockholders, and is fair, reasonable, and competitive. 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for approval of all decisions for the compensation of our named executive officers. 
The three elements of total direct compensation for our executives are: (i) base salary, (ii) short-term incentive and (iii) long-term incentive. Unlike base salary, which is fixed annually, short-term and long-term incentive awards each represent variable compensation. These three elements are balanced such that each executive has an appropriate amount of compensation that is contingent on performance across both near and long-term horizons.

Executive Compensation 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives 
In 2018 the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the management team, initiated a review of our compensation program, partially in response to input from stockholders and constituents, but also in our normal review of executive employment agreements that were due to renew. As a result of this review, we made changes to the agreements with our executives, including changing agreements to one year terms and eliminating guaranteed equity grants. We also modified certain elements of our long-term incentive compensation program, including the elimination of single trigger equity vesting upon change in control ("CiC"), removal of 100% stock vesting on CiC, and implementation of a policy splitting grants 50/50 between performance-based and time-based vesting to align our program more closely to the performance of the Company. We did not make any substantial changes to the short-term component of the Company's compensation program. While it has always been our philosophy to align the compensation of our executives and employees with the stockholders, we believe the modifications to our compensation program more clearly ties the executive compensation program to the interests of our stockholders. Further, the program as modified, holds our named executive officers accountable for short-term and long-term performance, manages risk taking within the parameters of our philosophy, and supports the guiding principles that drive our overall compensation philosophy. The elements of our compensation program have specific objectives and the overall program is designed to reward annual and sustained performance over the long-term. We follow the same program for all senior management but vary pay mix by job responsibility level and include additional pay for performance factors for our most senior employees. In addition, the Company adopted an anti-hedging policy and a claw-back policy as part of the review of the compensation program. These policies are available on the Investors section of the Company's website at www.lsbindustries.com. The table below describes the elements of our compensation program and how each supports our compensation philosophy:

Executive Compensation 
Setting Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee annually sets cash and non-cash executive compensation to reward the named executive officers for achievement of, and to motivate the named executive officers to achieve, near-term and long-term business objectives. The Compensation Committee also reviews the compensation information of our peer companies, as provided by our compensation consultants. As described in more detail below, in 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Steven Hall & Partners as compensation consultants to assist the Compensation Committee in conducting its review of our compensation program. This information is used to determine whether our compensation amounts are within the range of similar companies, as further described below. We do not benchmark the amount of total compensation or any material element of compensation. 
The Compensation Committee also considers the allocation between cash and non-cash compensation amounts as well as near-term and long-term compensation, but does not have a specific formula or required allocation between such compensation types. In each case, such allocation is considered as part of the overall compensation determination. 
During 2018, the Compensation Committee compared the Chief Executive Officer's total compensation to the total compensation of our other named executive officers. However, the Compensation Committee has not established a target ratio between total compensation of the Chief Executive Officer and the median total compensation level for the next lower tier of management. The Compensation Committee also considers internal pay equity among the named executive officers and in relation to the next lower tier of management and average compensation of all employees to maintain compensation levels that are consistent with the individual contributions and responsibilities of those executive officers. The Compensation Committee does not consider amounts payable under severance agreements when setting the annual compensation of the named executive officers. 
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee annually reviews and adjusts salaries based on changes in the market, responsibilities and performance against job expectations, strategic importance, and experience and tenure. The following table sets forth the base salaries for each of our named executive officers as of the end of 2018. The Committee recommended changes to the base salary for named executive officers for 2019 based upon the review of the compensation program and the changes in the executive management team that took place at the end of the year.

Executive Compensation 
Short-Term (Annual) Incentive Plan 
Executive officers participate in the Company's Short-Term Incentive Plan (the "STI Plan"). The STI Plan is our annual performance pay plan developed and instituted in 2016. The STI Plan provides the opportunity for annual cash payments tied directly to the achievement of key financial and operational goals. The Compensation 
 Committee sets goals derived from our strategic plan that are designed to align the interests of management with the interests of our stockholders. The goals for 2018, and our performance compared to those goals are shown below. We did not make substantial changes to the STI Plan as part of the program review in 2018.

(3)  Mr. Diesch, our EVP-Manufacturing had different targets for EBITDA, production,  sales and maintenance based on the operational focus of his position. His 2018 STI Plan targets were 30% for EBITDA, 30% for NH3 Production, 10% for sales and 25% for maintenance. With the variances in the targets Mr. Diesch's percentage  payout equaled 45.9% of target.  
[END TABLE]
Payment to an executive officer under the STI Plan is calculated as follows: 
Base Salary x Target Payout Percentage x Company Performance 
Company performance is measured against the achievement of the performance goals. Each performance goal is measured independently of other goals. Company performance for 2018 was 42.8% as shown in the table above.

(1)  Although Mr. Greenwell resigned from the Company effective December 30, 2018, pursuant to the terms of his  employment agreement he received a payout under the STI Plan for 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Long-Term (Equity) Incentive Plan 
We award long-term performance pay to our named executive officers under the terms of the 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "LTI Plan") that was approved by stockholders at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Compensation Committee, with the input of its independent compensation consultant, designed the LTI Plan to align named executive officer compensation with stockholders' interests and to serve as a retention tool. The Compensation Committee believes the LTI Plan will allow us to continue to motivate our named executive officers through the grant of stock awards and will also increase the Compensation Committee's flexibility to grant different types of equity, equity-based, and cash awards in the future. As a result of our 2018 compensation plan review, the Compensation Committee determined to amend the program to eliminate the guaranteed time-based equity grants from the named executive's employment agreements and instead evaluate each named executive officer's performance on an annual basis and make appropriate discretionary equity awards. Additionally, the Compensation Committee instituted a policy of splitting the equity grants between time-based grants and performance-based grants. Beginning with the December 30, 2018 equity grants, future LTI Plan grants for the named executive awards will be split 50/50 between time-based and performance-based awards. The Compensation Committee and management also agreed to change the vesting terms granted under the LTI Plan in the event of a CiC or other termination of employment. 
Our long-term incentive plans currently consist of time-based restricted share grants and performance-based share grants as determined by the Compensation Committee on an annual basis. Both types of awards generally vest over a three-year period. Time-based awards vest one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. Performance-based awards vest at the end of the three-year performance measurement period. Beginning with the grants in December of 2018 the Company initiated a program whereby 50% of each executive's grants under the LTI Plan will be performance-based and 50% will be time-based. We believe both award types link the value of payments to the long-term results of the Company. 
Effective with the December 30, 2018 grants, the performance-based share grants are tied to our free cash flow, fixed costs per ton of ammonia (NH3) measured annually over a three year period and modified based on our ranking relative to total stockholder return (share price appreciation plus dividends reinvested) ("TSR") versus the companies in the 2019 peer group over a three-year measurement period. The actual number of shares that will vest will be based on the performance of the company against the metrics set out above. The threshold performance for free cash flow is 70% and for fixed costs per ton of NH3 is 50% of the targeted improvement with a maximum for each of 120% of target. The TSR modifier will adjust the overall actual performance up or down by as much as 25% based on the Company's TSR versus the Peer Group average TSR. 
The performance grants made to Mr. Diesch prior to 2018 are tied to our TSR versus the companies in the 2018 peer group over a three-year measurement period. The actual number of shares that will vest will be equal to the aggregate number of shares granted multiplied by the applicable TSR payout percentage. TSR payout percentages will be determined using a non-linear interpolation between threshold and target and between target and maximum. The threshold TSR is 25%. If actual Company TSR over the applicable three-year period is at or below 25% as compared to the TSR of the peer group, there will be no earned award. 
LSB Industries Proxy Statement    25 
Executive Compensation 
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits 
We and the Compensation Committee believe that perquisites are necessary and appropriate parts of total compensation that contribute to our ability to attract and retain superior executives. Accordingly, the Company provided our named executive officers a limited number of perquisites that are reasonable and consistent with our overall compensation program. 
In 2018, we provided an automobile for business use by Messrs. Diesch and Greenwell and an automobile allowance to Mr. Behrman. 
The Compensation Committee periodically reviews the levels of perquisites provided to the named executive officers to determine whether such perquisites are consistent with our compensation policies. 
Consideration of Stockholder Say-On-Pay Advisory and Say-on-Frequency Votes 
At our annual meeting of stockholders held in May 2018, 66% of the total votes cast on our say-on-pay proposal approved the compensation of our named executive officers for 2018 on a non-binding, advisory basis. The Compensation Committee and the Board believes that this affirms our stockholders' support of our approach to executive compensation. However, as this was a decrease from the 2017 say-on-pay advisory vote, we took the results of the vote on our say-on-pay proposal in consideration as we completed our review of the compensation program in 2018. Additionally, as part of our regular engagement with our stockholders and to better understand the concerns relating to our compensation program, management and the Compensation Committee held discussions with stockholders representing approximately 70% of our outstanding stock. The concerns and comments raised by our stockholders related to our compensation program were considered by the Compensation Committee as it completed the review of the compensation program and ultimately in the changes made to the program. 
The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the feedback it receives from stockholders and proxy advisory services firms when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers, including when negotiating any future employment agreements. 
In accordance with the advisory vote on the frequency of the stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation submitted to stockholders at the Company's Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in May 2018, the Company will continue to hold a stockholder advisory vote on executive compensation every year until the next required advisory vote on the frequency of such votes which, in accordance with applicable law, will occur no later than the Company's annual meeting of stockholders in 2023. 
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions 
Our Chief Executive Officer annually reviews the performance of each of our named executive officers (other than his own) and provides recommendations to the Compensation Committee with respect to salary, STI Plan and LTI Plan compensation, and other benefits. The Compensation Committee reviews these recommendations while considering the compensation philosophy and objectives and exercises its discretion in accepting or modifying the recommended compensation. Historically, the Compensation Committee has generally adopted the compensation recommended by the Chief Executive Officer. In determining compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee reviews his responsibilities and performance. Such review includes interviewing our Chief Executive Officer and consideration of the Compensation Committee's observations of his performance during the applicable year. When appropriate, named executive officers are invited by the Compensation Committee to provide insight regarding Company and individual performance and feedback regarding compensation structure. Named executive officers are not present at any meeting of the Compensation Committee while their own compensation is being discussed or determined. 
Role of Compensation Consultants in Compensation Decisions 
As previously discussed, the Compensation Committee undertook a full review of the Company's executive compensation program in 2018. The Committee engaged Steven Hall & Partners ("Hall & Partners"). As a part of this review and Hall & Partners was tasked with assessing all elements of our pay programs, advising of potential changes to the program and providing market intelligence on compensation trends, views and recommendations with respect to our compensation programs, and analyses and recommendations with respect to the amount or form of senior executive and director compensation. The Compensation Committee, in consultation with Hall & Partners, completed a full review of the elements of compensation, separately and as part of the broader program. As a result of this review, with the assistance of Hall & Partners, the Committee made substantial changes to the Company's 
26    LSB Industries Proxy Statement 
Executive Compensation 
LTI Plan and to the form and structure of the executive employment agreement. 
At the request of the Compensation Committee, Mr. Steven Hall attended the May 3, 2018 and September 13, 2018 meetings of the Compensation Committee and held additional consultations with the Compensation Committee, particularly as part of the 2018 compensation program review. Hall & Partners did not provide any services to us in 2018 other than the executive and director compensation advisory services provided to the Compensation Committee. 
Hall & Partners reports directly to the Chair of the Compensation Committee but partners with management, at the request of the Compensation Committee, to ensure the Compensation Committee receives the most comprehensive information for decision making. 
The Compensation Committee analyzed the independence of Hall & Partners pursuant to the SEC rules and NYSE listing standards and determined that the engagement did not raise any conflict of interest that would prevent Hall & Partners from independently representing the Compensation Committee. In reaching this conclusion, the Compensation Committee considered the factors relevant to Hall & Partners' independence from management, including the factors set forth in the NYSE listing standards. 
Peer Group Review 
To ensure that our executive compensation program provides competitive compensation opportunities that are necessary to attract and retain well-qualified executives, the Compensation Committee reviews the level and mix of compensation for our Chief Executive Officer and other NEOs against the compensation provided by a group of peer companies (in addition to survey data provided by Steven Hall Partners). The Compensation Committee also uses these peer companies to consider the relative performance of our Company with respect to the TSR performance measures in our LTI Plan. As part of the 2018 Compensation Review the Compensation Committee adjusted the Peer Groups for 2019. The 2018 and 2019 Peer Groups are set out here.

Executive Compensation 
Management Stock Ownership Guidelines 
Beginning in April 2017, the Compensation Committee approved stock ownership guidelines that ensure that the interests of our named executive officers are aligned with the interests of our stockholders by requiring them to hold significant levels of Company stock. In keeping with our overall compensation philosophy, we believe that the equity ownership levels that they are required to maintain are high enough to assure our stockholders of our named executive officers' commitment to long-term value creation. The terms of our Stock Ownership Guidelines are set out below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Term    Component/Description      
 Target Ownership Amount    Chief Executive Officer    5x base salary 
 Shares Counted Towards  Ownership     ∎  Shares  owned outright or held in trust   ∎  Time-based vesting restricted stock or restricted stock units   ∎  The target number of any performance shares  or units

[END TABLE]
As of December 31, 2018, each of Messrs. Behrman and Foster exceeded the stock ownership guidelines. Mr. Diesch and Ms. Maguire are currently in compliance with the policy and have until April 2022 and 
 December 30, 2024, respectively, to meet the stock ownership guidelines. At December 31, 2018, Mr. Greenwell was no longer employed by the Company and is not subject to the ownership guidelines. 
Tax and Accounting Implications 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code") provides that we may not deduct, for federal income tax purposes, compensation in excess of $1 million paid to our Chief Executive Officer and each of the three other most highly-compensated officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) whose compensation is required to be disclosed to our stockholders under the federal securities laws in any taxable year. However, compensation in excess of $1 million may be deducted if it is "performance-based compensation" or qualifies for one of the other exemptions from the deductibility limit. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted on December 22, 2017, substantially modified Section 162(m) of the Code and, among other things, eliminated the performance-based exception to the $1 million deduction limit effective as of January 1, 2018. As a result, beginning in 2018, compensation paid to certain executive officers in excess of $1 million will generally be nondeductible, whether or not it is performance-based. In addition, beginning in 2018, the executive officers subject to Section 162(m) of the Code (the "Covered Employees") will include any individual who served as the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer at any time during the taxable year and the three other most highly compensated officers (other than the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) for the taxable year, and once an individual becomes a Covered Employee for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016, that 
30    LSB Industries Proxy Statement 
Executive Compensation individual will remain a Covered Employee for all future years, including following any termination of employment. 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act includes a transition rule under which the changes to Section 162(m) of the Code described above will not apply to compensation payable pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and is not materially modified after that date. To the extent applicable to our existing contracts and awards, the Compensation Committee may avail itself of this transition rule. However, because of uncertainties as to the application and interpretation of the transition rule, no assurances can be given at this time that our existing contracts and awards, even if in place on November 2, 2017, will meet the requirements of the transition rule. Moreover, to maintain flexibility in compensating executive officers in a manner designed to promote varying corporate goals in the best interest of the company, the Compensation Committee does not limit its actions with respect to executive compensation to preserve deductibility under Section 162(m) of the Code if the Compensation Committee determines that a given action is otherwise in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
We account for stock-based payments, including our incentive and nonqualified stock options and restricted stock awards, in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("FASB ASC Topic 718"). FASB ASC Topic 718 requires us to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and members of our Board based on the grant date "fair value" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the executive compensation tables required by the federal securities laws, even though the recipient of the awards may never realize any value from their awards. While we consider the expense resulting from the application of FASB ASC Topic 718 when granting our stock-based compensation awards to ensure that it is reasonable, the amount of this expense is not the most important factor that the Compensation Committee considers when making equity-award decisions. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
Our compensation program, which applies to all employees including named executive officers, is designed to provide competitive levels of reward that are responsive to company and individual performance but do not incentivize risk taking that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In reaching our conclusion that our compensation policies do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us, we examined the various elements of our compensation programs and policies and our risk mitigation controls. In particular, numerous factors were considered, including: 
Senior executives representing our legal and compliance, human resources, finance, and audit functions, as well as the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, are involved in this review process, which is conducted under the oversight of the Compensation Committee.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
Employment Agreements 
As previously discussed, during nearly all of 2018, we were party to employment agreements with Messrs. Greenwell, Behrman, Diesch and Foster which provide, among other things, certain severance benefits in the event an executive officer's employment terminates under specific circumstances (the "2016 Employment Agreements"). Additionally, on December 30, 2018 we entered into new agreements with Ms. Maguire and Messrs. Berhman and Foster and on February 11, 2019 with Mr. Diesch (the "2018 Employment Agreements"). The 2018 Employment Agreements replaced the 2016 Employment Agreements for Messrs. Behrman, Diesch and Foster. The provisions related to potential payments upon termination or change in control remain the same in the 2016 and the 2018 Employment Agreements. 
Severance Payments and Benefits under the Employment Agreements 
The employment agreements with our named executive officers provide for potential severance payments upon the termination of a named executive officer's employment in certain situations, including in connection with a "change in control," without "cause" by the Company or for "good reason" by the executive, due to nonrenewal by the Company and upon the death or permanent disability of the executive (as each term is defined in the named executive officers' employment agreement). 
Termination for Cause, without Good Reason, or due to Executive's Nonrenewal. In the event of an executive's termination by the Company for "cause" or by the executive without "good reason," the Company has no severance obligation to the executive other than payment of accrued obligations, which are (i) earned but unpaid base salary through the date of termination, (ii) any employee benefits to which the executive has a vested entitlement as of the date of termination, (iii) accrued but unused vacation, and (iv) approved but unreimbursed eligible business expenses. 
Death or Permanent Disability. Under the terms of the employment agreements, in the event of an executive's death or termination on account of becoming permanently disabled, the agreements will terminate and the executive will be entitled to (i) the payment of accrued obligations and (ii) payment of a pro-rata portion of his or her annual bonus determined and paid in accordance with our regular bonus practices (other than for Mr. Diesch under the 2016 Diesch Agreement), which pro rata portion will be based on the time the executive was employed during the applicable vesting period. 
Termination without Cause, for Good Reason or due to Company's Nonrenewal. If the executive is terminated by the Company without "cause," by the executive for "good reason" or by the Company's proper notice of nonrenewal of the employment agreement, the executive will be entitled to (i) payment of a pro rata portion of his or her annual bonus based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance criteria for the year in which the executive's employment terminates and paid in accordance with our regular bonus practices (other than for Mr. Diesch under the 2016 Diesch Agreement); (ii) payment of a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of one times (or two times in the case of Mr. Greenwell under the terms of the 2016 Employment Agreements and Mr. Behrman under the terms of the 2018 Employment Agreements) the sum of his or her then-current base salary and target bonus (or in the case of Mr. Diesch, 12 months of his base salary only, under the 2016 Diesch Agreement) payable on the first payroll date following the executive's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims; (iii) continued participation in our medical, dental and hospitalization insurance coverage for himself and his or her qualified dependents on the same terms in effect immediately prior to the termination for a period of 18 months with the employer portion of the continued coverage paid by us (other than for Mr. Diesch under the 2016 Diesch Agreement); and (iv) accelerated vesting of all equity awards otherwise unvested as of the date of his or her termination of employment under the 2016 Employment Agreements. The provisions for accelerated stock vesting are not included in the 2018 and 2019 Employment Agreements. 
Change in Control. If a named executive officer is employed by us at the time of a change in control and his or her employment is terminated without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" within twenty-four months of the change in control (or for Mr. Diesch, during the period beginning six months before and ending twelve months following the change in control under the 2016 Diesch Agreement), the executive will be entitled to (i) payment of a pro rata portion of his or her annual bonus based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance criteria for the year in which the executive's employment terminates and paid in accordance with our regular bonus practices (other than for Mr. Diesch under the 2016 Diesch Agreement); (ii) payment of a lump sum cash payment equal to the product of two times (or three times in the case of Mr. Greenwell under the terms of the 2016 Employment Agreements and Mr. Behrman under the terms of the 2018 Employment Agreements) the sum of his or her then-current base salary and target bonus payable on the first payroll date following the executive's execution and non-revocation of a general release of claims; (iii) continued participation in our medical, dental and hospitalization insurance coverage for himself and his

Executive Compensation Tables or her qualified dependents on the same terms in effect immediately prior to the termination for a period of 18 months with the employer portion of the continued coverage paid by us (other than for Mr. Diesch under the 2016 Diesch Agreement); and (iv) accelerated vesting of all equity awards otherwise unvested as of the date of his or her termination of employment under the 2016 Employment Agreements. The provisions for accelerated stock vesting are not included in the 2018 and 2019 Employment Agreements.

Table of Severance Benefits 
The following table summarizes the dollar amounts of potential payments to each named executive officer upon a qualifying termination of employment or change in control pursuant to the terms of their employment and severance agreements, as applicable, assuming that the events described in the table occurred on December 31, 2018, when the closing price of the Company's common stock was $5.52. The values below are our best estimates of the severance payments and benefits the executives would receive upon a termination of employment or a change in control as of December 31, 2018 and we believe the amounts are calculated using reasonable assumptions. All amounts are before taxes, which would reduce amounts ultimately received by our named executive officers. The table is only intended to summarize various terms of the employment agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the actual agreements, copies of which are on file with the SEC.

CEO Pay Ratio 
Our CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated pursuant to Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. We identified the median employee by examining the income set out on form W-2 for all individuals, including our CEO, who were employed by the Company on December 31, 2018. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time or seasonal basis, as of the end of the year. We believe the use of the W-2 income for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure. 
Mr. Behrman's 2018 total annual compensation was $2,934,722 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Our median employee's total annual compensation for 2017 was $60,754. As a result, the ratio of Mr. Behrman's total compensation to that of our median employee was 48 to 1. 
Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
On April 26, 2017, the Board unanimously adopted the LSB Industries, Inc. Stock Ownership Guidelines. The Stock Ownership Guidelines require each non-employee director (other than Messrs. Jonathan Bobb and Kanna Kitamura) to own shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of at least $250,000 (2 times the non-employee director retainer) by the later of (i) five years following the effective date of the guidelines (April 26, 2022) or (ii) the fifth anniversary of a director's election to the Board.

(2)  Director fees for Messrs. Bobb and Genender and Ms. Kitamura, who joined the Board effective December 29, 2018,  are paid to LSB Funding and/or Eldridge Business Services LLC. Because the LTI Plan does not allow payment in shares to corporate entities, Messrs. Bobb and Genender received an additional cash grant in the amount of $62,500 in lieu of the grant of  restricted stock units as determined by the Compensation Committee. Ms. Kitamura will also receive cash compensation in lieu of the grant of restricted stock in 2019. Due to his significant stock holdings in the Company, the Board agreed to  exempt Mr. B. Golsen from receiving a portion of his director fees in the form of restricted stock units and his director fees are paid entirely in cash.

This amount does not reflect the actual value  that may be recognized by the directors. All of the restricted stock units awarded to our non-employee directors in 2018 will vest on May 24, 2021. The aggregate number of stock awards outstanding as of  December 31, 2018 for each non-employee director who served on the Board during 2018 was as follows: Mr. Bobb: 0 restricted stock units; Mr. Genender: 0 restricted stock units; Mr. B.

Executive Compensation Tables 
On April 19, 2016 we amended and restated our director compensation policy ("Director Policy") to include: 
Cash fees earned under the Director Policy are earned on a calendar-quarter basis and are paid in arrears not later than the 15th day following the end of each calendar quarter. Such cash fees are prorated to reflect the period of year during which the director was not a member of the Board. Additionally, under the Director Policy, restricted stock units are granted on the first business day following our annual meeting of stockholders each year. The number of restricted stock units will be determined by dividing $62,500 by the closing price of our common stock on the first business day following our annual meeting of stockholders.

Securities Ownership 
Security Ownership of 5% Owners 
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of our common stock and preferred stock as of March 12, 2019, held by beneficial owners of 5% or more of each class of our common stock and voting preferred stock. 
The amounts and percentage of units beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or "investment power," which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of March 12, 2019. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed a beneficial owner of securities as to which he has no economic interest. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all stock shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners 
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of each class of our common stock and voting preferred stock as of March 12, 2019, held by (1) directors and director nominees; (2) each named executive officer listed in this Proxy Statement; and (3) all current directors and named executive officers as a group. 
The amounts and percentage of units beneficially owned are reported on the basis of regulations of the SEC governing the determination of beneficial ownership of securities. Under the rules of the SEC, a person is deemed to be a "beneficial owner" of a security if that person has or shares "voting power," which includes the power to vote or to direct the voting of such security, or "investment power," which includes the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security. A person is also deemed to be a beneficial owner of any securities of which that person has a right to acquire beneficial ownership within 60 days of March 12, 2019. Under these rules, more than one person may be deemed a beneficial owner of the same securities and a person may be deemed a beneficial owner of securities as to which he has no economic interest. Except as indicated by footnote, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all stock shown as beneficially owned by them, subject to community property laws where applicable.

Securities Ownership 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, requires our directors, officers, and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's common stock to file with the SEC reports of holdings and changes in beneficial ownership of the Company's stock. Based solely on a review of copies of the Forms 3, 4 and 5 furnished to us with respect to 2018, or written representations that no 
 Form 5 was required to be filed, we believe that during 2018 all our directors and officers and beneficial owners of more than 10% of the Company's common stock timely filed their required Forms 3, 4, or 5, except Kanna Kitamura filed her Form 3 late, and Cheryl Maguire filed her Form 3 and first Form 4 late due to delays in obtaining Form IDs from the SEC for both filers.
