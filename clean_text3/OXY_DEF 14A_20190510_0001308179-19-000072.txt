Performance
2018 was a year of financial and operational success at Occidental. Executing on our strategy, we generated net income of $4.1 billion and delivered a peer-leading return on capital employed(1) of 14%. With outstanding performance across our business segments, we returned over $3.6 billion to our stockholders through our sector-leading dividend and our share repurchase program.
Oversight
The Board continued to provide comprehensive oversight of our long-term strategic direction. The Board discusses strategy at each regularly scheduled meeting and annually dedicates one board meeting to an in-depth strategic review. During the 2018 strategy review, directors engaged in robust discussions with senior leaders from the Oil and Gas, Midstream and Marketing, and Chemical business segments and key corporate functions, including Compliance, Community Engagement, Public Affairs and Social Responsibility. The directors also received the latest updates from the Oxy Low Carbon Ventures team, whose mission is to promote innovative low-carbon technologies that drive cost efficiencies to grow our business while reducing emissions.
Engagement
We value your views. If you would like to write to the Board, you may address your correspondence to the Board of Directors, in care of the Corporate Secretary, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, 5 Greenway Plaza, Suite 110, Houston, Texas 77046.

Director Nominations
The Board is committed to recruiting and nominating directors for election who will collectively provide the Board with the necessary diversity of skills, backgrounds and experiences to meet Occidental's ongoing needs and support oversight of our business strategy and priorities. In recommending candidates for election to the Board, the Corporate Governance, Nominating and Social Responsibility Committee (Governance Committee) evaluates a candidate's character; judgment; skill set and experience in light of Occidental's current and future needs and strategic priorities; independence; other time commitments, including other public and private company board memberships; and any other factors that the Governance Committee deems relevant. In addition, in determining whether to recommend incumbent directors for re-election to the Board, the Governance Committee also reviews and considers the director's board and committee meeting attendance; the level of support that the director's nomination received at the most recent annual stockholders' meeting; and the well-roundedness of the Board as a whole.
In 2019, the Governance Committee recommended to the Board, and the Board approved, the nomination of Spencer Abraham, Eugene L. Batchelder, Margaret M. Foran, Carlos M. Gutierrez, Vicki Hollub, William R. Klesse, Jack B. Moore, Avedick B. Poladian and Elisse B. Walter to serve for a one-year term ending at the 2020 Annual Meeting, but in any event, until his or her successor is elected and qualified, unless ended earlier due to his or her death, resignation, disqualification or removal from office. Messrs. Howard Atkins and John Feick will retire from the Board effective at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board thanks them for their years of service to Occidental.

Summary of Director Nominee Core Competencies and Composition Highlights
The following chart summarizes the competencies that the Board considers valuable to effective oversight of the Company, and illustrates how the current Board members individually and collectively represent these key competencies. The lack of an indicator for a particular item does not mean that the director does not possess that qualification, skill or experience. We look to each director to be knowledgeable in these areas; rather, the indicator represents that the item is a core competency that the director brings to the Board.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board's Corporate Governance Policies establish Occidental's governance framework. The Corporate Governance Policies address the structure and operation of the Board of Directors, including matters related to director independence; retirement; outside board memberships; the role of the Board's Independent Chairman; director stock ownership; and Board and Committee performance evaluations. In addition to the Corporate Governance Policies, the Board has established other stand-alone governance policies, including a policy on stockholder rights plans, a confidential voting policy and an independent compensation consultant policy. Occidental's governance policies are reviewed and updated periodically, in light of changing regulations, evolving best practices and stockholder feedback. The corporate governance policies are available on our website at www.oxy.com/investors/Governance.
Occidental's corporate governance practices generally align with the Investor Stewardship Group's Corporate Governance Framework for U.S. Listed Companies.
Corporate Governance Highlights
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    18
Stockholder Engagement
Occidental is committed to regular and transparent communication and engagement with its stockholders and other stakeholders. Occidental proactively offers engagement meetings with stockholders collectively representing over a majority of shares outstanding, and responds to engagement requests as they are received. Feedback from these meetings is shared with directors through senior management reports to the Board and its committees and by virtue of independent director participation in various stockholder engagements throughout the year.
2018 Engagement Process. In the spring of 2018, we reached out to our largest stockholders and other interested environmental, social and governance (ESG) stakeholders to discuss matters related to the 2018 Annual Meeting and to gather feedback on our first climate report publication. In the fall, we conducted a broad-based engagement, and offered telephonic or in-person meetings with stockholders collectively representing a majority of Occidental's shares outstanding to engage on ESG issues, including climate-related risks and opportunities, and executive compensation. Occidental's stockholder engagement team, comprised of senior members from the environmental, health and safety, investor relations, corporate secretary and legal departments met with over 30 stockholders and other stakeholders to discuss these topics. One or more of our independent directors participated in several of these meetings, demonstrating the Board's commitment to transparent engagement and the value the Board places on directly hearing the views of our stockholders.
Responding to Feedback. Engagements in recent years have resulted in changes to Occidental's practices and disclosures regarding environmental matters, including the content of our 2018 and 2019 climate reports; matters related to corporate governance, including the adoption of proxy access; and the executive compensation program, including the addition of a second returns metric in the long-term incentive program beginning in 2018.
Sustainability and Social Responsibility
Occidental's social responsibility programs support the company's business objectives and are intended to positively affect the communities where we operate, our employees and the environment. By investing in programs and initiatives that manage operational impacts and address key stakeholder concerns, Occidental strengthens its community relationships and creates shared value for stakeholders and our business. Occidental categorizes its social responsibility commitments and ongoing initiatives into five pillars:
Reporting on Performance. Occidental's climate report, CDP Climate Report, CDP Water Report and an Annual Performance Summary Table with information regarding its environmental, health, safety and social performance are available for download on the Social Responsibility page of Occidental's website.
Board Oversight. At the Board level, oversight of sustainability and social responsibility issues are principally divided between two of our standing Board committees: the Environmental Committee and the Governance Committee. Combined, the membership of these committees includes all of our independent directors. The Environmental Committee reviews and discusses climate-related risks and opportunities with management and oversees Occidental's environmental, health and safety programs and performance. The Governance Committee oversees Occidental's public disclosures regarding ESG and sustainability matters.

Board Evaluation Process
Led by the Governance Committee, the Board conducts a robust annual evaluation of its performance and the performance of each of the Board's committees and the individual directors. The Governance Committee believes that board evaluations are a critical tool in assessing the composition and effectiveness of the Board, its committees and its directors, and presents an opportunity to identify areas of strength and areas capable of improvement. The annual Board evaluation includes an assessment of, among other things, whether the Board and its Committees have the necessary diversity of skills, backgrounds and experiences to meet Occidental's needs. The Governance Committee annually considers the format of its evaluation processes, which, in recent years, have intentionally included different formats, such as anonymous questionnaires, individual director interviews, and the use of a third-party facilitator. The 2018 Board evaluation process is summarized below.
[BEGIN TABLE]
DETERMINE THE PROCESS   In 2018, the Governance Committee recommended, and the Board approved, Board evaluations through          the use of: (i) anonymous written questionnaires, (ii) a skills matrix, and (iii) individual director interviews conducted          by the Governance Committee Chair. This process was intended to encourage candid feedback from directors to promote productive          discussions.     CONDUCT EVALUATIONS   Among other topics addressed, the Board and committee questionnaires solicited director opinions          related to committee and board effectiveness and performance; agenda topics and materials; skills; leadership; and, at          the board level, matters related to strategy. The Board evaluations also included open-ended questions that prompted each          director to reflect and comment on his or her own individual performance and contributions to the Board.

Director Selection and Recruitment
In recent years, the Board has identified director candidates through the use of independent search firms, third-party recommendations, and the recommendations of directors and executive officers. Additionally, it is the policy of the Governance Committee to consider director candidates recommended by stockholders pursuant to its Nominating Policy, discussed further on page 61. For a discussion of the factors that the Governance Committee considers in recommending candidates for election to the Board, see "Proposal 1: Election of Directors – Director Nominations" on page 11.
  Proxy Access for Stockholder-Nominated Director Candidates
Occidental's by-laws permit a group of up to 20 stockholders, collectively owning 3% or more of Occidental's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in Occidental's proxy materials directors constituting up to 20% of the Board, but not less than two directors, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) meet the requirements of Occidental's by-laws. For more information on proxy access and other procedures to recommend candidates to Occidental's Board of Directors, see "Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting" beginning on page 61.

  Director Education
Directors are provided with continuing education, including business-specific learning opportunities through site visits and briefing sessions led by internal experts or third parties on topics that are relevant to Occidental. Directors are also encouraged to attend additional continuing education programs designed to enhance the performance and competencies of individual directors and the Board of Directors. In 2018, directors participated in various corporate director and compliance programs held by universities and corporate director, governance and investor organizations, including the NYSE and the National Association of Corporate Directors, as attendees or as presenters.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation    23
  Director Attendance
The Board of Directors held six meetings in 2018, one of which was principally devoted to a strategic review session. Each of the directors attended more than 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the Board committees on which he or she served and which were held during the period that each director served. All of the directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Attendance at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders is expected of directors as if it were a regular meeting of the Board.
  Executive Sessions of the Independent Directors
The independent directors regularly meet in executive sessions at which no members of management are present. The independent directors held five executive sessions in 2018. The Board's Independent Chairman, Mr. Batchelder, chaired the executive sessions.
  Risk Oversight
The Board is responsible for overseeing Occidental's policies and procedures with respect to risk management, and it has empowered the Audit, Compensation, Environmental and Governance Committees with oversight of specific, material risks tailored to each committee's area of focus. Each of these committees is integral to the control and compliance aspects of risk oversight by the Board. Each committee meets regularly with management to review, as appropriate, compliance with existing policies and procedures and to discuss changes or improvements that may be required or desirable. Every committee met at least five times in 2018. The frequency of committee meetings is intended to allow each committee adequate time for in-depth review and discussion of matters associated with its areas of responsibility. Each committee regularly reports to the Board regarding the committee's discussion of issues and findings, as well as to make recommendations of appropriate changes or improvements.
  Related Party Transactions
Pursuant to Occidental's Conflict of Interest Policy and Code of Business Conduct, each director and executive officer has an obligation to avoid any activity, agreement, business investment or interest, or other situation that could be construed either as divergent from or in competition with Occidental's interest or as an interference with such person's primary duty to serve Occidental, unless prior written approval has been granted by the Audit Committee. All potential conflicts of interest must be reported to a designated compliance officer. A summary of the Conflict of Interest Policy is included in Occidental's Code of Business Conduct which can be found at www.oxy.com/Investors/Governance.
Pursuant to Occidental's written policy on related party transactions, the Governance Committee reviews relationships and transactions in which Occidental and its directors, executive officers, or their immediate family members participate if the amount involved exceeds $120,000. To help identify related party transactions, each director and executive officer must complete an annual questionnaire that requires disclosure of any transaction between Occidental and the director or executive officer or any of his or her affiliates or immediate family members. Additionally, the accounting department reviews Occidental's financial records for payments made to, or received from, related parties and the entities with which the related parties are affiliated, and reports any identified transactions to the legal department. The Governance Committee reviews and approves, ratifies or rejects identified related party transactions. In approving, ratifying or rejecting a related party transaction, the Governance Committee considers such information as it deems appropriate to determine whether the transaction is on reasonable and competitive terms and is fair to Occidental and its stockholders.
Pursuant to the policy, the Governance Committee identified one transaction that qualified as a related party transaction. Brent Vangolen, the son of Mr. Glenn Vangolen, an executive officer, is employed by Occidental as a production engineering manager for the domestic oil and gas segment. His total compensation for 2018 (consisting of his annual base salary, annual bonus and stock-based compensation) was approximately $215,000. He also participated in the general welfare and benefit plans of Occidental. Mr. Vangolen did not participate in the hiring of his son and does not participate in performance evaluations or compensation decisions regarding his son. Mr. Brent Vangolen's compensation and benefits are comparable with similarly situated employees of Occidental.
  Communications with Directors
Stockholders and other interested parties may communicate with any director by sending a letter to the director's attention in care of Occidental's Corporate Secretary, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, 5 Greenway Plaza, Suite 110, Houston, Texas 77046. The Corporate Secretary opens, logs and forwards all such correspondence (other than advertisements or other solicitations) to directors unless a director has requested that the Corporate Secretary forward correspondence unopened.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes the material elements, objectives and principles of Occidental's 2018 executive compensation program for its named executive officers, recent compensation decisions and the factors the Compensation Committee considered in making those decisions.
The named executive officers for 2018 are:
Executive Compensation Program Features
The 2018 executive compensation program for the named executive officers includes many best-practice features that are intended to enhance the alignment of compensation with the interests of Occidental's stockholders.

Executive Compensation Program Objectives
The Compensation Committee strives to maintain a compensation program that will attract, retain and motivate outstanding executives by providing incentives to reward them for superior performance that supports Occidental's long-term strategic objectives, whether in an up- or down-cycle commodity price environment, and is competitive with industry practices. The executive compensation program is intended to:
Recent Executive Compensation Program Changes
  Long-Term Incentive Program
Expanded the Use of Returns-Focused Metrics. In response to investor feedback, among other considerations, the Compensation Committee revised the long-term incentive program in 2018 to link a portion of long-term compensation to Occidental's absolute cash return on capital employed (CROCE) over a three-year period. CROCE is a transparent, full-cycle returns metric that can be calculated from Occidental's audited financial statements. CROCE is calculated by dividing cash return (annual net income plus after-tax net interest expense plus depreciation, depletion and amortization) by the average of the opening and closing balance of total debt plus total equity for each year. For purposes of the CROCE award, the CROCE attained during the performance period is calculated as the simple average of the CROCE for each of the three years in the performance period. The addition of CROCE in the long-term incentive program better aligns ultimate pay outcomes with Occidental's returns-focused strategy and promotes executive accountability for the efficient use of capital over a three-year performance period. During the 2017 and 2018 stockholder engagement programs, a significant portion of Occidental's stockholders expressed a preference for the addition of a return on capital metric in the long-term incentive program and viewed this change as an improvement to the program.
  Annual Cash Incentive
Added a Sustainability Metric to the Safety/Environmental Objective. The Compensation Committee expanded the Safety/Environmental objective of the Annual Cash Incentive award in 2018 to include a sustainability metric, with target performance conditioned on the demonstrable advancement of commercial opportunities for CCUS, which is an important feature of Occidental's strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business. CCUS is a process that captures man-made carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from sources such as coal-fired power plants, ethanol plants and cement production and then uses the CO2 in a manner that prevents it from entering the atmosphere, typically by sequestering (or permanently entrapping) the CO2 deep underground. For 2019, the Compensation Committee made Sustainability a stand-alone key corporate objective of the Annual Cash Incentive award, which increased the weighting of Sustainability from approximately 3% to 10% of the target company performance portion of the Annual Cash Incentive award. The Compensation Committee determined that this increase was appropriate in light of the increasing importance of Sustainability measures to Occidental's long-term strategy.
Refined the Financial Objective. Starting in 2018, the Compensation Committee replaced Returns on Net Invested Capital with CROCE as one of the two financial metrics underlying the Financial objective of the Annual Cash Incentive award. The Compensation Committee believes that it is important to include CROCE in both the Annual Cash Incentive award and long-term incentive program because maximizing cash returns over both shorter- and longer-term time horizons incentivizes the returns-focus and financial discipline that is critical to delivering on our value proposition over the long-term. The Compensation Committee determined that the overall percentage of executive compensation tied to CROCE was appropriately balanced against other compensation, as it comprised approximately 20% and 15% of the target direct compensation opportunity for Ms. Hollub and the other named executive officers in 2018, respectively.

Executive Compensation Program Considerations
In evaluating the appropriateness of the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee considers the results of Occidental's advisory vote to approve executive compensation (the Say-on-Pay vote) and other relevant factors, including:
[BEGIN TABLE]
At the 2018 Annual      Meeting, Occidental's Say-on-Pay vote received support from approximately 96% of the total votes cast. The Compensation Committee interpreted this result as an endorsement by stockholders of the current executive      compensation program and the expanded use of returns metrics      in the 2018 long-term incentive program, as previewed in the      2018 Proxy Statement.  96% Say-on-Pay Support

Stockholder Feedback on Executive Compensation. The Compensation Committee regularly receives feedback on the executive compensation program through Occidental's spring and fall stockholder engagement programs. During 2017 engagement meetings, many stockholders expressed a preference for a second performance-based metric in the long-term incentive program conditioned on Occidental's return on capital. As a commitment to Occidental's business strategy and in light of the views expressed by Occidental's stockholders, the Compensation Committee added CROCE to the long-term incentive program in 2018. During 2018 engagement meetings, stockholders generally continued to express support for the executive compensation program, and endorsed the addition of a sustainability metric in the Annual Cash Incentive award.

Elements of the 2018 Compensation Program
  Salary
The Compensation Committee believes that base salary should reward executives on a market-competitive basis for consistent performance of job requirements and the achievement of short-term goals. Salaries are reviewed by the Compensation Committee annually and as circumstances warrant. In determining base salary levels, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation surveys, publicly available peer company data, internal pay equity, individual responsibilities, and performance assessments. Base salary and "other" annual compensation (perquisites and certain other employee benefits) represented, on average, less than 16% of the 2018 compensation packages of the named executive officers, based on compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 40. For information regarding salary decisions for the named executive officers in 2018, see "Individual Compensation Considerations" beginning on page 35.
  Annual Cash Incentive
The Annual Cash Incentive award is intended to motivate executives to achieve superior company and individual performance over a one-year period. In the first quarter, the Compensation Committee approves individual target award amounts for each executive officer based on a review of compensation surveys, publicly available peer company data, the executive's prior-year award value, retention considerations, the balance of short- and long-term pay and internal pay equity. Potential payouts under the Annual Cash Incentive award range from 0% to 200% of the target award amount, based on actual company and individual performance. The amounts earned under the Annual Cash Incentive award for 2018, which were paid in the first quarter of 2019, are reflected in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40.
Setting the Annual Cash Incentive. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the objectives, metrics and targets underlying the Annual Cash Incentive award, and their relative weightings, with an aim to incentivize the named executive officers to excel in areas that are aligned with Occidental's business objectives. In the first quarter of 2018, the Compensation Committee approved company performance metrics related to Occidental's strategic, operational, financial, and safety/environmental goals. With respect to these metrics, the Compensation Committee set target performance goals that it believed were rigorous based on Occidental's detailed capital program and business plan, projections from the strategic planning team and business unit heads, prior-year results, and third-party forecasts relating to future market conditions and other external market factors. In 2018, the Compensation Committee also expanded the Safety/Environmental objective of the Annual Cash Incentive award to include a sustainability metric, with target performance conditioned on the demonstrable advancement of commercial opportunities for CCUS, which is an important feature of Occidental's strategy to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions while growing its business.
Weighting the Metrics. The Compensation Committee determined that the company performance metrics would comprise 80% of Ms. Hollub's target Annual Cash Incentive award, and 60% for the other named executive officers, with the remainder of the Annual Cash Incentive award opportunity linked to an assessment of the performance of the individual executive. The Compensation Committee determined to weight a larger portion of Ms. Hollub's Annual Cash Incentive award opportunity toward key company performance metrics because, as Chief Executive Officer, her leadership directly affects all aspects of the company's performance. The relative weightings of the Annual Cash Incentive award elements are shown below.

Annual Cash Incentive Award – Individual Performance Portion. The individual performance portion of the Annual Cash Incentive award (20% for Ms. Hollub and 40% for the other named executive officers) links compensation directly to the performance of the particular executive. In the first quarter, the Compensation Committee establishes the performance objectives for Ms. Hollub, and Ms. Hollub establishes the performance objectives for her leadership team. In evaluating Ms. Hollub's performance, the Compensation Committee principally considered the following performance goals:
For a detailed discussion of the Compensation Committee's considerations with respect to each named executive officer's individual performance and resulting payouts, please see "Individual Compensation Considerations" beginning on page 35.
  Long-Term Incentive Program
The majority of named executive officer compensation is determined by Occidental's long-term performance. In 2018, the long-term incentive program consisted of a performance-based TSR award, a performance-based CROCE award and a time-based RSU award, which are each payable solely in shares of common stock. The long-term incentive awards are intended to motivate and incentivize executives to achieve results (including stock price performance) that are consistent with Occidental's strategic business objectives. The Compensation Committee believes that long-term compensation should represent the largest portion of each named executive officer's total compensation package and that the levels of payout ultimately achieved should reflect Occidental's performance, both relative to peer company performance and on an absolute basis. During the process of determining each named executive officer's long-term incentive compensation package for 2018, the Compensation Committee evaluated many factors, including:
2018 Long-Term Incentive Program. The 2018 long-term incentive program consisted of two performance-based stock unit (PSU) awards (one based on relative TSR and the other based on absolute CROCE performance), and a time-based RSU award, with the majority of the target long-term incentive award opportunity weighted toward PSUs, as indicated below.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD MIX
Occidental Petroleum Corporation    31
Total Shareholder Return (TSR) PSU Award. The Compensation Committee believes that the comparison of Occidental's three-year TSR to peer companies' returns over the same period is an objective external measure of Occidental's effectiveness in translating its results into stockholder returns. TSR is the change in price of a share of common stock plus reinvested dividends, over a specified period of time, and is an indicator of management's achievement of long-term growth in stockholder value. Payout of the TSR award is based on Occidental's three-year TSR as compared to the three-year TSR of the 11 performance peer companies identified on page 34. The TSR award is denominated in PSUs, each of which is equivalent to one share of common stock. The percentage of such number of PSUs that will be payable at the end of the three-year performance period, which began January 1, 2018 and ends December 31, 2020, will depend on Occidental's relative TSR performance and Occidental's absolute TSR performance. If Occidental's absolute TSR is negative over the performance period, then, irrespective of Occidental's ranking within the peer group, the payout of the TSR award is capped at no more than target. A table illustrating the potential payout of the TSR award based on relative and absolute TSR performance is set forth below:
The cap on payout of the TSR award in instances of negative TSR performance over the performance period is intended to reinforce the pay-for-performance nature of the compensation program. The TSR award comprised 45% and 35% of Ms. Hollub's and the other named executive officers' target long-term incentive award opportunity for 2018, respectively. Cumulative dividend equivalents will be paid in cash at the end of the three-year performance period and will be paid only on the number of PSUs earned. Forfeiture and change in control provisions applicable to the TSR award are discussed in more detail in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control table and the accompanying footnotes, beginning on page 47.
Cash Return on Capital Employed (CROCE) PSU Award. The CROCE award is designed to focus executives on the efficient use of capital by promoting discipline in capital allocation decisions, which is critical to Occidental's returns-focused strategy. CROCE is a transparent measure of how efficiently Occidental uses its capital and is calculated from Occidental's audited financial statements with no adjustments for special items. The CROCE award is denominated in PSUs, each of which is equivalent to one share of common stock. The percentage of such number of PSUs that will be payable at the end of the three-year performance period, which began January 1, 2018 and ends December 31, 2020, will depend on Occidental's absolute CROCE during the performance period. The CROCE award comprised 25% and 20% of Ms. Hollub's and the other named executive officers' target long-term incentive award opportunity for 2018, respectively. Cumulative dividend equivalents will be paid in cash at the end of the three-year performance period and will be paid only on the number of PSUs earned. Forfeiture and change in control provisions applicable to the CROCE award are discussed in more detail in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control table and the accompanying footnotes, beginning on page 47. A table illustrating the potential payout of the CROCE award based on CROCE performance is set forth below:
Restricted Stock Unit (RSU) Award. The RSU award, which comprises the remainder of the 2018 long-term incentive program package, vests ratably over three years with one-third vesting on each of February 28, 2019, 2020 and 2021, subject to continued employment. The RSU award is denominated in restricted stock units, each of which is equivalent to one share of common stock. Payment for a vested RSU award will be made solely in shares of common stock. The shares of stock ultimately received by the named executive officer pursuant to the RSU award are subject to a two-year post-vesting holding period. Dividend equivalents are accrued and paid out upon vesting. Forfeiture and change in control provisions applicable to the RSU award are discussed in more detail in the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control table and the accompanying footnotes, beginning on page 47.

Other Compensation and Benefits
  Qualified Defined Contribution Plans
Occidental does not have a defined benefit pension plan that provides named executive officers a fixed monthly retirement payment. Instead, all salaried employees on the U.S. dollar payroll, including the named executive officers, are eligible to participate in one or more tax-qualified defined contribution plans.
Savings Plan. For 2018, the defined contribution 401(k) savings plan (Savings Plan) permitted employees to save a percentage of their annual salary up to the $275,000 limit set by IRS regulations, and employee pre-tax contributions were limited to $18,500. Employees may direct their contributions to a variety of investments. Occidental matches two dollars for every one dollar the employee contributes up to 2% of eligible pay, plus an additional dollar-for-dollar match on the next 3% of eligible pay. The named executive officers are fully vested in their account balances under the Savings Plan. The amounts contributed by Occidental to the Savings Plan are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40.
Retirement Plan. The defined contribution retirement plan (Retirement Plan) is funded annually through a reallocation process from the employee's Supplemental Retirement Plan II (SRP II) account balance (described below). Because it is not possible to determine the exact amount that could be contributed to the Retirement Plan without exceeding governmental limits until the end of the year, the reallocation process has been developed to maximize the amount contributed each year to a tax-qualified defined contribution plan. The Retirement Plan is company-funded, and employees may not contribute to the Retirement Plan. Except for Mr. Burgher, the named executive officers are fully vested in their account balances under the Retirement Plan. The amounts allocated to the Retirement Plan are included in the SRP II contributions by Occidental in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40.
  Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plans
Occidental maintains two nonqualified deferred compensation plans: (i) the SRP II, and (ii) the Modified Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). The purpose of the SRP II is to provide eligible employees, including the named executive officers, with benefits to compensate them for maximum limits imposed by law on the amount of contributions that may be made to Occidental's tax-qualified defined contribution plans. The purpose of the MDCP is to provide key management and highly compensated employees the ability to accumulate additional retirement income through deferrals of compensation.
Additional information regarding the terms and conditions of the SRP II and the MDCP is provided on page 45. Amounts contributed to the SRP II on behalf of the named executive officers are included in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40. Amounts of salary and bonus deferred by named executive officers who participate in the MDCP are included as compensation in the "Salary," and "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" columns of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40, as applicable. In addition, the contributions, aggregate earnings, withdrawals and aggregate balances for the named executive officers in the SRP II and MDCP with respect to 2018 are shown in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table on page 46. No above-market earnings were paid to the named executive officers in 2018 under either the SRP II or the MDCP.
  Other Personal Benefits
Occidental provides a limited number of other personal benefits for its named executive officers, which, in 2018, consisted principally of fees related to financial and tax preparation services, excess liability insurance, an annual physical and a tax gross-up related to spousal travel.
Participants in the Compensation Decision-Making Process
Role of the Independent Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee, comprised of independent members of the Board, is responsible for annually reviewing and approving all aspects of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, as well as annually reviewing and approving the compensation of all other named executive officers. In performing these duties, the Compensation Committee obtains input, advice and information from senior management, members of Occidental's Human Resources team and an independent compensation consultant, as further described below, throughout the year. The Compensation Committee also considers the views expressed by Occidental's investors and stockholder advisory groups in making executive compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee uses publicly available data regarding the executive compensation practices of its peer group (as defined below) as an additional tool, but does not benchmark executive compensation to a specific percentile within the peer group.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation    33
Role of Senior Management. Ms. Hollub, as Chief Executive Officer, makes recommendations regarding the compensation package for each of the other named executive officers to the Compensation Committee. Ms. Hollub and the senior executives responsible for Human Resources are present for a portion of each of the Compensation Committee meetings but no senior executive is present when decisions regarding his or her compensation is discussed and determined. Ms. Hollub's compensation package is set only by the Compensation Committee. Senior members of the Human Resources team and other members of senior management interact with the compensation consultant as necessary, and prepare materials for each Compensation Committee meeting to assist the Compensation Committee in its consideration and administration of executive compensation programs, plans and policies.
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC (Meridian) as its compensation consultant to provide advice on various executive compensation matters. Meridian has served as the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant since 2016. The Compensation Committee reviewed the independence of Meridian under SEC rules, the NYSE Listed Company Manual standards, and Occidental's Independent Compensation Consultant Policy and found Meridian to be independent and without conflicts of interest. Occidental also participates in compensation surveys conducted by compensation consultants, including the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, in order to better understand general external compensation practices, including with respect to executive compensation.
Role of Stockholders. Occidental maintains an ongoing dialogue with its investors through its spring and fall stockholder engagement programs. During these programs, members of Occidental's senior management team and, on a case-by-case basis, members of Occidental's Board, meet with investors telephonically or in person. Input from these meetings regarding Occidental's executive compensation practices and policies is taken into account by the Compensation Committee in making future compensation decisions.
Role of Peer Companies. In order to evaluate how Occidental's executive compensation program compares within the oil and gas industry, particularly with respect to award types, compensation mix, performance metrics and reported levels of compensation, the Compensation Committee reviews the executive compensation practices, programs and policies of its "compensation peer" companies, as identified below. The Compensation Committee also reviews and considers oil and gas industry compensation surveys and related materials. This information is used only as a reference and not to establish compensation benchmarks, as Occidental does not benchmark executive compensation to a specific percentile within the compensation peer group. The Compensation Committee also maintains a peer group of "performance peer" companies within the oil and gas industry, and the value of the long-term TSR awards is dependent on Occidental's three-year TSR performance as compared to the three-year TSR performance of the performance peer companies. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the peer companies to ensure that they have reasonably similar business strategies, represent a mix of integrated and independent oil and gas companies and generally compete against Occidental for investor dollars.

Compensation Decisions
Additional Compensation Policies and Practices
  Stock Ownership Guidelines
Occidental's stock ownership guidelines are intended to more closely align the interests of the named executive officers with those of the company's stockholders. The ownership requirements range from three–to-six times the officer's annual base salary, based on position, as illustrated below:
Unvested performance-based stock awards and performance-based stock units do not count toward satisfaction of the stock ownership guidelines. Officers subject to the guidelines are expected to comply within five years from the later of the effective date of the guidelines or the date the individual is named to a participating position. As of February 28, 2019, each of the named executive officers was in compliance with the guidelines.
  Equity Grant Practices
The Compensation Committee made equity grants pursuant to the long-term incentive program at its regularly scheduled February meeting. The grant date fair value of each of the CROCE and RSU awards is based on the closing price of Occidental's common stock on the NYSE on the day the Compensation Committee granted the awards, and the grant date fair value of the TSR award also incorporates the estimated payout percentage of the award as of the grant date. As specifically authorized by the terms of the 2015 LTIP, the Compensation Committee has delegated to Ms. Hollub the authority to grant equity awards in certain circumstances to new employees and to grant equity awards to Occidental's employees who are not executive officers.
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    38
  Potential Recoupment of Compensation Due to Misconduct
Occidental may recoup certain compensation from the executive officers in the event of misconduct pursuant to the terms of Occidental's Code of Business Conduct, the Annual Cash Incentive award and the 2015 LTIP. Occidental's Code of Business Conduct prohibits any officer, employee or director from violating or circumventing any law of the United States or a foreign country or engaging in unethical conduct during the course of his or her employment. The Audit Committee oversees compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and has put in place procedures, including a compliance hotline, to encourage prompt reporting of violations or suspected violations of the Code of Business Conduct, without fear of retaliation. In general, misconduct may have several consequences, including:
In addition, the 2015 LTIP includes a provision that gives Occidental the contractual right to recoup awards (i) where a participant has breached Occidental's Business Code of Conduct by violating applicable law or company policy or engaging in unethical conduct or (ii) pursuant to a policy to be adopted by Occidental to comply with Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which will generally require recoupment of incentive-based compensation if Occidental is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement.
Risk Assessment of Compensation Policies and Practices
Although the majority of the executive compensation program is performance-based, the Compensation Committee believes the program does not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk-taking. In reaching its conclusion, the Compensation Committee reviewed the findings of a risk-taking analysis performed by its independent compensation consultant, Meridian. The Compensation Committee concurred with Meridian's finding that Occidental's executive compensation program includes multiple features that appropriately control motivations for excessive risk-taking and that the compensation program does not encourage excessive risk-taking. The compensation features that are indicative of appropriate risk-taking include:
Compensation Committee Report
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the preceding Compensation Discussion and Analysis section for the year ended December 31, 2018. Based on these reviews and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

PREVIOUSLY GRANTED STOCK AWARDS VESTED IN 2018
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
  Supplemental Retirement Plan II
Employees whose participation in Occidental's tax-qualified defined contribution plans is limited by applicable tax laws are eligible to participate in Occidental's Supplemental Retirement Plan II (SRP II), which provides additional retirement benefits outside of those limitations.
Annual plan allocations for each participant restore the amounts that would have accrued for salary and Annual Cash Incentive under the qualified plans, but for the tax law limitations. Account balances are fully vested after three years of service and are payable following separation from service, or upon attainment of a specified age elected by the participant. Except for Mr. Burgher, each of the named executive officers is fully vested in his or her aggregate balance shown on page 46.
Interest on SRP II accounts is allocated daily to each participant's account. The amount of interest earnings is calculated using a rate equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury Note rate on the last business day of the processing month plus 2%, on a daily basis with monthly compounding.
  Modified Deferred Compensation Plan
Under the Modified Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP), the maximum amount of an executive officer's salary or Annual Cash Incentive that may be deferred for any one year is limited to $75,000. A participant's overall plan balance must be less than $1 million at the end of any given year to enable a participant to defer compensation for the subsequent year. Deferred amounts earn interest at a rate equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury Note rate plus 2%.
The following table sets forth the 2018 contributions, earnings, withdrawals and balances under the SRP II and the MDCP, to the extent the named executive officers participate in such plans. The footnotes provide information about other amounts that were reported as earned in the Summary Compensation Table on page 40 for 2018 and prior years.

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION
Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
Payments and other benefits provided to named executive officers in various termination circumstances or in connection with a change in control are subject to certain policies, plans and agreements. The material terms of these arrangements are summarized below. Except as described in this summary and in the Potential Payments table, Occidental does not have any other agreements or plans that will require compensation to be paid to named executive officers in the event of a termination of employment or a change in control.
Golden Parachute Policy. Occidental's Golden Parachute Policy provides that, subject to certain exceptions, Occidental will not grant Golden Parachute Benefits (as defined in the policy) to any senior executive that exceed 2.99 times his or her salary plus Annual Cash Incentive pay, unless the grant of such benefits is approved by a vote of Occidental's stockholders. The complete Golden Parachute Policy is available at www.oxy.com.
Outstanding Equity Awards. Awards granted to the named executive officers since 2015 (those granted under the 2015 LTIP) are subject to double-trigger vesting upon a "change in control" (as defined in the 2015 LTIP). Payout under each of the outstanding equity awards based on various termination circumstances or in connection with a change in control are described in more detail in the footnotes to the Potential Payments table on page 48.
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    46
  Potential Payments
In the table that follows, payments and other benefits provided to the active named executive officers in connection with various termination and change in control situations are set out as if the conditions for payment had occurred and the applicable triggering events took place on December 31, 2018, when the closing price of Occidental's common stock was $61.38.
The amounts shown in the following table are in addition to the payments and benefits that are potentially available to all full-time salaried U.S. dollar payroll employees, such as amounts vested under the Savings Plan and other tax-qualified retirement plans, amounts vested under Occidental's nonqualified deferred compensation plans, payment for accrued vacation up to a maximum accrual ceiling of 296 hours, and disability benefits, among others.
Actual amounts to be paid will depend on several factors, such as the date of each named executive officer's separation from Occidental or the occurrence of an actual change in control event, Occidental's ultimate achievement of performance goals underlying performance awards and the price of Occidental's common stock when such awards are earned, if at all. The disclosures below do not take into consideration any requirements under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code, which could affect, among other things, the timing of payments and distributions.
While amounts reported in the following table are expressed as an estimated cash value, all of the amounts reported are payable solely in shares of common stock, if at all. In addition, in circumstances of retirement, disability, death, or termination without cause, payout of performance-based long-term incentive awards is not accelerated, as such awards will not be paid out unless and until the performance goals underlying the awards are satisfied.

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
The Governance Committee periodically reviews non-employee director compensation and makes recommendations regarding changes to the Board. The Governance Committee last reviewed non-employee director compensation in 2017 with the assistance of Meridian Partners, LLC (Meridian). Meridian performed a robust review of Occidental's non-employee director compensation program, which included a detailed comparison of Occidental's non-employee director compensation program and practices against those of Occidental's peer companies (as defined on page 34) and against a broader comparator group of Fortune 250 companies based on market capitalization. Based on the market data presented by Meridian and the Governance Committee's analysis, the Governance Committee determined that the program was competitive and aligned with market practices and recommended to the Board that no changes be made to the program. Non-employee director compensation has remained unchanged since 2014.
Director Compensation Program
The non-employee directors receive a combination of cash, in the form of an annual retainer payable on a monthly basis, and stock-based compensation. Occidental does not provide option awards; non-equity incentive awards; or retirement plans for non-employee directors. The Independent Chairman of the Board and the Committee chairs receive additional compensation for their service due to the increased responsibilities that accompany these positions. Ms. Hollub does not receive any compensation for her service as a director.
The following table describes the components of the 2018 non-employee director compensation program:
  Annual Equity Award
The Board believes that director and stockholder interests should be aligned over the long term. In furtherance of this objective, the majority of non-employee director compensation is equity-based compensation. Directors may elect to receive their annual equity award in shares of common stock or in deferred common stock units.
Common Stock Award. Pursuant to the terms of the award, the director receives shares of common stock that are fully vested at grant, but subject to transfer restrictions. 50% of the shares may not be sold or transferred until the third anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50% may not be sold or transferred until the date of the director's separation from service; provided, however, that all of the shares become transferable in the event of certain change in control events or the director's separation from service.
Deferred Common Stock Unit Award. Pursuant to the terms of the award, the director receives deferred stock units that are fully vested at grant, but subject to transfer restrictions. Each deferred stock unit is equivalent to one share of common stock and payable in shares of common stock upon the satisfaction of the deferral period. 50% of the deferred stock units are payable upon the third anniversary of the grant date and the remaining 50% are payable on the date of the director's separation from service; provided, however, that all of the deferred stock units are payable in the event of certain change in control events or the director's separation from service.
  All Other Compensation
Directors are eligible to participate in the Occidental Petroleum Corporation Matching Gift Program, which matches contributions made by employees and directors to educational institutions and organizations, as well as arts and cultural organizations. The limit for such matching contributions was $10,000 in 2018. Occidental reimburses non-employee directors for expenses related to their Board service, including hotel, airfare, ground transportation and meals.
Occidental Petroleum Corporation    49
  Stock Ownership Guidelines
Non-employee directors are required to own a number of shares of common stock of Occidental having a value of not less than six times the annual cash retainer for non-employee directors within five years of election to the Board. As of March 1, 2019, each of our non-employee directors is in compliance with these guidelines.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation    51
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), Occidental's executive officers, directors and any beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of Occidental's equity securities are required to file, with the SEC, reports of ownership and changes in ownership of Occidental common stock. Copies of such reports are required to be furnished to Occidental. Based solely on its review of the copies of the reports furnished to Occidental and written representations that no additional reports were required, Occidental believes that, during 2018, all persons required to report filed the required reports on a timely basis under Section 16(a).
PAY RATIO
For 2018, the annual total compensation of the median compensated employee of Occidental was $124,103; the annual total compensation of Ms. Hollub for purposes of this pay ratio disclosure was $14,126,873; and the ratio of these amounts is approximately 114 to 1. This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on Occidental's payroll records and the methodology described below.
Pay Ratio Methodology. To identify the median "employee" (as defined by SEC rules), as well as to determine the annual total compensation of the median employee, we used certain permitted assumptions, adjustments, and estimates, as described further below. Because the SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
As permitted by SEC rules, for the 2018 pay ratio reported above, we used the same median employee that we used for our 2017 pay ratio, as we believe there has been no change in our employee population or employee compensation arrangements during the last fiscal year that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure.
Employee Population. We identified the median employee used for 2017 and 2018 from Occidental's employee population as of October 1, 2017. After excluding employees under the "de minimis exemption" (as described below), Occidental's employee population consisted of 6,960 employees located in the U.S.; 557 in Colombia; 2,647 in Oman; and 466 in Qatar. For purposes of identifying the median employee, Occidental was permitted to exclude up to 5% of its total employees who are non-U.S. employees. Occidental relied on this exemption to exclude the employee populations of the following jurisdictions, which collectively accounted for less than 5% of Occidental's total employee population of 10,978 as of October 1, 2017: Abu Dhabi (64); Belgium (2); Bolivia (65); Brazil (1); Canada (88); Chile (111); Hong Kong (4); Japan (2); Libya (1); Mexico (3); The Netherlands (1); and Singapore (6).
Compensation Measure to Identify Median Employee. To identify the median employee, we used the annual salary of each employee as of October 1, 2017, plus any annual bonus paid to each employee during 2017, each as reported in Occidental's payroll systems. We did not annualize the salary of any temporary employees.
Total Compensation in 2018. We calculated the median employee's compensation for 2018 in accordance with the requirements of Item 402 of Regulation S-K, which is equal to the amount of the median employee's compensation for 2018 that would have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 40, plus the amount of the median employee's non-discriminatory health and welfare benefits. With respect to the annual total compensation of Ms. Hollub, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 40, plus the amount of Ms. Hollub's non-discriminatory health and welfare benefits.
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    52
Occidental is submitting this proposal to its stockholders for an advisory vote to approve the compensation of its named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to Section 14A of the Exchange Act. At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the stockholders approved, on an advisory basis, a frequency of every year for casting advisory votes to approve named executive officer compensation. The next Say-on-Pay vote is expected to occur at our 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The executive compensation program for the named executive officers includes many best-practice features that are intended to enhance the alignment of compensation with the interests of Occidental's stockholders. The executive compensation program is described in the CD&A section beginning on page 25 of this proxy statement.
The Compensation Committee strives to maintain a compensation program that will attract, retain and motivate outstanding executives by providing incentives to reward them for superior performance that supports Occidental's long-term strategic objectives, whether in an up- or down-cycle commodity price environment, and is competitive with industry practices. The executive compensation program is intended to:
The Board recommends that stockholders support the following resolution for the reasons described in the CD&A:
RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of Occidental's named executive officers for 2018, as set forth in the CD&A section, Summary Compensation Table and all other table and narrative disclosures regarding named executive officer compensation set forth in this proxy statement.
A majority of the shares of common stock represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal must vote FOR the proposal to approve it. Your broker may not vote your shares on this proposal unless you give voting instructions. Abstentions have the same effect as votes cast AGAINST the proposal. Broker non-votes have no effect on the vote. As in past years, your vote will not directly affect or otherwise limit or enhance any existing compensation or award arrangement of any of our named executive officers, but the outcome of the Say-on-Pay vote will be taken into account by the Compensation Committee in making future compensation decisions.
The Board recommends that you vote FOR the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation.

Audit Related Matters
  Audit and Non-Audit Services Pre-Approval Policy and Procedures
The Audit Committee must give prior approval to any management request for any amount or type of service (audit, audit-related and tax services or, to the extent permitted by law, non-audit services) Occidental's independent auditor provides to Occidental. Additionally, the Audit Committee has delegated to the committee Chair full authority to approve any such request provided the Audit Committee Chair presents any approval so given to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All audit and audit-related services rendered by KPMG LLP in 2018 were approved by the Audit Committee or the Audit Committee Chair before KPMG LLP was engaged for such services. No services of any kind were approved pursuant to the de minimis exception for non-audit services set forth in Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X.
  Audit and Other Fees
KPMG LLP was our independent auditor for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered to Occidental by KPMG LLP for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, were as follows (in millions):
Ratification of Selection of Independent Auditor
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Occidental has selected KPMG LLP as independent auditor to audit the consolidated financial statements of Occidental and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019. KPMG LLP has audited Occidental's financial statements since 2002. A member of that firm is expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, will have an opportunity to make a statement, if so desired, and is expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions.
As a matter of good corporate governance, the Board of Directors of Occidental submits the selection of the independent auditor to our stockholders for ratification. A majority of the shares of common stock represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal must vote FOR the proposal to ratify the selection of auditor. Abstentions have the same effect as votes AGAINST the proposal. Your broker may vote your shares on the proposal if you do not give your broker voting instructions. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent auditor. Even if the stockholders ratify the selection of KPMG LLP, the Audit Committee may select a different independent auditor at any time during the year if it determines that this would be in the best interests of Occidental and our stockholders. If KPMG LLP should decline to act or otherwise become incapable of acting or if its employment is discontinued, the Audit Committee will select another independent auditor.
The Board of Directors recommends that you vote FOR the ratification of the selection of KPMG as independent auditor.
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    54
Report of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed Occidental's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, including management's annual assessment of and report on Occidental's internal control over financial reporting, with management and KPMG LLP, Occidental's independent auditor. In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by the applicable standards of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee received from KPMG LLP written disclosures and the letter regarding its independence as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB. The Audit Committee has also considered whether the provision of non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP to Occidental is compatible with maintaining their independence and has discussed with KPMG LLP the firm's independence. Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in Occidental's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, to be filed with the SEC.
Respectfully submitted,

Occidental Petroleum Corporation Occidental has been advised that the following stockholder proposal may be introduced at the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors disclaims any responsibility for the content of the proposal and for the statements made in support thereof, which, except for minor formatting changes, is presented in the form received from the stockholder proponent. The stockholder proposal is required to be voted on at the Annual Meeting only if it is properly presented. The Board unanimously recommends that you vote AGAINST the stockholder proposal for the reasons stated on page 57.
John Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California, 90278, beneficial owner of 50 shares of Occidental's common stock, is the proponent of the following stockholder proposal.
Proposal 4 – Special Shareholder Meetings
Resolved, Shareowners ask our board to take the steps necessary (unilaterally if possible) to amend our bylaws and each appropriate governing document to give holders in the aggregate of 15% of our outstanding common stock the power to call a special shareowner meeting. This proposal does not impact our board's current power to call a special meeting.
Special shareholder meetings allow shareholders to vote on important matters, such as electing new directors that can arise between annual meetings. This proposal topic won more than 70%-support at Edwards Lifesciences and SunEdison. This proposal topic, sponsored by William Steiner, also won 78%-support at a Sprint annual meeting with 1.7 billion yes-votes. Nuance Communications (NUAN) shareholders gave 94%-support in February 2018 to a rule 14a-8 proposal calling for 10% of shareholders to call a special meeting.
Our current higher 25%-threshold for shareholders to call a special meeting may be unreachable due to the baked-in time constraints and the detailed technical requirements that can easily trigger disqualifying errors by shareholders.
An enhanced ability of shareholders to call a special meeting would give shareholders greater standing to have input in director refreshment. For instance:
Edward Abraham received 22-times as many negative votes as certain other Occidental directors and yet continued to serve on 2 of our most important board committees.
John Feick had 20-years long tenure (which is the opposite of shareholder-oriented independence in a director) yet continued to serve on 3 of our most important board committees.
Eugene Batchelder, who is retired, was our Chairman and did not serve on any other significant board to keep his skills current.
Meanwhile there has been a 5-year drought as far as the price of our stock – slipping from $91 to $72.
Any claim that a shareholder right to call a special meeting can be costly – may be moot. When shareholders have a good reason to call a special meeting – our board should be able to take positive responding action to make a special meeting unnecessary.
Please vote yes: Special Shareholder Meetings – Proposal 4
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    56
The Board of Directors' Statement in Opposition.
The Board of Directors agrees with the proponent that it is important for Occidental's stockholders to have the ability to call a special meeting, which is why Occidental already provides stockholders with this right. The Board of Directors also believes that this ability should be carefully balanced to safeguard the long-term interests of all Occidental stockholders. In 2009, the Board of Directors amended Occidental's governing documents to permit holders of an aggregate of 25% of the company's outstanding common stock the right to call a special meeting. This proposal seeks to reduce the percentage of outstanding stock necessary to call a special meeting to 15%. The proponent also submitted this proposal for a vote at Occidental's 2016 and 2017 annual meetings, and each time a majority of the votes cast were voted against the proposal to reduce the stock ownership threshold to call a special meeting.
The Board of Directors has carefully reviewed and discussed this proposal, and continues to believe that reducing the current threshold to call a special meeting of stockholders is not appropriate or necessary because the existing threshold strikes an appropriate balance between giving stockholders a meaningful right to call a special meeting and minimizing the risk that a small minority of stockholders may trigger the administrative and financial burdens of holding a meeting to address a narrowly supported interest. For every special meeting, Occidental would incur the legal and administrative costs associated with preparing the necessary disclosure documents, distributing these documents to all stockholders and holding the meeting. Also, the time and focus of Occidental's Board of Directors and senior management would be diverted from Occidental's operations to prepare for the special meeting.
The Board believes that its existing governance practices and demonstrated responsiveness to stockholder concerns demonstrate that lowering the threshold to call a special meeting is unwarranted.
In recognition of our governance practices, Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has consistently given us its highest ranking of "1" under its Governance QualityScore rating system, and a "1" for Occidental's "Shareholder Rights," which indicates the lowest governance risk as compared to our industry.
These corporate governance features provide stockholders with meaningful opportunities to express their views and concerns.
Finally, the current threshold of 25% is consistent with and, in most cases, the same or lower than, the thresholds at other S&P 500 companies. With respect to U.S.-based companies in the S&P 500 where stockholders are permitted to call a special meeting, more than 63% set a threshold of 25% or greater. Moreover, approximately 40% of S&P 500 companies incorporated in Delaware do not even permit stockholders to call special meetings.
The vote required to approve this proposal is set forth in "Vote Required to Approve the Stockholder Proposal" on page 59.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors recommends that you vote AGAINST the foregoing stockholder proposal.

The SEC permits Occidental, with your permission, to send a single set of proxy materials, including the Notice, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Proxy Statement and Annual Report to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if Occidental believes they are members of the same family. This rule is called "householding" and its purpose is to help reduce printing and mailing costs of proxy materials. To date, the company has not instituted this procedure, but may do so in the future.
A number of brokerage firms have instituted householding. If you and members of your household have multiple accounts holding shares of Occidental's common stock, you may have received a householding notification from your broker. Please contact your broker directly if you have questions or wish to revoke your decision to household. These options are available to you at any time. If you receive a single set of proxy materials as a result of householding by your broker and you would like to receive separate copies of the Notice, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders, Proxy Statement or Annual Report, you may submit a request to our Corporate Secretary at the address above, or by calling the Corporate Secretary's office at 713-552-8654.
Admission to the Annual Meeting
Attendance at the Annual Meeting is limited to stockholders and authorized proxy holders. If you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, or would like to appoint a proxy holder to attend the meeting, you must request an admission ticket by writing to the Corporate Secretary's office at the address above, or by calling the Corporate Secretary's office at 713-552-8654. Your request must be received by the Corporate Secretary's office on or before May 6, 2019.
If you hold your shares of Occidental common stock in street name through a bank, broker or other holder of record, in addition to an admission ticket, you must bring proof of share ownership as of the record date, such as a bank or brokerage account statement and valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport. If you want to vote your shares of Occidental common stock held in street name in person, you must get a legal proxy in your name from the bank, broker or other nominee that holds your shares of stock, and submit it with your vote.
If you are not a stockholder, you will be admitted only if you have an admission ticket, a valid legal proxy and valid government-issued photo identification, such as a driver's license or passport.
For safety and security reasons, cell phones, laptops, tablets, recording equipment, other electronic devices, large bags, briefcases and packages will not be permitted in the Annual Meeting.

Voting Instructions and Information
  Voting Rights
A Notice of Internet Availability or proxy card is being mailed beginning on or about March 28, 2019, to each stockholder of record as of the close of business on March 15, 2019, which is the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive notice of, attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, Occidental had 747,877,572 shares of common stock outstanding. A majority of the outstanding shares of common stock must be represented at the Annual Meeting, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum and to transact business. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum is present. You will have one vote for each share of Occidental's common stock you own. You may vote in person at the Annual Meeting or by proxy. Proxies may be submitted by telephone or by internet at www.proxyvote.com as explained on the Notice of Internet Availability and, if you received a proxy card or voting information form, by marking, signing and returning the card in the envelope provided. Voting via the internet is a valid proxy voting method under the laws of the state of Delaware, Occidental's state of incorporation. You may not cumulate your votes.
Pursuant to Occidental's by-laws, a complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting will be open to the examination of any stockholder during normal business hours for 10 days prior to the Annual Meeting at Occidental's headquarters and at the Annual Meeting.
  Director Election Requirements
Pursuant to Occidental's by-laws, in an uncontested election, directors are elected by the majority of votes cast with respect to such director, meaning that the number of votes cast "for" a director must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that director. Your broker may not vote your shares on this proposal unless you give voting instructions. Abstentions and broker non-votes have no effect on the vote. Any director who receives a greater number of votes "against" his or her election than votes "for" in an uncontested election must tender his or her resignation. Unless accepted earlier by the Board of Directors, such resignation will become effective on October 31st of the year of the election.
  Voting of Proxies
The Board of Directors has designated Ms. Hollub and Ms. Clark, and each of them, with the full power of substitution, to vote shares represented by all properly executed proxies. The shares will be voted in accordance with the instructions specified on the proxy card. If no instructions are specified on the proxy card, the shares will be voted:
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those described above. If any matters not described in this Proxy Statement are properly presented at the meeting, the proxies will use their own judgment to determine how to vote your shares. If the meeting is adjourned or postponed, the proxies can vote your shares at the adjournment or postponement as well.
  Vote Required to Approve the Stockholder Proposal
A majority of the shares of common stock represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote must vote FOR the stockholder proposal for it to be approved. Your broker may not vote your shares on a stockholder proposal unless you give voting instructions. An abstention has the same effect as a vote AGAINST the proposal. Broker non-votes have no effect on the vote.
  Broker Votes
If your shares are held in street name, under NYSE rules, your broker can vote your shares on Proposal 3, with respect to the ratification of the selection of the independent auditor, but not with respect to the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve named executive officer compensation or the stockholder proposal (if properly presented). If your broker does not have discretion and you do not give the broker instructions, this will result in a broker non-vote, which will have no effect on the vote.

Director Nominations for the 2020 Annual Meeting
  Nominating Policy
It is the policy of the Governance Committee to consider nominees to the Board of Directors recommended by stockholders. Pursuant to the Nominating Policy, which is available at www.oxy.com/Investors/Governance/Governance-Policies/Pages/ Nominations-for-Directors.aspx, stockholder recommendations must be received by the Corporate Secretary of Occidental no earlier than September 1 and no later than November 30 of the year preceding the annual meeting to be considered by the Governance Committee. Each recommendation must include the following information:
2019 Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    60
The stockholder's recommendation must include the recommended person's written consent to being named as a nominee and to serving as a director if elected.
In prior years, the Governance Committee has identified director candidates through the use of independent search firms, third-party recommendations, and the recommendations of directors and executive officers. The Governance Committee anticipates that, if a vacancy on the Board were to occur, it would use these sources as well as stockholder recommendations to identify candidates.
In deciding if a candidate recommended by a stockholder or identified by another source is qualified to be a nominee, it is the Governance Committee's policy to consider:
If there is a vacancy and the Governance Committee believes that a recommended candidate has good potential for Board service, the Governance Committee will arrange an interview with the candidate. Pursuant to its charter, the Governance Committee will not recommend any candidate to the Board who has not been interviewed by the Governance Committee.
In accordance with its charter, the Governance Committee annually reviews its performance and reports its findings to the Board. The Governance Committee also assists the Board in performing its self-evaluation, which includes an assessment of whether the Board has the necessary diversity of skills, backgrounds and experiences to meet Occidental's ongoing needs.
  Advance Notice Procedure to Nominate Candidates
Under Occidental's by-laws, stockholders may nominate a person for election to the Board at an annual meeting by complying with the advance notice procedures in the by-laws and attending the annual meeting to make the necessary motion. For the 2020 Annual Meeting on Stockholders, the notice must be received no earlier than September 1, 2019 and no later than November 30, 2019 and include the information required by Article III, Section 2 of the by-laws.
  Proxy Access Procedure to Nominate Candidates
In 2015, with input from stockholders, the Board amended Occidental's by-laws to permit a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of Occidental's outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in Occidental's proxy materials directors constituting up to 20% of the Board, but not less than two directors, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) meet the requirements in Article III, Section 15 of the by-laws. To be included in the 2020 proxy materials, director nominations pursuant to Article III, Section 15 must be received no earlier than October 30, 2019 and no later than November 29, 2019.

This Proxy Statement refers to return on capital employed (ROCE), which is a supplemental measure not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP).
ROCE is defined by Occidental as net income plus after-tax net interest expense divided by average total debt plus stockholders' equity (average of the beginning and ending totals for the current period). Management believes that ROCE is useful to investors when comparing our profitability and the efficiency with which management has employed capital over time relative to other companies. ROCE is not considered to be an alternative to net income reported in accordance with GAAP.
