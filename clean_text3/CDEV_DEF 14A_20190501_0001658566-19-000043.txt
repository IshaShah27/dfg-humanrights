GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE MEETING
In this section of the proxy statement, we answer some common questions regarding the Annual Meeting and the voting of shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class A Common Stock") and Class C Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the "Class C Common Stock" and, together with the Class A Common Stock, the "Common Stock"), at the Annual Meeting. 
Where and when will the Annual Meeting be held?
The date, time and place of the Annual Meeting are as follows: 
May 1, 2019 
10:00 a.m. (Central Time)
The Sugar Land Marriott Town Square
16090 City Walk
Sugar Land, TX 77479
Why did I receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting in the mail instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials?
The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") has approved rules (the "e-proxy rules") allowing companies to furnish proxy materials, including this proxy statement and our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, to our stockholders by providing access to such documents on the Internet instead of mailing paper copies. We believe these e-proxy rules provide a convenient and quick way in which our stockholders can access the proxy materials and vote their shares of Common Stock, while allowing us to conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing the proxy materials. Accordingly, certain of our stockholders will receive a Notice Regarding the Internet Availability of Proxy Materials for the Annual Meeting (the "Notice") and will not receive paper copies of the proxy materials unless they request them. Instead, the Notice will provide such stockholders with notice of the Annual Meeting and will also provide instructions regarding how such stockholders can access and review all of the proxy materials on the Internet. The Notice also provides instructions as to how you may submit your proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone. If you received the Notice and you would instead prefer to receive a paper or electronic copy of the proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting such materials that are provided in the Notice. Any request to receive proxy materials by mail or email will remain in effect until you revoke it.
Why did you send me the proxy materials or the Notice?
We sent you the proxy materials or the Notice because we are holding our Annual Meeting and our board of directors (the "Board") is asking for your proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock at the Annual Meeting. We have summarized information in this proxy statement that you should consider in deciding how to vote at the Annual Meeting.
Can I vote my shares of Common Stock by filling out and returning the Notice?
No. The Notice identifies the items to be voted on at the Annual Meeting, but you cannot vote by marking the Notice and returning it. The Notice provides instructions on how to authorize your proxy electronically via the Internet, by telephone or by requesting and returning a paper proxy card, or you may vote your shares of Common Stock by submitting a ballot in person at the meeting.
Who can vote?
You can vote your shares of Common Stock if our records show that you were the owner of the shares as of the close of business on March 13, 2019, the record date for determining the stockholders who are entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. As of March 13, 2019, there were a total of [264,394,082] shares of Class A Common Stock and [12,003,183] shares of Class C Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. You get one vote for each share of Common Stock that you own.
How is a quorum determined?
We will hold the Annual Meeting if stockholders representing the required quorum of shares of Common Stock entitled to vote authorize their proxy online or telephonically, sign and return their proxy cards or attend the Annual Meeting. The presence in person or by proxy of a majority of the shares of Common Stock entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting constitutes a quorum. If you authorize your proxy online or telephonically or sign and return your proxy card, your shares will be counted to determine whether we have a quorum even if you abstain or fail to indicate your vote on the proxy card. What is the required vote for approval?
The election of each of our Class III director nominees requires the vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. If you withhold votes for purposes of the vote on the election of directors, your withheld votes will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of such vote. Broker non-votes also have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
The approval by a non-binding advisory vote of our named executive officer compensation, the approval of the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm require the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. If you abstain for purposes of these proposals, your abstention will not be counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will not have an effect on the results of such vote.  For the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the approval on an advisory basis of our named executive officer compensation, broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote.  However, the rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market (the "NASDAQ") permit brokers to vote uninstructed shares at their discretion regarding the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, so there will be no broker non-votes on the proposal.
The two proposals that contain proposed amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws require a vote, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, of the majority of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote on the proposal. If you abstain for purposes of these proposals, your abstention will be counted as a vote against the proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for these proposals.
How do I vote by proxy?
Follow the instructions on the Notice or the proxy card to authorize a proxy to vote your shares of Common Stock at the Annual Meeting electronically via the Internet or by telephone or, if you received paper proxy materials, by completing and returning the proxy card. The individuals named and designated as proxies will vote your shares of Common Stock as you instruct. You have the following choices in voting your shares of Common Stock:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• You may vote on each proposal, in which case your shares will be voted in accordance with your choices. 
• In voting on the election of Class III directors, you may either vote "FOR" each director or withhold your vote on any or all of the directors. 
• You may abstain from voting on the proposal (i) to approve on an advisory basis our named executive officer compensation, (ii) to approve the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and (iii) to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm, in which case no vote will be recorded with respect to the proposal. 
• You may abstain from voting on the two proposals that contain proposed amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws, in which case your vote will be counted as a vote against the proposal. 
[END TABLE]
You may return a signed proxy card without indicating your vote on any matter, in which case the designated proxies will vote to (i) elect each Class III director nominee, (ii) approve on an advisory basis our named executive officer compensation, (iii) approve the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (iv) approve the two proposals that contain proposed amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws and (v) ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm.
How can I authorize my proxy online or via telephone?
In order to authorize your proxy online or via telephone, go to www.cstproxyvote.com or call the toll-free number reflected on the Notice, and follow the instructions. If your shares of Common Stock are held in the name of your broker, a bank or other nominee in "street name," that party will give you instructions for voting your shares. Please have your Notice in hand when accessing the site, as it contains a control number required for access. You can authorize your proxy electronically via the Internet or by telephone at any time prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 30, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting.
If you received paper proxy materials, you may also refer to the enclosed proxy card for instructions. If you choose not to authorize your proxy electronically, please complete and return the paper proxy card in the pre-addressed, postage-paid envelope provided. What if other matters come up at the Annual Meeting?
As of the date of this proxy statement, the only matters we know of that will be voted on at the Annual Meeting are the proposals we have described herein: (i) the election of three Class III directors, (ii) the approval on an advisory basis of our named executive officer compensation, (iii) the approval of the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (iv) the approval and adoption of amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws to implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, (v) the approval and adoption of amendments to the Charter to eliminate provisions relating to our prior capital structure and the initial business combination that are no longer applicable to us or our stockholders; and (vi) the ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the designated proxies will vote your shares of Common Stock at their discretion.
Can I change my previously authorized vote?
Yes, you can change your vote at any time before the vote on a proposal either by executing or authorizing, dating and delivering to us a new proxy electronically via the Internet, by telephone or by mail at any time prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 30, 2019, the day before the Annual Meeting, by giving us a written notice revoking your proxy card or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting your shares of Common Stock in person. Your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not, by itself, revoke a proxy previously given by you. We will honor the latest dated proxy.
Proxy revocation notices or new proxy cards should be sent to Centennial Resource Development, Inc., 1001 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1800, Denver, Colorado, 80202, Attention: General Counsel.
Can I vote in person at the Annual Meeting rather than by authorizing a proxy?
You can attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares of Common Stock in person; however, we encourage you to authorize your proxy to ensure that your vote is counted. Authorizing your proxy electronically or telephonically, or submitting a proxy card, will not prevent you from later attending the Annual Meeting and voting your shares of Common Stock in person.
Will my shares of Common Stock be voted if I do not provide my proxy?
Depending on the proposal, your shares of Common Stock may be voted if they are held in the name of a brokerage firm, even if you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions. Brokerage firms have the authority under the NASDAQ rules to cast votes on certain "routine" matters if they do not receive instructions from their customers. The proposal to ratify the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is considered a "routine" matter for which brokerage firms may vote shares without receiving voting instructions.
Brokerage firms do not have the authority under the NASDAQ rules to vote on non-routine matters, which include the election of directors, the approval on an advisory basis of our named executive officer compensation, the approval of the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the approval of the two proposals that contain proposed amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws.  If you do not provide the brokerage firm with voting instructions on these proposals, your shares will not be voted and will result in "broker non-votes."  Broker non-votes will be considered present for the purpose of determining whether we have a quorum; however, such broker non-votes will not have an effect on the election of directors, the approval on an advisory basis of our named executive officer compensation, the approval of the adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the approval and adoption of the proposed amendments to the Company's Charter and Bylaws described in Proposals 4 and 5. 
What do I do if my shares are held in "street name"?
If your shares of Common Stock are held in the name of your broker, a bank or other nominee in "street name," that party will give you instructions for voting your shares. If your shares of Common Stock are held in "street name" and you would like to vote your shares in person at the Annual Meeting, you must contact your broker, bank or other nominee to obtain a proxy form from the record holder of your shares.
Who will count the votes?
Representatives of Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company will count the votes and will serve as the independent inspector of election. Who pays for this proxy solicitation?
We do. The Company has engaged Morrow Sodali, to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the Annual Meeting. The Company has agreed to pay Morrow Sodali a fee of $6,500, plus disbursements. The Company will reimburse Morrow Sodali for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and will indemnify Morrow Sodali and its affiliates against certain claims, liabilities, losses, damages and expenses. The Company will also reimburse banks, brokers and other custodians, nominees and fiduciaries representing beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock for their expenses in forwarding soliciting materials to beneficial owners of shares of Common Stock and in obtaining voting instructions from those owners. In addition to sending you these materials, some of our employees or agents may contact you by telephone, by mail or in person. None of our employees will receive any extra compensation for providing those services.

ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Board Structure
There are currently nine directors on our Board, and eight of our directors are divided into three classes, with two directors in Class I and three directors in each of Class II and Class III. The terms of office of the three Class III directors will expire at the Annual Meeting.  One additional director is elected each year by the holder of our Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to serve for a one-year term expiring at the next annual meeting of our stockholders.
Class III Election
The three nominees for election as Class III directors are listed below.  If elected, the nominees for election as Class III directors will serve on our Board for a term of three years expiring at our annual meeting of stockholders in 2022 and until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified.  Each of the nominees currently serves on our Board.
Class III Nominees
The Class III nominees are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Director   Age, Principal Occupation, Business Experience, Other Directorships Held and Director Qualifications   Director Since 
Mark G. Papa (Class III)  Mark G. Papa, age 72, has served as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board since November 2015.  Mr. Papa is also an advisor to Riverstone Holdings, LLC, a private equity firm specializing in energy investments (together with its affiliates, "Riverstone").  We currently anticipate that Mr. Papa will spend approximately 90% of his working time providing services to us as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and approximately 10% of his working time providing services to Riverstone on matters unrelated to the Company.  Prior to joining Riverstone in February 2015, Mr. Papa was Chairman and CEO of EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG), an independent U.S. oil and gas company ("EOG"), from August 1999 to December 2013. Mr. Papa served as a member of EOG's board of directors from August 1999 until December 2014. Mr. Papa worked at EOG for 32 years in various management positions. Mr. Papa was retired from December 2013 through February 2015. Prior to joining EOG, Mr. Papa worked at Conoco Inc. for 13 years in various engineering and management positions. Mr. Papa has also served on the board of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB), an international oilfield services company, since October 2018 and Casa de Esperanza, a non-profit organization serving children in crisis situations, since November 2006. Mr. Papa previously served on the board of Oil States Industries (NYSE: OIS), an international oilfield services company, from February 2001 to August 2018. In February 2010 and 2013, the Harvard Business Review cited Mr. Papa as one of the 100 Best Performing CEOs in the World; both times Mr. Papa was the highest ranked Global Energy CEO. Additionally, Institutional Investor magazine repeatedly ranked him as the Top Independent E&P CEO.  He received his B.S. in petroleum engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and an MBA from the University of Houston.    We believe Mr. Papa's significant experience in the energy industry and his deep understanding of the Company and its assets make him well qualified to serve as the Chairman of our Board. Through his current role as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and his prior experience with EOG and other exploration and production companies, Mr. Papa has established himself in the industry as a proven leader with a strong understanding of exploration and production techniques, macro conditions in the energy industry, as well as the operational, strategic, financial, risk and compliance issues facing a publicly traded company in the upstream oil and gas industry.   2015 
Mark G. Papa (Class III)  Mark G. Papa, age 72, has served as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board since November 2015.  Mr. Papa is also an advisor to Riverstone Holdings, LLC, a private equity firm specializing in energy investments (together with its affiliates, "Riverstone").  We currently anticipate that Mr. Papa will spend approximately 90% of his working time providing services to us as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and approximately 10% of his working time providing services to Riverstone on matters unrelated to the Company.  Prior to joining Riverstone in February 2015, Mr. Papa was Chairman and CEO of EOG Resources, Inc. (NYSE: EOG), an independent U.S. oil and gas company ("EOG"), from August 1999 to December 2013.

Mr. Papa has also served on the board of Schlumberger Limited (NYSE: SLB), an international oilfield services company, since October 2018 and Casa de Esperanza, a non-profit organization serving children in crisis situations, since November 2006. Mr. Papa previously served on the board of Oil States Industries (NYSE: OIS), an international oilfield services company, from February 2001 to August 2018. In February 2010 and 2013, the Harvard Business Review cited Mr. Papa as one of the 100 Best Performing CEOs in the World; both times Mr. Papa was the highest ranked Global Energy CEO. Additionally, Institutional Investor magazine repeatedly ranked him as the Top Independent E&P CEO.  He received his B.S. in petroleum engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and an MBA from the University of Houston.    We believe Mr. Papa's significant experience in the energy industry and his deep understanding of the Company and its assets make him well qualified to serve as the Chairman of our Board.

Our website (www.cdevinc.com) includes materials that are helpful in understanding our corporate governance practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Policy for Related Person Transactions, Policy for Accounting-Related Complaints and charters for the committees of our Board.
Board Role in Risk Oversight
As an oil and gas exploration and production company, we encounter a variety of risks, including, among others, commodity price volatility and supply and demand risks, risks associated with rising costs of doing business, availability of capital and financing, risks associated with our development, acquisition and production activities, environmental and other regulatory risks, weather-related risks and political instability.  While our senior management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks we face, the Board, directly and through its committees, oversees the Company's management and, with their assistance, is actively involved in the oversight of risks that could affect the Company. Specifically, the Board is responsible for ensuring that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate to address the risks we face and function as intended. Accordingly, during the course of each year, the Board (i) reviews and approves management's operating plans and considers any risks that could affect operating results, (ii) reviews the structure and operation of our various departments and functions and (iii) in connection with the review and approval of particular transactions and initiatives, reviews related risk analyses and mitigation plans.
The Board has delegated certain risk oversight responsibility to committees of the Board as follows: (i) the audit committee of the Board (the "Audit Committee") oversees the Company's risk assessment and risk management guidelines, policies and processes, as well as risks relating to the financial statements and financial reporting processes of the Company, meeting periodically with management to discuss the Company's major financial risk exposures and the steps management is taking to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company's risk assessment and risk management policies; (ii) the compensation committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee") oversees risks related to senior executive and other compensation; and (iii) the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board (the "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee") oversees risks related to corporate governance. Our senior management regularly reports to the full Board and, as appropriate, the committees of the Board regarding enterprise risk that the Company must mitigate and/or manage. Board Independence
NASDAQ listing rules require that a majority of the board of directors of a company listed on NASDAQ be composed of "independent directors," which is defined generally as a person other than an officer or employee of the company or its subsidiaries or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the company's Board, would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.  Our Board has determined that Maire A. Baldwin, Karl E. Bandtel, Matthew G. Hyde, Jeffrey H. Tepper and Tony R. Weber are independent within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing rules. Further, our Board has determined that Maire A. Baldwin, Karl E. Bandtel and Jeffrey H. Tepper, the current members of the Audit Committee, are independent with the meaning of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").
Lead Independent Director
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that, if the Chairman of the Board is a member of management or does not otherwise qualify as independent, the independent directors may elect a lead independent director.  In 2018, the independent directors elected Ms. Baldwin to serve as the Board's lead independent director.  The lead director's responsibilities include, but are not limited to: (i) presiding over all meetings of our Board at which the Chairman of the Board is not present, including any executive sessions of the independent directors; (ii) approving Board meeting schedules and agendas; and (iii) acting as the liaison between the independent directors and the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board.  Our Board may modify its leadership structure in the future as it deems appropriate.
Board Meetings
Our Board conducts its business through meetings of the Board, actions taken by written consent in lieu of meetings and by the actions of its committees.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Board held four meetings and acted by unanimous written consent one time.  During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, no incumbent director attended fewer than 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board (including consents to action in lieu of a meeting) held during the period for which he or she has been a director.
Committees of the Board
The Board currently has three standing committees: the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Each of the committees reports to the Board as it deems appropriate and as the Board may request. The composition, duties and responsibilities of these committees are set forth below.
From time to time and as necessary to address specific issues, our Board may establish other committees.
Audit Committee
The principal functions of our Audit Committee are detailed in the Audit Committee charter, which is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.cdevinc.com, and include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the appointment, compensation, retention, replacement and oversight of the work of the independent auditors and any other independent registered public accounting firm engaged by us; 
• pre-approving all audit and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditors or any other registered public accounting firm engaged by us, and establishing pre-approval policies and procedures; 
• reviewing and discussing with the independent auditors all relationships the auditors have with us in order to evaluate their continued independence; 
• setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditors; 
• setting clear policies for audit partner rotation in compliance with applicable laws and regulations; 
• reviewing and approving any related party transaction required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC prior to us entering into such transaction; 
• reviewing our annual audited financial statements and quarterly financial statements with management and the Company's independent auditors prior to their final completion and filing with the SEC;  
• reviewing the program, policies and systems we have in place to monitor compliance with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and any ethics complaints we may receive; and 
• reviewing with management, the independent auditors and our legal advisors, as appropriate, any legal, regulatory or compliance matters, including any correspondence with regulators or government agencies and any employee complaints or published reports that raise material issues regarding our financial statements or accounting policies  
[END TABLE]
 and any significant changes in accounting standards or rules promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.
Our Audit Committee consists of Jeffrey H. Tepper, Karl E. Bandtel and Maire A. Baldwin, with Mr. Tepper serving as the Chair.  We believe that Messrs. Tepper and Bandtel and Ms. Baldwin qualify as independent directors according to the rules and regulations of the SEC with respect to audit committee membership. We also believe that Mr. Tepper qualifies as our "audit committee financial expert," as such term is defined in Item 401(h) of Regulation S-K.
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Audit Committee held six meetings and acted by unanimous written consent one time.
Compensation Committee
The principal functions of our Compensation Committee are detailed in the Compensation Committee charter, which is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.cdevinc.com, and include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officer's compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officer's performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation; 
• reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation of all of our other officers; 
• reviewing and approving on an annual basis the compensation of all of our non-employee directors; 
• reviewing on an annual basis our executive compensation policies and plans; 
• implementing and administering our incentive compensation stock-based remuneration plans;

• producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and 
• reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors. 
[END TABLE]
Our Compensation Committee consists of Maire A. Baldwin, Jeffrey H. Tepper and Tony R. Weber, with Ms. Baldwin serving as the Chair.  Our Board has affirmatively determined that Ms. Baldwin and Messrs. Tepper and Weber meet the definition of "independent director" for purposes of serving on a compensation committee under the NASDAQ listing rules.
The Compensation Committee may delegate the approval of certain transactions to a subcommittee consisting solely of two or more members of the Compensation Committee. On October 27, 2016, the Compensation Committee created a subcommittee (the "Section 162(m) Plan Subcommittee") consisting of Ms. Baldwin and Mr. Tepper to administer and make determinations from time to time with respect to awards granted or compensation to be provided under the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2016 Long Term Incentive Plan (as amended and/or restated, the "LTIP") or any successor plan, including compensation that is intended to qualify as "performance-based compensation" under Section 162(m) of the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder. The Compensation Committee dissolved the Section 162(m) Plan Subcommittee on February 13, 2018.
The Compensation Committee has the authority to retain or obtain the advice of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors (independent or otherwise) to assist in carrying out its responsibilities. For information regarding the role of our Chief Executive Officer, other executive officers and compensation consultants in determining our executive and director compensation, please refer to the section entitled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis-Determination of Compensation."
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee held eight meetings and acted by unanimous written consent five times.  In addition, prior to its dissolution, the Section 162(m) Plan Subcommittee acted by unanimous written consent one time in 2018.
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The principal functions of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are detailed in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter, which is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.cdevinc.com, and include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assisting the Board in identifying individuals qualified to become members of the Board, consistent with criteria approved by the Board; 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• recommending director nominees for election or for appointment to fill vacancies; 
• monitoring the independence of board of director members; and 
• ensuring the availability of director education programs. 
[END TABLE]
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also develops and recommends to the Board corporate governance principles and practices and assists in implementing them, including conducting a regular review of our corporate governance principles and practices. The Board finds it appropriate that the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee currently does not have a policy regarding consideration of director candidates recommended by stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee oversees the annual performance evaluation of the Board and the committees of the Board and makes a report to the Board on succession planning.
Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Karl E. Bandtel, Matthew G. Hyde and Tony R. Weber, with Mr. Bandtel serving as the Chair.  Our Board has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Bandtel, Hyde and Weber meet the definition of "independent director" for purposes of serving on a nominations committee under the NASDAQ listing rules.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and acted by unanimous written consent one time.
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, no officer or employee of the Company served as a member of our Compensation Committee. None of our executive officers serve, or have served during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has or had one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee.
Code of Business Conduct and Ethics
We have adopted a written code of ethics (the "Code of Business Conduct and Ethics") that applies to our directors, officers and employees and that, among other purposes, is intended to assist directors, officers and employees in recognizing, avoiding and resolving ethical issues. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics covers various topics, including the standards of honest, ethical and fair conduct, conflicts of interest, disclosure requirements, compliance, reporting and accountability, insider information and trading, confidentiality, anti-corruption laws and others.  The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is designed to comply with SEC regulations and NASDAQ listing standards related to codes of conduct and ethics and is posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website at www.cdevinc.com.  A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is also available free of charge, upon request directed to Centennial Resource Development, Inc., 1001 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1800, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attention: General Counsel.  We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirements regarding any amendment to, or any waiver of, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our website within four business days following the date of any such amendment or waiver.
Annual Board and Committee Evaluation Process
 The Board and each of our committees conducted self-evaluations related to their performance in 2018, including an evaluation of each director. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee supervises the performance evaluations and uses various processes from year to year in order to solicit feedback, including Board and committee-level questionnaires prepared by each of the Board and committee members, the responses to which are used to evaluate the effectiveness of Board and committee performance and to identify areas for improvement and issues for further discussion. Following a discussion of the results of the evaluations, the Board and each committee review and discuss the evaluation results and take this information into account when assessing the qualifications of the Board and its directors, further enhancing the effectiveness of the Board and its committees over time. Policies Relating to our Board
Stockholder Communications with the Board
All stockholders who wish to contact the Board may send written correspondence to Centennial Resource Development, Inc., 1001 Seventeenth Street, Suite 1800, Denver, Colorado 80202, Attention: General Counsel. Communications may be addressed to an individual director, to the non-management or independent directors as a group or to the Board as a whole, marked as confidential or otherwise. Communications not submitted confidentially, which are addressed to directors that discuss business or other matters relevant to the activities of our Board, will be preliminarily reviewed by the office of the General Counsel and then distributed either in summary form or by delivering a copy of the communication. Communications marked as confidential will be distributed, without review by the office of the General Counsel, to the director or group of directors to whom they are addressed, unless there are safety or security concerns that mitigate against further transmission.
Director Qualifications
As provided by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee charter, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies, evaluates and recommends to our Board director candidates with the goal of identifying individuals with a high level of personal and professional integrity, strong ethics and values and the ability to make mature business judgments. In evaluating director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may also consider certain other criteria as set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines, including, among other things, the candidate's experience in corporate management and as a board member of another publicly held company, the candidate's professional and academic experience relevant to the oil and natural gas industry, the strength of the candidate's leadership skills and the overall diversity of the Board.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board monitor the mix of specific experience, qualification and skills of our directors in order to ensure that the Board, as a whole, has the necessary tools to perform its oversight function effectively.  Generally, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee identifies candidates through the personal, business and organizational contacts of the directors and management.
Board Leadership Structure
Currently, Mark G. Papa serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and we have no policy with respect to the separation of the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Board believes that it is important to retain its flexibility to allocate the responsibilities of the offices of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in any way that is in the best interests of the Company at a given point in time.  The Board believes that the most effective leadership structure for the Company at this time is for Mr. Papa to serve both as Chief Executive Officer as well as Chairman of the Board.
Separate Sessions of Independent Directors
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require the Board to hold executive sessions for the independent directors, without any non-independent directors or management present, on a regularly scheduled basis but not less than twice per year. Our independent directors met in executive session on four occasions in 2018.  Each of our independent directors attended each of the executive sessions.
Director Attendance at Annual Meeting of Stockholders
Although we do not have a formal policy regarding director attendance at our annual meeting of stockholders, we encourage directors to attend.  Eight board members attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.
Stockholder Engagement 
Stockholder engagement is a very important part of our business practices. We value our stockholders' views on a variety of important topics, including their perspective on our operations and performance, executive compensation and environmental, social and governance initiatives, among others. As a result of stockholder engagement, we enhanced our website disclosure in 2018 to better describe our corporate, environmental, health and safety, social and corporate governance commitments and practices. We are committed to corporate responsibility, environmental sustainability, operational safety and sound corporate governance, and we describe each of these commitments in detail in the "Responsibility" portion our website. 
In addition, listed below are highlights of actions we have taken in 2018 or early 2019 as a result of stockholder engagement and in an effort to better align our corporate governance and compensation practices with best practices for public companies in our industry: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We updated our Corporate Governance Guidelines in 2018 to encourage the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Board to consider diversity, among other factors, when evaluating director candidates. 
• We elected Ms. Baldwin to serve as our first lead independent director. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We adopted a clawback policy that provides for the recoupment of cash incentive compensation or performance-based equity compensation in certain instances if the Company restates its financial statements as a result of a material error in such financial statements. 
• We approved majority voting for uncontested director elections and recommended that our stockholders approve and adopt governance changes to implement that new voting standard, as described in greater detail in Proposal 4. 
• We enhanced the disclosure in this proxy statement to provide a more fulsome description and relative weightings of the performance goals and assessments considered by the Compensation Committee for performance-based awards granted during 2018.

 AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management of the Company and KPMG LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 (the "Audited Financial Statements").
The Audit Committee has discussed with KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the "PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 61, as in effect on the date of this proxy statement.
The Audit Committee has: (i) considered whether non-audit services provided by KPMG LLP are compatible with its independence; (ii) received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding KPMG LLP's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; and (iii) discussed with KPMG LLP its independence.
Based on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the Audited Financial Statements be included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
Respectfully submitted,
The Audit Committee

Karl E. Bandtel COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
In this Compensation Discussion and Analysis, we address our philosophy, programs and processes related to the compensation paid or awarded to our "named executive officers," or "NEOs," for 2018, including the elements of our compensation program for named executive officers, material compensation decisions made under that program during 2018 and the material factors considered in making those decisions.  Our named executive officers include our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and our three other most highly compensated executive officers. Our named executive officers for 2018 are:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mark G. Papa, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board; 
• George S. Glyphis, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; 
• Sean R. Smith, Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; 
• Davis O. O'Connor, Vice President and General Counsel; and 
• Brent P. Jensen, Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Summary 
Compensation Philosophy, Objectives and Rewards
Our executive compensation program has been designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain high caliber management with the skills and competencies that we believe are essential to our success and to align executive compensation with our short-term and long-term business objectives, business strategy and financial performance.  To achieve our compensation objectives, we generally provide executives with a compensation package consisting primarily of the following fixed and variable elements: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Compensation Element   Compensation Objective 
Annual Base Salary   Provide competitive fixed compensation based on the NEO's title, role, experience and performance in order to attract and retain individuals with superior talent 
Annual Incentive Compensation   Provide incentives to attain the Company's and NEO's short-term strategic, financial and operational goals 
Equity Incentive Awards   Promote the maximization of stockholder value by aligning the interests of NEOs and stockholders for long-term value creation 
[END TABLE]
 Mix of Compensation Elements for our Named Executive Officers
Our executive compensation program directly links a substantial portion of the executive compensation to the Company's performance through annual and long-term incentives.  The pie charts below show the mix of compensation elements for our Chief Executive Officer and the average mix of compensation elements for our other named executive officers for 2018 based on the information included in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.  As discussed below, at our Chief Executive Officer's request, the Compensation Committee did not provide additional long-term equity grants to him for 2018; therefore, the "at risk" portion of his compensation decreased from 2016 and 2017 levels as did his total compensation as discussed below in the section entitled "Compensation for our Chief Executive Officer." These charts highlight the substantial portion of named executive officer compensation that is "at risk" because its value is tied to the Company's performance.

  What We Do     What We Don't Do 
ü Pay for performance - each of our NEO's total compensation is substantially weighted toward compensation that is "at-risk" and tied to the performance of the Company and the NEO.   û Allow hedging or pledging of any Company securities by any director, officer or employee. 
ü Maintain equity ownership guidelines for our officers and directors requiring substantial Company stock ownership.   û Provide tax gross-ups for severance or change in control payments to our NEOs or other officers or employees. 
ü Review comparative compensation data and generally target total NEO compensation between the 50th and 75th percentile of our compensation peer group.   û Provide defined benefit or supplemental executive retirement plans. 
ü Have an independent compensation consultant retained by our Compensation Committee.   û Utilize performance measures that we believe would encourage excessive risk taking. 
ü Have a clawback policy that is applicable to our NEOs.   û Provide significant perquisites to any of our NEOs or other officers. 
ü Have double-trigger change in control severance for both cash severance payments and equity vesting under our Severance Plan.   û Have employment agreements with our NEOs or other officers. 
ü Conduct an annual risk assessment of compensation practices to ensure avoidance of excessive risk taking.   û Guarantee bonuses for any of our NEOs or other officers. 
ü Have performance-based restricted stock units that are capped at target if our total stockholder return is less than or equal to zero for the applicable performance period.   û Permit repricing of underwater stock options without stockholder approval. 
[END TABLE]
2018 Company Performance Highlights
During 2018, we achieved the following operational and financial performance highlights, among others:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Exceeded our goal of a 17% unlevered before-tax rate of return on our 2018 capital investment program; 
• Increased average daily oil and oil equivalent production volumes by 81% and 92% from 2017 levels, respectively; in-line with the midpoint of our fiscal year 2018 production guidance; 
• Substantially outperformed production costs per barrel of oil equivalent targets for lease operating expense, cash general and administrative expense, gathering, processing and transportation expense, cash interest expense and depreciation, depletion and amortization;  
• Achieved the midpoint of 2018 drilling and completions capital expenditures guidance and did not raise the capital budget in 2018; 
• Secured flow assurance for a significant portion of our near-term oil and natural gas volumes through firm transportation and firm sales agreements, ensuring essentially no volume will be shut-in due to takeaway capacity constraints out of the Permian Basin; 
• Acquired approximately 9,000 net acres of quality core leasehold acreage in the Delaware Basin through strategic bolt-on acquisitions and organic leasing at attractive prices, which allowed us to add approximately 100 core, gross operated horizontal drilling locations;  
• Retained strong balance sheet and liquidity position, ending the year with 17% Net Debt to Total Capitalization with available borrowing capacity of $499.2 million under our revolving credit facility; and 
• Maintained a safety and environmental track record that significantly outperformed industry average. 
[END TABLE]
 Compensation for our Chief Executive Officer
For 2016 and 2017, the substantial majority of total compensation awarded to Mr. Papa, our Chief Executive Officer, was in the form of stock options and restricted stock, which vest in three substantially equal annual installments following the date of grant. At Mr. Papa's request, his base salary was not increased in 2018 and has remained unchanged since it was initially set by the Compensation Committee in 2016. Furthermore, at his request, the Compensation Committee did not provide any additional long-term equity grants to Mr. Papa for 2018. As a result, Mr. Papa's total compensation for 2018 was substantially lower than in prior years, as illustrated in the diagram below.
Our Chief Executive Officer's Total Compensation (2016 - 2018)*
*Based on total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table for the applicable fiscal year. 
Consideration of 2018 "Say-on-Pay" and "Say-on-Frequency" Advisory Votes
At the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, approximately 93% of the votes cast were in favor of the non-binding advisory vote to approve compensation for our named executive officers (commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" vote). Also, 99% of votes cast were in favor of holding the say-on-pay vote on an annual basis, which was the frequency recommended by our Board. We believe that annual "say-on-pay" votes are the most appropriate for the Company because such votes allow our stockholders the opportunity to provide more frequent feedback on the compensation program for our named executive officers and provide the Compensation Committee with more current information regarding our stockholders' response to our programs and policies. 
The Board and the Compensation Committee took the results of the "say-on-pay" vote into account when evaluating the compensation program for our named executive officers for 2018. Based in part on the level of support from our stockholders, the Compensation Committee elected not to make any material changes to the compensation programs for our named executive officers during 2018, other than the Compensation Committee's determination to not provide additional long-term equity grants to our Chief Executive Officer for 2018, as discussed above. We appreciate our stockholders' continuing annual feedback regarding our executive pay practices, as we value our stockholders' evaluation of our executive compensation program and policies. As discussed in more detail in Proposal 2 below, the Board has recommended that stockholders vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, to approve the compensation of the named executive officers as described in this proxy statement. The Compensation Committee will continue to review stockholder votes on our executive compensation and determine whether to make changes to the program accordingly. Determination of Compensation
Our executive compensation program has been designed to attract, motivate, reward and retain high caliber management with the skills and competencies we believe are essential to our success and to align executive compensation with our short-term and long-term business objectives, business strategy and financial performance.  We link pay and performance to foster a culture of individual accountability and, in evaluating executive officer performance, place particular emphasis on the unlevered before-tax rate of return on our capital investment program, which is described in greater detail below in the section entitled "Annual Incentive Compensation."
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee administers and determines the parameters of our executive officer compensation program, including appropriate target levels and performance measures and the allocation between short-term and long-term compensation and between cash and equity-based awards, in order to establish an overall compensation program it believes is appropriate for each named executive officer.  The Compensation Committee has principal authority for determining and approving the compensation awards for our executive officers and is charged with reviewing our executive compensation policies and practices to ensure adherence to our compensation philosophies and objectives. In making decisions, the Compensation Committee takes into account, among other factors:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• achievement of individual and Company performance goals and expectations relating to the named executive officer's position at the Company; 
• alignment of named executive officer compensation with short-term and long-term Company performance; 
• competitiveness of compensation with compensation peer group companies, internal pay equity among individuals with similar expertise levels and experience and the unique skill sets of the individual; 
• market demand for individuals with the named executive officer's specific expertise and experience; 
• advice, data and analysis provided by the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant; 
• general industry compensation data; 
• the named executive officer's background, experience and circumstances, including prior related work experience and training; and 
• the recommendations of the Company's Chief Executive Officer. 
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee generally targets total compensation for our executive officers between the 50th and 75th percentile of our compensation peer group on an aggregate basis.  However, the Compensation Committee retains discretion to allow for individual adjustments based on factors and considerations specific to the individual.
Role of Compensation Consultant in Determining Executive Compensation 
In determining 2018 executive compensation, the Compensation Committee received information and reports from Longnecker & Associates ("Longnecker"), an independent compensation consultant retained by the Compensation Committee.  Longnecker provided data, analysis and advice to the Compensation Committee, including market information that the Compensation Committee used when determining whether our executive compensation is competitive, commensurate with the executive officers' responsibilities and consistent with market trends in executive compensation practices for companies in our industry. Longnecker does not provide services to us other than consulting services related to the compensation and benefits of our directors, officers and employees. The Compensation Committee has considered the adviser independence factors required under SEC rules as they relate to Longnecker and does not believe Longnecker's work in 2018 raised a conflict of interest. Use of Competitive Market Data 
A key objective of our executive compensation program is to ensure that the total compensation opportunities available to our executive officers are competitive with those of oil and gas exploration and production companies with whom we compete for executive talent, investment dollars and business opportunities.  We maintain a peer group for executive compensation and performance reference purposes to, among other things, assist in evaluating our executive compensation program against this key objective. Our criteria for the selection of peer companies within our General Industry Classification Standard Industry Code (i.e., oil and gas exploration and production companies) include revenue, assets, market capitalization, enterprise value, location (significant footprint in the Permian Basin) and complexity of operations. The Compensation Committee, with input and advice from Longnecker and Company management, typically reviews the peer group on an annual basis. 
In August 2018, with input and advice from Longnecker and Company management, the Compensation Committee updated the peer group used for 2018 compensation purposes. RSP Permian, Inc., which had been a member of the 2017 peer group, ceased to be a publicly-traded corporation after it was acquired by Concho Resources Inc. on July 19, 2018, and was therefore removed from the 2018 peer group. Longnecker also recommended adding two new companies, Matador Resources Company and SM Energy Company, which each have operations that are concentrated in the Permian Basin and financial metrics that are aligned with those of Centennial.  The Compensation Committee approved these recommendations, resulting in the inclusion of the following companies in the 2018 peer group:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Callon Petroleum Company Parsley Energy, Inc. 
Cimarex Energy Co. PDC Energy, Inc. 
Diamondback Energy, Inc. QEP Resources, Inc. 
Energen Corporation (1) SM Energy Company 
Laredo Petroleum, Inc. WPX Energy, Inc. 
Matador Resources Company   
[END TABLE]
(1) On November 29, 2018, Energen Corporation was acquired by Diamondback Energy, Inc. and ceased to be a publicly-traded company, and therefore ceased to be a member of our peer group on such date.
Role of Executive Officers in Determining Executive Compensation 
Our Chief Executive Officer provides the Compensation Committee with a review of the performance of our executive officers, other than himself, and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee to assist it in determining executive compensation levels, other than his own.  During 2018, our Chief Executive Officer reviewed compensation assessments and data provided by Longnecker prior to and in connection with the recommendations he made to the Compensation Committee. While the Compensation Committee utilized this information and valued management's observations with regard to compensation, the ultimate decisions regarding 2018 executive compensation were made by the Compensation Committee.
Elements of Our Executive Compensation Program
For 2018, the primary elements of our named executive officers' compensation were base salaries, annual incentive compensation and long-term equity-based compensation.
Base Salaries
The base salaries of our named executive officers are an important part of their total compensation package, and are intended to reflect their respective positions, duties and responsibilities and to provide a fixed base of cash compensation.  Base salary is a visible and stable fixed component of our compensation program.  The Compensation Committee may adjust base salaries based on a number of factors, including experience, responsibilities, individual contributions, number of years in the position and competitive data.  In addition, the Compensation Committee may evaluate our named executive officers' base salaries, together with other components of their compensation, to ensure that the executive's total compensation is consistent with our overall compensation philosophy and market practices of our compensation peer group.
With the exception of base salary increases in connection with promotions, the Compensation Committee generally evaluates whether to increase the base salaries of our named executive officers in August of each year. In determining whether to adjust base salaries in 2018, the Compensation Committee considered, among other things, the Company's goals for 2017 and its performance as measured against those goals, compensation alignment with performance, the performance and individual contributions of each executive, the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, competitive market data provided by Longnecker and the level of fixed cash compensation that the Compensation Committee believed to be necessary to retain the services of our named executive officers in a competitive talent market. Based upon these considerations, the Compensation Committee increased base salaries, effective August 25, 2018, for all of our named executive officers except for  Mr. Papa. At Mr. Papa's request, his base salary was not increased and has remained unchanged since it was initially set by the Company in 2016.
The table below sets forth the annual base salaries of our named executive officers for 2017 and 2018.

[END TABLE]
In evaluating 2018 performance, the Compensation Committee focused on the Company's performance goals for 2018 and the individual contributions of each named executive officer. As in prior years, the Compensation Committee considered our unlevered before-tax rate of return on our 2018 capital investment program (the "Rate of Return Metric") as the most significant performance goal. The calculation of the Rate of Return Metric is based on the estimated recoverable reserves ("net" to our interest) for all operated and non-operated wells turned on production in 2018, the estimated net present value of the future net cash flows from such reserves (for which we utilize certain assumptions regarding future commodity prices and operating costs) and our direct net costs incurred in the drilling and completion of such wells (inclusive of well-level facilities expenditures).  This calculation also includes certain indirect capital expenditures, such as infrastructure-related expenditures, capital expenditures related to the acquisition of undeveloped leasehold through organic oil and gas leasing and other related land expenditures, and expenditures for seismic, geological and geophysical services and data. The calculation also includes the impact of financial commodity derivative contracts, general and administrative expenses and other similar expenses.  Such calculation excludes interest and income tax expenses.  As such, the Rate of Return Metric cannot be calculated from our consolidated audited financial statements.

The Compensation Committee believes that employees who are in a position to make a substantial contribution to our long-term success should have a significant and ongoing stake in our success. Equity-based compensation creates an ownership culture among our employees that provides an incentive to contribute to the continued growth and development of our business and aligns interest of executives with those of our stockholders.
During 2018, the Compensation Committee did not have any formal policy for determining the number or type of equity-based awards to grant to named executive officers.  Rather, the Compensation Committee evaluated various factors when making its determinations, including the base salary and target annual cash incentive compensation of the named executive officers, the value of total compensation package deemed appropriate to attract and retain highly qualified named executive officers in light of the competitive environment, a named executive officer's ability to influence and create long-term  stockholder value and the stock-based holdings of the named executive officer, the individual's personal experience and performance in recent periods and the Compensation Committee's overall evaluation of individual and company performance based on the performance goals described above.
Based upon the Compensation Committee's review of competitive market data, and taking into account the advice and information received from Longnecker, the Compensation Committee determined that 50% of the 2018 total long-term equity-based incentive compensation awarded to Messrs. Glyphis, Smith, O'Connor and Jensen should be in the form of restricted stock awards that vest based on continuous employment and the passage of time, with the remaining 50% in the form of a target number of performance restricted stock units that vest based on performance measures tied to the relative total stockholder return ("TSR") of our company as compared to our 2018 compensation peer group over a three year performance period. As in 2017, the Compensation Committee choose this allocation of equity for the long-term awards for these named executive officers because the restricted stock awards that vest based on continuous employment and the passage of time promote the retention of executives, while the performance restricted share units promote the long-term interests of our stockholders and align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders by tying the ultimate payout of those units to the relative TSR of our company as compared to our 2018 compensation peer group. 
At the request of Mr. Papa, the Compensation Committee did not provide any additional long-term equity grants to Mr. Papa for 2018. The Compensation Committee also did not award any stock options to any of the named executive officers in 2018. 
In February 2018, the Compensation Committee elected to pay a portion of 2017 annual incentive bonuses for all named executive officers, other officers and certain employees in restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock that vest in three annual installments subject to continued service with us (collectively, the "2017 annual equity incentive awards"). The 2017 annual equity incentive awards were issued in February 2018 and consisted of 44,323 shares for Mr. Papa, 13,427 shares for Mr. Glyphis, 14,602 shares for Mr. Smith, 9,063 shares for Mr. O'Connor and 7,414 shares for Mr. Jensen, valued at of $816,005, $247,200, $268,830, $166,868 and $136,492, respectively, based on a five-day trailing average closing price of our Class A Common Stock ending on and including February 13, 2018 of $18.41 per share. The grant date fair value of these shares was $839,940 for Mr. Papa, $254,442 for Mr. Glyphis, $276,708 for Mr. Smith, $171,763 for Mr. O'Connor and $140,495 for Mr. Jensen, based on the $18.95 per share closing price of our Class A Common Stock on the grant date. 
The following table sets forth the restricted shares of Class A Common Stock and target number of performance restricted stock units granted to our named executive officers in 2018 but excludes the 2017 annual equity incentive awards referenced in the prior paragraph.  Refer to the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below for additional information regarding the equity awards issued to our named executive officers in 2018.

As is described above, the Compensation Committee elected to pay a portion of 2018 annual incentive bonuses for all named executive officers, other officers and certain employees in restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock that vest in three annual installments subject to continued service with us. These awards were issued in February 2019 and consisted of 59,554 shares for Mr. Papa, 18,763 shares for Mr. Glyphis, 20,800 shares for Mr. Smith, 14,353 shares for Mr. O'Connor and 10,360 shares for Mr. Jensen. The grant date fair value of these shares was $756,931 for Mr. Papa, $238,478 for Mr. Glyphis, $264,368 for Mr. Smith, $182,427 for Mr. O'Connor and $131,676 for Mr. Jensen, based on the $12.71 closing price per share of our Class A Common Stock on the grant date.
Retirement Plans and Other Employee Benefits
Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our employee benefit plans and programs, including medical and dental benefits and life insurance, to the same extent as our other full-time employees, subject to the terms and eligibility requirements of those plans. Our named executive officers may participate in a 401(k) defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan"), subject to limits imposed by the Code, to the same extent as our other full-time employees. In 2018, the 401(k) Plan provided for matching contributions equal to 100% of the first 6% of each employee's eligible compensation contributed to the 401(k) Plan. Effective January 1, 2019, the employer matching contribution was increased to 100% of the first 8% of each employee's eligible compensation contributed to the 401(k) Plan. Employees are immediately 100% vested in the matching contributions. We do not typically provide any perquisites or special personal benefits to our named executive officers.
Compensation of our Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Papa is an advisor to Riverstone. We currently anticipate Mr. Papa will spend approximately 90% of his working time providing services to us as our Chief Executive Officer and approximately 10% of his working time providing services to Riverstone on matters unrelated to the Company. During 2018, this was the approximate allocation of Mr. Papa's working time. The Compensation Committee was aware of Mr. Papa's continued service to Riverstone and considered it when determining an appropriate level of compensation for services as our Chief Executive Officer.
Employment, Severance or Change in Control Agreements
We have not entered into any employment agreements with our named executive officers.  However, we consider a strong workforce to be essential to our success.  To that end, we recognize that the uncertainty which may exist among employees with respect to their "at-will" employment with us could result in the departure or distraction of personnel to our detriment. Accordingly, to encourage the continued attention and dedication of our employees, and to allow our management team to focus on the value to stockholders of strategic alternatives without concern for the impact on their continued employment, on May 2, 2018, our Board adopted the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. Severance Plan (the "Severance Plan") under which all of our regular, full-time U.S. employees are eligible to receive certain "double trigger" severance payments and benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment within a specified period following a change in control. For a more detailed description of the Severance Plan, see "Potential Payments Upon Termination or a Change of Control." Company Guidelines Regarding Stock Ownership
Effective November 2, 2017, our Board adopted stock ownership guidelines, to be administered by the Compensation Committee, for our named executive officers and certain other officers (collectively, "Covered Executives") as well as for non-employee directors of the Company, which are intended to demonstrate to our stockholders, the investing public and other employees that such Covered Executives and non-employee directors are invested in and committed to the Company, and to further align their interests with the interests of our stockholders. Under the guidelines, each Covered Executive must own stock in the Company equal to a multiple of his or her base salary.  The Chief Executive Officer must own an amount equal to six times his annual base salary, the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer each must own an amount equal to three times his annual base salary, and the General Counsel and Chief Accounting Officer each must own an amount equal to two times his annual base salary.  Other Covered Executives must own an amount equal to two times his or her annual base salary, and non-employee directors must each own an amount equal to five times his or her annual cash retainer.
Stock ownership for the purpose of these guidelines, whether (i) owned individually by the named executive officer, or jointly with, or separately by, a spouse, domestic partner and/or minor children, either directly or indirectly, or (ii) held in trust for the benefit of the named executive officer or a spouse, domestic partner and/or minor children, includes the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, whether purchased on the open market or obtained through the exercise of stock options or vesting of stock-based compensation; 
• Unvested stock-based awards subject to time-based vesting conditions; 
• Vested deferred stock units; and 
• Shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock held in the Covered Executive's Company 401(k) or other retirement plan, if any, or in the Company's employee stock ownership plan, if any. 
[END TABLE]
Covered Executives and non-employee directors generally have five years from the later of the date of adoption of the guidelines or the date she or he became a Covered Executive or non-employee director to come into full compliance with the guidelines.  A Covered Executive or non-employee director who is not in compliance with the guidelines on the applicable compliance date is prohibited from selling or transferring any Company stock, except as needed to pay income tax liabilities relating to the vesting or exercise price of a stock option, and may be subject to such other discipline as determined by the Compensation Committee.  There is an exception to the holding requirement for severe hardship or compliance with court or domestic relations orders, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee.
Company Anti-Hedging Policy
Our Insider Trading and Regulation FD Policy prohibits all of our directors, officers and other employees, as well as those acting on behalf of the Company, such as auditors, agents and consultants, from engaging in certain speculative transactions in our securities, including short-term trading, short sales, transactions in puts, calls or other derivatives, margin accounts, pledging for collateral purposes and hedging.  To our knowledge, all such covered individuals are in compliance with this policy.
Clawback Policy
Our Board, at the recommendation of our Compensation Committee, adopted a clawback policy effective August 1, 2018, which applies to each of our named executive officers. Under the policy, recoupment of cash incentive compensation or performance-based equity compensation would be generally required in the event the Company restates its financial statements as a result of a material error in such financial statements if the material error was caused by the fraud or intentional misconduct of one of the officers covered by the policy. In the event of such misconduct, we may recoup cash incentive compensation or performance-based equity compensation that was paid, granted, earned or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of any financial reporting measure during the three years prior to the restatement. The policy gives the Compensation Committee discretion to determine whether a clawback of compensation should be initiated in any given case, as well as the discretion to make other determinations, including whether a covered individual's conduct meets the specified standard, the amount of compensation to be clawed back and the form of reimbursement to the Company. In order to comply with applicable law, the clawback policy will be updated or modified once the SEC adopts final clawback rules pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.
Tax Treatment of NEO Compensation
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Section 162(m)"), generally limits the tax deductibility of compensation paid by a public company to its "covered employees" to $1 million per covered employee in the year the compensation becomes taxable to the executives. While the Compensation Committee considers the impact of Section 162(m) and other tax rules when developing, structuring and implementing our executive compensation programs, the Compensation Committee also believes that it is important to preserve flexibility in administering compensation programs in a  manner designed to promote varying corporate goals. Centennial Resource Production, LLC, our operating subsidiary and the employer of all of our employees, is a partnership and not subject to Section 162(m). However, a portion of the compensation for our executive officers could be non-deductible under Section 162(m) in future tax years.  COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement with members of management and based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement.

2018 Pension Benefits 
None of our named executive officers participated in any defined benefit pension plans in 2018.
2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
None of our named executive officers participated in any non-qualified deferred compensation plans in 2018.
Potential Payments upon Termination or a Change in Control 
Change of control severance protection is provided to all of our regular, U.S. full-time employees, including our named executive officers, under the Severance Plan, which was adopted by our Board on May 2, 2018. The Severance Plan has a "double trigger" mechanism, which requires first that a qualifying change of control event has occurred, and second that, within a specified period thereafter, the employee has incurred a qualifying termination.
Under the Severance Plan, if, within 24 months following a change in control, we terminate the employment of one of our named executive officers without cause or if the named executive officer resigns for "good reason," then such named executive officer will be entitled to receive the following severance benefits and payments, subject to the executive's execution and non-revocation of a release of claims: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to two times the named executive officer's annual base salary;   
• a cash payment equal to two times the average of the actual annual performance bonuses paid to the named executive officer in the three full fiscal years prior to the year of termination (or, if fewer, the number of full fiscal years the employee has performed services for us and been eligible for an annual bonus), excluding any portion of an annual bonus that we reasonably determine is attributable to payment of a portion of the annual bonus in property and is over and above the amount of the annual bonus that the named executive officer would have been paid if his entire annual bonus had been paid in cash; 
• a cash payment equal to 125% of the aggregate COBRA premiums that the named executive officer would need to pay to continue coverage of his and his family's benefit plans for two years following the termination date;  
• outplacement benefits for one year following the termination date; 
• vesting of all unvested equity or equity-based awards under any of the Company's equity compensation plans that vest solely based upon the passage of time; and 
• vesting of all unvested equity or equity-based awards under any of the Company's equity compensation plans that vest based on the attainment of performance vesting conditions at the level that would apply based on actual performance calculated as if the termination date were the final day of the applicable performance period. 
[END TABLE]
As referenced above, if a named executive officer resigns for "good reason" following the change in control, he or she will be entitled to the severance benefits. "Good reason" is generally defined in the Severance Plan to mean the occurrence of any of the following without the named executive officer's prior written consent, subject to certain notice and cure rights: (i) a material diminution in the executive's responsibilities, authorities and duties, (ii) a material reduction in the executive's base salary or target annual bonus opportunity, (iii) a requirement that the executive relocate his principal location of employment to a location that is more than fifty (50) miles from the current work location or (iv) our failure to cause a successor to our business or assets to assume liabilities under the Severance Plan. 
The following table provides estimates of the payments and benefits that would be paid to each named executive officer under each element of our compensation program assuming that such named executive officer's employment was terminated on December 31, 2018 and the "double trigger" requirements under the Severance Plan were satisfied. In all cases, the amounts were valued as of December 31, 2018, based upon, where applicable, $11.02 per share (the closing price of our Class A Common Stock on December 31, 2018). The amounts in the table below are calculated as of December 31, 2018 pursuant to  SEC rules and are not intended to reflect actual payments that may be made. Actual payments that may be made will be based on the dates and circumstances of the applicable event.  Other than under the Severance Plan and except for rights to vested benefits under the terms of our employee benefit plans on the same terms as apply to all of our other full-time  employees, our named executive officers are not entitled to any payments or other benefits in connection with a termination of employment or a change in control.

CEO Pay Ratio
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K ("Item 402(u)"), we are providing the following information regarding the ratio of the annual total compensation of our median  employee (as described below) to that of our Chief Executive Officer.
The SEC's rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported below, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.
Pursuant to Item 402(u), we identified the median employee from our entire employee population (other than our Chief Executive Officer), whether employed on a full-time or part-time basis, as of December 31, 2018, which consisted of 178 employees (all of whom are located in the United States). Within this group of employees, the median employee was identified by using a total target cash compensation measure, which was calculated by annualizing on a straight-line basis the salary of each employee as of December 31, 2018 and adding each employee's target bonus and the amount of employer-paid benefits received by such employee in 2018. The compensation measure was consistently applied to all employees. 
Using this methodology, we identified a median employee. We then calculated that employee's annual total compensation in the same manner as the named executive officers' total compensation, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table.
For 2018, the annual total compensation of our median employee was $130,761, and the annual total compensation of our Chief Executive Officer was $2,693,240, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table. Based on this information, for 2018, the ratio of our Chief Executive Officer's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of our median employee was estimated to be approximately 21 to 1.
Compensation of Our Directors 
Effective December 31, 2017, our Board approved a non-employee director compensation policy, or the "Director Compensation Policy," providing our non-employee directors who are not affiliated with Riverstone or Natural Gas Partners with an annual cash retainer of $87,500 per year, payable quarterly in arrears and subject to proration for any partial year of service, and an annual equity grant on December 31 of each year for a number of restricted shares of our Class A Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing $162,500 by the average daily closing price of one share of our Class A Common Stock over the five consecutive trading days ending on the day before the applicable grant date.  The restricted shares of Class A Common Stock vest in a single installment on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director's continued service as a non-employee director. Our Board updated the Director Compensation Policy effective August 1, 2018 to provide our lead independent director with an additional annual cash retainer of $50,000 per year to recognize the additional responsibilities associated with that role.  
In January 2019, Longnecker, conducted a review of compensation practices for our non-employee directors.  In February 2019, the Compensation Committee met to consider the non-employee director compensation analysis prepared by Longnecker.  Longnecker's analysis noted that the targeted total annual compensation paid to the Company's non-employee directors aligns at approximately the 60th percentile of the Company's compensation peer group on a per-director basis.  2018 Director Compensation

Compensation Risk Assessment
Management has conducted a risk assessment of our compensation plans and practices and concluded that our compensation programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The objective of the assessment was to identify any compensation plans or practices that may encourage employees to take unnecessary risk that could threaten the Company.  No such plans or practices were identified by management. The Compensation Committee has also reviewed the risks and rewards associated with our compensation plans and practices and agrees with management's conclusion.

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Review and Approval of Related Party Transactions
Our Board has adopted a written policy regarding related party transactions, a copy of which is available on our website at www.cdevinc.com. Under the policy, our Audit Committee reviews and, where the Audit Committee determines them to be in our best interests, approves all transactions and arrangements in which we and our directors, director nominees and executive officers and their immediate family members, as well as holders of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities and their immediate family members, have a direct or indirect material interest.  In determining whether a related party transaction or arrangement is in our best interests, the Audit Committee considers, among other factors, the position within or relationship of the related party with us, the materiality of the transaction or arrangement, the business purpose for and reasonableness of the transaction or arrangement, whether the transaction or arrangement is comparable to one that could be available on an arms-length basis to us or is on terms we offer generally to persons who are not related, whether the transaction is in the ordinary course of our business and was proposed and considered in the ordinary course, and the effect of the transaction or arrangement on our business and operations.  The policy provides that the following do not create a material direct or indirect interest on behalf of the related party and are therefore not related party transactions:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• use of Company assets for business purposes for amounts that do not exceed $10,000; 
• reimbursements or payments of business expenses; 
• executive officer or director compensation in accordance with the disclosure exceptions provided for in Instruction 5 to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K (or any successor rule); 
• any charitable contribution, grant, endowment or pledge by us to a charitable organization, foundation or university where the related party's only relationship with that organization is as a director and the aggregate amount involved does not exceed $120,000; 
• any other transaction or arrangement authorized on our behalf from which no related party obtains a benefit with a value to such related person in excess of $25,000, provided that all related transactions or arrangements involving such related party during a fiscal year will be aggregated for such purpose; and 
• any transaction or arrangement pre-approved by the Audit Committee as provided in the policy. 
[END TABLE]
Annually, the Audit Committee reviews any previously approved related party transaction or arrangement that is continuing and determines based on then existing facts and circumstances whether it is in our best interest to continue, modify or terminate each such transaction or arrangement.
The related party transactions policy supplements the conflict of interest provisions in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all conflicts of interests, except under guidelines or resolutions approved by our Board (or the appropriate committee of our Board) or as disclosed in our public filings with the SEC. Under our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, conflict of interest situations include, among others, any financial transaction, arrangement or relationship (including any indebtedness or guarantee of indebtedness) involving the company, and any circumstance, event, relationship or situation in which the personal interest of any of our directors, officers or employees interferes or appears to interfere with our interests as a whole. A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on our website at www.cdevinc.com.  We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement regarding any amendment to, or any waiver of, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics by posting such information on our website.
Although our management believes that the terms of the related party transactions described below are reasonable, it is possible that we could have negotiated more favorable terms for such transactions with unrelated third parties.
Riverstone Affiliated Companies
From time to time, the Company obtains services related to its drilling and completion activities from affiliates of Riverstone. In 2018, the Company paid approximately $0.16 million to Basic Energy Services, Inc., an oilfield service provider that is affiliated with Riverstone. In addition, from time to time, the Company sells its produced oil and gas and other hydrocarbons to affiliates of Riverstone. In 2018, the Company sold natural gas to Lucid Energy Delaware, LLC, a midstream company affiliated with Riverstone, and the Company received approximately $3.95 million in revenue in connection with those sales.  SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who own, or are part of a group that owns, more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by regulation of the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file.
Based solely on our review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 and amendments thereto and other information obtained from our directors and officers and certain 10% stockholders or otherwise available to us, we believe that no director, officer or beneficial owners of more than 10% of our total outstanding shares of Common Stock failed to file the reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act on a timely basis during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT
The following table sets forth information known to us regarding ownership of shares of our Common Stock as of March [15], 2019 by:
[BEGIN TABLE]
• each person who is the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock; 
• each of our named executive officers and directors for 2018; and 
• all of our current executive officers and directors, as a group. 
[END TABLE]
Beneficial ownership is determined according to the rules of the SEC, which generally provide that a person has beneficial ownership of a security if he, she or it possesses sole or shared voting or investment power over that security, including options and warrants that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days.
The beneficial ownership of our Common Stock is based on [264,394,082] shares of our Class A Common Stock and [12,003,183] shares of Class C Common Stock issued and outstanding as of March [15], 2019.

 PROPOSAL 2
APPROVAL ON AN ADVISORY BASIS OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION
In accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") and Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking our stockholders to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement.
As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success.  Please read "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" and the accompanying tables and narrative disclosure for details about our executive compensation programs.  We are asking our stockholders to indicate their support for our named executive officer compensation as described in this proxy statement.  This proposal, commonly known as a "say-on-pay" proposal, gives our stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers' compensation.  This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Accordingly, we will ask our stockholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the annual meeting:
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Centennial Resource Development, Inc. (the "Company") approve, by a non-binding advisory vote, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and the other related tables and disclosure."
The say-on-pay vote is advisory, and therefore not binding on the Company, the Board or the Compensation Committee. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee value the opinions of our stockholders and intend to consider our stockholders' views regarding our executive compensation programs, including in making future decisions relating to such programs. Our stockholders will have a "say-on-pay" vote each year, and the next "say-on-pay" vote will take place at our 2020 Annual Meeting.
Vote Required; Recommendation
The approval by a non-binding advisory vote of our named executive officer compensation requires the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on this proposal. Abstentions will not be counted as a vote cast and, therefore, will not have an effect on the outcome of the vote.  Broker non-votes have no effect on the outcome of the vote.
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AS DISCLOSED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE RULES OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. PROPOSAL 3
ADOPTION OF THE CENTENNIAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, INC.
2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN
In this Proposal 3, we are asking our stockholders to approve the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"). At the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, our Board voted unanimously to approve and adopt the ESPP on February 12, 2019, subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The ESPP is not intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder (the "Code").
The purpose of the ESPP is to provide our eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock through accumulated payroll deductions. We believe that the ESPP will be a key factor in retaining existing employees, recruiting and retaining new employees and aligning and increasing the interest of employees in the success of the Company. If the ESPP is not approved by our stockholders, the ESPP will not become effective and no shares or rights will be issued under it.
Summary of the ESPP
A summary of the principal features of the ESPP is set forth below. The summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the ESPP, which is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A.
Administration. The ESPP will be administered by our Compensation Committee unless the Board assumes the authority for administration of the ESPP. The plan administrator has broad authority to construe the ESPP and to make determinations with respect to the terms and conditions of each offering period under the ESPP, including employee eligibility requirements, maximum payroll deductions and the discounted purchase price applicable to the issuance of shares pursuant to the ESPP, as well as other matters pertaining to plan administration.
Class A Common Stock Reserved for Issuance under the ESPP. A total of 2,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock will be reserved for issuance under the ESPP, which may be adjusted for changes in our capitalization and certain corporate transactions, as described below under the heading "Adjustments."
Eligible Employees. The plan administrator may designate certain of our subsidiaries as participating "designated subsidiaries" in the ESPP and may change these designations from time to time. Employees of the Company and our designated subsidiaries are eligible to participate in the ESPP if they meet the eligibility requirements under the ESPP established from time to time by the plan administrator. Unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, our employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP if they are customarily employed by us or a designated subsidiary for more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under the ESPP if such employee, immediately after the grant, would own (directly or through attribution) stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our common stock or other class of stock.  Eligible employees become participants in the ESPP by enrolling and authorizing payroll deductions by the deadline established by the plan administrator prior to the relevant offering date. Directors who are not employees, as well as consultants, are not eligible to participate in the ESPP. Employees who choose not to participate, or are not eligible to participate at the start of an offering period but who become eligible thereafter, may enroll in any subsequent offering period.
Subject to limited exceptions, all of our employees and the employees of our operating subsidiary, Centennial Resource Production, LLC, are expected to be eligible to participate in the ESPP. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 178 employees, of whom all would have been eligible to participate in the ESPP if it had been in effect on such date.
Participation. Under the terms of the ESPP, eligible employees may generally elect to contribute and apply to the purchase of shares of Class A Common Stock between 1% and 15% of their gross base compensation during an offering period, which includes overtime payments, but excludes sales commissions, incentive compensation, bonuses, expense reimbursements, fringe benefits, moving expenses, equity compensation and other special payments. In addition, no employee will be permitted to accrue the right to purchase stock under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $25,000 worth of shares during any calendar year during which such a purchase right is outstanding (based on the fair market value per share of our Class A Common Stock as of the first day of the offering period during which such right is granted), which limitation will be applied as if the ESPP was intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code. Rights granted under the ESPP are exercisable on specified exercise dates only through funds accumulated by an employee through payroll deductions made during the applicable offering period, and any such funds that are not used to purchase shares will be credited to a participant's account and carried forward and applied toward the purchase of whole shares for the following offering period. Participation in the ESPP is voluntary.
Offering Periods. Under the ESPP, employees are offered the right to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock at a discount to fair market value during offering periods designated by the plan administrator. The initial offering period is expected to commence on July 1, 2019 and end on December 31, 2019, and the subsequent offering periods are expected to be  successive six-month periods commencing on each January 1 and each July 1 to occur following the commencement of the initial offering period. The plan administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.
Share Purchases. On the first trading day of each offering period, each participant will automatically be granted a right to purchase shares of our Class A Common Stock.  Shares are purchased on each exercise date occurring during an offering period, to the extent of the payroll deductions accumulated during the applicable offering period, subject to the participant remaining an eligible employee through such exercise date. The exercise dates for each offering period will be the last trading day of the offering period. Unless the plan administrator designates a higher exercise price for a particular offering period, the exercise price will be 85% of the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock on either the first trading day of each offering period or the exercise date, whichever is lower. The fair market value per share of our Class A Common Stock under the ESPP will generally be the closing sales price of our common stock on NASDAQ on the date for which fair market value is being determined, or if there is no closing sales price for a share of our Class A Common Stock on the date in question, the closing sales price for a share of Class A Common Stock on the last preceding date for which such quotation exists.  On March [18], 2019, the last practicable date prior to the filing of this Proxy Statement, the closing sales price of our Class A Common Stock on NASDAQ was $[] per share.
Unless a participant has elected to withdraw all of the funds then credited to his or her ESPP account or the participant's employment terminates prior to the exercise date, an amount equal to the amount credited to his or her ESPP account will be used to purchase the maximum number of whole shares of Class A Common Stock that can be purchased based on the amount credited to such participant's account on the exercise date. No fractional shares will be issued.
A participant may withdraw from the ESPP by delivering written notice of such election to the Company no later than one week prior to the end of the applicable offering period (or another date designated by the plan administrator). Upon a participant's withdrawal, all of the payroll deductions credited to such participant's account shall be paid to such participant as soon as reasonably practicable and no further payroll deductions shall be made for such offering period.
Termination of Eligibility. If a participant ceases to be an eligible employee for any reason during an offering period, he or she will be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the ESPP and any amounts credited to the participant's ESPP account will be returned to the participant or the participant's beneficiary in the event of his or her death. Participation ends automatically upon a participant's termination of employment.
Transferability; Holding Period. A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP. A participant will not be entitled to sell or otherwise transfer the shares of Class A Common Stock purchased by the participant pursuant to the ESPP to anyone until six months after the exercise date.
Adjustments. In the event that the plan administrator determines that any stock dividend or other distribution, change in control, reorganization, merger, amalgamation, consolidation, combination, repurchase, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or sale, transfer, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or sale or exchange of Common Stock or other securities of the Company, issuance of warrants or other rights to purchase Common Stock or other securities of the Company, or other similar corporate transaction or event affects the Class A Common Stock such that an adjustment would be appropriate in order to prevent dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended by the Company to be made available under the ESPP or with respect to any outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, the plan administrator shall make equitable adjustments to the ESPP and outstanding rights.  In addition, in the event of the foregoing transactions or events or certain significant transactions, including a change in control, the plan administrator may provide for either (1) the replacement of outstanding rights with other rights or property or termination of outstanding rights in exchange for cash, (2) the assumption or substitution of outstanding rights by the successor or survivor corporation or parent or subsidiary thereof, if any, (3) the adjustment in the number and type of shares of stock subject to outstanding rights and/or in the terms and conditions of outstanding rights, (4) the use of participants' accumulated payroll deductions to purchase stock on a new purchase date prior to the next scheduled purchase date and termination of any rights under ongoing offering periods or (5) the termination of all outstanding rights.
Insufficient Shares. If the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock that are to be purchased under outstanding rights on any particular date exceed the number of shares then available for issuance under the ESPP, the plan administrator will make a pro rata allocation of the available shares on a uniform and equitable basis. If the plan administrator thereafter suspends or terminates the ESPP, the excess payroll deductions will be refunded to participants.
Amendment or Termination of the ESPP. The plan administrator has the right to amend, suspend or terminate the ESPP at any time and from time to time to the extent that it deems advisable, subject to the requirement to obtain stockholder approval of amendments to the extent required by law and NASDAQ rules. U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences
The ESPP is not intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Section 423 of the Code. Accordingly, certain tax benefits available to participants in a Section 423 plan are not available under the ESPP.
For federal income tax purposes, a participant generally will not recognize taxable income on the grant of a right under the ESPP. Upon the exercise of a right under the ESPP, a participant will recognize ordinary income, and unless limited by Section 280G or 162(m) of the Code, the Company or its subsidiary will generally be entitled to a corresponding deduction, in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the exercise date and the purchase price paid for the shares. A participant's basis in shares of Class A Common Stock received on exercise, for purposes of determining the participant's gain or loss on subsequent disposition of such shares of Class A Common Stock, generally, will be the fair market value of the shares of Class A Common Stock on the date the participant exercises his or her right.
Upon the subsequent sale of the shares acquired upon the exercise of a right under the ESPP, the participant will recognize capital gain or loss (long-term or short-term, depending on how long the shares were held following the date they were purchased by the participant prior to disposing of them).
The above is a general summary under current law of the material federal income tax consequences to an employee who participates in the ESPP. This summary deals with the general federal income tax principles that apply and is provided only for general information. Some kinds of taxes, such as state, local and foreign income taxes and federal employment taxes, are not discussed. Tax laws are complex and subject to change and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. The summary above does not discuss all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant in light of a participant's personal circumstances. Further, this summarized tax information is not tax advice, and a participant in the ESPP should rely on the advice of his or her legal and tax advisors.
New Plan Benefits
Because the number of shares that may be purchased under the ESPP will depend on each employee's voluntary election to participate and contribution elections, and on the fair market value of our Class A Common Stock at various future dates, neither the actual number of shares that may be purchased by any individual nor the benefits that will be received in the future by participants in the ESPP can be determined in advance.
Vote Required; Recommendation
The adoption of the Centennial Resource Development, Inc. 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock present in person or represented by proxy that are entitled to vote and actually cast thereon at the Annual Meeting, voting as a single class. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this proposal.
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADOPTION OF THE CENTENNIAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT, INC. 2019 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. PROPOSAL 4
APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE COMPANY'S CHARTER AND BYLAWS TO 
IMPLEMENT A MAJORITY VOTING STANDARD IN UNCONTESTED DIRECTOR ELECTIONS
At the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board voted unanimously to approve, and our stockholders are being asked to approve, amendments to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections (the "Majority Voting Proposal").
Section 5.2(b) of our Charter and Section 2.5(d) of our Bylaws currently provide that directors to be elected at any meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in such election, subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of preferred stock of the Company. Under this plurality voting standard, the director nominees receiving the highest number of FOR votes cast are elected as directors regardless of the number of WITHHOLD votes received.
The proposed amendment to Section 5.2 of our Charter and Section 2.5(d) of our Bylaws provide that, in an uncontested election of directors, a candidate would be elected as a director only if the number of votes cast for the candidate exceed the number of votes cast against the candidate. Abstentions and broker non-votes would not be counted as votes cast and would have no effect on the outcome of the vote. If, however, the Secretary of the Company were to determine that an election of directors was contested (i.e., the number of candidates exceeds the number of directors to be elected), a plurality voting standard would apply, and the candidates receiving the greatest number of FOR votes would be elected. If approved, this proposal would establish a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections beginning with the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders.
We believe that the adoption of a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections will give our stockholders a greater voice in determining the composition of our Board. Under this standard, a director nominee will not be elected to the Board when the number of votes cast against the director nominee exceed the number of votes cast for the director nominee. We also believe, however, that a plurality voting standard should continue to apply in contested elections, where the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected. If a majority voting standard were used in contested elections, it would be possible for no single director nominee to receive a majority of votes cast, leaving the incumbent director to serve as a holdover director until the earlier of the election and qualification of such director's successor or such director's death, resignation or removal.
A form of the Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Third A&R Charter") and the Second Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Second A&R Bylaws"), which each reflect the proposed amendments contemplated by this Majority Voting Proposal, are attached to this proxy statement as Annex B and Annex C, respectively. The description of the proposed amendments to the Charter and Bylaws included above are only a summary of the proposed amendments and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual text of the proposed amendments reflected in Annex B and Annex C. If adopted, the proposed amendments to our Charter and Bylaws to implement a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections will become effective immediately following our filing of the Third A&R Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware after the conclusion of this Annual Meeting.
If the stockholders approve the Majority Voting Proposal, we will also revise our Corporate Governance Guidelines to include a director resignation policy to address the issue of "holdover" directors who are not re-elected but remain directors because their successor has not been elected or appointed. This policy would require each incumbent director that is nominated by the Board for re-election to tender an irrevocable resignation letter to the Board prior to the mailing of the proxy statement for the meeting at which such nominee is to be re-elected as director. If such incumbent director is not re-elected by a majority vote in an uncontested election, the Corporate Governance Guidelines will provide for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to consider the tendered resignation and make a recommendation to the Board as to whether to accept or reject the resignation. The Board would then, after taking into account the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, accept or reject such tendered resignation generally within 90 days following certification of the election results. Thereafter, the Company would publicly disclose the decision of the Board and, if applicable, the Board's reasons for rejecting a tendered resignation. Pursuant to the provisions of our Third A&R Charter, if a director's tendered resignation is rejected, such director would continue to serve until a successor is elected, or until such director's earlier removal or death. If a director's tendered resignation is accepted, then the Board would have the sole discretion to fill any resulting vacancy or to decrease the number of directors, in each case pursuant to the provisions of and to the extent permitted by our Third A&R Charter and Second A&R Bylaws. Any director who tenders a resignation pursuant to this policy would be required to abstain from participating in the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's deliberations and in the decision of the Board as to whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation.
In determining whether to recommend to our stockholders the adoption of a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections, our Board analyzed current corporate governance trends and evaluated the arguments in favor of and against  maintaining the existing plurality voting standard in uncontested director elections. Our Board recognizes that many other public companies have amended their governing documents to provide for a majority voting standard rather than a plurality standard in uncontested director elections. Our Board believes that generally requiring directors to be elected by a majority of votes cast both ensures that only director nominees with broad acceptability among our stockholders will be elected and enhances the accountability of each elected director to our stockholders. Accordingly, after careful consideration, our Board has determined to recommend that our stockholders amend our Charter and Bylaws to adopt a majority voting standard for uncontested director elections. Our Board believes, however, that the plurality vote should continue to apply in contested director elections.
Vote Required; Recommendation
The approval of the Majority Voting Proposal requires the affirmative vote, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, of a majority of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote on this proposal, voting together as a single class. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this proposal.
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE MAJORITY VOTING PROPOSAL. PROPOSAL 5
ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL CHARTER AMENDMENTS
At the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, our Board voted unanimously to approve, and our stockholders are being asked to approve, amendments to the Company's Charter to eliminate certain provisions relating to the Company's business combination and its capital structure preceding the business combination. These provisions include references to shares of the Company's Class B Common Stock, all of which converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis in connection with the closing of the Company's business combination on October 11, 2016. Since the closing of the business combination, these provisions are no longer relevant or applicable to us or our stockholders. Therefore, assuming the Majority Voting Proposal is approved, which would require amendments to the Charter, we are seeking to concurrently revise the Charter to remove these unnecessary provisions (the "Additional Charter Proposal").
A form of the Third A&R Charter, which reflects the proposed amendments contemplated by this Additional Charter Proposal, is attached to this proxy statement as Annex B. The description of the proposed amendments to the Charter included above is only an overview of the proposed amendments and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual text of the proposed amendments reflected in Annex B. If adopted, the proposed amendments to our Charter under this proposal will become effective immediately following our filing of the Third A&R Charter with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware after the conclusion of this Annual Meeting.
Vote Required; Recommendation
The Additional Charter Proposal is conditioned on the approval of the Majority Voting Proposal.
The approval of the Additional Charter Proposal requires the affirmative vote, whether present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, of a majority of outstanding shares of Common Stock entitled to vote on this proposal, voting together as a single class. Abstentions will have the same effect as a vote against this proposal. Broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote for this proposal.
OUR BOARD UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE ADDITIONAL CHARTER PROPOSAL. PROPOSAL 6
RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
KPMG LLP, which has been our independent audit firm since November 18, 2016, has been appointed by our Audit Committee as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and our Audit Committee has further directed that the appointment of KPMG LLP be submitted for ratification by our stockholders at the Annual Meeting.  We have been advised by KPMG LLP that neither that firm nor any of its associates has any relationship with us or our subsidiaries other than the usual relationship that exists between independent auditors and their clients.  Representatives of KPMG LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be provided an opportunity to make a statement and to respond to appropriate inquiries from stockholders.
Stockholder ratification of the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required by our Bylaws, Corporate Governance Guidelines, committee charters or otherwise.  However, our Board is submitting the appointment of KPMG LLP to our stockholders for ratification as a matter of what it considers to be good corporate practice. Even if the appointment is ratified, our Audit Committee, in its discretion, may appoint a different independent accounting firm at any time during the year if our Audit Committee determines that such a change would be in our and our stockholders' best interests.

ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION
5.1 Eligibility. Any Eligible Employee who shall be employed by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary on a given Enrollment Date for an Offering Period shall be eligible to participate in the Plan during such Offering Period, subject to the requirements of this Article V.
5.2 Enrollment in Plan.

(a) Each subscription agreement shall designate a whole percentage of such Eligible Employee's Compensation to be withheld by the Company or the Designated Subsidiary employing such Eligible Employee on each payday during the Offering Period as payroll deductions under the Plan. The percentage of Compensation designated by an Eligible Employee may not be less than 1% and may not be more than the maximum percentage specified by the Administrator in the applicable Offering Document (which percentage shall be 15% in the absence of any such designation) as payroll deductions. The payroll deductions made for each Participant shall be on an after-tax basis and shall be credited to an account for such Participant under the Plan and shall be deposited with the general funds of the Company.

A-4
in local law, tax policy or custom. Moreover, the Administrator may approve such supplements to, or amendments, restatements, sub-plans to or alternative versions of this Plan as it may consider necessary or appropriate for such purposes without thereby affecting the terms of this Plan as in effect for any other purpose. No such special terms, supplements, amendments or restatements shall include any provisions that are inconsistent with the terms of this Plan as then in effect unless this Plan could have been amended to eliminate such inconsistency without further approval by the stockholders of the Company.
ARTICLE VI.
GRANT AND EXERCISE OF RIGHTS
6.1 Grant of Rights. On the Enrollment Date of each Offering Period, each Eligible Employee participating in such Offering Period shall, subject to the limits in Section 5.5, have the right to buy, on the applicable Purchase Date during such Offering Period (at the applicable Purchase Price), such number of whole Shares as is determined by dividing (a) such Participant's payroll deductions accumulated prior to such Purchase Date and retained in the Participant's account as of the Purchase Date, by (b) the applicable Purchase Price (rounded down to the nearest Share). The right shall expire on the last Purchase Date of the Offering Period or, if earlier, upon a Participant ceasing to be an Eligible Employee.
6.2 Exercise of Rights. On each Purchase Date, subject to the Participant remaining an Eligible Employee through such Purchase Date, each Participant's accumulated payroll deductions and any other additional payments specifically provided for in the applicable Offering Document will be applied to the purchase of whole Shares pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the applicable Offering Document at the Purchase Price. No fractional Shares shall be issued upon the exercise of rights granted under the Plan, unless the Offering Document specifically provides otherwise. Any cash in lieu of fractional Shares remaining after the purchase of whole Shares upon exercise of a purchase right will be credited to a Participant's account and carried forward and applied toward the purchase of whole Shares for the next following Offering Period. Shares issued pursuant to the Plan may be evidenced in such manner as the Administrator may determine and may be issued in certificated form or issued pursuant to book-entry procedures. 
6.3 Pro Rata Allocation of Shares. If the Administrator determines that, on a given Purchase Date, the number of Shares with respect to which rights are to be exercised may exceed (a) the number of Shares that were available for issuance under the Plan on the Enrollment Date of the applicable Offering Period, or (b) the number of Shares available for issuance under the Plan on such Purchase Date, the Administrator may in its sole discretion provide that the Company shall make a pro rata allocation of the Shares available for purchase on such Enrollment Date or Purchase Date, as applicable, in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as it shall determine in its sole discretion to be equitable among all Participants for whom rights to purchase Common Stock are to be exercised pursuant to this Article VI on such Purchase Date, and shall either (i) continue all Offering Periods then in effect, or (ii) terminate any or all Offering Periods then in effect pursuant to Article IX. The Company may make pro rata allocation of the Shares available on the Enrollment Date of any applicable Offering Period pursuant to the preceding sentence, notwithstanding any authorization of additional Shares for issuance under the Plan by the Company's stockholders subsequent to such Enrollment Date. The balance of the amount credited to the account of each Participant that has not been applied to the purchase of Shares shall be paid to such Participant in one lump sum in cash as soon as reasonably practicable after the Purchase Date. 
6.4 Withholding. Each Participant must pay the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, or make provision satisfactory to the Administrator for payment in accordance with the Plan of, any taxes required by law to be withheld with respect to any purchase of Shares under the Plan or any sale of such Shares by the date of the event creating the tax liability.  Subject to any Company insider trading policy (including blackout periods) and Section 12.6, except as otherwise determined by the Administrator, Participants may satisfy such tax obligations (i) in cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, or by check made payable to the order of the Company or a Designated Subsidiary, provided that (A) the Company may limit the use of the foregoing payment forms if one or more of the payment forms below is permitted and (B) the Company may, or may cause a Designated Subsidiary to, deduct an amount sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations based on the applicable statutory withholding rates (or such other rate as may be determined by the Company after considering any accounting consequences or costs) from any payment of any kind otherwise due to a Participant, (ii) in whole or in part by delivery of Shares valued at their Fair Market Value on the Purchase Date, (iii) if there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax obligations are satisfied, (A) delivery (including telephonically to the extent permitted by the Company) of an irrevocable and unconditional undertaking by a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary sufficient funds to satisfy the tax obligations, or (B) delivery by the Participant to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary of a copy of irrevocable and unconditional instructions to a broker acceptable to the Company to deliver promptly to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary cash or a check sufficient to satisfy the tax withholding; provided that such amount is paid to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary at such time as may be required by the Company, or (iv) any combination of the foregoing payment forms.  Subject to Section 12.6, if any tax withholding obligation will be satisfied under clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence by the retention of Shares purchased upon exercise of a Participant's rights under the Plan creating the tax obligation and there is a public market for Shares at the time the tax obligation is satisfied, the Company may elect to instruct any brokerage firm determined acceptable to the Company for such purpose to sell on the applicable 
A-5
Participant's behalf some or all of the Shares retained and to remit the proceeds of the sale to the Company, a Designated Subsidiary or their respective designees, and each Participant's exercise of a Participant's rights under the Plan will constitute the Participant's authorization to the Company or a Designated Subsidiary and instruction and authorization to such brokerage firm to complete the transactions described in this sentence. Participant acknowledges that Participant is ultimately liable and responsible for all taxes owed in connection with the purchase of Shares under the Plan and any subsequent sale of such Shares, regardless of any action the Company or any Subsidiary takes with respect to any tax withholding obligations that arise in connection with the Shares. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary makes any representation or undertaking regarding the treatment of any tax withholding in connection with the purchase or the subsequent sale of Shares under the Plan.
6.5 Conditions to Issuance of Common Stock. The Company shall not be required to issue or deliver any certificate or certificates for, or make any book entries evidencing, Shares purchased upon the exercise of rights under the Plan prior to fulfillment of all of the following conditions: 
(a) The admission of such Shares to listing on all stock exchanges, if any, on which the Common Stock is then listed; 
(b) The completion of any registration or other qualification of such Shares under any state or federal law or under the rulings or regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other governmental regulatory body, that the Administrator shall, in its absolute discretion, deem necessary or advisable; 
(c) The obtaining of any approval or other clearance from any state or federal governmental agency that the Administrator shall, in its absolute discretion, determine to be necessary or advisable; 
(d) The payment in accordance with Section 6.4 to the Company of all amounts that it is required to withhold under federal, state or local law upon exercise of the rights, if any; and 
(e) The lapse of such reasonable period of time following the exercise of the rights as the Administrator may from time to time establish for reasons of administrative convenience.
6.6 Mandatory Holding Period. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary and other than to satisfy withholding tax obligations in accordance with Section 6.4, unless the Administrator otherwise determines, a Participant may not lend, offer, pledge, sell, contract to sell, sell or grant any option, right or warrant to purchase, or otherwise transfer or dispose of, directly or indirectly, any Shares acquired under the Plan or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for such Shares (in any case, a "Transfer") prior to the expiration of the period beginning on and including the Purchase Date on which such Shares were acquired under the Plan and ending on the date that is six (6) months following such Purchase Date.  Any attempted Transfer of Shares in violation of this Section 6.6 will be null and void.  The Company will not be required to (a) recognize on its books any Transfers in violation of this Section 6.6 or (b) treat as owner of a Share any purchaser or other transferee to whom a Share has been Transferred in violation of this Section 6.6.  To ensure compliance with the requirements of this Section 6.6, the Company may issue "stop transfer" instructions to its transfer agent, if any, or make notations to the same effect in its records, in each case, as the Company determines to be necessary or appropriate.
ARTICLE VII

If a Participant withdraws from an Offering Period, payroll deductions shall not resume at the beginning of the next Offering Period unless the Participant timely delivers to the Company a new subscription agreement.
7.2 Future Participation. A Participant's withdrawal from an Offering Period shall not have any effect upon his or her eligibility to participate in any similar plan that may hereafter be adopted by the Company or a Designated Subsidiary or in subsequent Offering Periods that commence after the termination of the Offering Period from which the Participant withdraws.
7.3 Cessation of Eligibility. Upon a Participant's ceasing to be an Eligible Employee for any reason, he or she shall be deemed to have elected to withdraw from the Plan pursuant to this Article VII and the payroll deductions credited to such Participant's account during the Offering Period shall be paid to such Participant or, in the case of his or her death, to the person or persons entitled thereto under Section 12.4, as soon as reasonably practicable, and such Participant's purchase rights under the Plan shall be automatically terminated.

The Committee may delegate administrative tasks under the Plan to the services of an Agent or Employee to assist in the administration of the Plan, including establishing and maintaining individual accounts under the Plan for each Participant. The Board may at any time vest in the Board any authority or duties for administration of the Plan. 
11.2 Action by the Administrator. Unless otherwise established by the Board or in any charter of the Administrator, a majority of the Administrator shall constitute a quorum. The acts of a majority of the members present at any meeting at which a quorum is present and, subject to Applicable Law and the bylaws of the Company, acts approved in writing by a majority of the Administrator in lieu of a meeting, shall be deemed the acts of the Administrator. Each member of the Administrator is entitled to, in good faith, rely or act upon any report or other information furnished to that member by any officer or other employee of the Company or any Designated Subsidiary, the Company's independent certified public accountants, or any executive compensation consultant or other professional retained by the Company to assist in the administration of the Plan.
11.3 Authority of Administrator. The Administrator shall have the power, subject to, and within the limitations of, the express provisions of the Plan:
(a) To determine when and how rights to purchase Common Stock shall be granted and the provisions of each offering of such rights (which need not be identical).
(b) To designate from time to time which Subsidiaries of the Company shall be Designated Subsidiaries, which designation may be made without the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
(c) To construe and interpret the Plan and rights granted under it, and to establish, amend and revoke rules and regulations for its administration. The Administrator, in the exercise of this power, may correct any defect, omission or 
A-8
inconsistency in the Plan, in a manner and to the extent it shall deem necessary or expedient to make the Plan fully effective.

ARTICLE XII.
MISCELLANEOUS
12.1 Restriction upon Assignment. A right granted under the Plan shall not be transferable and is exercisable only by the Participant. The Company shall not recognize and shall be under no duty to recognize any assignment or alienation of the Participant's interest in the Plan, the Participant's rights under the Plan or any rights thereunder. 
12.2 Rights as a Stockholder. With respect to Shares subject to a right granted under the Plan, a Participant shall not be deemed to be a stockholder of the Company, and the Participant shall not have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder, until such Shares have been issued to the Participant following exercise of the Participant's rights under the Plan. No adjustments shall be made for dividends (ordinary or extraordinary, whether in cash securities, or other property) or distribution or other rights for which the record date occurs prior to the date of such issuance, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as determined by the Administrator.
12.3 Interest. No interest shall accrue on the payroll deductions or contributions of a Participant under the Plan.
12.4 Designation of Beneficiary.
(a) A Participant may, in the manner determined by the Administrator, file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any Shares and/or cash, if any, from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death subsequent to a Purchase Date on which the Participant's rights are exercised but prior to delivery to such Participant of such Shares and cash. In addition, a Participant may file a written designation of a beneficiary who is to receive any cash from the Participant's account under the Plan in the event of such Participant's death prior to exercise of the Participant's rights under the Plan. If the Participant is married and resides in a community property state, a designation of a person other than the Participant's spouse as his or her beneficiary shall not be effective without the prior written consent of the Participant's spouse. 
(b) Such designation of beneficiary may be changed by the Participant at any time by written notice to the Company. In the event of the death of a Participant and in the absence of a beneficiary validly designated under the Plan who is living at the time of such Participant's death, the Company shall deliver such Shares and/or cash to the executor or administrator of the estate of the Participant, or if no such executor or administrator has been appointed (to the knowledge of the Company), the Company, in its discretion, may deliver such Shares and/or cash to the spouse or to any one or more dependents or relatives of the Participant, or if no spouse, dependent or relative is known to the Company, then to such other person as the Company may designate.
12.5 Notices. All notices or other communications by a Participant to the Company under or in connection with the Plan shall be deemed to have been duly given when received in the form specified by the Company at the location, or by the person, designated by the Company for the receipt thereof.
12.6 Equal Rights and Privileges.  Subject to Section 5.6, all Eligible Employees will have equal rights and privileges under this Plan, and any provision of this Plan that is inconsistent with the equal rights and privileges requirement of Section 423 of the Code will, without further act or amendment by the Company, the Board or the Administrator, be reformed to comply with the equal rights and privileges requirement of Section 423 of the Code. 
12.7 Use of Funds. All payroll deductions received or held by the Company under the Plan may be used by the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such payroll deductions.
12.8 Reports. Statements of account shall be given to Participants at least annually, which statements shall set forth the amounts of payroll deductions, the Purchase Price, the number of Shares purchased and the remaining cash balance, if any.
12.9 No Employment Rights. Nothing in the Plan shall be construed to give any person (including any Eligible Employee or Participant) the right to remain in the employ of the Company or any Subsidiary or affect the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to terminate the employment of any person (including any Eligible Employee or Participant) at any time, with or without cause.
A-9

Before the commencement of an Offering Period, the Administrator shall prescribe the time limits within which any such electronic form shall be submitted to the Administrator with respect to such Offering Period in order to be a valid election.

The Corporation will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon redemption of the Common Units for Class A Common Stock pursuant to the LLC Agreement, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issuable upon any such redemption pursuant to the LLC Agreement; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude the 
B-3
Corporation from satisfying its obligations in respect of any such redemption of Common Units pursuant to the LLC Agreement by delivering to the holder of Common Units upon such redemption cash in lieu of shares of Class A Common Stock in the amount permitted by and provided in the LLC Agreement. All shares of Class A Common Stock that shall be issued upon any such redemption will, upon issuance in accordance with the LLC Agreement, be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

(vi)Restrictive Legend.  All certificates or book entries representing shares of Class C Common Stock, as the case may be, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form (or in such other form as the Board may determine):
THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS [CERTIFICATE][BOOK ENTRY] ARE SUBJECT TO THE RESTRICTIONS (INCLUDING RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER) SET FORTH IN THE THIRD AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION (A COPY OF WHICH IS ON FILE WITH THE SECRETARY OF THE CORPORATION AND SHALL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO ANY STOCKHOLDER MAKING A REQUEST THEREFOR).

(f)Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up of the Corporation. Subject to applicable law, and the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other liabilities of the Corporation, the holders of shares of Common Stock (other than holders of shares of Class C Common Stock) shall be entitled to receive all the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders, ratably in proportion to the number of shares of Common Stock (other than shares of Class C Common Stock) held by them.

Subject to Section 5.5, if the number of directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned by the Board among the classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee.
Section 5.3 Newly Created Directorships and Vacancies.

The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by law or by this Third Amended and Restated Certificate (including any Preferred Stock Designation), the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of all then outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws; and provided further, however, that no Bylaws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall invalidate any prior act of the Board that would have been valid if such Bylaws had not been adopted.
ARTICLE VII.
MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS; 
ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT
Section 7.1 Meetings. Subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock, and to the requirements of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and the ability of the stockholders to call a special meeting is hereby specifically denied. Except as provided in the foregoing sentence, special meetings of stockholders may not be called by another person or persons.

ARTICLE VIII.
LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION
Section 8.1 Limitation of Director Liability. A director of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted under the DGCL as the same exists or may hereafter be amended unless they violated their duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, acted in bad faith, knowingly or intentionally violated the law, authorized unlawful payments of dividends, unlawful stock purchases or unlawful redemptions, or derived improper personal benefit from their actions as directors. Any amendment, modification or repeal of the foregoing sentence shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such amendment, modification or repeal.
Section 8.2 Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses.
(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "proceeding") by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and 
B-6
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such indemnitee in connection with such proceeding. The Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay the expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred by an indemnitee in defending or otherwise participating in any proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, to the extent required by applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on behalf of the indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section 8.2 or otherwise. The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this Section 8.2 shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.2(a), except for proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on any indemnitee by this Section 8.2 shall not be exclusive of any other rights that any indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this Third Amended and Restated Certificate, the Bylaws, an agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
(c) Any repeal or amendment of this Section 8.2 by the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate inconsistent with this Section 8.2, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any proceeding (regardless of when such proceeding is first threatened, commenced or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.
(d) This Section 8.2 shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than indemnitees.
ARTICLE IX.
ORPORATE OPPORTUNITY
The doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any other analogous doctrine, shall not apply with respect to the Corporation or any of its officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, in circumstances where the application of any such doctrine would conflict with any fiduciary duties or contractual obligations they may have as of the date of this Third Amended and Restated Certificate or in the future. In addition to the foregoing, the doctrine of corporate opportunity shall not apply to any other corporate opportunity with respect to any of the directors or officers of the Corporation unless such corporate opportunity is offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation and such opportunity is one the Corporation is legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Corporation to pursue.

OFFICES
Section 1.1. Registered Office.  The registered office of the Corporation within the State of Delaware shall be located at either (a) the principal place of business of the Corporation in the State of Delaware or (b) the office of the corporation or individual acting as the Corporation's registered agent in Delaware.
Section 1.2. Additional Offices.  The Corporation may, in addition to its registered office in the State of Delaware, have such other offices and places of business, both within and outside the State of Delaware, as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the "Board") may from time to time determine or as the business and affairs of the Corporation may require.
ARTICLE II.
STOCKHOLDERS MEETINGS
Section 2.1. Annual Meetings.  The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5(a).  At each annual meeting, the stockholders entitled to vote on such matters shall elect those directors of the Corporation to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of such annual meeting and may transact any other business as may properly be brought before the meeting.
Section 2.2. Special Meetings.  Subject to the rights of the holders of any outstanding series of the Preferred Stock and to the requirement of applicable law, special meetings of stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, or the Board pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Board, and may not be called by any other person.  Special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such place, either within or without the State of Delaware, and at such time and on such date as shall be determined by the Board and stated in the Corporation's notice of the meeting, provided that the Board may in its sole discretion determine that the meeting shall not be held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5(a).
Section 2.3. Notices.  Written notice of each stockholders meeting stating the place, if any, date, and time of the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, if such date is different from the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, shall be given in the manner permitted by Section 9.3 to each stockholder entitled to vote thereat as of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting, by the Corporation not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting unless otherwise required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as amended from time to time (the "DGCL").  If said notice is for a stockholders meeting other than an annual meeting, it shall in addition state the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, and the business transacted at such meeting shall be limited to the matters so stated in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto).  Any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be postponed, and any meeting of stockholders as to which notice has been given may be cancelled, by the Board upon public announcement (as defined in Section 2.7(c)) given before the date previously scheduled for such meeting.
Section 2.4. Quorum.  Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Corporation's Third Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as the same may be amended or restated from time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation") or these Bylaws, the presence, in person or by proxy, at a stockholders meeting of the holders of shares of outstanding capital stock of the Corporation representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote at such meeting shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such meeting, except that when specified business is to be voted on by a class or series of stock voting as a class, the holders of shares representing a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series shall constitute a quorum of such class or series for the transaction of such business.  If a quorum shall not be present or represented by proxy at any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn the meeting from time to time in the manner 
C-1
provided in Section 2.6 until a quorum shall attend.  The stockholders present at a duly convened meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.  Shares of its own stock belonging to the Corporation or to another corporation, if a majority of the voting power of the shares entitled to vote in the election of directors of such other corporation is held, directly or indirectly, by the Corporation, shall neither be entitled to vote nor be counted for quorum purposes; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not limit the right of the Corporation or any such other corporation to vote shares held by it in a fiduciary capacity.
Section 2.5. Voting of Shares.
(a)Voting Lists.  The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall prepare and make, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders of record entitled to vote at such meeting; provided, however, that if the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than 10 days before the meeting date, the list shall reflect the stockholders entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date, arranged in alphabetical order and showing the address and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder.  Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) shall require the Corporation to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.  Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation.  In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation.  If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.  If a meeting of stockholders is to be held solely by means of remote communication as permitted by Section 9.5(a), the list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of meeting.  The stock ledger shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the list required by this Section 2.5(a) or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders.
(b)Manner of Voting.  At any stockholders meeting, every stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy.  If authorized by the Board, the voting by stockholders or proxy holders at any meeting conducted by remote communication may be effected by a ballot submitted by electronic transmission (as defined in Section 9.3), provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which the Corporation can determine that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder or proxy holder.  The Board, in its discretion, or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders, in such person's discretion, may require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.
(c)Proxies.  Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period.  Proxies need not be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation until the meeting is called to order, but shall be filed with the Secretary before being voted.  Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, either of the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority.
(i)A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy.  Execution may be accomplished by the stockholder or such stockholder's authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such writing or causing such person's signature to be affixed to such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature.
(ii)A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of an electronic transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that any such electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder.
Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or transmission could be used; provided that such copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.
C-2
(d)Required Vote.  Subject to the rights of the holders of one or more series of preferred stock of the Corporation ("Preferred Stock"), voting separately by class or series, to elect directors pursuant to the terms of one or more series of Preferred Stock, at all duly called or convened meetings of stockholders, at which a quorum is present, a nominee for director shall be elected to the Board if the votes cast for such nominee's election exceed the votes cast against such nominee's election (with any abstentions or broker non-votes not counted as a vote cast either for or against that nominee's election); provided, however, that a plurality of the votes cast shall be sufficient to elect a director at any duly called or convened meeting of stockholders, at which a quorum is present, if the Secretary of the Corporation determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected as of the record date for such meeting. If directors are to be elected by a plurality of the votes cast, stockholders shall not be permitted to vote against a nominee. All other matters presented to the stockholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be determined by the vote of a majority of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon, unless the matter is one upon which, by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws or applicable stock exchange rules, a different vote is required, in which case such provision shall govern and control the decision of such matter.
(e)Inspectors of Election.  The Board may, and shall if required by law, in advance of any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more persons as inspectors of election, who may be employees of the Corporation or otherwise serve the Corporation in other capacities, to act at such meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof and to make a written report thereof.  The Board may designate one or more persons as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act.  If no inspectors of election or alternates are appointed by the Board, the chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting.  Each inspector, before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability.  The inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of outstanding shares and the voting power of each; determine the number of shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and the validity of proxies and ballots; count all votes and ballots and report the results; determine and retain for a reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any determination by the inspectors; and certify their determination of the number of shares represented at the meeting and their count of all votes and ballots.  No person who is a candidate for an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such election.  Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by the inspector or by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such meeting.  If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be the report of the inspectors.
Section 2.6. Adjournments.  Any meeting of stockholders, annual or special, may be adjourned by the chairman of the meeting, from time to time, whether or not there is a quorum, to reconvene at the same or some other place.  Notice need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the date, time, and place, if any, thereof, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken.  At the adjourned meeting the stockholders, or the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to vote separately as a class, as the case may be, may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.  If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.  If after the adjournment a new record date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting in accordance with Section 9.2, and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date fixed for notice of such adjourned meeting.
Section 2.7. Advance Notice for Business.
(a) Annual Meetings of Stockholders.  No business may be transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders, other than business that is either (i) specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board, (ii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or at the direction of the Board or (iii) otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the Corporation (x) who is a stockholder of record entitled to vote at such annual meeting on the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this Section 2.7(a) and on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and (y) who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2.7(a).  Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.7(a) to the contrary, only persons nominated for election as a director to fill any term of a directorship that expires on the date of the annual meeting pursuant to Section 3.2 will be considered for election at such meeting.
(i)In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business (other than nominations) to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the Secretary of the Corporation and such business must otherwise be a proper matter for stockholder action.  Subject to Section 2.7(a)(iii), a stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to such business, to be timely, must be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 90th day nor earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting is more than 30 days before or more than 60 
C-3
days after such anniversary date, notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day before the meeting and not later than the later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day before the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is first made by the Corporation.  The public announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting shall not commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a stockholder's notice as described in this Section 2.7(a).
(ii)To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary with respect to any business (other than nominations) must set forth as to each such matter such stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (A) a brief description of the business desired to be brought before the annual meeting, the text of the proposal or business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration and in the event such business includes a proposal to amend these Bylaws, the language of the proposed amendment) and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B) the name and record address of such stockholder and the name and address of the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C) the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation that are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and by the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (D) a description of all arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made and any other person or persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business by such stockholder, (E) any material interest of such stockholder and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made in such business and (F) a representation that such stockholder (or a qualified representative of such stockholder) intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such business before the meeting.
(iii)The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations) if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder's intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and such stockholder has complied with the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit proxies for such annual meeting.  No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of stockholders except business brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.7(a), provided, however, that once business has been properly brought before the annual meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any such business.  If the Board or the chairman of the annual meeting determines that any stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.7(a) or that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the information requirements of this Section 2.7(a), such proposal shall not be presented for action at the annual meeting.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.7(a), if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the annual meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the proposed business, such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such matter may have been received by the Corporation.
(iv)In addition to the provisions of this Section 2.7(a), a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.  Nothing in this Section 2.7(a) shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.
(b) Special Meetings of Stockholders.  Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting.  Nominations of persons for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting only pursuant to Section 3.2.
(c) Public Announcement.  For purposes of these Bylaws, "public announcement" shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service, Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document publicly filed by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (or any successor thereto).
Section 2.8. Conduct of Meetings.  The chairman of each annual and special meeting of stockholders shall be the Chairman of the Board or, in the absence (or inability or refusal to act) of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer (if he or she shall be a director) or, in the absence (or inability or refusal to act of the Chief Executive Officer or if the Chief Executive Officer is not a director, the President (if he or she shall be a director) or, in the absence (or inability or refusal to act) of the President or if the President is not a director, such other person as shall be appointed by the Board.  The Board may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of stockholders as it shall deem appropriate.  Except to the extent inconsistent with these Bylaws or such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall have the right and authority to convene and to adjourn the meeting, to prescribe such rules, regulations and 
C-4
procedures and to do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the proper conduct of the meeting.  Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether adopted by the Board or prescribed by the chairman of the meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (a) the establishment of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (b) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present; (c) limitations on attendance at or participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation, their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the chairman of the meeting shall determine; (d) restrictions on entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof; and (e) limitations on the time allotted to questions or comments by participants.  Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or the chairman of the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.  The secretary of each annual and special meeting of stockholders shall be the Secretary or, in the absence (or inability or refusal to act) of the Secretary, an Assistant Secretary so appointed to act by the chairman of the meeting.  In the absence (or inability or refusal to act) of the Secretary and all Assistant Secretaries, the chairman of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Section 2.9. Consents in Lieu of Meeting.  Unless otherwise provided by the Certificate of Incorporation, until the corporation consummates an initial public offering ("Offering"), any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock entitled to vote thereon having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.
Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent, and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner required by this section and the DGCL to the Corporation, written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded.  Delivery made to the Corporation's registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in paragraph (b) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual meeting is greater than the number of directors whose terms expire on the date of the annual meeting and there is no public announcement by the Corporation naming all of the nominees for the additional directors to be elected or specifying the size of the increased Board before the close of business on the 90th day prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 3.3 shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for the additional directorships created by such increase that are to be filled by election at such annual meeting, if it shall be received by the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on the 10th day following the date on which such public announcement was first made by the Corporation.

Such notice must be accompanied by a written consent of each proposed nominee to being named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.
(e) If the Board or the chairman of the meeting of stockholders determines that any nomination was not made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3 or that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the information requirements of this Section 3.3, then such nomination shall not be considered at the meeting in question.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.3, if the stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear at the meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to present the nomination, such nomination shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of such nomination may have been received by the Corporation.
(f) In addition to the provisions of this Section 3.3, a stockholder shall also comply with all of the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the matters set forth herein.  Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall be deemed to affect any rights of the holders of Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 3.4. Compensation.  Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, the Board shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors, including for service on a committee of the Board and may be paid either a fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board or other compensation as director.  The directors may be reimbursed their expenses, if any, of attendance at each meeting of the Board.

(b) A restriction imposed by the Corporation on the transfer or the registration of shares of the Corporation or on the amount of shares of the Corporation that may be owned by any person or group of persons, even if otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without actual knowledge of such restriction unless: (i) the shares are certificated and such restriction is noted conspicuously on the certificate; or (ii) the shares are uncertificated and such restriction was contained in a notice, offering circular or prospectus sent by the Corporation to the registered owner of such shares within a reasonable time prior to or after the issuance or transfer of such shares.

ARTICLE VIII.
INDEMNIFICATION
Section 8.1. Right to Indemnification.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (hereinafter an "Indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such proceeding; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 8.3 with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation shall indemnify an Indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.
Section 8.2. Right to Advancement of Expenses.  In addition to the right to indemnification conferred in Section 8.1, an Indemnitee shall also have the right to be paid by the Corporation to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law the expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred in defending or otherwise participating in any such proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an "advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such Indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon the Corporation's receipt of an undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified under this Article VIII or otherwise.
Section 8.3. Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit.  If a claim under Section 8.1 or Section 8.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within 60 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in the case of a claim for 
C-11
an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall be 20 days, the Indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim.  If successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Indemnitee shall also be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit.  In (a) any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by an Indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense that, and (b) in any suit brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such expenses upon a final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that, the Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL.  Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such suit that indemnification of the Indemnitee is proper in the circumstances because the Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation (including a determination by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit brought by the Indemnitee, shall be a defense to such suit.  In any suit brought by the Indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article VIII or otherwise shall be on the Corporation.
Section 8.4. Non-Exclusivity of Rights.  The rights provided to any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII shall not be exclusive of any other right, which such Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, these Bylaws, an agreement, a vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.
Section 8.5. Insurance.  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect itself and/or any director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.
Section 8.6. Indemnification of Other Persons.  This Article VIII shall not limit the right of the Corporation to the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law to indemnify and to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees.  Without limiting the foregoing, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the Corporation and to any other person who is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article VIII with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of Indemnitees under this Article VIII.
Section 8.7. Amendments.  Any repeal or amendment of this Article VIII by the Board or the stockholders of the Corporation or by changes in applicable law, or the adoption of any other provision of these Bylaws inconsistent with this Article VIII, will, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be prospective only (except to the extent such amendment or change in applicable law permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights to Indemnitees on a retroactive basis than permitted prior thereto), and will not in any way diminish or adversely affect any right or protection existing hereunder in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision; provided, however, that amendments or repeals of this Article VIII shall require the affirmative vote of the stockholders holding at least 65% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation.
Section 8.8. Certain Definitions.  For purposes of this Article VIII, (a) references to "other enterprise" shall include any employee benefit plan; (b) references to "fines" shall include any excise taxes assessed on a person with respect to an employee benefit plan; (c) references to "serving at the request of the Corporation" shall include any service that imposes duties on, or involves services by, a person with respect to any employee benefit plan, its participants, or beneficiaries; and (d) a person who acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of an employee benefit plan shall be deemed to have acted in a manner "not opposed to the best interest of the Corporation" for purposes of Section 145 of the DGCL.
Section 8.9. Contract Rights.  The rights provided to Indemnitees pursuant to this Article VIII shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to be a director, officer, agent or employee and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitee's heirs, executors and administrators.
Section 8.10. Severability.  If any provision or provisions of this Article VIII shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this 
C-12
Article VIII shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of this Article VIII (including, without limitation, each such portion of this Article VIII containing any such provision held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.
ARTICLE IX.
MISCELLANEOUS
Section 9.1. Place of Meetings.  If the place of any meeting of stockholders, the Board or committee of the Board for which notice is required under these Bylaws is not designated in the notice of such meeting, such meeting shall be held at the principal business office of the Corporation; provided, however, if the Board has, in its sole discretion, determined that a meeting shall not be held at any place, but instead shall be held by means of remote communication pursuant to Section 9.5 hereof, then such meeting shall not be held at any place.
Section 9.2. Fixing Record Dates.
(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board may fix a record date, which shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting.  If the Board so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination.  If no record date is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the business day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.2(a) at the adjourned meeting.
(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock, or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be not more than 60 days prior to such action.  If no record date is fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the resolution relating thereto.
Section 9.3. Means of Giving Notice.
(a) Notice to Directors.  Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any director, such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral notice given personally or by telephone.  A notice to a director will be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, orally, or by telephone, when actually received by the director, (ii) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director's address appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission number for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if sent by electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or number (as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation.
(b) Notice to Stockholders.  Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws notice is required to be given to any stockholder, such notice may be given (i) in writing and sent either by hand delivery, through the United States mail, or by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service for next day delivery, or (ii) by means of a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder, to the extent permitted by, and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 232 of the DGCL.  A notice to a stockholder shall be deemed given as follows: (i) if given by hand delivery, when actually received by the stockholder, (ii) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such service, with fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the stockholder at the stockholder's address appearing on the stock ledger of the Corporation, and (iv) if given by a form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is given 
C-13
and otherwise meeting the requirements set forth above, (A) if by facsimile transmission, when directed to a number at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (B) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice, (C) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specified posting, upon the later of (1) such posting and (2) the giving of such separate notice, and (D) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.  A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent to receiving notice by means of electronic communication by giving written notice of such revocation to the Corporation.  Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission two consecutive notices given by the Corporation in accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or to the Corporation's transfer agent, or other person responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action.
(c) Electronic Transmission.  "Electronic transmission" means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process, including but not limited to transmission by telex, facsimile telecommunication, electronic mail, telegram and cablegram.
(d) Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address.  Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom such notice is given.  A stockholder may revoke such stockholder's consent by delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation.  Any stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to receiving such single written notice.
(e) Exceptions to Notice Requirements.  Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to any person with whom communication is unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a license or permit to give such notice to such person.  Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.  In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom communication is unlawful.
Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, to any stockholder to whom (1) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings, or (2) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder's address as shown on the records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required.  Any action or meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given.  If any such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting forth such stockholder's then current address, the requirement that notice be given to such stockholder shall be reinstated.  In the event that the action taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be given pursuant to Section 230(b) of the DGCL.  The exception in subsection (1) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the notice was given by electronic transmission.
Section 9.4. Waiver of Notice.  Whenever any notice is required to be given under applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a written waiver of such notice, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to such required notice.  All such waivers shall be kept with the books of the Corporation.  Attendance at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a person attends for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.
Section 9.5. Meeting Attendance via Remote Communication Equipment.
(a) Stockholder Meetings.  If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and proxy holders not physically present at a meeting of stockholders may, by means of remote communication:
(i) participate in a meeting of stockholders; and
C-14
(ii) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of remote communication, provided that (A) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a stockholder or proxy holder, (B) the Corporation shall implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders and proxy holders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (C) if any stockholder or proxy holder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means of remote communication, a record of such votes or other action shall be maintained by the Corporation.
(b) Board Meetings.  Unless otherwise restricted by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, members of the Board or any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or any committee thereof by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.  Such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting, except where a person participates in the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.
Section 9.6. Dividends.  The Board may from time to time declare, and the Corporation may pay, dividends (payable in cash, property or shares of the Corporation's capital stock) on the Corporation's outstanding shares of capital stock, subject to applicable law and the Certificate of Incorporation.
Section 9.7. Reserves.  The Board may set apart out of the funds of the Corporation available for dividends a reserve or reserves for any proper purpose and may abolish any such reserve.
Section 9.8. Contracts and Negotiable Instruments.  Except as otherwise provided by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument may be executed and delivered in the name and on behalf of the Corporation by such officer or officers or other employee or employees of the Corporation as the Board may from time to time authorize.  Such authority may be general or confined to specific instances as the Board may determine.  The Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation.  Subject to any restrictions imposed by the Board, the Chairman of the Board Chief Executive Officer, President, the Chief Financial Officer, the Treasurer or any Vice President may delegate powers to execute and deliver any contract, bond, deed, lease, mortgage or other instrument in the name and on behalf of the Corporation to other officers or employees of the Corporation under such person's supervision and authority, it being understood, however, that any such delegation of power shall not relieve such officer of responsibility with respect to the exercise of such delegated power.
Section 9.9. Fiscal Year.  The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by the Board.
Section 9.10. Seal.  The Board may adopt a corporate seal, which shall be in such form as the Board determines.  The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile thereof to be impressed, affixed or otherwise reproduced.
Section 9.11. Books and Records.  The books and records of the Corporation may be kept within or outside the State of Delaware at such place or places as may from time to time be designated by the Board.
Section 9.12. Resignation.  Any director, committee member or officer may resign by giving notice thereof in writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Secretary.  The resignation shall take effect at the time it is delivered unless the resignation specifies a later effective date or an effective date determined upon the happening of an event or events.  Unless otherwise specified therein, the acceptance of such resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.
Section 9.13 Surety Bonds.  Such officers, employees and agents of the Corporation (if any) as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may direct, from time to time, shall be bonded for the faithful performance of their duties and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of their death, resignation, retirement, disqualification or removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in their possession or under their control belonging to the Corporation, in such amounts and by such surety companies as the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President or the Board may determine.  The premiums on such bonds shall be paid by the Corporation and the bonds so furnished shall be in the custody of the Secretary.
Section 9.14. Securities of Other Corporations.  Powers of attorney, proxies, waivers of notice of meeting, consents in writing and other instruments relating to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation by the Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer, President, or any officers authorized by the Board.  Any such officer, may, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, take all such action as any such officer may deem advisable to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of security holders of any corporation in which the Corporation may own securities, or to consent in writing, in the name of the Corporation as such holder, to any action by such corporation, and at 
C-15
any such meeting or with respect to any such consent shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof, the Corporation might have exercised and possessed.  The Board may from time to time confer like powers upon any other person or persons.
Section 9.15. Amendments.  The Board shall have the power to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.  The affirmative vote of a majority of the Board shall be required to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.  The Bylaws also may be adopted, amended, altered or repealed by the stockholders; provided, however, that in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation required by applicable law or the Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting (except as otherwise provided in Section 8.7) power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required for the stockholders to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the Bylaws.
