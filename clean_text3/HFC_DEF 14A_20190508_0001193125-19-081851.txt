Proxy Statement for

General Information 
Purpose, Place, Date and Time 
This proxy statement provides information in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of HollyFrontier Corporation (the "Company," "we," "our" or "us") for use at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders or any postponement or adjournment thereof (the "Annual Meeting"). The Annual Meeting will be held on May 8, 2019, at 8:30 a.m., Central Daylight Time, at 2727 N. Harwood St., 5th Floor, Conference Room A, Dallas, Texas 75201. This proxy statement and the enclosed proxy card are being first made available to stockholders on or about March 21, 2019. All stockholders are invited to attend the Annual Meeting. 
Internet Availability of Proxy Materials 
The Company will continue to take advantage of the "Notice and Access" rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), which allow public companies to deliver a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials ("Notice of Internet Availability") and provide internet access to the proxy materials and annual report to their stockholders. The use of Notice and Access generates significant cost savings for the Company. 
In lieu of paper copies of the proxy statement and other materials, most of our stockholders will receive a Notice of Internet Availability containing instructions on how to access the proxy materials and annual report and vote online. Please follow the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability for requesting paper or e-mail copies of our proxy materials and annual report. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by e-mail, you will receive an e-mail next year with instructions with links to the proxy materials, annual report and to the proxy voting site. Your election to receive proxy materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you instruct us otherwise. Choosing to receive your future proxy materials by e-mail will save the Company the cost of printing and mailing documents to you.

[END TABLE]
If you vote by internet or telephone, do not return your proxy card. Submitting your proxy by internet or telephone will not affect your right to vote in person should you decide to attend the Annual Meeting. The telephone and internet voting procedures are designed to authenticate stockholders' identities, to allow stockholders to give their voting instructions and to confirm that stockholders' instructions have been recorded properly. 
Please do not return the Notice of Internet Availability. 
The Notice of Internet Availability is not a valid proxy. 
How do I vote if I hold my shares in street name? 
If you hold your shares in street name, you will receive instructions from your broker, bank or other nominee describing how to vote your shares. In addition, you may be eligible to vote by internet or telephone if your broker, bank or other nominee participates in the proxy voting program provided by Broadridge. If your bank, brokerage firm or other nominee is participating in Broadridge's program, your voting form will provide instructions. Beneficial owners voting by telephone or internet are subject to the same deadlines as described above for holders of record. 
2019 Proxy Statement    7 
What can I do if I change my mind after I submit my proxy? 
If you are a stockholder of record, you can revoke your proxy prior to the completion of voting at the Annual Meeting by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering an executed, later-dated proxy that is received by the Secretary of the Company before the voting polls close at  the Annual Meeting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• resubmitting your proxy by internet or telephone at any time prior to 11:59 p.m., Eastern Daylight Time, on May 7,  2019;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• delivering a written notice of revocation of the proxy that is received by the Secretary of the Company before the voting  polls close at the Annual Meeting; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the Annual Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
If you are a beneficial owner of shares, you may submit new voting instructions by contacting your broker, bank or other nominee. You may also vote in person at the Annual Meeting if you obtain a legal proxy from your broker, bank or other nominee. 
What happens if I do not give specific voting instructions? 
All properly executed proxies, unless revoked as described above, will be voted at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions on your proxy. If a properly executed proxy gives no specific instructions, your shares will be voted in the manner recommended by the Board on all matters presented in this proxy statement and as the proxy holders may determine in their discretion with respect to any other matters properly presented for a vote at the Annual Meeting. 
If you are a beneficial owner of shares and do not provide your broker, bank or other nominee with specific voting instructions, the rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") require that these institutions only vote on matters for which they have discretionary power to vote. If your broker, bank or other nominee does not receive instructions from you on how to vote your shares and they do not have discretion to vote on the matter, then the broker, bank or other nominee will inform the inspector of election that it does not have the authority to vote on the matter with respect to your shares, resulting in a "broker non-vote." 
Your broker, bank or other nominee is not permitted to vote on your behalf in the election of directors (Proposal 1) or the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers (Proposal 2) unless you provide specific instructions to them. Accordingly, if you do not provide timely voting instructions to your broker, bank or other nominee that holds your shares, that institution will be prohibited from voting on all of the proposals in its discretion, except the ratification of the appointment of the independent public accounting firm (Proposal 3). 
How many votes must be present to hold the meeting? 
A quorum is necessary for conducting a valid meeting. Holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock entitled to vote must be present, in person or by proxy, to constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting. Abstentions (shares of the Company's common stock for which proxies have been received but for which the holders have abstained from voting) will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining a quorum.

2019 Proxy Statement    15 
Corporate Governance 
The Board and senior management believe that one of their primary responsibilities is to promote a corporate culture of accountability, responsibility and ethical conduct throughout the Company. The Company is committed to maintaining the highest standard of business conduct and corporate governance, which we believe is essential to operating our business efficiently, maintaining our integrity in the marketplace and serving our stockholders. 
Consistent with these principles, the Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and Corporate Governance Guidelines. These documents, together with our certificate of incorporation, by-laws and the Board committee charters, form the framework for our governance. Copies of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Corporate Governance Guidelines, certificate of incorporation, by-laws, Audit Committee Charter, Compensation Committee Charter, Environmental, Health, Safety, and Public Policy Committee Charter and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee Charter are publicly available on our website at www.hollyfrontier.com and may also be obtained free of charge upon written request to HollyFrontier Corporation, 2828 North Harwood, Suite 1300, Dallas, Texas 75201, Attention: Director, Investor Relations. 
Board Leadership Structure 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board is responsible for selecting the Board leadership structure that is in the best interests of the Company. Our Board, at this time, has determined that a leadership structure consisting of separate Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board roles, together with a strong lead independent director, is appropriate for the Company. Currently, Mr. Myers serves as our independent Chairman of the Board, and Mr. Damiris serves as our Chief Executive Officer and President. 
The Board believes that at this time the separation of these positions and the establishment of both an independent Chairman of the Board and an independent lead director, enhances both the oversight of management by the Board and the Company's overall leadership structure. As a result of his experience at publicly traded energy companies, Mr. Myers has industry-specific experience and expertise and as Chairman of the Board can identify strategic priorities, lead the discussion and execution of strategy and facilitate the flow of information between management and the Board. 
In addition, in order to reinforce effective, independent leadership on the Board, and in recognition of his demonstrated leadership skills, the Board has appointed Mr. Bech as lead director. The lead director's responsibilities are set forth in the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• presiding over executive sessions of the Board's independent directors and at all meetings of the Board at which the  Chairman of the Board is not present;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• communicating matters discussed at the executive session to the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, as  appropriate;

[END TABLE]

• maintaining regular contact with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer to provide access for any issue that  may arise and assist in communication, if appropriate, and to ensure that there is a steady, relevant, meaningful and effective information flow from management to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• approving in advance, in consultation with the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, agendas, schedules and  related information for all meetings of the Board; and  
[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
16    HollyFrontier Corporation 
The Board has established a policy that its non-management directors periodically meet in executive session, without members of management present. If the lead director is unable to attend a meeting of the non-management directors, then the non-management directors will designate an independent director to preside at the meeting. 
We believe that the foregoing structure, policies and practices, when combined with the Company's other governance policies and procedures, provide appropriate opportunities for oversight, discussion and evaluation of decisions and direction from the Board, and are in the best interest of our stockholders. 
Board Oversight of Risk Management 
The Board oversees management of risk, including cyber security. The Board regularly reviews information regarding the Company's business and operations, including the key operational and/or financial risks. As described below, consistent with SEC regulations and NYSE requirements, the Board committees are also engaged in overseeing risk associated with the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Audit Committee oversees management of exposure to financial risks and data system risks.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Compensation Committee oversees the management of risks relating to the Company's executive compensation plans and  incentive structure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee oversees the Company's ethics and compliance programs.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Environmental, Health, Safety, and Public Policy Committee oversees the management of risks associated with the  environment, health, safety and public policy.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Finance Committee oversees the management of risks relating to the Company's capital allocation and capital  investment strategies.  
[END TABLE]
While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of those risks, the full Board is ultimately responsible for overseeing the Company's risk exposures and management thereof, and the Board is regularly informed on these matters through committee and senior management presentations. 
The Board also receives input from the Company's Risk Management Oversight Committee on management's views of the risks facing the Company. This committee is made up of management personnel and monitors the risk environment for the Company as a whole. This committee also supports the efforts of the Board and the Board committees to monitor and evaluate guidelines and policies governing the Company's risk assessment and management. 
Director Independence 
Board of Directors. NYSE listing requirements and our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that at least a majority of the Board meet the NYSE criteria for independence. The Board has determined that each of Mses. Ainsworth and Catalano and Messrs. Bech, Echols, Knocke, Kostelnik, Lee, Myers and Rose is "independent" under the NYSE independence standards. The Board previously determined that Mr. Hardage was "independent" under the NYSE independence standards during his service on the Board. Mr. Damiris is deemed not to be independent because he is an employee of the Company, and Mr. Jennings is not independent because he does not meet the independence requirements under the NYSE listing standards. 
Audit Committee. The Board has determined each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"). 
Compensation Committee. The Board has determined each member of the Compensation Committee is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards. For each member of the Compensation Committee, the Board considered all factors specifically relevant to determining whether a director has a relationship to the Company that is material to that director's ability to be independent from management in connection with the duties of a Compensation Committee member, including the sources of such director's compensation, such as any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees paid by the Company, and whether the director has an affiliate relationship with the Company, a subsidiary of the Company or an affiliate of a subsidiary of the Company. The Board previously determined that Mr. Hardage was "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards during his service on the Compensation Committee. 
2019 Proxy Statement    17 
Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. The Board has determined each member of the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards. 
Environmental, Health, Safety, and Public Policy Committee. The Board has determined each member of the Environmental, Health, Safety, and Public Policy Committee, other than Mr. Jennings, is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards. The Board previously determined that Mr. Hardage was "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards during his service on the Environmental, Health, Safety, and Public Policy Committee. 
Finance Committee. The Board has determined each member of the Finance Committee is "independent" as defined by the NYSE listing standards. 
Independence Determination. In making its independence determinations, the Board considered certain transactions, relationships and arrangements. In determining Mr. Hardage's independence during his service on the Board, and in determining Mr. Knocke's independence in connection with his nomination to the Board, the Board considered that each of Mr. Hardage and Mr. Knocke is a non-controlling manager and member of TCTC and Mr. Knocke is also a Principal of TCTC (which may be deemed to beneficially own 7.36% of the Company's common stock) and holds various other positions with TCTC's subsidiaries. The Board previously determined that this relationship did not impair the independence of Mr. Hardage during his service on the Board and does not impair the independence of Mr. Knocke. 
Director Nominations 
Qualifications 
In considering nominees for election as director, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee considers a number of factors, with an objective of having a board with diverse backgrounds and experiences. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee is also responsible for recommending the nomination of incumbent directors it deems appropriate for re-election to the Board and, if applicable, reappointment to any committees of the Board on which such director serves. 
The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee nominated Mr. Knocke to the Board in January 2019, and the Board appointed Mr. Knocke to the Board in February 2019. Mr. Knocke was recommended to our former Chairman of the Board, Mr. Jennings, by one of our security holders. The Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee reviewed his qualifications in the same manner as it reviews other potential candidates, as described below. 
Characteristics expected of all directors include integrity, exceptional talent and judgment, and the ability and willingness to commit adequate time to the Board. In evaluating the suitability of individual board members, the committee takes into account many factors, including the candidate's knowledge of the communities in which the Company does business, the Company's industry, or other industries relevant to the Company's business or other organizations of comparable size, as well as personal qualities, background and reputation. The Board also considers the diversity of race, gender, culture, age, knowledge, viewpoints, background, experience and skill when evaluating candidates. Subject to its fiduciary duties, applicable law and regulations and membership of the Board at the applicable time, when searching for new Board members, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee shall endeavor to identify highly qualified diverse candidates, including women and individuals from minority groups, to include in the pool of candidates as provided in the immediately preceding sentence from which Board nominees may be chosen. 
Pursuant to our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee will not recommend to the Board the nomination of any director or nominee who has attained or will attain the age of 75 prior to the annual meeting at which he or she would be elected or re-elected. The Board may approve an exception to this policy on a case by case basis. 
Stockholder Recommendations

18    HollyFrontier Corporation 
 Committee. Stockholders may submit such a recommendation by sending a letter to the Secretary of the Company at the Company's principal executive offices. The mailing envelope must contain a clear notation indicating that the enclosed letter is a "Director Nominee Recommendation."

The Board 
Under the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, Board members are expected to devote the time reasonably necessary to discharge their responsibilities and to prepare for and, to the extent reasonably practicable, attend and participate in all meetings of the Board and Board committees on which they serve.

Each then-current director attended at least 75% of the total number of meetings of the Board and committees on which he or she served during the period he or she was a director. 
The Company does not have a policy regarding director attendance at the annual stockholder meeting. All of our then-current directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders.

2019 Proxy Statement    21 
 2011, the Compensation Committee had retained Pearl Meyer & Partners ("Pearl Meyer") as its independent compensation consultant for matters related to executive and non-management director compensation. In selecting Pearl Meyer as its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee had assessed the independence of Pearl Meyer pursuant to SEC rules and considered, among other things, whether Pearl Meyer provides any other services to us, the fees paid by us to Pearl Meyer as a percentage of Pearl Meyer's total revenues, the policies of Pearl Meyer that are designed to prevent any conflict of interest between Pearl Meyer, the Compensation Committee and us, any personal or business relationship between Pearl Meyer and a member of the Compensation Committee or one of our executive officers and whether Pearl Meyer owned any shares of our common stock. In addition to the foregoing, the Compensation Committee had received an independence letter from Pearl Meyer, as well as other documentation addressing the firm's independence. Pearl Meyer reported exclusively to the Compensation Committee and did not provide any additional services to us. The Compensation Committee discussed these considerations and concluded that Pearl Meyer was independent and that we did not have any conflicts of interest with Pearl Meyer. Pearl Meyer provided information and advice to the Compensation Committee during 2017 relating to non-employee director and executive compensation matters for 2018. 
In December 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian Compensation Partners, LLC ("Meridian"), who replaced Pearl Meyer as the independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee, to provide advice relating to executive compensation matters. Meridian did not provide any information or advice to the Compensation Committee with respect to establishing the compensatory arrangements for our NEOs in 2018; however, they did advise the Compensation Committee during 2018 with respect to those pre-established arrangements. In selecting Meridian as its independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee assessed the independence of Meridian pursuant to SEC rules and considered, among other things, whether Meridian provides any other services to us, the fees paid by us to Meridian as a percentage of Meridian's total revenues, the policies of Meridian that are designed to prevent any conflict of interest between Meridian, the Compensation Committee and us, any personal or business relationship between Meridian and a member of the Compensation Committee or one of our executive officers and whether Meridian owned any shares of our common stock. In addition to the foregoing, the Compensation Committee received an independence letter from Meridian, as well as other documentation addressing the firm's independence. Meridian reports exclusively to the Compensation Committee and does not provide any additional services to us. The Compensation Committee discussed these considerations and concluded that Meridian is independent and that we do not have any conflicts of interest with Meridian.

Executive Committee

Director Compensation 
The Compensation Committee annually evaluates the compensation program for members of the Board who are not our officers or employees ("non-management directors"). In making its recommendation to the Board for non-management director compensation, the Compensation Committee reviews the form and amount of compensation paid to directors by the Company's peer group and benchmark market data provided by the compensation consultant. Based on a recommendation from the Compensation Committee, effective January 1, 2018, the Board approved the components of non-management director compensation for 2018 as set forth below. In February 2018, the Board increased the annual cash retainer from $115,000 to $116,000 to compensate non-management directors for incidental travel expenses. Members of the Board who also serve as our officers or employees do not receive additional compensation in their capacity as directors. 
2019 Proxy Statement    23 
For 2018, non-management directors were entitled to receive Board and Board committee retainers and meeting fees payable in cash and the other compensation described in the following table. We also reimburse directors for all reasonable expenses incurred in attending Board and Board committee meetings upon submission of appropriate documentation.

(2)  Meeting fees are not paid for attendance at the first twelve Board meetings or the first twelve meetings of each Board  committee during the year. Beginning with the thirteenth meeting of the Board or a Board Committee in the year, directors receive a fee of $2,000 per meeting. During 2018, no meeting fees were paid since neither the Board, nor any Board committee,  met more than twelve times.  
[END TABLE]
Equity Awards 
Non-management directors receive an annual equity award grant in the form of restricted stock units having a fair market value of approximately $135,000 on the date of grant. These annual grants are made in the fourth quarter of the year preceding the year to which the award relates in order to align the timing of the equity award grants with the timing of the other compensation decisions made for non-management directors and with the timing of long-term equity incentive award grants for our executive officers. 
Continued service on the Board through the stated vesting date for the restricted stock units, which is in most cases approximately one year following the date of grant, is required in order for the restricted stock units to become vested. The restricted stock units granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year vested on December 1, 2018. The 
24    HollyFrontier Corporation restricted stock units granted in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year will vest on December 1, 2019. Accelerated vesting of outstanding restricted stock units will occur upon a change in control (subject to the director serving as a member of the Board immediately prior to the change in control) or the director's death, disability or retirement. Settlement of the restricted stock units in shares of our common stock occurs within 30 days of the event that caused the restricted stock units to vest. Directors do not have the rights of a stockholder with respect to the shares underlying the restricted stock units until the award vests and is settled in shares. However, directors are entitled to the payment of dividend equivalents on outstanding restricted stock units in the form of cash in an amount equal to the dividends that would have been paid with respect to the underlying shares. These dividend equivalents are not subject to forfeiture. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
Our non-management directors are eligible to participate in the HollyFrontier Corporation Executive Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan, which is not tax-qualified under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code and allows participants to defer receipt of certain compensation (the "NQDC Plan"). The NQDC Plan allows non-management directors the ability to defer up to 100% of their cash retainers and meeting fees for a calendar year. Participating directors have full discretion over how their contributions to the NQDC Plan are invested among the offered investment options, and earnings on amounts contributed to the NQDC Plan are calculated in the same manner and at the same rate as earnings on actual investments. We do not subsidize a participant's earnings under the NQDC Plan. 
Mr. Myers was the only non-management director that participated in the NQDC Plan in 2018. During 2018, no above market or preferential earnings were paid to Mr. Myers under the NQDC Plan and, therefore, none of the earnings received by Mr. Myers during 2018 are included in the Director Compensation Table below. For additional information on the NQDC Plan, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Components of our Executive Compensation Program—Retirement Benefits and Perquisites—Retirement Plans—Deferred Compensation Plan" and "Executive Compensation—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
Stock Ownership and Retention Policy for Non-Management Directors 
Non-management directors are expected to acquire and hold during their service on the Board shares of our common stock equal in value to at least five times the annual Board cash retainer paid to our non-management directors (excluding any retainer paid for service on a Board committee). Directors have five years from their initial election to the Board to meet the target stock ownership requirements. 
Directors are required to continuously own sufficient shares to meet the stock ownership requirements once attained. Until the directors attain compliance with the stock ownership policy, the directors will be required to hold 50% of the shares of common stock received from any equity award. If a director attains compliance with the stock ownership policy and subsequently falls below the requirement because of a decrease in the price of our common stock, the director will be deemed in compliance provided that the director retains the shares then held. 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our then-current non-management directors were in compliance with the stock ownership policy or were within the five year grace period provided under the stock ownership policy. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
All of our directors are subject to our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, prohibits such directors from entering into short sales or hedging or pledging shares of our common stock.

Advisory Vote on the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers 
(Proposal 2) 
Section 14A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC, including the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables and any related material contained in this proxy statement. 
In accordance with the preference expressed by our stockholders at our annual meeting in 2017, the Board determined that we would provide this opportunity annually until the next non-binding stockholder advisory vote on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. As described in detail under the heading "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," our executive compensation programs are primarily designed to (i) attract, motivate and retain our named executive officers, who are critical to our success, (ii) provide incentives for our named executive officers to achieve and exceed our operational, financial and strategic goals and (iii) align the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders. Under these programs, compensation for our named executive officers is tied to performance, including our financial results and stockholder returns. Please read the information under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis," and review the compensation tables and narratives that follow, for additional details about our executive compensation programs, including information about the compensation of our named executive officers in 2018. 
This vote is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the compensatory philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Compensation Committee, the Board or the Company. However, the Board and the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take those results into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
Required Vote and Recommendation 
The advisory vote on the compensation of named executive officers requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.

The compensation of our named executive officers is also presented in the tables and related information provided under "Executive Compensation" below. 
Certain of our named executive officers also provide services to our wholly-owned subsidiary, HLS, and HEP. HLS is the general partner of HEP Logistics Holdings, L.P., which is the general partner of HEP. We own a 57% limited partner interest and a non-economic general partner interest in HEP. During 2018, Mr. Damiris, Mr. Voliva and Ms. McWatters also served as executive officers of HLS and split their professional time between HEP and us. Mr. Damiris, Mr. Voliva and Ms. McWatters did not receive any compensation from HLS or HEP during 2018. 
For 2018, Mr. Damiris, Mr. Voliva and Ms. McWatters were also named executive officers of HLS. In accordance with SEC rules, a portion of the compensation paid by us to them for 2018 was allocated to the services they each performed for HLS and HEP during 2018 and was included in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying narratives and tables contained in HEP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The total compensation paid and other benefits made available to Mr. Damiris, Mr. Voliva and Ms. McWatters by us, including amounts disclosed in HEP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, are disclosed below.

2019 Proxy Statement    29 
These achievements were taken into account in awarding 2018 annual incentive bonuses to our named executive officers. We believe the total compensation received by our named executive officers for 2018 was reflective of the Company and individual performance for the year. 
Say-on-Pay Vote 
At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders had an opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation. At that meeting, over 93% of the votes cast by our stockholders were voted in support our executive pay program. The Compensation Committee believes this affirms our stockholders' support of our approach to executive compensation, and the Compensation Committee did not make any material changes to its executive compensation program in 2018 based on the results of the advisory vote. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the Company's say-on-pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the named executive officers.

Philosophy and Objectives of Executive Compensation Program 
Pay-for-Performance Philosophy 
Our compensation programs are designed to remunerate named executive officers in accordance with a pay-for-performance philosophy. As such, the compensation programs are intended to provide incentives to our named executive officers, as well as other employees, to maximize operational performance and stockholder value, which in turn affects the overall compensation earned by our management. 
Each named executive officer's total direct compensation is heavily influenced by company and individual performance measures. The majority of our named executive officers' compensation is performance-based, at-risk pay in the form of both short-term and long-term incentives. 
2018 CEO Pay Mix

Objectives 
In designing the compensation program for named executive officers, the Compensation Committee sought to achieve the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and Retain Talented and Productive Executives. The compensation program should  provide each named executive officer with a total compensation opportunity that is competitive within the market. This objective is intended to ensure that we are able to attract and retain executive officers while maintaining an appropriate cost  structure.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Motivate Executives. The compensation program should provide incentives for our named  executive officers to achieve and exceed our operational, financial and strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align with Stockholders. The compensation program should align named executive  officers' interests with those of our stockholders, promoting actions that will have a positive long-term impact on total stockholder return.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Transparent Compensation. The elements of the compensation program should be easily  understood by both our executive officers and our stockholders.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Each of these components is described in further detail in the narrative that follows. Specific information regarding 2018 compensation is included below in the section titled "2018 Executive Compensation Decisions." 
Base Salary 
Base salaries provide named executive officers with a predictable level of income. The Compensation Committee reviews base salaries annually and determines base salaries on the basis of market practices and each executive's position, level of responsibility, individual performance and position relative to other executives and other compensation elements. The Compensation Committee also reviews competitive market data relevant to each position provided by the compensation consultant. 
Annual Incentive Cash Compensation 
Under our annual incentive cash compensation program, named executive officers are eligible for cash bonuses that are designed to attract and retain senior leadership, reward achievement of financial and business goals and align executives' interests with stockholders. Annual incentive cash opportunities for our named executive officers are reviewed annually and differ with the level of responsibility of each executive. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee oversees the administration of the equity plan and grants equity incentive awards to qualifying employees at its discretion. Annual awards are typically made during the fourth quarter of the year preceding the year to which the awards relate. 
We view long-term equity incentive compensation as the cornerstone of the executive compensation program because we believe: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• equity incentives and the related vesting periods help attract and retain executives capable of executing our business  strategies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the value received by the recipient of equity incentives is aligned with long-term value creation for our stockholders; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• equity incentives provide the closest link between our performance and the executives' compensation.   
[END TABLE]
In determining the appropriate amount and type of long-term equity incentive awards to be made, the Compensation Committee considers a named executive officer's position, scope of responsibility, base salary, performance and market compensation information for executives in similar positions in similar companies and prior awards. In addition, the Compensation Committee has historically considered the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer, except in regard to his own equity awards. 
Change in Control and Severance Benefits 
Severance and change in control protections are provided to our named executive officers pursuant to the terms of outstanding awards granted under the equity plan and pursuant to change in control severance agreements. The award agreements related to outstanding restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance share units granted to our named executive officers include accelerated vesting provisions in the event of certain terminations of 
32    HollyFrontier Corporation employment, including in connection with a change in control. For additional information about these provisions, see "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." In addition, we have entered into change in control severance agreements with each of our named executive officers, as described below. These agreements are designed to provide benefits only in the event of a qualifying termination of employment following a change in control transaction, and do not provide any benefits without a termination of employment. None of the change in control severance agreements we have with our named executive officers contain any tax reimbursement provisions in the event a named executive officer receives potential parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code. For additional information about the severance benefits provided under the change in control agreements, see "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Retirement Benefits and Perquisites 
Retirement Plans 
Defined Contribution Plan. For 2018, our named executive officers were able to participate in the HollyFrontier Corporation 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan, which is a tax-qualified defined contribution plan (the "401(k) Plan"). Employees who are not eligible to participate in the NQDC Plan may contribute amounts between 0% and 75% of their eligible compensation to the 401(k) Plan, while employees who are eligible to participate in the NQDC Plan may contribute amounts between 0% and 50% of their eligible compensation to the 401(k) Plan. Employee contributions that were made on a tax-deferred basis were generally limited to $18,500 for 2018, with employees 50 years of age or over able to make additional tax-deferred contributions of $6,000. 
For 2018, we made a retirement contribution of 3% to 8% of the participating employee's eligible compensation under the 401(k) Plan, subject to applicable limitations under the Code, based on years of service, as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Years of  Service    Retirement Contribution (as percentage of eligible compensation) 
 Less than 5 years    3% 
 5 to 10 years    4% 
 10 to 15 years    5.25% 
 15 to 20 years    6.5% 
 20 years and over    8% 
[END TABLE]
In addition to the retirement contribution, in 2018, we made matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan equal to 100% of the first 6% of each participating employee's eligible compensation up to compensation limits. In 2018, all of our named executive officers participated in the 401(k) Plan and received matching contributions and the retirement contribution. Matching contributions vest immediately and retirement contributions are subject to a three-year cliff-vesting period. 
Deferred Compensation Plan. Certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, were also eligible to participate in the NQDC Plan in 2018. The NQDC Plan provides certain members of management and other highly compensated employees an opportunity to defer compensation in excess of qualified retirement plan limitations on a pre-tax basis and accumulate tax-deferred earnings to achieve their financial goals. 
Participants in the NQDC Plan can contribute between 1% and 50% of their eligible earnings, which includes base salary and bonuses, to the NQDC Plan. Participants in the NQDC Plan are also eligible to receive certain employer-provided contributions, including but not limited to matching contributions, retirement contributions and nonqualified nonelective contributions. Matching contributions and retirement contributions represent contribution amounts that could not be made under the 401(k) Plan due to limitations on tax-qualified plans under the Code. We do not provide any subsidized returns or guarantee of returns on compensation deferred by our named executive officers or other participants in the NQDC Plan. For more information regarding this plan, see "Executive Compensation—Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
2019 Proxy Statement    33 
Other Benefits and Perquisites 
All of our executive officers are eligible to participate in the same benefit plans available generally to our salaried employees, such as medical, dental, vision, long-term and short-term disability and life insurance. We do not maintain separate "executive" plans for any of these benefits. 
During 2018, Mr. Damiris and Mr. Voliva were permitted to use the company aircraft for personal travel, subject to a requirement that they reimburse us for all aggregate incremental costs associated with their personal use, including fuel costs, landing fees, catering charges, pilot overnight expenses and other similar charges incurred by us. In addition, we permit a named executive officer's family member to accompany the executive on a flight when the executive is traveling for business. No additional direct operating cost is incurred by us in such situations, but to the extent that Internal Revenue Service guidelines cause us to impute income to the named executive officer for such family member travel, and that travel is not business-related, the associated tax liability is the responsibility of the executive. 
In addition, for security reasons as a result of our increased size and value, we reimburse our executive officers up to $9,500 per year for any out-of-pocket expenses related to security training, consulting or technology. During 2018, we also reimbursed monthly club dues for Mr. Damiris, Mr. Voliva and Mr. Stump. The Compensation Committee believes that a club membership assists these named executive officers in performing their responsibilities by providing a means for business entertainment and networking. In addition, we may also reimburse our executive officers for limited entertainment expenses that we deem to serve a business purpose and provide personal benefits to our executive officers in limited circumstances associated with executive team-building and strategy planning events. We also provide reserved parking spaces for our executive officers. 
Role of Compensation Committee in Establishing Compensation 
The Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation programs. The role of the Compensation Committee is to review and approve the compensation to be paid to executive officers, including the named executive officers, and to review the compensation policies and practices for all of our employees to verify that they do not create unreasonable risks for us or our stockholders. 
In setting compensation for executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers, among other things, recommendations by its independent compensation consultant and management and the compensation of similarly situated executives in comparable businesses. In addition, the Compensation Committee annually reviews total compensation paid to the named executive officers for the prior year and, with the assistance of management, proposes long-term incentive compensation awards. 
Role of Executive Officers in Establishing Compensation 
Our Chief Executive Officer makes compensation recommendations to the Compensation Committee for the executive officers, including the named executive officers (except with respect to his own compensation). Management provides financial and compensation data to the Compensation Committee for its review in setting compensation and gives guidance as to how the data impacts performance goals set by the Compensation Committee. This data includes: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our financial performance for the current year compared to the preceding year;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• performance evaluations of the named executive officers (other than for the Chief Executive Officer, who is evaluated by  the Compensation Committee); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• compensation provided to the named executive officers in previous years.  
[END TABLE]
In addition, the Chief Executive Officer may recommend and provide rationale for discretionary bonuses for other named executive officers to the Compensation Committee. Given the day-to-day familiarity that the Chief Executive Officer has with the work performed by the other named executive officers, the Compensation Committee values his recommendations. However, the Compensation Committee makes all final decisions as to the compensation of the named executive officers.

Role of Compensation Committee Consultant in Establishing Compensation 
Since September 2011, the Compensation Committee had retained Pearl Meyer as its independent compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee on matters related to executive and non-management director compensation. The Compensation Committee periodically met independently with Pearl Meyer. In 2017, the Compensation Committee received competitive market data and related observations and advice from Pearl Meyer with respect to the development and structure of our executive compensation program for 2018. As discussed above under "The Board, its Committees and its Compensation—Board Committees—Compensation Committee," the Compensation Committee has concluded that we do not have any conflicts of interest with Pearl Meyer. 
In December 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Meridian, who replaced Pearl Meyer as the independent compensation consultant to the Compensation Committee, to provide advice relating to executive compensation matters. In 2018, the Compensation Committee received competitive market data and related observations and advice from Meridian with respect to the development and structure of our executive compensation program for 2019, but Meridian did not provide any information or advice to the Compensation Committee with respect to 2018 compensation for the NEOs. As discussed above under "The Board, its Committees and its Compensation—Board Committees—Compensation Committee," the Compensation Committee has concluded that we do not have any conflicts of interest with Meridian. 
Market Review 
We regularly compare our executive compensation program with market information regarding salary levels and incentive awards and programs. The purpose of this analysis is to provide a frame of reference in evaluating the reasonableness and competitiveness of our executive compensation as compared to that of companies within the energy industry that are generally comparable in size and scope of operations to us. 
Market pay levels for named executive officers are obtained from the SEC filings of the companies in our comparator group. We supplement this data with, and obtain data for our named executive officers from, various sources, including published compensation surveys, which cover our industry sector and labor market. As a component of setting 2018 compensation, in September 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed a study of compensation paid to our named executive officers prepared by Pearl Meyer. The following companies comprised the 2018 comparator group reviewed by the Compensation Committee: 
The 2018 comparator group differs from the 2017 comparator group due to merger activity and change in company size (the 2018 comparator group added Eastman Chemical Company and Valero Energy Corporation, while deleting LyondellBasell Industries N.Y., Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Western Refining Inc.). The 2018 comparator group is different than the 2018 incentive peer group, which is used as a market comparison when determining payouts of certain performance-based incentive awards granted to named executive officers. See "—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—Annual Incentive Cash Compensation" for a further discussion of the 2018 incentive peer group and the reasons for the differences from the 2018 comparator group. 
2019 Proxy Statement    35 
2018 Executive Compensation Decisions 
The Compensation Committee established 2018 total direct compensation, including base salary, annual incentive cash compensation and long-term equity incentive compensation awards, for our named executive officers at pay levels approximating the middle range of market compensation. The Compensation Committee utilized the market data provided by Pearl Meyer and internal evaluations of the named executive officers to establish total compensation opportunities for the named executive officers that are consistent with this objective. 
Based on the 2018 annual review of compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that 2018 compensation for the named executive officers reflects appropriate allocation of compensation between salary, bonuses and equity compensation, with a majority of the compensation being performance-based, at-risk pay in the form of both short-term and long-term incentives. 
Base Salary 
The Compensation Committee establishes base salaries within a competitive range to provide our named executive officers with compensation consistent with their responsibilities, their experience, their individual performance and our peers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee conducted its annual review of base salaries and market survey data for our named executive officers and determined that increases in the base salaries of the named executive officers were warranted based on factors such as our financial performance, market levels of compensation for comparable positions and internal pay equity. The following table sets forth the base salaries for 2017 and 2018 of our named executive officers:

Annual Incentive Cash Compensation 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Compensation Committee approved target award levels as well as all other terms of the annual incentive cash compensation awards granted to our named executive officers for 2018. These awards were subject to our achievement of specified levels of performance with respect to certain financial and environmental, health and safety measures, as well as individual performance measures for certain named executive officers. 
36    HollyFrontier Corporation 
No changes were made to the annual incentive cash compensation for 2018 as compared to 2017. The following table sets forth the minimum, target and maximum award opportunities (as a percentage of annual base salary) for our named executive officers for 2018, and the portion of each named executive officer's target award opportunity that is allocated to each performance measure (as percentage of the annual bonus awards and as a percentage of annual base salary).

The financial measures are weighted more heavily than the environmental, health and safety measures in order to incentivize and reward the named executive officers for overall company performance and to promote stockholder value creation. Awards are capped to avoid encouraging an excessive short-term focus, potentially at the expense of long-term performance. 
To facilitate timely determination of award payouts, the measurement period for each of the above metrics covers four consecutive quarters starting with the fourth quarter of the preceding year (2017) and ending with the third quarter of the following year (2018). 
2019 Proxy Statement    37 
Financial Measures. The Compensation Committee allocates the majority of each named executive officer's bonus opportunity to financial performance in order to align the financial interests of our executive officers with the interests of our stockholders and our Business Improvement Plan. The following equally-weighted criteria are used to determine overall performance under the financial measures metric: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Criteria    What It Means    Why It's Used 
 Refinery Reliability    Percentage Lost Profit Opportunity ("LPO"), defined as foregone gross margin that results from operational variance due to factors within the Company's control, specifically including human and equipment performance,  divided by the sum of actual gross margin plus LPO.    Measures the percentage of earnings or margin forgone due to unplanned operational issues. 
 Equipment Utilization    Actual crude throughput for the performance period divided by the planned crude throughput for the performance period. Planned crude throughput is reflected in the Company's annual volumetric plan, as updated with  monthly optimized plans, which reflect 100% of the actual crude processing for which there is an economic incentive during the given period.    Principal driver of overall profitability. 
 Operating Expense    Measurement of actual controllable and fixed operating costs versus budgeted amounts; budgeted amounts are subject to revision by the Compensation Committee in its discretion based on changes in the business conditions or  configuration of the business (e.g., items such as acquisitions or divestitures, unusual or non-recurring charges and changes in staffing relating to changed strategy approved by the Board will be considered  as items for potential adjustment).    Directly aligns with the Company's cost management strategy. 
 Return on Capital Employed     Operating income before depreciation and amortization (excluding asset impairments, non-cash asset writedowns and inventory valuation gains or losses) divided by average capital employed during the period, where capital employed means the sum of debt plus shareholders' equity plus  minority interests less cash and marketable securities less intangible assets less goodwill.      Measures both the Company's income production and capital effectiveness. 
 Return on Capital Employed     Operating income before depreciation and amortization (excluding asset impairments, non-cash asset writedowns and inventory valuation gains or losses) divided by average capital employed during the period, where capital employed means the sum of debt plus shareholders' equity plus  minority interests less cash and marketable securities less intangible assets less goodwill.      Measures both the Company's income production and capital effectiveness. 
[END TABLE]
38    HollyFrontier Corporation 
The return on capital employed metric is compared to the performance of the 2018 incentive peer group, which includes the following: 
The 2018 incentive peer group differs from the 2017 incentive peer group due to merger activity (the 2018 incentive peer group added CVR Energy Inc. and Phillips 66, while deleting Alon USA Energy, Inc. and Western Refining Company). We compare the return on capital employed metric against that of these companies because their collective performance reflects external economic conditions we are facing as a company and as an industry as a whole, and they are also companies with which both management and investment analysts compare our results. The 2018 incentive peer group differs from the 2018 comparator group because the 2018 incentive peer group includes companies that are too large in size or that significantly differ in ownership and management composition from us to be suitable comparisons for determining and establishing competitive pay data for our executives. 
The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum performance levels for each financial metric and the actual results for the financial metrics in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Metric    Threshold    Target    Maximum    Actual for 2018    Percent of Target Bonus Achievement

 Equipment Utilization    95%    97%    greater than 99%    96.8%     
 Operating Expense    103%    101%    less than 99.5%    104.9%

2019 Proxy Statement    39 
Environmental, Health and Safety Measures. The Compensation Committee selected this metric because it reflects one of our key business objectives, drives our overall performance and promotes accountability. Our performance with respect to the following equally-weighted criteria, as compared to our performance for the prior year, is used to determine performance under the environmental, health and safety metric: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Criteria    What It Means    Why It's Used 
 Personal Safety    Measured by the OSHA 300 recordable incident rate (for our employees).    Measures our ability to provide safe working conditions for our employees and directly aligns with our Company's values of health and safety. 
 Process Safety    Measured by the annual process safety incident rate (using API 754 Tier 1 and Tier 2 incident reporting).    Measures our ability to manage the integrity of our processes and equipment that handle hazardous substances by designing appropriate safety systems into our processes and equipment. 
 Environmental Events    Measured by the number of "numerical" releases, spills, permit exceedances and violations (normalized for effects of startup of new continuous emission monitors brought online  during the performance period).    Measures our ability to minimize environmental impact. 
[END TABLE]
For environmental, health and safety measures, the incident rate or the number of incidents for each component, as applicable, will be compared to the incident rate or the number of incidents, as applicable, in the prior 3-year period and the total percentage change will determine the environmental, health and safety performance. The payout is based 80% on the performance of our US refineries and 20% on the performance of our non-US refineries. The table below sets forth the threshold, target and maximum payout levels for environmental, health and safety measures based on the percentage change in the incident rate or the number of incidents, as applicable, as compared to the prior 3-year period and the actual results for the environmental, health and safety metrics in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Metric   Threshold   Target   Maximum   Actual for 2018   Bonus Achievement 
 Environmental, Health and Safety               186.7% 
 Personal Safety   no change   decrease by 3%   decrease by 10%   US refineries –   decrease by 14%Non-US refinery – increase in incidents by 157%

Individual Performance Measures. In addition to the metrics mentioned above, a portion of the award for each of the named executive officers (other than Mr. Damiris) was based on the Compensation Committee's evaluation of the executive officer's individual performance during the year. The Compensation Committee considers various criteria such as interpersonal effectiveness, business conduct, professional and technical development, leadership and results orientation. The evaluation is discretionary and based on a wide range of considerations which often change over the course of the year. Further, the Compensation Committee may exercise its discretion and increase, decrease or eliminate awards based on individual performance for any named executive officer. 
2018 Performance. The following table sets forth the named executive officers' target bonus as a percentage of base salary and the actual payouts to the named executive officers for 2018 as a percentage of base salary, including payments made based on our achieving 87.5% of the target financial measures and 186.7% of the target environmental, health and safety measures and the bonuses awarded for individual performance.

[END TABLE]
In addition, for 2018, we awarded special cash performance bonuses to each of the following named executive officers in recognition of their extraordinary efforts and contributions to us in 2018, including with respect to closing the acquisition of, and integrating, Red Giant Oil Company LLC and entering into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of Sonneborn, in the following amounts: Mr. Damiris ($122,375), Mr. Voliva ($22,415), Mr. Stump ($2,066), Ms. McWatters ($6,441) and Mr. Creery ($9,038). 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation. Prior to November 2017, including for equity awards intended to cover the 2017 calendar year, our long-term equity incentive program consisted of annual grants of restricted stock and performance share unit awards for our named executive officers. Beginning in November 2017 with our equity grants that are intended to cover the 2018 calendar year, our annual grants for our named executive officers consist of restricted stock units and performance share unit awards. The long-term incentive awards were allocated between award types as reflected below: 
Long-Term Incentive 50% 50% Restricted Stock/ Restricted Stock Units Performance Share Units 50% 50% Return on Capital Employed Total Shareholder Return 
Annual grants of long-term equity incentive awards are generally made in the fourth quarter of the preceding year, rather than in the first quarter of the year to which the award relates, in order to align the timing of the long-term equity incentive award grants with the timing of the other compensation decisions made for our named executive officers and, with respect to performance share unit awards, to align the timing of the grant with the quarter in which the performance period commences. Pursuant to SEC rules, the long-term equity incentive awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year are disclosed as 2017 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table and are not included in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table included in this proxy statement; however, because these awards relate to the 2018 fiscal year, they are described in greater detail below. The long-term equity incentive awards granted in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year are discussed below under "—2019 Executive Compensation Decisions." 
2019 Proxy Statement    41 
Annual grants of long-term equity incentive awards are initially approved by the Compensation Committee as a dollar amount established according to the pay grade of the named executive officer. The award is then converted into a number of shares by dividing the dollar amount by the closing price of our common stock on the grant date of the award, with half of the shares being granted as restricted stock units (or restricted stock prior to November 2017)    and half of the shares being granted as performance share units. The following table sets forth:

The restricted stock unit awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year originally were scheduled to vest in three equal annual installments on December 15, 2018, 2019 and 2020 (or the first business day thereafter if the vesting date falls on a Saturday or Sunday), subject to continued employment. In February 2019, the Compensation Committee determined that all equity awards with a vesting date of December 15 would be changed to December 1 of the applicable year. This vesting date change was deemed to be a minor administrative modification necessitated by our growth, the size of our employee population and the number of existing award holders. Therefore, the remaining two tranches of the November 2017 restricted stock units are now scheduled to vest on December 1, 2019 and 2020 (or the first business day thereafter if the vesting date falls on a Saturday or Sunday), subject to continued employment. Each named executive officer has the right to receive dividends and other distributions paid with respect to such restricted stock units, and these dividend and other distributions are paid at approximately the same time as dividends are received by our common stockholders. 
Performance Share Unit Awards 
The Compensation Committee determined that performance metrics for the November 2017 grants would consist of return on capital employed and total shareholder return during the performance period as measured against that of the 2018 incentive peer group. See "—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—Annual Incentive Cash Compensation" for a discussion of the 2018 incentive peer group. 
The performance period for these performance share unit awards runs from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2020. Each named executive officer has the right to receive dividend equivalents and other distributions with respect to such performance share units based on the target level of payout, and these dividend equivalents are paid at approximately the same time as dividends are received by our common stockholders. 
For the performance share unit awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "return on capital employed," which determines 50% of the shares earned at  the end of the performance period, is defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization, divided by the sum of shareholders' equity, plus minority interest, plus debt, less goodwill and intangible assets, less cash and marketable  securities (excludes gains or losses attributable to first-in, first-out inventory valuation (including lower of cost or market adjustments), asset impairment expenses  (tangible or intangible)) and non-cash asset writedowns. The Compensation Committee believes return on capital employed is an appropriate metric because it (i) holds management accountable for the   
[END TABLE]
42    HollyFrontier Corporation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     efficient use of the Company's capital and (ii) provides a useful means of comparing the Company's operating performance relative to the operating performance of our incentive peer  group. This metric differs from the return on capital employed metric used for our annual incentive cash compensation since this metric looks at return on capital employed over a three-year period whereas the return on capital employed metric used  for our annual incentive cash compensation looks at a one-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• "total shareholder return," which determines 50% of the shares earned at the  end of the performance period, is defined as (i) the appreciation in our stock price during the performance period (in dollars) plus cumulative dividends paid during the performance period plus any additional value or compensation received by  shareholders such as stock received from spinoffs, divided by (ii) the closing price of our stock on the first business day of the performance period. The Compensation Committee believes total shareholder return is an appropriate metric because  it (i) aligns the interests of management with the interests of shareholders, and (ii) provides a useful means of comparing Company overall performance relative to the overall performance of our incentive peer group.  
[END TABLE]
The actual number of performance share units earned at the end of the performance period will be equal to (a) the target number of performance share units granted multiplied by (b) our average performance unit payout with respect to the performance metrics. The average performance unit payout is determined by adding our performance unit payout percentage with respect to each performance metric and dividing the sum by two. 
For the return on capital employed metric and the total shareholder return metric, an ordinal ranking of our return on capital employed versus the return on capital employed of each entity in our incentive peer group and our total shareholder return versus the total shareholder return of each entity in our incentive peer group, respectively, will be calculated at the end of the performance period and payout is determined in accordance with the following table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Second     167% of Target

As a result, the above table was adjusted by the Compensation Committee, as permitted by the award agreements governing the performance share units, to reflect the change in the number of companies in the incentive peer group as follows:

Earned performance share unit awards will be paid in the form of fully vested shares of our common stock. 
2019 Proxy Statement    43 
Stock Ownership Policy 
Our Board, the Compensation Committee and our executive officers recognize that ownership of our common stock is an effective means by which to align the interests of our directors and officers with those of our stockholders. The terms of the stock ownership policy for our executive officers are summarized below. 
Under the stock ownership policy, our executive officers are required to hold shares of our common stock as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       9x base salary The value of shares held by Mr. Damiris as of March 6, 2019. 
       9x base salary The value of shares held by Mr. Damiris as of March 6, 2019. 
[END TABLE]
CEO 6x base salary CFO 3x base salary SVPs 2x base salary 
Our executive officers are required to meet the applicable requirements within five years of employment or promotion. 
Executive officers are required to continuously own sufficient shares to meet the stock ownership requirements once attained. Until the executive officers attain compliance with the stock ownership policy, the executive officers will be required to hold 50% of the shares of common stock received from any equity award, net of any shares used to pay tax withholdings. If an executive officer attains compliance with the stock ownership policy and subsequently falls below the requirement because of a decrease in the price of our common stock, the executive officer will be deemed in compliance provided that the executive officer retains the shares then held. 
As of December 31, 2018, all of our named executive officers were in compliance with the stock ownership policy. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
All of our employees, including our named executive officers, are subject to our Insider Trading Policy, which, among other things, prohibits employees from entering into short sales or hedging or pledging shares of our common stock. 
Recoupment of Compensation 
In September 2018, the Board adopted a formal clawback policy to allow the Board to recover bonus and other incentive and equity based compensation (the "Incentive Compensation") awarded to Board-appointed officers of the Company and our subsidiaries upon the occurrence of a material restatement of our financial results during the prior 24-month period (other than due to a change in accounting policy or applicable law). In the event of such material restatement, if the Incentive Compensation would have been lower had it been calculated based on such restated results, the Compensation Committee may (as determined in its sole discretion and to the extent permitted by governing law and as appropriate under the circumstances) seek to recover for our benefit all or a portion of such Incentive Compensation awarded to any covered employee who is then currently employed by us. In determining whether to seek recovery, the Compensation Committee may take into account any considerations as it deems appropriate, including whether the error was caused by intentional misconduct or fraud. The amount of any recovery and the source of such recovery (whether from unvested equity compensation or future compensation payable to the covered employee) will be determined in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
Further, our change in control severance agreements with our named executive officers include language providing that amounts paid or payable pursuant to such agreements may be forfeited and/or recouped to the extent required by applicable law or any clawback policy that we adopt. 
In addition, the agreements for awards under our long-term equity incentive program provide that the award, including amounts paid or realized with respect to the award, may be subject to reduction, cancelation, forfeiture or recoupment to the extent required by applicable law or any clawback policy that we adopt. 
Impact of Regulatory Compliance 
In designing and implementing programs applicable to executives, the Compensation Committee considers the anticipated tax treatment to us and our executive officers of various payments and benefits, and the effects of applicable provisions of the Code, including Section 280G. 
44    HollyFrontier Corporation 
Section 280G of the Code prohibits the deduction of any "excess parachute payment." Benefits payable under the change in control severance agreements entered into with certain of our executives, including all of our named executive officers, as well as accelerated vesting under restricted stock and performance share unit awards could result in "excess parachute payments" that are not deductible by us. For more information regarding amounts payable and benefits available upon the occurrence of a change in control, see "Executive Compensation—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." None of the change in control severance agreements we have with our named executive officers contain any tax reimbursement provisions in the event a named executive officer receives potential parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code. 
In December 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code was modified by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to delete the exception that limited the deductibility by a company of compensation in excess of $1,000,000 paid to certain executive officers for performance-based compensation. As a result, decisions relating to 2018 compensation and performance awards were not impacted by Section 162(m) considerations, and we did not materially alter our performance based arrangements in response to the modification of Section 162(m). 
2019 Executive Compensation Decisions 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation for Named Executive Officers 
In November 2018, the Compensation Committee approved grants of restricted stock units with time-based vesting conditions and performance share units to our named executive officers for the 2019 fiscal year. 
Pursuant to SEC rules, the long-term equity incentive awards granted in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year are disclosed as 2018 compensation in the Summary Compensation Table and are reported in the 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards table included in this proxy statement. These awards are described in greater detail below.

In November 2018, the Compensation Committee approved grants of restricted stock units with time-based vesting conditions to our named executive officers for the 2019 fiscal year. The number of restricted stock units awarded to our named executive officers who received restricted stock unit awards was determined in the same manner as previously described for the restricted stock awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year. The restricted stock units with time-based vesting awarded in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year to each of the named executive officers were originally scheduled to vest in three equal installments on December 15 of 2019, 2020 and 2021 (or the first business day thereafter if December 15 falls on a Saturday or Sunday), subject to continued employment. As described above, following the grant date, those vesting dates have been changed to December 1 of each applicable year (or the first business day thereafter if the vesting date falls on a Saturday or Sunday). 
2019 Proxy Statement    45 
Each named executive officer has the right to receive dividend equivalents and other distributions paid with respect to such restricted stock units, and these dividend equivalents are paid at approximately the same time as dividends are received by our common stockholders. 
Performance Share Unit Awards 
In November 2018, the Compensation Committee granted performance share unit awards to our named executive officers for the 2019 fiscal year. Each named executive officer who received performance share unit awards was granted a target number of performance share units, which was determined in the same manner as previously described for the performance share unit awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year. 
The Compensation Committee determined that performance metrics for the November 2018 grants would consist of return on capital employed and total shareholder return during the performance period as measured against that of the 2019 incentive peer group. The 2019 incentive peer group consists of: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• CVR Energy Inc.• PBF Energy Corporation 
• Delek US Holdings, Inc.• Phillips 66 
• Marathon Petroleum Corporation• Valero Energy Corporation 
[END TABLE]
The performance period for these performance share unit awards runs from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2021. Each named executive officer has the right to receive dividend equivalents and other distributions with respect to such performance share units based on the target level of payout, and these dividend equivalents are paid at approximately the same time as dividends are received by our common stockholders. 
For the performance share unit awards granted in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year, "return on capital employed" and "total shareholder return" are calculated in the same manner as they are calculated for the performance share units granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year. 
The actual number of performance share units earned at the end of the performance period will be determined in the same manner as the performance share unit awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year. 
For the return on capital employed metric and the total shareholder return metric, a percentile ranking of our return on capital employed versus the return on capital employed of each entity in our incentive peer group and our total shareholder return versus the total shareholder return of each entity in our incentive peer group, respectively, will be calculated at the end of the performance period and payout is determined in accordance with the following table:

2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards 
The following table provides information about plan-based awards granted to our named executive officers under our equity and non-equity incentive plans during 2018. Certain equity awards reported below were granted in November 2018 for the 2019 fiscal year and are reported in this table as 2018 compensation in accordance with SEC rules. These awards are described in greater detail above under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2019 Executive Compensation Decisions." Annual equity awards are generally made once each year in the fourth quarter of the year preceding the year to which the annual awards relate in order to align the timing of the long-term equity incentive award grants with the timing of the other compensation decisions made for our executive officers. In accordance with SEC rules, the equity awards granted in November 2017 for the 2018 fiscal year were previously reported as 2017 compensation in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table contained in our proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 22, 2018. 
In this table, awards are abbreviated as "AICP" for awards under the annual incentive cash compensation program (other than with respect to the discretionary individual performance portion of the awards, which are reported in the "Bonus" column of the Summary Compensation Table above and are not included below), as "RSU" for restricted stock unit awards and "PUA" for performance share unit awards. The restricted stock unit awards and performance

Option Exercises and Stock Vested 
The following table provides information about the vesting in 2018 of restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards held by the named executive officers. The Company does not grant options. 
The value realized from the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units or performance share unit awards is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date (or, if the vesting date is not a trading day, on the trading day immediately following the vesting date), multiplied by the number of shares acquired on vesting. The value is calculated before payment of any applicable withholding or other income taxes.

Pension Benefits 
None of our named executive officers participates in or has ever participated in any plan sponsored or maintained by us that provides for specified retirement payments or benefits, such as a tax-qualified defined benefit plan or a supplemental executive retirement plan. 
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
In 2018, all of the named executive officers participated in the NQDC Plan. The NQDC Plan is a nonqualified plan (i.e., not tax-qualified under Section 401 of the Code) that functions as a pour-over plan, allowing key employees to defer tax on income in excess of limits under the Code that apply under the 401(k) Plan. For 2018, the annual deferral contribution limit under the 401(k) Plan was $18,500, and the annual compensation limit was $275,000. Deferral elections made by eligible employees under the NQDC Plan apply to the total amount of eligible earnings the eligible employees choose to contribute to both the 401(k) Plan and the NQDC Plan. Once eligible employees reach the limits under the Code on contributions under the 401(k) Plan, contributions automatically begin being contributed to the NQDC Plan. Federal and state income taxes are generally not payable on income deferred under the NQDC Plan until funds are withdrawn. 
Eligible executives may make salary deferral contributions between 1% and 50% of their eligible earnings to the NQDC Plan. Eligible earnings include base pay, bonuses and overtime, but exclude extraordinary pay such as severance, accrued vacation, equity compensation, and certain other items. Eligible participants are required to make catch-up contributions to the 401(k) Plan before any contributions are made to the NQDC Plan. For 2018, the catch-up contribution limit was $6,000. Deferral elections are irrevocable for an entire plan year and must be made prior to December 31 immediately preceding the plan year. Elections will carry over to the next plan year unless changed or otherwise revoked. 
2019 Proxy Statement    53 
Participants in the NQDC Plan are eligible to receive a matching contribution with respect to their elective deferrals made up to 6% of the participant's eligible earnings for the plan year in excess of the limits under Section 401(k) of the Code. These matching contributions are 100% vested at all times. In addition, participants are eligible for a retirement contribution ranging from 3% to 8% of the participant's eligible earnings for the plan year in excess of the limits under Section 401(k) of the Code, based on years of service, as follows:

Participating employees have full discretion over how their contributions to the NQDC Plan are invested among the offered investment options, and earnings on amounts contributed to the NQDC Plan are calculated in the same manner and at the same rate as earnings on actual investments. We do not subsidize a participant's earnings under the NQDC Plan. During 2018, the investment options offered under the NQDC Plan were the same as the investment options available to participants in the 401(k) Plan.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
We have agreements with our executive officers that provide for severance compensation or accelerated vesting in the event of certain terminations of employment, including in connection with a change in control, which are summarized below. None of the agreements we have with our named executive officers contain any tax reimbursement provisions in the event a named executive officer receives potential parachute payments under Section 280G of the Code. 
Change in Control Severance Agreements 
We have entered into change in control severance agreements with each of our named executive officers. The term of these change in control agreements is generally three years from the date the change in control agreement is entered into, but the term of the agreement will be automatically extended for an additional two year period beginning on the second anniversary of the date of the change in control agreement and any anniversary thereafter, unless a cancellation notice is given by us 60 days prior to the applicable expiration date. 
Under the change in control agreement, an executive is not entitled to receive payments or other benefits under the agreement unless there is a change in control and the executive's employment is either terminated by us without cause, by the officer for good reason or as a condition of the transaction constituting the change in control, in each 
56    HollyFrontier Corporation case during the six months preceding the change in control or within two years of the change in control. If the officer is entitled to payments under the change in control agreement, he or she will receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an amount equal to a multiple (the "severance multiplier") of (a) the greater of the officer's base  salary on the date of termination or the date immediately prior to the change in control, plus (b) the officer's annual bonus amount, calculated as the average annual bonus paid to the officer for the prior three years. The severance  multiplier is 3.0 for Mr. Damiris and 2.0 for Mr. Voliva, Mr. Stump, Ms. McWatters and Mr. Creery;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a cash payment equal to unpaid base salary and expenses and accrued vacation pay;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued participation by the officer and his or her dependents in our medical and dental benefit plans for a period of  one year following the later of the date of termination or the date of the change in control; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• unless the applicable award agreement provides otherwise, all outstanding equity-based compensation awards shall become  immediately vested at target level.  
[END TABLE]
Definitions. The following definitions are used in the change in control severance agreements. 
Under the change in control severance agreements, a "change in control" generally occurs if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a person or group of persons becomes the beneficial owner of more than 40% of the combined voting power of our then  outstanding securities or more than 40% of our outstanding common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of our Board is replaced during a 12-month period by directors who were  not endorsed by a majority of the previous board members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of a merger, consolidation or recapitalization of us or one of our subsidiaries resulting in our  stockholders prior to the merger owning less than 60% of the voting power of the new merged company or a recapitalization where no one owns more than 60% of the voting power; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution or an agreement for the sale or disposition of all  or substantially all of our assets.  
[END TABLE]
Under the change in control severance agreements, "cause" is defined as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the engagement in any act of willful gross negligence or willful misconduct on a matter that is not inconsequential; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the conviction of a felony.  
[END TABLE]
Under the change in control severance agreements, "good reason" is defined as, without the consent of the executive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction in the executive's (or his supervisor's) authority, duties or responsibilities;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction in the executive's base compensation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the relocation of the executive to an office or location more than 50 miles from the location at which the executive  normally performed the executive's services, except for travel reasonably required in the performance of the executive's responsibilities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if applicable, a failure of the executive to be re-elected or appointed as an  officer or to the board of directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material diminution in the budget or other spending over which the executive has authority; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material breach of the terms of the change in control severance agreement.  
[END TABLE]
The executive must provide notice to us of the alleged good reason event within 90 days of its occurrence and we have 30 days to cure. 
Obligations of the Officer. Payments and benefits under the change in control agreements are conditioned on the execution of a general release of claims by the former officer in favor of us and our related entities and agents. In addition, the change in control agreements contain confidentiality provisions pursuant to which each executive 
2019 Proxy Statement    57 
 agrees not to disclose or otherwise use our confidential information during his or her employment with us and thereafter, as well as non-disparagement and non-solicitation covenants. Violation of these provisions entitles us to complete relief, including injunctive relief, and may result in the executive being terminated for cause (provided the breach constituted willful gross negligence or misconduct on the executive's part that is not inconsequential). The agreements do not prohibit the waiver of a breach of these covenants. 
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards 
Special Involuntary Termination. The outstanding long-term equity incentive awards granted by us under the equity plan vest upon a "special involuntary termination," which means that, within 60 days prior to or at any time after a change in control: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive is terminated by us, other than for cause; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the executive resigns within 90 days after an adverse change has occurred.  
[END TABLE]
Under the long-term equity incentive award agreements, a "change in control" generally occurs if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a person or group of persons becomes the beneficial owner of more than 40% of the combined voting power of our then  outstanding securities;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a majority of our Board is replaced by directors who were not endorsed by  two-thirds of our prior board members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the consummation of a merger or consolidation of us or any of our subsidiaries other than (a) a merger or  consolidation resulting in our voting securities outstanding immediately prior to the transaction continuing to represent at least 60% of the combined voting power of our voting securities or the voting securities of the surviving entity outstanding  immediately after the transaction or (b) a merger or consolidation effected to implement a recapitalization of us in which no person or group becomes the beneficial owner of our securities representing more than 40% of the combined voting power  of our then outstanding securities; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• our stockholders approve a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution or an agreement for the sale or disposition of all  or substantially all of our assets.  
[END TABLE]
Under the long-term equity incentive award agreements, "cause" is defined as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• an act of dishonesty constituting a felony or serious misdemeanor and resulting (or intended to result) in personal gain or  enrichment to the recipient at our expense;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• gross or willful and wanton negligence in the performance of the recipient's material duties; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• conviction of a felony involving moral turpitude.  
[END TABLE]
Under the long-term equity incentive award agreements, an "adverse change" means, without the consent of the recipient: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material change in the geographic location at which the recipient is required to work regularly;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a substantial increase in travel requirements of employment;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction in the duties performed by the recipient; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a material reduction in the recipient's base compensation (other than bonuses and other forms of discretionary  compensation, or a general reduction applicable generally to executives).  
[END TABLE]
Performance Share Units upon Termination. In the event of a voluntary separation or termination for cause, the recipient will forfeit any outstanding performance share units. 
In the event of death, disability or termination by us other than for cause, each such termination not in connection with a change in control, the recipient becomes vested in a number of performance share units equal to the percentage of time the recipient was employed during the vesting period multiplied by the number of performance share units otherwise earned at the end of the applicable performance period. If the recipient dies or is disabled, the Compensation Committee, in its sole discretion, may determine the performance percentage in an amount up to 200%. 
58    HollyFrontier Corporation 
In the event of a special involuntary termination, and for the performance share units granted in November 2017, retirement before the end of the performance period, the recipient remains eligible to receive normal payment of the performance share units at the normal vesting date based upon our actual achievement of the performance measure. Under the performance share units granted in November 2018, if the recipient retires before the end of the performance period, the recipient vests in the target number of performance share units awarded. "Retirement" for purposes of the performance share units issued in November 2017 and November 2018 means termination of employment other than for cause on or after the date on which the recipient has achieved ten years of continuous service with the Company and is age 60. 
Restricted Stock upon Termination. In the event of a retirement, voluntary separation or termination by the Company with or without cause, the recipient will forfeit the unvested portion of the restricted stock award. 
In the event of death or disability, the recipient becomes vested in a number of shares of restricted stock equal to the percentage of time the recipient was employed during the vesting period multiplied by the total number of shares of restricted stock the recipient was awarded. The Compensation Committee may decide to vest all of the shares of restricted stock. 
In the event of a special involuntary termination before the full vesting of restricted stock awards, all restrictions lapse and the shares become fully vested and delivered to the recipient as soon as practicable thereafter. 
Restricted Stock Units upon Termination. In the event of a voluntary separation or termination by the Company with or without cause, the recipient will forfeit the unvested portion of the restricted stock award. 
In the event of death or disability, the recipient becomes vested in a number of shares of restricted stock equal to the percentage of time the recipient was employed during the vesting period multiplied by the total number of shares of restricted stock the recipient was awarded. The Compensation Committee may decide to vest all of the shares of restricted stock. 
In the event of a special involuntary termination or retirement before the full vesting of restricted stock awards, all restrictions lapse and the shares become fully vested and delivered to the recipient as soon as practicable thereafter. Retirement for purposes of the restricted stock units is defined in the same manner as for the performance share units granted in November 2017 and November 2018. 
The long-term equity incentive awards granted in 2018 were granted to our named executive officers with certain restrictive covenants that generally mirror the release requirements and confidentiality restrictions found in our change in control agreements described above. The awards were also granted with non-solicitation provisions that generally prevent the named executive officers from soliciting any employee or service provider of us or our affiliates for one year following a termination of employment. 
Quantification of Benefits 
The following table summarizes the compensation and other benefits that would have become payable to each named executive officer assuming his or her employment terminated on December 31, 2018, given the named executive officer's base salary as of that date, and, if applicable, the closing price of our common stock on December 31, 2018, which was $51.12. In addition, the following table summarizes the compensation that would become payable to the named executive officers assuming that a change in control occurred on December 31, 2018. 
In reviewing these tables, please note the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Accrued vacation for a specific year is not allowed to be carried over to a subsequent year, so we assumed all accrued  vacation for the 2018 fiscal year was taken prior to December 31, 2018. Because we accrue vacation in any given year for the following year, amounts reported as "Cash Severance" include accrued vacation amounts accrued in 2018 for the  2019 fiscal year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The row entitled "Performance Units" reports amounts payable with respect to outstanding performance share unit  awards issued by us. For amounts payable to the named executive officers with respect to performance share

[BEGIN TABLE]
     unit awards, we assumed the performance share units would settle at 100%. The number of units paid at the end of the performance period may vary from the amounts reflected in the following  tables, based on our actual achievement compared to the performance targets. For additional information regarding the potential payouts, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2018 Executive Compensation Decisions—Long-Term Equity  Incentive Compensation—Performance Share Unit Awards," "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—2019 Executive Compensation Decisions—Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation—Performance Share Unit Awards,"  "Executive Compensation—2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards" and "Executive Compensation—Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End."  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For the amounts shown in the row entitled "Restricted Stock" and "Restricted Stock Units" under the  column entitled "Death or Disability," we have reflected accelerated vesting based on the length of employment during the vesting period for each award.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Only Mr. Creery was eligible for retirement as of December 31, 2018. We have therefore not addressed amounts due  upon retirement for any other named executive officers. Assuming that Mr. Creery had retired on December 31, 2018, his retirement benefits would have consisted of accelerated vesting of restricted stock units valued at $792,871, and  accelerated vesting of performance share units valued at $2,007,585. We assumed that Mr. Creery's performance share units would settle at 100%, therefore the number of units paid upon a retirement scenario could vary from that level.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The amounts shown in the row entitled "Medical and Dental Benefits" represent amounts equal to the monthly  premium payable pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"), for medical and dental premiums, multiplied by 12 months for each of the named executive officers.

Compensation Practices and Risk Management 
Certain members of our management are responsible for annually reviewing the relationship between our risk assessment guidelines and our compensation programs. In addition, certain members of our management and the Compensation Committee annually review the features and characteristics of our compensation programs, including particular areas that could encourage employees to take excessive risk or focus on short-term results at the expense of long-term value creation, to confirm that our compensation programs do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking. As a part of this review, the Compensation Committee and certain members of management review salaries, annual incentive bonus awards, including the targets established for the annual incentive bonus awards, and long-term equity incentive awards, including the performance measures used for a portion of the long-term equity incentive awards, at all levels of the Company. 
Although the majority of the compensation provided to the named executive officers is performance-based, we believe our compensation programs do not encourage excessive and unnecessary risk taking by executive officers (or other employees) because these programs are designed to encourage employees to remain focused on both our short- and long-term operational and financial goals. In addition, we explicitly include Company safety and environmental performance in determining potential payouts under our annual incentive cash plan for our senior executives. 
While annual cash-based incentive bonus awards play an appropriate role in the executive compensation program, the Compensation Committee believes that payment determined based on an evaluation of our performance on a variety of measures, including our performance compared to our industry peers, mitigates excessive risk-taking that could produce unsustainable gains in one area of performance at the expense of our overall long-term interests. In addition, performance goals reflect our past performance and market conditions affecting our industry. 
An appropriate part of total compensation is fixed for the named executive officers, while another portion is variable and linked to performance. A portion of the variable compensation we provide is comprised of long-term incentives. A portion of the long-term incentives we provide is in the form of restricted stock and/or restricted stock units subject to time-based vesting conditions, which retain value even in a depressed market, so executives are less likely to take unreasonable risks. With respect to our performance share unit awards, assuming achievement of at least a minimum level of performance, payouts result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, in lieu of an "all or nothing" approach. 
As discussed above, while a portion of our potential annual compensation is incentive based, we have also instituted policies and programs designed to discourage unnecessary risk-taking, which is not in our long-term interests. For example, our stock ownership policy requires our executives to hold at least a specified level of stock (in addition to any unsettled performance based equity awards), which aligns our executives' interests with those of our long-term stockholders. Also, our clawback policy requires the return of annual and long-term incentive compensation for misconduct resulting in a material financial restatement. 
Based on the foregoing and our annual review of our compensation programs, we do not believe that our compensation policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company or our stockholders. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 W-2 (for U.S. employees) and T4 (for Canadian employees) taxable wages for all U.S. and Canadian employees, including our CEO, who were employed by us on December 15, 2018. We included all U.S. and Canadian employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, temporary or seasonal basis. As of December 15, 2018 the Company employed 3,621 such persons. As permitted by the SEC rules, we excluded our 58 employees located in Europe and Asia since those employees comprise less than 5% of our 3,679 worldwide employees. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments or estimates with respect to the W-2 or T4 wages, and we did not annualize the wages for any employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We believe the use of W-2 or T4 wages, as applicable, is the most appropriate compensation measure since it includes the total taxable wages received by our employees in 2018. 
62    HollyFrontier Corporation 
After identifying the median employee based on total taxable wages, we calculated annual 2018 compensation for the median employee using the same methodology used to calculate the chief executive officer's total compensation as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above. The median employee's annual 2018 compensation was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Year    Salary      Bonus    Stock Awards    Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation    All Other Compensation    Total 
 Median Employee    2018    $ 117,307      —    —    $7,107    $14,172    $138,586 
[END TABLE]
Our 2018 ratio of chief executive officer total compensation to the median employee's total compensation is reasonably estimated to be 82:1.

The term of the Omnibus Plan expired on April 26, 2016 and was not extended. As a result, no further awards have been granted under the Omnibus Plan after April 26, 2016. As of December 15, 2018, all outstanding awards under the Omnibus Plan vested, and as a result, the Omnibus Plan has terminated.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions 
Related Party Transactions 
The Company provides various general and administrative services to HEP under the terms of an Omnibus Agreement. Under the Omnibus Agreement, HEP pays the Company an annual fee, currently $2.5 million. The administrative fee is increased annually, beginning July 1, 2018, for changes in the Producers Price Index-Commodities-Finished Goods, (PPI), et al. and may increase in connection with the expansion of HEP's operations through the acquisition or construction of new assets or businesses. The administrative fee covers expenses the Company incurs in performing centralized corporate functions for HEP, such as executive services, tax, legal, accounting, treasury, information technology and other corporate services, including the administration of employee benefit plans. The fee does not include salaries of personnel who perform services for HLS or the cost of their employee benefits, such as 401(k), pension, and health insurance benefits 
In addition, under a secondment arrangement with HLS, the Company seconds certain of its employees to HLS to provide operational and maintenance services with respect to certain of HEP's processing, refining, pipeline and tankage assets at certain of the Company's refineries, including routine operational and maintenance activities. During their period of secondment, the seconded employees are under the management and supervision of HLS. HLS is required to reimburse the Company for the prorated portion of the wages, benefits, and other costs of these employees. 
On October 31, 2017, the Company closed on an equity restructuring transaction with HEP pursuant to which its incentive distribution rights were canceled and the Company's 2% general partner interest in HEP was converted into a non-economic general partner interest in HEP. In consideration, the Company received 37,250,000 HEP common units. In addition, the Company agreed to waive $2.5 million of limited partner cash distributions for each of twelve consecutive quarters beginning with the first quarter the units issued were eligible to receive distributions as consideration. 
In March 2016, Mr. Bech purchased $500,000 of the Company's 5.875% Senior Notes due 2026 in the open market. 
Julia Heidenreich, Vice President, Commercial Analysis and Pricing, is the wife of Richard L. Voliva III, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Ms. Heidenreich received cash and equity compensation totaling $501,883 in 2018. Ms. Heidenreich does not report to Mr. Voliva. 
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Audit Committee is charged with the responsibility of reviewing and approving all transactions with related persons, when required by the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. This responsibility is set forth in the Audit Committee's charter. In addition, pursuant to the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, an employee should disclose any potential conflict of interest to a supervisor who does not have a conflict of interest and the Chief Compliance Officer and obtain approval prior to proceeding with the potentially conflicted situation. If a director has a potential conflict of interest, the transaction or relationship must be disclosed to the Board or a committee of the Board that does not include such director. 
In determining whether to approve or disapprove entry into a related party transaction, the Audit Committee considers factors it deems appropriate, which may include, among others, whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction are in the best interest of the Company. All related party transactions that are approved by the Audit Committee are disclosed to the Board.

Ratification of Appointment of Ernst & Young LLP 
(Proposal 3) 
The Audit Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, to be the Company's auditor for fiscal year 2019. The Board is asking stockholders to ratify this appointment. SEC regulations and the NYSE listing requirements require the Company's independent registered public accounting firm to be engaged, retained and supervised by the Audit Committee. However, the Board considers the selection of an independent registered public accounting firm to be an important matter to stockholders. Accordingly, the Board considers a proposal for stockholders to ratify this appointment to be an opportunity for stockholders to provide input to the Audit Committee and the Board on a key corporate governance issue. If the stockholders do not ratify the selection of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection of that firm as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Ernst & Young LLP has conducted the Company's audits since 1977. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting and will have the opportunity to make a statement. They will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. For additional information regarding our independent registered public accounting firm, see "Independent Public Accountants." 
Required Vote and Recommendation 
The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP requires the approval of a majority of the votes cast on the proposal.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit services performed by the independent auditor to assure that performing such services does not impair the auditor's independence. 
The Audit Committee may also pre-approve fees related to other non-recurring services or it may delegate its pre-approval authority for non-recurring services, up to $75,000, to one or more of the Audit Committee's members or to the Company's Chief Accounting Officer. Any decisions made under this delegation must be reported to the Audit Committee.

Audit Committee Report 
The Company's management is responsible for preparing our financial statements and for our system of internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") and to issue a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing management's conduct of the financial reporting process and system of internal control. The Audit Committee also is responsible for selecting, engaging and overseeing the work of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, which reports directly to the Audit Committee, and evaluating its qualifications and performance. Among other things, to fulfill its responsibilities, the Audit Committee: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• considered whether Ernst & Young LLP's provision of non-audit  services to the Company is compatible with the auditor's independence.  
[END TABLE]
Taking all of these reviews and discussions into account, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
