PROXY STATEMENT
We are providing these Proxy Materials in connection with the solicitation by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of Capital City Bank Group, Inc., a Florida corporation ("Capital City"), of proxies to be voted at our 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareowners and at any adjournments or postponements of the Annual Meeting.
We will hold our 2019 Annual Meeting at 10:00 a.m., local time, Tuesday, April 23, 2019, at the Florida State University Turnbull Conference Center, 555 West Pensacola Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32301. We are making these Proxy Materials available to our shareowners on or about March 8, 2019.
At Capital City, and in this Proxy Statement, we refer to our employees as "associates." Also in the Proxy Statement, we refer to Capital City as the "Company," "we," or "us" and to the 2019 Annual Meeting as the "Annual Meeting."
VOTING INFORMATION
Who can vote?
All shareowners of record at the close of business on the record date of February 26, 2019 are entitled to receive these Proxy Materials and to vote at the Annual Meeting. On that date, there were 16,807,883 shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote.
How do I vote my shares in person at the Annual Meeting?
Shares held in your name as the shareowner of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting. Shares for which you are the beneficial owner but not the shareowner of record may be voted in person at the Annual Meeting only if you obtain a legal proxy from the broker, trustee, or other nominee that holds your shares giving you the right to vote the shares. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, we recommend that you vote by proxy as described below so that your vote will be counted if you later decide not to attend the Annual Meeting. The vote you cast in person will supersede any previous votes that you submitted, whether by Internet, phone, or mail. 
How do I vote my shares in the 401(k) plan?
If you are an associate who participates in Capital City's 401(k) Plan, you may instruct the Plan trustee on how to vote your shares in the Plan by mail, by telephone, or on the Internet as described above, except that, if you vote by mail, the card that you use will be a voting instruction card rather than a proxy card. If you own shares through the Plan and you do not vote, the Plan trustee will vote the shares in the same proportion as other Plan participants vote their Plan shares.
How can I vote my shares without attending the Annual Meeting?
Whether you hold shares directly as a shareowner of record or beneficially, you may direct how your shares are voted without attending the Annual Meeting. You may give voting instructions by the Internet or by telephone. If you requested and received a paper copy of a proxy card by mail, you may vote by mail. Instructions are on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy card.
Whether you provide voting instructions by the Internet or by telephone, or vote by mail, you are designating certain individuals to vote on your behalf as your legal Proxy. We have designated Bethany H. Corum and Dale A. Thompson each as a Proxy. The Proxies will vote all valid voting instructions and proxy cards that are delivered in response to this solicitation, and not later revoked, in accordance with the instructions given by you.
What is the deadline for voting my shares?
If you hold shares as the shareowner of record, then your vote by proxy must be received before 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on April 22, 2019 (the day before the Annual Meeting). If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee, or other nominee, please follow the instructions provided by your broker, trustee, or other nominee.

PROPOSAL NO. 1 â€“ ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Our Board is divided into three classes, designated Class I, Class II, and Class III. The directors in each class are elected for terms of three years. At the Annual Meeting, the shareowners will elect four Class I directors. Our Board proposes the following four nominees for election as directors at the Annual Meeting. Each of the nominees is currently serving as a member of the Board. The proxies will vote, unless instructed otherwise, each valid voting instruction and proxy card for the election of the following nominees as directors.
If a nominee is unable to serve, the shares represented by all valid proxies that have not been revoked will be voted for the election of a substitute as the Board may recommend, or the Board may by resolution reduce the size of the Board to eliminate the resulting vacancy. At this time, the Board knows of no reason why any nominee might be unable to serve.
If the four director nominees are elected, the Board will not have any vacancies. Brokers do not have discretion to vote on this proposal without your instructions. If you do not instruct your broker how to vote on this proposal, your broker will deliver a broker nonvote on this proposal.
The following paragraphs provide information as of the date of this Proxy Statement about each nominee and each incumbent director not up for re-election in the categories of: age, positions held, principal occupation and business experience for the past five years, and names of other publicly-held companies for which he or she serves as a director or has served as a director during the past five years. While the following paragraphs note certain individual qualifications and skills of our directors that contribute to the Board's effectiveness as a whole, we also believe that all of our nominees and incumbent directors not up for re-election have a reputation for integrity, honesty, and adherence to high ethical standards. They each have demonstrated strong leadership skills, business acumen and an ability to exercise sound judgment, as well as a commitment of service to our shareowners.

GOVERNING PRINCIPLES
We are committed to maintaining a business atmosphere where only the highest ethical standards and integrity prevail. An unwavering adherence to high ethical standards provides a strong foundation on which our business and reputation can thrive, and is integral to creating and sustaining a successful, high-caliber company.
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee Report
During 2018, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee focused its efforts on:
2018 Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee:
Stanley W. Connally, Jr. (Chair)
Cader B. Cox, III
Eric Grant
Laura L. Johnson
BOARD'S RESPONSIBILITIES AND DUTIES
Succession Planning
The Board plans for succession to the position of Chief Executive Officer as well as certain other senior management positions. To assist the Board, William G. Smith, Jr., our Chairman, President, and CEO, annually provides the Board with an assessment of senior managers and of their potential to succeed him. He also provides the Board with an assessment of persons considered potential successors to certain other senior management positions. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and our independent directors in an executive session annually review this updated assessment. In addition, the Board interacts with members of senior management who are potential successors to our executive management.
Board Refreshment
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines reflect our belief that directors should not be subject to term limits because it would likely cause us to lose directors who have developed insight into our strategies and operations and risks. Nevertheless, we have several policies in place to support board refreshment such as a mandatory retirement age, mandatory resignation if the director does not receive a majority vote of support from our shareowners, mandatory tender of a resignation upon a change in our director's principal employment, and a strict prohibition on serving on too many boards. Nevertheless, our Board regularly reviews its own composition, and considers and plans for an orderly transition and refreshment process, which includes planning for potential retirements and identifying potential candidates for service as new directors. As part of this process, over the past six years, the Board has added six new independent directors, Ms. Johnson and Messrs. Bense, Connally, Criser, Grant, and Sample, whom the Board believes have the relevant experience and expertise to complement that of our other directors and to further contribute to the Board's ongoing guidance of our company.

Risk Management
Risk management is an important component of our corporate strategy. While we assess specific risks at our committee levels, the Board, as a whole, oversees our risk management process, and discusses and reviews with management major policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Board is regularly informed through committee reports about our risks. In addition, we have an Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee, which reports to the Board at least twice per year. The Enterprise Risk Oversight Committee serves to assist the Board in establishing and monitoring our key risks, and meets at least on a quarterly basis.
Board and Committee Evaluations
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee uses a variety of methods to annually evaluate the Board as a whole and its committees. In most years, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee uses written questionnaires for the evaluation. Directors submit completed questionnaires to the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, who summarizes the results without attribution. The full Board discusses the summary of the Board evaluation, and each committee discusses the summary of its own evaluation. In other years, the evaluation is conducted by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee by sending each director a series of questions for the director to consider. The evaluation is then conducted verbally in executive session led by the Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. For 2018's evaluation, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee engaged an outside firm, Bank Director, to conduct the assessment.
Corporate Governance Guidelines
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines to implement the Nasdaq corporate governance listing standards and various other corporate governance matters.
Codes of Conduct and Ethics
The Board has adopted Codes of Conduct applicable to all directors, officers, and associates, and a Code of Ethics applicable to our Chief Executive Officer and our financial and accounting officers, all of which are available, without charge, upon written request to:
Capital City Bank Group, Inc.c/o Corporate Secretary217 North Monroe Street  Tallahassee, Florida 32301
These codes are designed to comply with Nasdaq and SEC requirements. We will disclose any amendments to, or waivers from, the Code of Ethics on our website (www.ccbg.com) within four business days of such determination.
Board structure and process
Independent Directors
Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. Nasdaq requires that a majority of our directors be "independent," as defined by Nasdaq's rules. Generally, a director does not qualify as an independent director if the director or a member of a director's immediate family has had in the past three years certain relationships or affiliations with us, our external or internal auditors, or other companies that do business with us. Our Board has adopted categorical independence standards that include all objective standards of independence set forth in the Nasdaq rules. The categorical independence standards are posted to the Corporate Governance section of our website, www.ccbg.com. Based on these standards, our Board has affirmatively determined that the following current directors, constituting a majority of our directors, are independent: Allan G. Bense, Frederick Carroll, III, Stanley W. Connally, Jr., Cader B. Cox, III, Marshall M. Criser III, J. Everitt Drew, Eric Grant, Laura L. Johnson, and John G. Sample, Jr.
Board Leadership
The Board does not have a policy with respect to separation of the positions of Chairman and CEO or with respect to whether the Chairman should be a member of management or an independent director, and believes that these are matters that should be discussed and determined by the Board from time to time. When the Chairman of the Board is a member of management or is otherwise not independent, the independent directors elect a lead director, which we discuss below. Currently, William G. Smith, Jr. serves as our Chairman and CEO. Given the fact that Mr. Smith is tasked with the responsibility of implementing our corporate strategy, we believe he is best suited for leading discussions regarding performance relative to our corporate strategy, and these discussions represent a significant portion of our Board meetings.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    9
Lead Director
The independent directors of our Board of Directors annually elect an independent director to serve in a lead capacity. Although elected annually, the lead director is generally expected to serve for more than one year. Mr. Drew serves as our lead director. The lead director's duties, which are listed in a Board approved charter, include:
We have posted the Lead Director Charter on our website, www.ccbg.com.
Independent Director Meetings In Executive Sessions
Our independent directors have established a policy to meet separately without any Company associates present in regularly scheduled executive sessions at least twice annually, and at such other times as may be deemed appropriate by our independent directors. Any independent director may call an executive session of independent directors at any time. In 2018, the independent directors met in an executive session five times.
Director Nominating Process
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee annually reviews and makes recommendations to the full Board regarding the composition and size of the Board so that the Board consists of members with the proper expertise, skills, attributes, and personal and professional backgrounds needed by the Board, consistent with applicable Nasdaq and regulatory requirements.
The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believes that all directors, including nominees, should possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity, and values, and be committed to representing the long-term interests of our shareowners. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider criteria including the nominee's current or recent experience as a senior executive officer, whether the nominee is independent, as that term is defined by the Nasdaq listing standards, the business experience currently desired on the Board, geography, the nominee's banking industry experience, and the nominee's general ability to enhance the overall composition of the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a formal policy on diversity; however, the Board and the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee believe that it is essential that the Board members represent diverse viewpoints and generally considers this issue during the annual board and committee evaluation process.
Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee identifies nominees for directors primarily based upon suggestions from shareowners, current directors, and executives. The Chair of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and at least one other member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee interviews director candidates. The full Board formally nominates candidates for director to be included in the slate of directors presented for shareowner vote based upon the recommendations of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee following this process.
Voting Standard
Our Bylaws provide that in an uncontested election, if a nominee for director does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for his or her election at which a quorum is present, then the director must promptly tender his or her resignation to the Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee would then recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation, or whether other action should be taken. The Board will act on the tendered resignation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind the decision within 90 days from the date of the certification of the election results. If a director's resignation is not accepted by the Board, then such director will continue to serve the remainder of the director's term. If a nominee's resignation is accepted by the Board, then the Board, in its sole discretion, may fill any remaining vacancy or decrease the size of the Board. To be eligible to be a nominee for election or reelection as our director, a person must deliver to our Corporate Secretary a written agreement that such person will abide by these requirements.
10   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
Mandatory Retirement Policy
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for mandatory director retirement at age 72.
Director Service on Other Boards
To ensure that our directors can provide sufficient time and attention to the Company, our directors may not serve on more than three other boards of directors of public companies in addition to our Board. Our CEO may not serve on more than two other boards of directors of public companies in addition to our Board.
Change in Director Occupation
A director whose principal occupation or business association changes substantially during the director's tenure must tender a resignation for consideration by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board the action, if any, to be taken with respect to the resignation.
DIRECTOR ATTENDANCE
Our Board met 12 times in 2018. Each of our directors attended at least 88.2 percent of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and Committees on which they served. We expect all directors to attend our Annual Meeting. Each of our directors, who was a director at the time of our Annual Meeting in 2018, attended the 2018 Annual Meeting.
SHAREOWNER COMMUNICATIONS
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for a process by which shareowners may communicate with the Board, a Board committee, the independent directors as a group, or individual directors. Shareowners who wish to communicate with the Board, a Board committee, or any other directors or individual directors may do so by sending written communications to the address below:
Capital City Bank Group, Inc.c/o Corporate Secretary  217 North Monroe StreetTallahassee, Florida 32301
Communications will be compiled by our Corporate Secretary and submitted to the Board, a committee of the Board, or the appropriate group of directors or individual directors, as appropriate, at the next regular meeting of the Board. The Board has requested that the Corporate Secretary submit to the Board all communications received, excluding those items that are not related to board duties and responsibilities, such as: mass mailings, job inquiries, resumes, advertisements, solicitations, and surveys.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION
Compensation elements
We currently have nine independent directors who qualify for compensation for Board service. In 2017, the Compensation Committee engaged Blanchard Consulting to measure Capital City's board compensation against the same peer group used to measure executive management compensation. Additionally, the Compensation Committee amended our Compensation Philosophy to include targeting total annual fees, including retainer, equity compensation, board meeting fees, committee chairmen fees, committee meeting fees, and Lead Director fees for our directors at the 50th percentile of our selected peer group unless an exception is stated by the Compensation Committee due to Company performance or market demand. Based on results from a study provided by Blanchard Consulting, the Compensation Committee implemented committee meeting fees in lieu of committee retainers. While the Compensation Committee deems attendance by directors to be mandatory at all meetings, having a variable compensation structure better aligns compensation with the volume of business conducted by each committee. The elements of director compensation are as follows: 
2019 Cash Compensation
Equity Compensation
Stock Grant. Each independent director earns restricted shares of our common stock valued at $24,000. The restricted shares are granted at the February Compensation Committee meeting and vest on December 31st of the same calendar year, provided that these shares will be forfeited if we incur a net loss for the year in which the grants were made. The restricted stock is issued under the terms of the 2011 Associate Incentive Plan.
Director Stock Purchase Plan. Directors are also permitted to purchase shares of common stock at a 10% discount from fair market value under the 2011 Director Stock Purchase Plan. During 2018, 14,470 shares were purchased. As of December 31, 2018, there were 33,910 shares of common stock available for issuance to directors under this plan. Purchases under this plan were not permitted to exceed the annual retainer and meeting fees received. Our shareowners adopted the Director Stock Purchase Plan at our 2011 Annual Meeting.
Perquisites and Other Personal Benefits
We provide directors with perquisites and other personal benefits that we believe are reasonable, competitive and consistent with our overall director compensation program. The value of the perquisites for each director in the aggregate is less than $10,000.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    13
Director Compensation Table
The following table sets forth a summary of the compensation we paid to our directors, other than directors who are also executive officers, in 2018:
Stock Ownership Expectations
We maintain stock ownership guidelines for all independent directors. In 2018, the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board approved a change to stock ownership expectations for directors. Under our current guidelines, each independent director is expected to own our common stock equal in value to 10 times their annual director retainer fees (including annual cash and equity grants). Directors have 10 years from the date they are first appointed or elected to our Board to meet the stock ownership requirement. The Compensation Committee has determined that as of December 31, 2018, all directors have met our share ownership expectations or are on track to meet these expectations within the stated time period of 10 years from date of appointment or election.
TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
PROCEDURES FOR REVIEW, APPROVAL, OR RATIFICATION OF RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS
We recognize that related person transactions may raise questions among our shareowners as to whether the transactions are consistent with our best interests and our shareowners' best interests. We generally do not enter into or ratify a related person transaction unless our Board, acting through the Audit Committee or otherwise, determines that the related person transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and our shareowners' best interests. We have adopted a written Related Person Transaction Policy.
Under our procedures, each director, executive officer, and nominee for director submits to our designated compliance officer certain information to assist us in monitoring the presence of related party transactions. On an ongoing basis, and to the best of their knowledge, directors and executive officers are expected to notify our designated compliance officer of any updates to that information. We use our best efforts to have our Audit Committee pre-approve all related person transactions. In the event a related person transaction was not pre-approved by the Audit Committee, the transaction is immediately submitted for the Audit Committee's review for ratification or attempted rescission.
In addition to the policy described above, we circulate a questionnaire each quarter to our directors and executive officers, in which each respondent is required to disclose, to the best of their knowledge, all related person transactions that occurred in the previous quarter.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PERSONS
Some of our directors and officers and their affiliates, are clients of, and have, in the ordinary course of business and banking, transacted with, Capital City Bank. These transactions include loans, commitments, lines of credit, and letters of credit, any of which may, from time to time, exceed $120,000. All loans included in these transactions were made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral requirements, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons who were not affiliates of Capital City Bank and, in the opinion of management, did not involve more than the normal risk of collectability or presented other unfavorable features. Our Board of Directors approved each of these transactions.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have not identified any transactions or series of similar transactions (other than the ordinary course of business transactions discussed above) for which we are a party in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000 and in which any current director, executive officer, or holder of more than 5% of our capital stock had or will have a direct or indirect material interest other than as follows:
Capital City Bank's Apalachee Parkway Office is located on land leased from the Smith Interests General Partnership L.L.P. ("SIGP") in which William G. Smith, Jr., Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive is a partner. William G. Smith, Jr. owns approximately 33.3% of SIGP interests. Under a lease agreement expiring in 2024, Capital City Bank makes monthly lease payments to SIGP. Lease payments are adjusted periodically for inflation. Actual lease payments made by Capital City Bank to SIGP in 2018 amounted to approximately $170,000. The approximate dollar value of Mr. Smith's interest in the transaction, without regard to profit and loss, was approximately $57,000. We believe the terms of this lease are comparable to the terms we would have received if we had leased the property from a third party.
William G. Smith, III, the son of our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, William G. Smith, Jr., is employed as a Vice President of Capital City Bank.  In 2018, William G. Smith, III's total compensation (consisting of annual base salary, annual bonus, and stock-based compensation) was approximately $147,000. His compensation was determined in accordance with our standard employment and compensation practices applicable to associates with similar responsibilities and positions.

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
Executive Overview
Capital City's Performance Highlights
Despite the challenging operating environment over the past several years, we believe that Capital City has positioned itself to take advantage of new opportunities. Consider that:
We are Careful with How We Spend our Shareowners' Money
We have an experienced and hardworking management team. In fact, members of our executive management team have more than 38 years of experience in the banking industry on average. We have been able to retain our management team by strongly linking pay to performance. Compare how our CEO's base salary matches up to the median base salary of the CEOs of our peer group:
16   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
Mr. Smith's relatively low base salary does not reflect his performance level, but rather it reflects our conservative compensation philosophy. Superior compensation should be earned through superior performance. Because Capital City's performance was adversely affected during last decade's recession, we significantly limited the raises our named executive officers received during that time frame. On the other hand, as Capital City has thrived, we have recognized our executives' performance through base salary increases.
We Strive to Maximize Shareowner Return
At Capital City, we strive to foster a culture of accountability to our shareowners and work to maximize shareowner return each day. In fact, that is why we refer to our shareholders as "shareowners" â€“ we understand that we work for the benefit of Capital City's owners. We also believe that a good way to align the interests of our associates with the interests of our shareowners is to encourage our associates to become shareowners. We are proud to offer our associates the ability to purchase shares of Capital City through our 2011 Associate Stock Purchase Plan and through the Capital City 401(k) Plan. We also pay our directors, executive officers and senior management team partially in shares of Capital City stock and maintain robust share ownership requirements for many of these individuals.
Pay for Performance is Integral to the Capital City Culture
Our focus on maximizing shareowner return and the strong ownership culture among our associates makes it much easier to implement a strong pay-for-performance compensation plan for your management team. Your executive officers do not expect to get paid well when Capital City's results do not meet our expectations. On the other hand, when Capital City achieves its board approved performance goals as it did over the past three years, your management team should be rewarded. In 2018, a substantial majority of Mr. Smith's eligible compensation was "at risk."
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    17
Capital City has been operating in a difficult environment over the past decade. We continue to experience low interest rates, which have reduced our net interest margin significantly. While we can't control general economic factors, we believe that we can ensure that our management team's compensation is in line with Capital City's performance.
Compensation Best Practices
We are proud of the strong corporate governance practices we have implemented. Below we have summarized some of the important policies we have implemented to ensure that we provide compensation to align the interests of our executive officers with the interests of our shareowners. More importantly, we have summarized the compensation practices that we do not have because we believe that these particular practices are not in the best interests of our shareowners.
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT
We, as a Compensation Committee, met five times in 2018, including two executive sessions with only the Compensation Committee members present. Mr. Cox, the chairman of our Committee, sets the meeting dates and agenda for the committee. In the past year, we:

We have also reviewed and discussed with management the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K included in this Proxy Statement. Based on that review and discussion, we have recommended to the Board of Directors of the Company that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Proxy Statement.

Compensation and Benefits Strategy
Our compensation strategy provides broad guidance on senior management compensation and more specifically on the compensation of the named executive officers. Our compensation objectives are to provide compensation programs that:
We believe that accomplishing corporate goals is essential for our continued success and sustained financial performance. Therefore, we believe that executive officer compensation should be largely at-risk and performance based. Specific targets and weightings used for establishing short-term and long-term performance goals are subject to change at the beginning of each measurement period, and are influenced by the Board's desire to emphasize performance in certain areas. Each year, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves all executive officer performance-based goals.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    19
The compensation and benefits programs for our executives are designed with the goal of providing compensation that is fair, reasonable and competitive. These programs are intended to help us recruit and retain qualified executives, and provide rewards that are linked to performance while also aligning the interests of executives with those of our shareowners.
Compensation Philosophy
The Compensation Committee, with Board approval, adopted the compensation philosophy and set the following compensation objectives:
We discuss the composition of our peer group and our benchmarking practices in further detail below.
Executive Compensation Policy Decisions
The Compensation Committee has adopted a number of policies to further the goals of our executive compensation program, particularly with respect to strengthening the alignment of our executives' interests with our shareowners' long-term interests. Further, the Compensation Committee believes the policies set forth below are effective based on the stability of our management team and our ability to attract talent from outside the Company.
Stock Ownership Expectations
We maintain stock ownership expectations for all senior managers, including our executive officers. Under our current guidelines, all senior managers are expected to own shares of our common stock equal in value to at least two times their annual base salary; Mr. Barron and Mr. Davis are expected to own shares of our common stock equal in value to at least three times their annual base salary; and Mr. Smith is expected to own shares of our common stock equal in value to at least five times his annual base salary. Compliance is expected within six years of becoming a senior manager or executive officer.
The Compensation Committee has determined that as of December 31, 2018, all executive officers have met our share ownership expectations and all other senior managers covered by this program are making significant strides in meeting the ownership expectations.
Stock Options
We ceased granting stock options in 2007 and there are currently no stock options outstanding.
Prohibition on Repricing Stock Options
By the terms of the 2011 Associate Incentive Plan, which is the only plan we may use to grant stock options, repricing stock options is prohibited without shareowner approval.
20   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
Employment Agreements and Severance Agreements
We believe the employment of our executive officers should remain "at will." Therefore, none of our executive officers have an employment agreement or severance agreement with us.
Incentive Compensation Clawback
Effective, January 1, 2017, all participants in the 2011 Associate Incentive Plan have their incentive compensation subject to a clawback where: (i) we issue a material restatement of our financial statements; (ii) we make a subsequent finding that the financial information or performance metrics used to determine the amount of the incentive compensation are materially inaccurate regardless of individual fault; (iii) a plan participant engages in intentional misconduct; or (iv) the plan participant has committed ethical or criminal violations. In addition, we may recover any incentive compensation awarded or paid based on a participant's conduct which is not in good faith and which materially disrupts, damages, impairs or interferes with our business or which causes harm to our reputation.
Compensation Program Design
Compensation Framework
We design our specific compensation elements based on the following:
Specific Compensation Elements
Our executive compensation program is comprised of four discrete elements (which are each described in further detail below):
Discussion of Specific Compensation Elements
Base Salary
Our compensation philosophy guideline is to target base salaries at the 50th percentile of our peer group; however, superior performance may warrant a base salary in excess of this target. Our Compensation Committee believes that this target level will allow us to attract and retain the talent necessary to achieve our performance goals. The base salaries for the named executive officers are determined by analyzing available market data as well as taking into account the experience and performance of the individual. In 2018, two of our named executive officers received an increase in their base salary. The increases were Mr. Barron, 9.4% and Mr. Davis, 5.3%. Mr. Smith's base salary is 21.5% below the 50th percentile base salary of our peer group. His relatively low base salary is not reflective of his performance or experience level. It has been historically low compared to our peer group benchmark and the Compensation Committee continues to place great emphasis on bringing Mr. Smith's base salary in line with the stated target level. Mr. Barron's base salary is 15.1% below the 50th percentile and Mr. Davis's base salary was 8.6% below the 50th percentile. We consider an officer's salary to be in line with the benchmark if it is within 15% of the benchmark.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    21
Incentive Compensation
In addition to their base salary, each named executive officer has the opportunity to earn annual incentive compensation. The Compensation Committee believes a competitive overall compensation package should include incentive compensation in the form of both cash and equity awards. The Compensation Committee believes, based on past advice from its compensation consultant, targeting incentive compensation equal to or greater than 30% of total compensation is sufficient to change behaviors relative to performance. As a result, we believe our total incentive-based compensation target of at least 30% of total compensation is appropriate.
In 2018, Mr. Smith's targeted incentive compensation was 60.0% of his total targeted compensation, Mr. Barron's was 49.2% and Mr. Davis's was 42.0%. We believe the differences of potential impact each executive officer has on our performance warrants differences in how much compensation they individually have at risk. Each executive officer has an opportunity to earn incentives under a long term plan.
In 2018, Mr. Smith's total targeted incentive compensation of $600,000 was comprised of 47% cash and 53% equity and includes both short term and long term incentive plans. Mr. Barron's total target incentive compensation of $339,000 was comprised of 57% cash and 43% equity, and includes both short-term and long-term incentive plans. Mr. Davis's total target incentive compensation of $217,000 was comprised of 56% cash and 44% equity, and includes both short-term and long-term incentive plans. The difference in allocation between cash and equity among the named executive officers is due to each executive's responsibilities.
The base and incentive (cash and equity) compensation for Messrs. Smith, Barron, and Davis placed them below the 75th percentile for total compensation, relative to their respective peers.
Cash Incentive Plan. Cash incentives for each of the named executive officers are based primarily on performance with regard to goals established by the Compensation Committee. In 2018, measurement was based on using four distinct goals that were weighted based on their relative relationship to overall performance including:
Messrs. Smith, Barron, and Davis received a payout of $211,418, $173,242, and $108,729, respectively, under the Cash Incentive Plan. The payout represented 120.81% of the target.
Although the goals are generally consistent from year to year, the Compensation Committee evaluates the exact goals each year to better align incentives with the Company's strategy. The goals can be based upon performing loan levels; loan growth; classified or non-performing asset levels; net charge-offs; deposit levels, including growth; increase in shareowner value; stock price; revenue, including growth; net interest income; fee income; net interest margin; non-interest income; non-interest expense; loan loss provision expense; expense management; net income; earnings per share; return on assets; return on shareowners' equity; return on capital; efficiency ratio; or the extent to which direct reporting managers meet their own goals based on these metrics.
Stock-Based Incentive Plan. The Stock-Based Incentive Plan is a performance-based equity bonus plan in which selected members of management, including all named executive officers, are eligible to participate. The Stock-Based Incentive Plan is administered under our 2011 Associate Incentive Plan. The Compensation Committee believes the equity component of our incentive compensation package creates ownership in the Company and aligns the goals of our shareowners and named executive officers because it provides incentives to our named executive officers to focus on improving long-term performance. Payments under the Stock-Based Incentive Plan consists of an award payable 75% in performance shares and 25% in cash, and is designed to align the economic interests of management with those of our shareowners.
22   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
Under the Stock-Based Incentive Plan, all participants were eligible to earn an equity award tied to achievement of four distinct objectives weighted based on their relative relationship to overall performance of the Company:
Depending on performance, component payouts under the plan could have ranged from 0% to 200% of the target, and the maximum payout, in aggregate, could have been 200%.
Two of four goals were achieved at the 100% level or better. Return on assets of 0.96% paid out at 74.82%. Efficiency ratio paid out at 95.38%, classified assets paid out at 200%, and risk-adjusted loan income paid out at 143.60%. Factoring in the component weighting of each goal, the total payout was 120.81% under the 2018 Stock-Based Incentive Plan.
Similar to the Cash Incentive Plan, the goals are generally consistent from year to year, but may change to align management's incentive with the Company's strategy. The goals are generally selected from the same group of metrics as available to be used in the Cash Incentive Plan.
The total economic value of the award for each named executive officer is set as a percentage of total incentive compensation. The total economic value of the target award at the 100% payout level is split 75% in shares and 25% in cash. The formula used a stock price of $24.18 to arrive at the number of performance shares granted. The price was derived based on the average high and low of the previous 10 trading days from date of grant (February 21, 2018). This formula was set by the terms of the 2011 Associate Incentive Plan.
For 2018, the named executive officers received the following shares:
The cash portion of the Stock-Based Incentive Plan award was as follows:
Awards earned under the Stock-Based Incentive Plan are issued in the calendar quarter following the calendar year in which the awards were earned. Generally, any awards earned are issued in late January or early February.
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) - Compound Annual Growth Rate in Diluted EPS. The Compensation Committee awards Messrs. Smith, Barron, and Davis performance shares as provided in the 2011 Associate Incentive Plan. This plan is designed to correlate compensation with the long-term growth of the Company. Pursuant to this three-year plan, which is adopted each year to allow for the annual adoption of rolling three-year goals, we award performance shares and cash with an economic value equivalent ranging from $0 to $500,000 after the conclusion of each three-year performance period for Mr. Smith. For Messrs. Barron and Davis, we award performance shares and cash with an economic value equivalent ranging from $0 to $200,000 after the conclusion of each performance period. In 2017, the Compensation Committee granted Mr. Davis the right to participate in this plan with a phased in approach in years 2017 and 2018.

Details of Mr. Smith's long-term incentive plan.
For the 2016 plan (with a payout in 2019 based on 2016-18 performance), the target award of $250,000 is based on Capital City achieving a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.53 per share (2015 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $500,000 would be earned if the compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level. Actual diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.54 per share, however, Mr. Smith requested that the Compensation Committee exercise negative discretion and not award him a bonus. The Compensation Committee honored his request.
For the 2017 plan (with a possible payout in 2020 based on 2017-19 performance), the target award of $250,000 is based on Capital City achieving a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.69 per share (2016 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $500,000 would be earned if the compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.
For the 2018 plan (with a possible payout in 2021 based on 2018-20 performance), the target award of $250,000 is based on Capital City achieving a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $1.03 per share (2017 earnings, as upwardly adjusted to reverse certain effects from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "TCJA")) as the base amount. A maximum award of $500,000 would be earned if the compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.
Details of Mr. Barron's long-term incentive plan.
For the 2016 plan (with a payout in 2019 based on 2016-18 performance), the target award of $100,000 is based on Capital City achieving a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.53 per share (2015 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $200,000 would be earned if the three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level. Actual diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.54 per share, therefore, Mr. Barron earned the maximum level of 200%, equaling 9,810 shares and $50,000 in cash.
For the 2017 plan (with a possible payout in 2020 based on 2017-19 performance), the target award of $100,000 is based on Capital City achieving a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.69 per share (2016 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $200,000 would be earned if the compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.
For the 2018 plan (with a possible payout in 2021 based on 2018-20 performance), the target award of $100,000 is based on achieving a goal of a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $1.03 per share (2017 earnings, as upwardly adjusted to reverse certain effects from the TCJA) as the base amount. A maximum award of $200,000 would be earned if the three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.
Details of Mr. Davis's long-term incentive plan.
For the Year 2 Phase-in 2017 plan (with a payout in 2019 based on 2017-18 performance), the target award of $66,667 is based on achieving a goal of a 10% two-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.69 per share (2016 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $133,334 would be earned if the two-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level. Actual diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1.54 per share, therefore, Mr. Davis earned the maximum level of 200%, equaling 4,812 shares and $33,333 in cash.
For the Year 3 Phase-in 2017 plan (with a possible payout in 2020 based on 2017-19 performance), the target award of $100,000 is based on achieving a goal of a 10% three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $0.69 per share (2016 earnings) as the base amount. A maximum award of $200,000 would be earned if the three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.
For the 2018 plan (with a possible payout in 2021 based on 2018-20 performance), the target award of $100,000 was based on achieving a goal of a 10% three-year annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share using $1.03 per share (2017 earnings, as upwardly adjusted to reverse certain effects from the TCJA) as the base amount. A maximum award of $200,000 would be earned if the three-year compound annual growth rate in diluted earnings per share equals or exceeds 12.5%, the maximum performance level.

Benefits and Perquisites
Determining Benefit Levels. Benefit levels are reviewed periodically to ensure that the plans and programs provided are competitive and cost-effective for us, and support our human capital needs. Benefit levels are not tied to company, business area or individual performance.
Perquisites. We provide our named executive officers with perquisites that we believe are reasonable, competitive and consistent with our overall executive compensation program. The value of the perquisites for each named executive officer in the aggregate is less than $10,000.
Health, Dental, Disability and Life Insurance Coverage. The core insurance package for our named executive officers and senior management team includes health, dental, disability and basic group life insurance coverage. Our named executives and senior management participate in these benefits on the same basis as our other associates.
Paid Time-Off Benefits. We provide vacation and other paid holidays to all associates, including our named executive officers and senior management team, which are comparable to those provided at similarly sized financial institutions.
Post-Termination Compensation and Retirement Benefits.
We provide retirement benefits to named executive officers and senior management through a combination of qualified (under the Internal Revenue Code) and nonqualified plans.
Retirement Plan. The Retirement Plan is a tax-qualified, noncontributory defined benefit plan intended to provide for an associate's financial security in retirement. All full-time and part-time associates with 1,000 hours of service annually are eligible for the Retirement Plan.
401(k) Plan. The 401(k) plan provides associates the opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-favored basis. For associates hired after January 1, 2002, the associates receive a reduced pension benefit under the Retirement Plan and a 50% matching contribution (matched up to 6% of cash compensation) under the 401(k) Plan. This change was intended to be cost-neutral. Executives may elect to participate in the 401(k) Plan on the same basis as our other similarly situated associates. No named executive officers are currently eligible for the company-sponsored match.
Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Each of our named executive officers participates in our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP"), a nonqualified plan which provides benefits in excess of the Retirement Plan. The SERP is designed to restore a portion of the benefits Messrs. Smith, Barron, and Davis would otherwise receive under our Retirement Plan, if these benefits were not limited by U.S. tax laws. This more closely aligns the benefits of Messrs. Smith, Barron, and Davis with those of other Retirement Plan participants. We have no obligation to fund the SERP, but accrue for our anticipated obligations under the SERP on an annual basis.
Benchmarking
We use benchmarking as a method to understand what similar positions pay in similar organizations. In setting 2018 executive compensation and director compensation, the Compensation Committee engaged Blanchard Consulting to create a custom peer group, based on the following traits: publicly traded bank holding company with assets between $1.9 billion and $7.9 billion as of fiscal year end 2017, at least 30 branches, and located in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. The states selected represent southeastern U.S. states where financial institutions with a similar profile to Capital City Bank were located. At the time the members of the peer group were selected, each member was a publicly traded company. (See the chart below for the names of the financial institutions in our selected peer group as well as their asset size.)
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    25
CCBG Peer Group Comparison
Approximately 30% of the peer group includes institutions that serve the same geographic region as we do. Benchmarking is the primary tool we use to set executive compensation; however, we also review individual performance and industry trends in terms of increases to executive compensation. For Mr. Smith, we also undertake a 10-year historical compensation review.
The compensation peer group is not identical to the peer group used to measure company performance, due to difficulty in gathering compensation data from nonpublic companies. Company performance data can be gathered from financial institution call reports for public and nonpublic financial institutions. However, some of the institutions represented on the compensation peer group are included in the Company performance peer group.
Pay ratio disclosure
The following information discloses the ratio of our median employee's annual total compensation to the annual total compensation of the principal executive officer ("CEO"), Mr. Smith.
In determining the median employee, we prepared a list of all employees (excluding our CEO) as of December 31, 2017 (other than employees on leave of absence). Wages and salaries were annualized for employees who began employment after January 1, 2017 or who took a leave of absence during 2017. We had 997 employees during calendar year 2017, including short-term and partial-year employees (i.e., new hires, temporary, etc.). We annualized compensation figures for all employees newly hired, or rehired, during 2017. For simplicity, we excluded the value of the our 401(k) plan and medical benefits provided in selecting the median employee because all employees including the CEO are provided the exact same benefits. We then selected the employee who earned the median compensation for 2017.
26   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
For purposes of determining our CEO pay ratio, we are permitted to use the same median employee for up to three years, provided there is no material change to the employment population or change in employee compensation arrangements that would significantly impact our pay ratio disclosure. After reviewing data related to our employees and employee compensation, we determined that there were no material changes to our employment population or employee compensation arrangements in 2018 as compared to 2017. Therefore, we have elected to use the same median employee for our 2018 analysis.
Once we identified the median employee, we added that individual's Change in Pension Value to his/her annual compensation, continuing to mirror the Executive Compensation â€“ Summary Compensation Table structure.
In determining the ratio, we included all compensation paid to the median employee, including base salary, incentive awards, and overtime; however, we did not include any benefits (i.e., employer paid premiums, group term life values, etc.), consistent with the compensation disclosures  in Executive Compensation â€“ Summary Compensation Table.
The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) was $47,252. The annual total compensation of our CEO was $1,176,183 resulting in an estimated ratio of CEO to Median Employee Total Compensation of 24.9 to 1.
Because of the high variability of pension value each year, particularly when the age of our CEO and our identified median employee is significant, we are also providing a ratio excluding the change in pension value. The median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees (excluding our CEO) was $37,615 excluding the change in pension value. The annual total compensation of our CEO (excluding the change in pension value) was $1,412,622, resulting in an estimated ratio of CEO to Median Employee Total Compensation excluding the change in pension value of 37.6 to 1.
Impact of Regulatory Requirements
Federal Reserve and FDIC Guidance.
In 2010, the Federal Reserve issued final comprehensive guidance regarding the manner in which banks and bank holding companies pay incentive compensation. In accordance with the final guidance, all banking organizations supervised by the Federal Reserve are required to review the incentive compensation arrangements of: senior executive officers and others responsible for oversight of company-wide activities or material business lines; individual employees, including nonexecutive employees, whose activities may expose the bank to material amounts of risk; and groups of employees who are subject to the same or similar incentive compensation arrangements and who, in the aggregate, may expose the bank to material amounts of risk. Our Compensation Committee has conducted a review to ensure that compensation is structured in a manner so as not to encourage excessive risk-taking.
In 2011, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule which, if adopted, could affect incentive-based compensation for our executive officers. The proposed rule, among other things, would prohibit certain types of incentive-based compensation including (i) compensation which would be unreasonable or disproportionate to the individual's services (excessive compensation) and (ii) compensation that would encourage inappropriate risk taking that could lead to a material loss. The Compensation Committee is monitoring the progress of the proposed rule. The final rule has not yet been adopted.
Impact on Say-on-Pay Vote
We provide our shareowners with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation ("Say-on-Pay") every three years. At our Annual Meeting in 2017, out of the 13,238,167 votes cast (excluding abstentions and broker nonvotes), our shareowners cast 13,040,351 shares, or 98.5%, "For" approval of our executive compensation. The Compensation Committee believes this vote affirmed shareowners' support of our approach to executive compensation. The Compensation Committee will continue to consider the outcome of the Say-on-Pay vote when making future compensation decisions for our named executive officers. Our next Say-on-Pay vote will take place at our Annual Meeting in 2020
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    27
Compensation Committee Process and Procedures
Scope of Authority
The Compensation Committee has strategic and administrative responsibility for a broad range of issues, including reviewing, authorizing, and approving compensation to be paid to our executive officers, directors, and our senior management team. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board, and the Board appoints, each member of the Compensation Committee. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has evaluated, and the Board has determined, that each member of the Compensation Committee is an independent director.
The Compensation Committee's policy is to review executive compensation, including incentive goals, at least annually. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews benefits and perquisites, reviews and provides oversight of our compensation philosophy, serves as the administrative committee for our equity-based plans, and reviews stock ownership guidelines for our executive officers and directors.
Delegation of Authority
The Compensation Committee's charter permits the delegation of its authority to our Chief People Office to administer compensation and benefits programs. In 2018, the Compensation Committee delegated the administration of all associate compensation, benefit and welfare plans to Bethany H. Corum, Capital City Bank's Executive Vice President and Co-Chief Operating Officer and Chief People Officer.
None of the members of the Compensation Committee is an executive officer of a public company of which one of our executive officers is a director.
Independent Consultants
In carrying out its responsibilities, the Compensation Committee evaluates the information and recommendations put forth by management and its independent advisors in making its decisions regarding executive compensation. The Compensation Committee's decisions are made with the objective of providing fair, equitable and performance-based compensation to executives in a manner that is affordable and cost effective for our shareowners. In 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged Blanchard Consulting to create a custom peer group for the purpose of benchmarking executive officer compensation.
Management's Role
The Compensation Committee sets compensation for the Chief Executive Officer based on data provided by the Chief People Officer and a review of peer group statistics. In addition, the Compensation Committee reviews and approves the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations for other executive officers' compensation. In making these decisions, the Compensation Committee relies on information and recommendations provided by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief People Officer. The key roles played by management in assisting the Compensation Committee to determine compensation levels for our named executive officers are as follows:
The key members of management involved in the executive compensation process were Mr. Smith and Mrs. Corum. Mr. Smith has no involvement in setting his own compensation and was not present during the Compensation Committee's deliberations regarding his own compensation. Mrs. Corum attends all meetings of the Compensation Committee to provide information to the Compensation Committee members and to take minutes of the meetings. At times, the Compensation Committee conducts executive sessions. Mrs. Corum is excused from all executive sessions and the Chairman of the Committee communicates any decisions for inclusion in the minutes. Management (other than Mr. Smith and Mr. Barron solely in their roles as directors approving the Compensation Committee's recommendations) had no role in setting compensation for the independent directors.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Summary Compensation Table for 2018, 2017, and 2016
The following summary compensation table shows compensation information for our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and our president (the only other executive officer whose total compensation exceeded $100,000) for each of the three previous fiscal years. Amounts listed under column (f), "Nonequity Incentive Plan Compensation" are determined by the Compensation Committee at its first meeting following the year in which the compensation is earned and paid to the executives shortly after such determination is made.
Cash awards under the LTIP are shown in the third year of the three-year performance period, but only if actually paid out. Mr. Smith declined his awards in 2017 and 2018. Awards were as follows:
These amounts were earned during the years indicated and were paid to our named executive officers in January of the following year.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    29
Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018
As discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, cash bonus plan payouts and performance share units are awarded only when we achieve Board-approved established levels of performance.

Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2018
The following table provides information on outstanding equity awards for our executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table at the end of 2018.
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control
The amount of compensation (if any) that is payable to our named executive officers upon termination of employment depends on the nature and circumstances under which employment is ended.
Change in Control
In the event of a change in control, our named executive officers will be credited with an additional two years of credited service for purposes of computation of retirement benefits payable under the SERP; however, all of our executive officers already have earned the maximum service time. Accrued benefits based upon normal retirement are payable to the named executive officer upon a change in control. A "change in control" under the SERP means the sale of substantially all of our assets, a change in share ownership of greater than 50% within a 24-month period, or any other determination of change in control made by our Board of Directors.
In the event of a change in control, our named executive officers would not receive any additional benefit under the qualified Retirement Plan but would have the same benefits as any associate who separates employment with the Company.
We have no post-employment compensation programs designed to provide benefits upon a change in control, other than those discussed above.
Payments Upon Termination of Employment
Voluntary Termination. If a named executive officer voluntarily resigns from our employment, no amounts are triggered under the Cash Incentive Plan or the Stock-Based Incentive Plan. The executive may be entitled to receive benefits from the Retirement Plan and the SERP to the extent those benefits have been earned under the provisions of the plans and the executive officer has met the vesting requirements of the plans. In addition, the executive would be entitled to receive any amounts voluntarily deferred (and the earnings on deferrals) under the 401(k) Plan.
Retirement. As of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Barron, Davis, and Smith are eligible for normal retirement as defined by the Retirement Plan and the SERP. As such, each may be entitled to receive benefits from the Retirement Plan and SERP to the extent those benefits have been earned under the provisions of the plans.
Death. If a named executive officer dies while employed by us, the Retirement Plan and the SERP will provide benefits to the heirs of the deceased executive. The benefits are of the same value as those provided for a voluntary termination or early retirement as applicable.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    31
Involuntary Termination with or without Cause. If a named executive officer's employment is involuntarily terminated, the executive may be entitled to receive benefits from the Retirement Plan and the SERP to the extent those benefits have been earned under the provisions of the plans and the executive officer has met the vesting requirements of the plans. In addition, the executive would be entitled to receive any amounts voluntarily deferred (and the earnings on deferrals) under the 401(k) Plan.
Disability. In the event that a named executive officer becomes disabled on a long-term basis, the executive officer's employment by us would not necessarily terminate. If a named executive officer becomes disabled under the terms of the Retirement Plan or the SERP, the executive will continue to accrue a retirement benefit until the earliest of recovery, death or retirement. This benefit cannot be paid as a lump sum distribution.
Payment Tables
Each named executive officer would have received the following payments had his employment terminated on December 31, 2018 under the following triggering events:
PENSION BENEFITS
Retirement Plan
The key provisions of the Retirement Plan are as follows:
Monthly Benefit. Participants with a vested benefit will be eligible to receive the following retirement benefits each month for the rest of their lives beginning at age 65:
Total benefits are limited by the Internal Revenue Code. In 2018, the limit was $220,000 per year or $18,333 per month. Additional provisions may apply for participants who were hired after January 1, 2002 or who worked for a bank that we acquired.
Final Average Monthly Compensation. The final average monthly compensation is the average of the highest five years of W-2 earnings (plus 401(k) deferrals minus taxable automobile allowance) within the previous 10 years, regardless of whether the years occur consecutively. Compensation is limited by the Internal Revenue Code to $275,000 per year (or $22,917 per month) for 2018.
32   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
Vesting. Participants become vested after reaching five years of service.
Early Retirement Benefits. Participants may elect to retire prior to their Normal Retirement Date.
Form of Payment. Participants may receive their pension benefit as an annuity or as a lump sum.
SERP
In general, the plan provisions for the SERP are identical to the provisions of the Retirement Plan, except the benefits are calculated without regard to the limits set by the Internal Revenue Code on compensation and benefits. The net benefit payable from the SERP is the difference between this gross benefit and the benefit payable by the Retirement Plan. The SERP limits gross benefits to 60% of final average monthly compensation. As a general rule, we do not grant extra years of service under the SERP other than in the event of a change in control, when we credit our named executive officers with an additional two years of credited service; however, all of our executive officers already have earned the maximum service time. Exceptions may occur in limited instances such as a mid-career hire.
2018 Pension Benefit Table
The following table shows the years of credited service, present value of the accumulated benefit for the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018 and payments made during the last fiscal year.

PROPOSAL NO. 2 â€“ RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Our Audit Committee expects to appoint Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year. Shareowner ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young as our independent auditors is not required by our Bylaws or other applicable legal requirement. However, the Board is submitting the expected appointment of Ernst & Young to the shareowners for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice. If the shareowners fail to ratify the expected appointment of Ernst & Young, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or not to retain that firm. Even if the expected appointment of Ernst & Young is ratified, the Audit Committee at its discretion may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in our and our shareowners' best interests. Representatives of Ernst & Young are expected to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting and, if in attendance, will have an opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and to respond to appropriate questions.
The proposal to ratify the expected appointment of Ernst & Young as independent auditors will be approved if the votes cast by the shareowners present, or represented, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter favoring this proposal exceed the votes cast in opposition to the proposal.
AUDIT COMMITTEE MATTERS
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
The Audit Committee, which operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors, monitors the Company's financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. This report reviews the actions taken by the Audit Committee with regard to the Company's financial reporting process during 2018 and particularly with regard to the Company's audited consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018.
The Audit Committee believes that it has taken the actions necessary or appropriate to fulfill its oversight responsibilities under the Audit Committee's charter. In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed with management the audited financial statements to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, including a discussion of the quality (rather than just the acceptability) of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and the clarity of disclosures in the financial statements.
The Audit Committee also reviewed with Ernst & Young their judgments as to quality (rather than just the acceptability) of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee in accordance with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board standards. In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with Ernst & Young, the auditor's independence from management and the Company, including the written disclosures, letter, and other matters required of Ernst & Young by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
Management and the Company's internal and independent auditors also made presentations to the Audit Committee throughout the year on specific topics of interest, including: (i) cyber security procedures; (ii) information technology systems and controls; (iii) significant regulatory matters, including the results of regulatory examinations, BSA/AML, Fair Lending, Community Reinvestment Act, Home Mortgage Disclosure, and Regulation O issues; (iv) whistleblower procedures and monitoring; (v) benefit plan fund management; (vi) critical accounting policies; (vii) assessment of the impact of new accounting guidance; (viii) compliance with the internal controls required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and COSO's Internal Control â€“ Integrated Framework 2013; (ix) compliance with Company Code of Conduct and Ethics programs; (x) risk management initiatives and controls; (xi) the appropriateness of loan loss reserves and methodology; (xii) significant legal matters; (xiii) insider and related party transactions; and (xiv) Service Organization Control engagements.

Additionally, the Audit Committee discussed with the Company's internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plan for their respective audits. The Audit Committee met with the internal and independent auditors, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting.
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

FEES PAID TO PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANTS
The following table represents aggregate fees, including out-of-pocket expenses, paid or to be paid to Ernst & Young for the 2018 and 2017 fiscal years.
Audit Fees primarily represent amounts billed to us for auditing our annual consolidated financial statements (including services incurred with rendering an opinion under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002), HUD Audits, reviewing the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and for services that are normally provided by the auditor in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. Audit-Related Fees include fees for certain attestation engagements and employee benefit audits. Tax Fees are fees related to tax planning and preparation of trust tax returns. Tax Fees include $43,256 and $33,768 for tax compliance services in 2018 and 2017, respectively. All Other Fees are related to a subscription to an online accounting research tool. Total 2018 and 2017 fees include $66,937 and $65,947 in out-of-pocket expenses, respectively.
POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NONAUDIT SERVICES OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
The Audit Committee's policy is to pre-approve all audit and nonaudit services provided by the independent auditors. These services may include audit services, audit-related services, tax services, and other services. Pre-approval is generally provided for up to 12 months from the date of pre-approval, and any pre-approval is detailed as to the particular service or category of services and is generally subject to a specific budget. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members when expedition of services is necessary. The independent auditors and management are required to periodically report to the full Audit Committee regarding the extent of services provided by the independent auditors in accordance with this pre-approval policy and the fees for the services performed to date. The Audit Committee pre-approved all audit and nonaudit services provided by Ernst & Young.
The Audit Committee has determined that the nonaudit services provided by Ernst & Young during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were compatible with maintaining their independence.

SHARE OWNERSHIP
SECTION 16(A) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended requires our directors and executive officers, and parties owning beneficially more than 10% of our common stock, to file reports with the SEC to reflect their interests in our common stock. Copies of these reports must be furnished to us.
Based solely upon on a review of these reports received by us for 2018 and any written representations from reporting persons, we believe that during 2018 each required Section 16(a) report for 2018 was filed on time other than: E. Drew Mitchell â€“ one report for two transactions; Douglas W. Smith â€“ one report for two transactions; the Estate of Robert Hill Smith â€“ one report for five transactions; William G. Smith, Jr. â€“ one report for one transaction; J. Kimbrough Davis â€“ one report for one transaction; and Laura L. Johnson â€“ one report for one transaction. These late reports, other than Ms. Johnson's report, related to transactions in connection with the final settlement of the Estate of Robert Hill Smith and which were reported late due to administrative oversight.

Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    37
PROXY STATEMENT â€“ GENERAL INFORMATION
Why did I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail instead of a paper copy of the Proxy Materials?
This year, we are again pleased to be using the SEC rule that allows companies to furnish their Proxy Materials over the Internet. As a result, we are mailing to our shareowners a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instead of a paper copy of the Proxy Materials. In past years, some of our shareowners received a paper copy of the Proxy Materials. This year, however, no shareowner will receive a paper copy of the Proxy Materials by mail unless you request it. All shareowners will have the ability to access the Proxy Materials over the Internet.
Why didn't I receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail?
We are providing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by e-mail to those shareowners who have previously elected delivery of the Proxy Materials electronically. Those shareowners should have received an e-mail containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website.
How can I access the Proxy Materials over the Internet?
Your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card will contain instructions on how to:
Choosing to access your future Proxy Materials electronically will help us conserve natural resources and reduce the costs of printing and distributing our Proxy Materials. If you choose to access future Proxy Materials electronically, you will receive an e-mail with instructions containing a link to the website where those materials are available and a link to the proxy voting website. Your election to receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by e-mail will remain in effect until you terminate it.
How may I obtain a paper copy of the Proxy Materials?
To obtain a paper copy of the Proxy Materials, please follow the instructions contained on your Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials.
What is being voted upon?
You are being asked to vote on two Class III nominees for election to the Board of Directors and to ratify our appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for 2019. None of the proposals will create appraisal or dissenters' rights.
How does the Board recommend that I vote?
Our Board recommends that you vote your shares as follows:
Could other matters be decided at the Annual Meeting?
We are not aware of any matters to be presented at the Annual Meeting other than those referred to in this Proxy Statement. If other matters are properly presented at the Annual Meeting, the holders of the proxies (those persons named on your proxy card) will have the discretion to vote on those matters for you.
38   Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement
How many votes does each share have?
Each share has one vote. For the proposals scheduled to be voted upon at the Annual Meeting, withheld votes on directors, abstentions, and shares held by a broker that the broker fails to vote are all counted to determine a quorum, but are not counted for or against the matters being considered; however, pursuant to our Bylaws, if a director nominee in an uncontested election does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board, as described under the heading "Corporate Governance - Director Elections." There is no cumulative voting.
How many votes are required to have a quorum?
In order for us to conduct the Annual Meeting, a majority of the shares entitled to vote must be present in person or by proxy.
How many votes are required to elect directors and to ratify Ernst & Young's appointment?
Directors are elected (Proposal No. 1) by a plurality of the votes cast. "Plurality" means that the nominees receiving the largest number of votes cast are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors who are nominated to be elected at the meeting. At our Annual Meeting, the maximum number of directors to be elected is four. Although our directors are elected by plurality, our Bylaws provide that if a director nominee in an uncontested election does not receive at least a majority of the votes cast at any meeting for the election of directors at which a quorum is present, the director must tender his or her resignation to the Board. Votes withheld have no legal effect.
Ernst & Young's appointment (Proposal No. 2) will be ratified if the affirmative votes cast by the shareowners present or represented at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the matter exceed the votes cast in opposition.
What is the difference between holding shares as a shareowner of record and as a beneficial owner?
Many of our shareowners hold their shares through a broker, trustee or other nominee rather than directly in their own name. As summarized below, there are some distinctions between shares held of record and those shares owned beneficially.
How will my voting instructions be treated?
If you provide specific voting instructions, your shares will be voted as instructed.
If you hold shares as the shareowner of record and sign and return a proxy card or vote by telephone or Internet without giving specific voting instructions, then your shares will be voted as recommended by our Board of Directors.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee, or other nominee, and that nominee has discretion to vote your shares on a particular proposal and you do not give instructions to that nominee on how you want your shares voted, then generally your nominee can vote your shares on certain "routine" matters. At our Annual Meeting, only Proposal No. 2 to ratify the Company's auditors is considered routine, which means that your broker, trustee, or other nominee can vote your shares on Proposal No. 2 if you do not timely provide instructions to vote your shares.
If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee, or other nominee, and that nominee does not have discretion to vote your shares on a particular proposal and you do not give your broker instructions on how to vote your shares, then the votes will be considered broker nonvotes. A "broker nonvote" will be treated as unvoted for purposes of determining approval for the proposal and will have the effect of neither a vote for nor a vote against the proposal.
Capital City Bank Group, Inc. | Notice of Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement    39
Can I change my vote?
If you are a shareowner of record, you may revoke your proxy by submitting a later proxy or by written request received by our Corporate Secretary before the Annual Meeting. You may also revoke your proxy at the Annual Meeting and vote in person. If you are the beneficial owner of shares held through a broker, trustee, or other nominee, you should review the information provided to you by the holder of record that explains how to revoke previously given instructions.
Who pays for soliciting proxies?
Proxies will be solicited from our shareowners by mail or e-mail. We will pay all expenses in connection with the solicitation, including postage, printing and handling, and the expenses incurred by brokers, custodians, nominees and fiduciaries in forwarding proxy material to beneficial owners. We may hire Alliance Advisors, LLC to assist in the distribution and solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $12,000, plus reasonable expenses. It is possible that our directors and officers and other associates may make further solicitations personally or by telephone, mail, or e-mail. Our directors and officers and other associates will receive no additional compensation for any such further solicitations.
What does it mean if I get more than one Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or more than one paper copy of the Proxy Materials?
You will receive a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or proxy card for each account you have. Please vote proxies for all accounts to ensure that all your shares are voted.
Where can I find voting results of the Annual Meeting?
We will announce preliminary voting results at the Annual Meeting and publish preliminary, and if available, final voting results in a current report on Form 8-K filed within four business days after our Annual Meeting.

OTHER MATTERS
ANNUAL REPORT
We filed an annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 on Form 10-K with the SEC. Shareowners may obtain, free of charge, a copy of our annual report. Requests should be directed to our Corporate Secretary, Capital City Bank Group, Inc., 217 North Monroe Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32301.
shareowners sharing the same address
We have adopted a procedure approved by the SEC known as "householding." Under this procedure, shareowners of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery or in notice and access will receive only one set of Proxy Materials, unless one or more of these shareowners notifies our transfer agent that they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure will reduce our printing costs and postage fees. If you wish to receive your own copy of these materials, you may contact our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in writing, by telephone, or on the Internet:
If you are eligible for householding, but you and other shareowners of record with whom you share an address currently receive multiple copies of our Notice of Annual Meeting, Proxy Statement, and Annual Report, or if you hold stock in more than one account, and in either case you wish to receive only a single copy of each document for your household, please contact our transfer agent as indicated above. Beneficial owners can request information about householding from their banks, brokers, or other holders of record.
SHAREOWNER PROPOSALS
Shareowner proposals that are to be included in the Proxy Statement for the 2020 meeting must be received by November 9, 2019. Shareowner proposals for the 2020 meeting that are not intended to be included in the Proxy Statement for that meeting must be received by January 23, 2020, or the Board of Directors can vote the proxies in its discretion on the proposal. Proposals must comply with the proxy rules and be submitted in writing to J. Kimbrough Davis, Corporate Secretary, at our principal offices.
DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS
Any shareowner entitled to vote generally in the election of directors may recommend a candidate for nomination as a director. A shareowner may recommend a director nominee by submitting the name and qualifications of the candidate the shareowner wishes to recommend, pursuant to Article VII of our Articles of Incorporation, to Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee of the Board of Directors, c/o Capital City Bank Group, Inc., 217 North Monroe Street, Tallahassee, Florida 32301. To be considered, recommendations with respect to an election of directors to be held at an annual meeting must be received no earlier than 180 days and no later than 120 days prior to March 8, 2020, the first anniversary of this year's Notice of Annual Meeting date. In other words, director nominations must be received no earlier than September 10, 2019, and no later than November 9, 2019. Recommendations with respect to an election of directors to be held at a special meeting called for that purpose must be received by the 10th day following the date on which notice of the special meeting was first mailed to shareowners. Recommendations meeting these requirements will be brought to the attention of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. Candidates for director recommended by shareowners are afforded the same consideration as candidates for director identified by our directors, executive officers, or search firms, if any, employed by us.
