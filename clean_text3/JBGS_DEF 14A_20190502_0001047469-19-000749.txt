   VOTING MATTERS 
       Shareholders are being asked to vote on the following matters at the Annual Meeting: 
   OUR BUSINESS AND FORMATION 
      The Company         
       JBG SMITH Properties is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that owns, operates, invests in and develops real estate assets concentrated in leading urban infill submarkets in and around Washington, DC. We own and operate a portfolio of high-quality office and multifamily assets, many of which are amenitized with ancillary retail. Our third-party real estate services business provides fee-based real estate services to our real estate ventures, legacy funds formerly organized by The JBG Companies® ("JBG Legacy Funds") and other third parties. 
      2018 Business Performance Highlights         
       In 2018, we achieved several significant accomplishments, including: 
       In addition, our 2018 total shareholder return ("TSR"), as described in the section titled "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Executive Compensation Program — 2018 Annual Equity Grants," significantly exceeded that of our peer group.       Executive Compensation

   CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS 
       Our corporate governance is structured in a manner that the Board of Trustees (the "Board") believes closely aligns the Company's interests with those of our shareholders. 
       In early 2018, the Board adopted and implemented several significant governance changes. These changes were initiated by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, which commenced a review and analysis of the Company's corporate governance provisions. As part of this process the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reviewed industry best practices, comparable governance provisions both within and outside of the public real estate industry and also included input that management proactively obtained from the corporate governance and stewardship units of some of the Company's largest shareholders. This comprehensive review and analysis enabled the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee to evaluate the Company's corporate governance elections. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee considered proposed changes with two overarching principles in mind: (i) that governance of a public company by the majority of its shareholders is fair, and (ii) that the Company should align itself with the governance practices of corporate America generally, not just REITs. Based on its review and analysis our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, together with management, recommended to our Board, and our Board approved, the following shareholder-aligned changes to our governance structure:
       While the foregoing governance changes were implemented in 2018, our Board and its Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee remain attentive to and focused on shareholder alignment and intend to continue to follow the two principals described above regarding majority rule and governance practices of corporate America generally when considering the corporate governance of our Company.

       Notable features of our corporate governance structure include the following:

       PROXY STATEMENT         
    QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE ANNUAL MEETING         
      Why am I receiving this Proxy Statement?         
       This Proxy Statement is furnished by the Board of Trustees (the "Board") of JBG SMITH Properties in connection with the Board's solicitation of proxies for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Shareholders of JBG SMITH Properties (the "Annual Meeting") to be held on Thursday, May 2, 2019 at 8:30 a.m., local time, at our at our corporate headquarters located at 4445 Willard Avenue, Suite 400, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, and at any adjournments or postponements thereof. This Proxy Statement first will be made available to shareholders on or about February 27, 2019. 
       We maintain a website at www.jbgsmith.com. Information on or accessible through our website is not and should not be considered part of this Proxy Statement. 
       Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this Proxy Statement to "JBG SMITH," "we," "our," "us" and the "Company" refer to JBG SMITH Properties, a Maryland real estate investment trust ("REIT"), together with its consolidated subsidiaries. References to our "formation transaction" refer to our separation from Vornado Realty Trust ("Vornado") and subsequent acquisition of the management business and certain assets of The JBG Companies® ("JBG") to become an independent publicly traded company. Following the formation transaction, JBG SMITH became an independent, publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "JBGS". 
      Why did I not automatically receive a paper copy of the Proxy Statement, proxy card and Annual Report?         
       Pursuant to rules adopted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), we have elected to provide access to our proxy materials via the Internet. Accordingly, rather than paper copies of our proxy materials, we are sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Proxy Notice") to our shareholders that provides instructions on how to access our proxy materials on the Internet. Shareholders may follow the instructions in the Proxy Notice to elect to receive future proxy materials in print by mail or electronically by email.  Table of Contents
      What am I being asked to vote on?         
       You are being asked to vote on the following proposals: 
       Our Board knows of no other matters to be brought before the Annual Meeting. 
      What are the Board's voting recommendations?         
       The Board recommends that you vote as follows:
      Who is entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting?         
       The close of business on February 26, 2019 has been fixed as the record date (the "Record Date") for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive notice of and to vote at the Annual Meeting. Only holders of record of our common shares of beneficial interest ("common shares") as of the close of business on the Record Date, or their duly appointed proxies, are entitled to receive notice of, to attend, and to vote at the Annual Meeting. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and you must obtain a proxy from your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, trustee or nominee, giving you the right to vote the shares at the Annual Meeting. On the Record Date, our outstanding voting securities consisted of 122,593,995 common shares. 
      What are the voting rights of shareholders?         
       Each common share is entitled to one vote on each matter to be voted. Votes in the election of trustees may not be cumulated. 
      How do I vote?         
       If your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent, American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, you are considered the shareholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Proxy Notice was sent directly to you by us. In that case, if you choose not to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, you may instruct the proxy holders named in the proxy card how to vote your common shares in one of the following ways:  Table of Contents
       If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Proxy Notice was forwarded to you by that organization. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. If you choose not to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person, you should instruct your broker or nominee how to vote your shares by following the voting instructions provided by your broker or nominee. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a vote instruction form for this purpose. 
       Of course, you always may choose to attend the Annual Meeting and vote your shares in person. If you do attend the Annual Meeting and have already submitted a proxy, you may withdraw your proxy and vote in person. 
      How are proxy card votes counted?         
       Proxies submitted properly via one of the methods discussed above will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained therein. If the proxy is submitted but voting directions are not made, the proxy will be voted "FOR" each of the four trustee nominees, "FOR" approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement, and "FOR" ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, and in such manner as the proxy holders named on the proxy (the "Proxy Agents"), in their discretion, determine upon such other business as may properly come before the Annual Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 
       If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, under applicable rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") (the exchange on which our common shares are traded), the brokers will vote your shares according to the specific instructions they receive from you. If brokers that hold our common shares for a beneficial owner do not receive voting instructions from that owner at least 10 days prior to the Annual Meeting, the broker may vote only on the proposal if it is considered a "routine" matter under the NYSE's rules. On "non-routine" matters, brokers do not have discretionary voting power and cannot vote without instructions from the beneficial owners, resulting in a so-called "broker non-vote." Pursuant to the rules of the NYSE, the election of trustees and the Say-on-Pay proposals each are "non-routine" matters, and brokerage firms may not vote on these matters without instructions from their clients, resulting in broker non-votes. In contrast, ratification of the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm is considered a "routine" matter under NYSE's rules, which means that brokers have discretionary voting authority to the extent they have not received voting instructions from their client on the matter. 
      How many votes are needed for the proposals to pass?         
       The proposals to be voted on at the Annual Meeting have the following voting requirements:  Table of Contents
"FOR" votes will be elected. There is no cumulative voting in the election of trustees. For purposes of the election of trustees, abstentions, votes marked "WITHHOLD" and other shares not voted (whether by broker non-vote or otherwise) will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. However, both abstentions and broker non-votes will count toward the presence of a quorum.  
      What will constitute a quorum at the Annual Meeting?         
       Holders representing a majority of all votes of our outstanding common shares entitled to be cast at the Annual Meeting must be present, in person or by proxy, for a quorum to exist. If the shares present in person or by proxy at the Annual Meeting do not constitute a quorum, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned to a subsequent time.

      Will any other matters be voted on?

      Can I change my vote after I have voted?

    PROPOSAL ONE: ELECTION OF TRUSTEES         
       The Board has set the number of trustees at 12. We currently have a classified board, but will transition to an unclassified board by our 2020 Annual Meeting. Our declaration of trust divides our Board into three classes. The terms of the first and third classes expire at our 2020 Annual Meeting, and the current term of the second class expires at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Shareholders elect only one class of trustees each year. The trustee nominees for election by shareholders at this Annual Meeting will serve a one-year term, which will expire at the 2020 Annual Meeting. Commencing with the 2020 Annual Meeting, each trustee will be elected annually for a term of one year and shall hold office until the next succeeding annual meeting and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. There is no cumulative voting in the election of trustees. 
       At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the first class of trustees was elected to serve on our Board until our 2020 Annual Meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. The four individuals designated below as Class II Trustee Nominees, each of whom currently serves on our Board, have been recommended by our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and nominated by our Board to serve on the Board until our 2020 Annual Meeting and until their respective successors are elected and qualify. Based on its review of the relationships between the trustees and the Company, the Board has determined that all of our trustees, except Steven Roth, Mitchell N. Schear, Michael J. Glosserman, W. Matthew Kelly, and Robert A. Stewart, are independent under applicable SEC and NYSE rules.

For additional information on other governance provisions mandated by the Master Transaction Agreement, see "Corporate Governance and Board Matters — Corporate Governance Profile." 
       The Board has no reason to believe that any of the persons named below as a nominee for our Board will be unable, or will decline, to serve as a member of the Board if elected. If any nominee is unavailable for election or service, the Board may designate a substitute nominee, and the Proxy Agents will vote for the substitute nominee recommended by the Board. Under these circumstances, the Board also may, as permitted by our bylaws, decrease the size of the Board. 
       The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has set forth a written policy including minimum qualifications that a trustee candidate must possess. In addition, the written policy sets forth certain additional qualities and skills that, while not a prerequisite for nomination, should be considered by the Committee when evaluating a particular candidate. See "Corporate Governance and Board Matters — Trustee Nominee Selection Process."

    PROPOSAL TWO: ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION         
       Pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), our shareholders are entitled to cast a non-binding advisory vote at the Annual Meeting to approve the compensation of our named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SEC's compensation disclosure rules, including the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this Proxy Statement, the compensation tables and accompanying narrative disclosures. We refer to this as our "Say-on-Pay" vote. While this Say-on-Pay vote is an advisory vote that is not binding on the Company or the Board, we value the views of our shareholders, and the Board's Compensation Committee, which administers our executive compensation program, will consider the outcome of the vote when making future compensation decisions. The Board has adopted a policy, which shareholders approved by a non-binding advisory vote, of providing for an annual Say-on-Pay vote. 
       The primary objectives of our executive compensation are to (1) align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders; (2) attract and retain the highest caliber executives in our industry; and (3) motivate executives to achieve corporate performance objectives as well as individual goals. To fulfill these objectives, we have an executive compensation program that includes three major elements—base salary, annual bonus incentives and long-term equity incentives, which may include stock options, restricted shares or partnership unit awards and performance-based equity awards. When determining the overall compensation of our named executive officers, including base salaries and annual bonus incentives and long-term equity incentives amounts, the Compensation Committee considers a number of factors it deems important, including:
       The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee independent trustees responsible for the overall design and administration of our executive compensation programs. For a more detailed description of the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee, see "Corporate Governance and Board Matters—Committees of the Board — Compensation Committee." 
       We believe that our executive compensation program achieves our compensation objectives. Accordingly, we ask our shareholders to vote "FOR" the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
       "RESOLVED, that the Company's shareholders approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and narrative discussion in this Proxy Statement." 
Vote Required and Recommendation  
       The affirmative vote of a majority of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting is required for approval, on a non-binding advisory basis, of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this Proxy Statement. For purposes of approving this Proposal Two, abstentions and other shares not voted (whether by broker non-vote or otherwise) will not be counted as votes cast and will have no effect on the result of the vote. 
THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES RECOMMENDS A VOTE "FOR" APPROVAL OF THE  COMPENSATION OF OUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. Table of Contents

The Audit Committee reviewed the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 with Deloitte & Touche LLP, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of those audited financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles, its judgments as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles and such other matters as are required to be discussed with the Audit Committee under generally accepted auditing standards and those matters required to be discussed by applicable standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Standard No. 1301, Communications with Audit Committees. 
       Deloitte & Touche LLP has provided to the Audit Committee the written disclosures and letter regarding its independence required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, and the Audit Committee has discussed with Deloitte & Touche LLP its independence. 
       In reliance on the review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board the inclusion of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. 
The Audit Committee Report above does not constitute "soliciting material" and will not be deemed "filed" or incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that might incorporate SEC filings by reference, in whole or in part, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in those filings.

    CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND BOARD MATTERS         
      Corporate Governance Profile         
       Our corporate governance is structured in a manner that the Board believes closely aligns the Company's interests with those of our shareholders. Notable features of our corporate governance structure include the following:
       Our declaration of trust and bylaws provide that the number of trustees constituting the Board may be increased or decreased by a majority vote of the entire Board, provided the number of trustees may not be greater than 15 and may not be decreased to fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL, which currently is one trustee. The tenure of office of a trustee will not be affected by any decrease in the number of trustees.  Table of Contents
       Our bylaws currently provide that, except as may be provided by our Board in setting the terms of any class or series of shares, any vacancy may be filled only by a majority of the remaining trustees, even if the remaining trustees do not constitute a quorum, and any trustee elected to fill a vacancy will hold office for the remainder of the full term of the trusteeship in which the vacancy occurred and until a successor is duly elected and qualifies. 
       There are no family relationships among our executive officers and trustees. All trustees except Steven Roth, Mitchell N. Schear, Michael J. Glosserman, W. Matthew Kelly, and Robert A. Stewart have been determined by the Board to be independent under applicable NYSE and SEC rules. 
   Shareholder Engagement  
       We believe engaging with our shareholders on a regular basis is important because a complex, long-term strategy like ours requires detailed explanation. In particular, our large development pipeline and placemaking strategy using office, multifamily and retail assets distinguishes our business from other REITs. In addition, Amazon's recent selection of our holdings in National Landing in Arlington, Virginia for a second headquarters has created significant new opportunities for our Company. 
       Our goal is to interact with the investment community on a quarterly basis through a variety of channels including: our quarterly investor package comprising our management letter and detailed financial supplement which we believe facilitate productive and efficient engagement with investors; participation in various industry conferences, non-deal roadshows and sell-side analyst tours; and regular investor days in Washington, DC. 
       Specifically, in 2018, in addition to publishing our quarterly investor package, we:
   Time-Limited Governance Provisions in Connection with our Formation Transaction  
       Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, Vornado and JBG each appointed six of our 12 trustees. Our bylaws name Scott A. Estes, Alan S. Forman, Michael J. Glosserman, W. Matthew Kelly, Ellen Shuman and Robert A. Stewart as JBG Board Designees and Charles E. Haldeman, Jr., Carol A. Melton, William J. Mulrow, Steven Roth, Mitchell N. Schear and John F. Wood as Vornado Board Designees. The Master Transaction Agreement and our bylaws require that, for a period of two years following our formation transaction (i.e., until July 18, 2019), if any Vornado Board Designee or JBG Board Designee is unable or unwilling to serve or is otherwise no longer serving as a trustee, then the remaining Vornado Board Designees or JBG Board Designees, respectively, may designate a replacement designee reasonably satisfactory to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board, who shall promptly be appointed by our Board to fill the vacancy. Further, during the same period, to the extent practicable, the membership of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall consist of an equal number of Vornado Board Designees and JBG Board Designees (or their respective replacement designees).

   Core Competencies and Diversity of Our Trustees  
       Our Board has deep experience in the public markets and strong capital allocation credentials. While maintaining these strengths, we believe our Board should evolve in a direction that reflects the strength and diversity of our national labor force. Our Board has made a long-term commitment to establish an equal balance between men and women and one that reflects the diversity of our country. These goals will not be achieved overnight, but they are deeply important to us, and we are committed to them over the long term. 
       The following charts summarize diversity and core competencies currently represented on our Board. The details of each trustee's competencies are included in each trustee's biography. 
      Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability         
       By fully integrating environmental sustainability, social responsibility, and strong governance practices throughout our organization, we believe we can enhance our communities and conserve resources while growing shareholder value. We remain committed to transparency in our investment strategy with a focus on operating efficiency, responding to evolving trends, and addressing the needs of our tenants and communities. 
       Selected Sustainability Program and other achievements are summarized below. We maintain a website at https://www.jbgsmith.com/about/sustainability. Information on or accessible through our website is not and should not be considered part of this Proxy Statement. 25

      Board Leadership Structure         
       Our Board recognizes that one of its key responsibilities is to evaluate and determine its optimal leadership structure to provide independent oversight of management. The Board understands that there is no single generally accepted approach to providing Board leadership, and the appropriate Board leadership structure may vary as circumstances warrant. Consistent with this understanding, the independent trustees periodically consider the Board's leadership structure. Currently, the roles of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board are held by different trustees. W. Matthew Kelly has served as Chief Executive Officer and Steven Roth has served as Chairman since our formation transaction. The Board believes that this structure provides the appropriate balance between the authority of those who oversee the Company and those who manage it on a day-to-day basis. The Chairman presides at all meetings of the shareholders and of the Board as a whole. The Chairman performs such other duties, and exercises such powers, as from time to time shall be prescribed in the bylaws or by the Board. 
       Although not applicable now, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that if the Chairman is an executive officer of the Company, then the Board will have a Lead Trustee, who shall be a non-management trustee. The Lead Trustee will be selected on an annual basis by a majority of the non-management trustees then serving on the Board. When the Chairman is not a non-management trustee, we believe the Lead Trustee position strengthens the role of our independent trustees and encourages independent Board leadership. The responsibilities of the Lead Trustee include, among others:
      Executive Sessions         
       Our non-management trustees met in special executive sessions without management at each of our in-person Board meetings, which occurred in March, May, August and November of 2018. Steven Roth, as Chairman, chaired the sessions. Per our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board expects to conduct executive sessions limited to non-management trustees at each of our regularly scheduled Board meetings, and at least annually will hold an executive session limited to independent trustees. Additionally, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that the Chairman shall preside over these sessions. 
      Attendance of Trustees at 2018 Board and Committee Meetings and Annual Meeting of Shareholders         
       The Board held a total of six meetings during 2018. Each trustee attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and all committees thereof on which such trustee served during 2018. 
       In accordance with the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines, trustees are expected to attend the annual meeting of shareholders. All trustees attended our 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Table of Contents
      Committees of the Board         
       Our Board has three standing committees: an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The principal functions of each committee are briefly described below. Each committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board, which are available on our website at  www.jbgsmith.com. 
       The table below provides membership information for each of the Board committees as of the date of this Proxy Statement. Each committee is composed exclusively of independent trustees, in accordance with NYSE rules. In addition, our bylaws and the Master Transaction Agreement require that, for the two years following the formation transaction (until July 18, 2019), to the extent practicable, the membership of each of the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee shall consist of an equal number of Vornado Board Designees and JBG Board Designees (or their respective replacement designees). 
   Audit Committee  
       Scott A. Estes (chair), Charles E. Haldeman, Jr. and William J. Mulrow comprise the Audit Committee.

       The Audit Committee's principal purposes are to (i) oversee the accounting and financial reporting processes of the Company and the audits of the Company's financial statements and (ii) prepare an Audit Committee report as required by the SEC for inclusion in our annual proxy statement.

The Audit Committee also approves the Audit Committee report required by SEC regulations to be included in our annual proxy statement. 
       The Audit Committee shall consist of no fewer than three members, and at least one member of the Audit Committee must qualify as a "financial expert" as defined by the SEC. The Board has determined that Mr. Estes is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined by the applicable SEC regulations and NYSE corporate governance listing standards and has accounting or related financial management expertise.

      Trustee Nominee Selection Process         
       The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee has set forth in a written policy the minimum qualifications that trustee candidates must possess. At a minimum, a trustee candidate must possess:
       In addition to these minimum qualifications, the written policy sets forth certain additional qualities and skills that, while not a prerequisite for nomination, should be considered by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee when evaluating a particular candidate. These additional qualities and skills include, among others, the following:
       The Board does not have a formal policy specifying how diversity of background and personal experience should be applied in identifying or evaluating trustee candidates. A trustee candidate's background and personal experience, however, will be significant in the Board's candidate identification and evaluation process to help ensure that the Board remains aware of and responsive to the needs and interests of our customers, shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.  Table of Contents
       The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will seek to identify trustee candidates based on input provided by a number of sources, including (a) members of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, (b) trustees of the Company and (c) any other party deemed appropriate by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, including shareholders. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also has the authority to consult with or retain advisors or search firms to assist in the identification of qualified trustee candidates; however, we do not currently employ a search firm, or pay a fee to any other third party, to locate qualified trustee candidates. 
       As part of the candidate identification process, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will evaluate the skills, expertise and diversity possessed by the current Board, and whether there are additional skills, expertise or diversity that should be added to complement the composition of the existing Board. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee also will consider the Company's bylaws, the number of trustees expected to be elected at the next annual meeting of shareholders (taking into account trustees whose terms are expiring at the next shareholders' meeting) and whether existing trustees have indicated a willingness to continue to serve as trustees if re-nominated. Once trustee candidates have been identified, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee then will evaluate each candidate in light of his or her qualifications and credentials, and any additional factors that the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee deems necessary or appropriate. Existing trustees who are being considered for re-nomination will be re-evaluated as part of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee's process of recommending trustee candidates. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee evaluates the performance of each current trustee and considers the results of such evaluation when determining whether to recommend the nomination of such trustee for an additional term. All candidates submitted by shareholders will be evaluated in the same manner as all other trustee candidates, provided that the advance notice and other requirements set forth in our bylaws have been followed. At an appropriate time prior to each annual meeting at which trustees are to be elected or re-elected, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommends to the Board for nomination by the Board such candidates as the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in the exercise of its judgment, has found to be well-qualified and willing and available to serve. 
       At an appropriate time after a vacancy arises on the Board or a trustee advises the Board of his or her intention to resign, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will recommend to the Board for election by the Board to fill such vacancy, such prospective member of the Board as the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, in the exercise of its judgment, has found to be well-qualified and willing and available to serve. In determining whether a prospective member is qualified to serve, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will consider the factors listed above. As required by the Master Transaction Agreement and our bylaws, for a period of two years following our formation transaction (i.e., until July 18, 2019), if any Vornado Board Designee or JBG Board Designee is unable or unwilling to serve or is otherwise no longer serving as a trustee, then the remaining Vornado Board Designees or JBG Board Designees, respectively, may designate a replacement designee reasonably satisfactory to the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board, who shall promptly be appointed by our Board to fill the vacancy. 
      Board Oversight of Risk Management         
       One of the key functions of our Board is informed oversight of our risk management process. Our Board administers this oversight function directly, with support from its three standing committees, the Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee, each of which addresses risks specific to their respective areas of oversight as follows:  Table of Contents
Committee also monitors compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and oversees the performance of our internal audit function.  
       Our Board and its standing committees also receive reports from the members of management responsible for the matters considered to enable our Board and each committee to understand and discuss risk identification and risk management. 
       The Board believes that the composition of its committees, and the distribution of the particular expertise of each committee's members, makes this an appropriate structure to monitor effectively the risks discussed above. 
      Corporate Governance Guidelines         
       The Board has adopted a set of Corporate Governance Guidelines that reflects the Board's commitment to monitoring the effectiveness of decision-making at the Board and management level and ensuring adherence to good corporate governance principles, all with the goal of enhancing shareholder value over the long term. The Corporate Governance Guidelines are subject to periodic review by the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee. The Corporate Governance Guidelines address, among other things:

      Company Policies         
   Share Ownership Guidelines  
       We believe that equity ownership by our trustees and named executive officers helps align their interests with our shareholders' interests and therefore have adopted share ownership guidelines applicable to all of our trustees and executive officers. On an annual basis, we evaluate the ownership status of the trustees and executive officers. 
       The Chief Executive Officer is required to own equity securities of the Company equal in value to at least six times his annual base salary and each other executive officer is required to own equity securities of the Company equal in value to at least three times his or her annual base salary. Non-employee trustees are required to own equity securities equal in value to five times their annual cash retainer. Executive officers and trustees must satisfy the ownership requirements within five years of when they became subject to the policy, which was adopted on August 10, 2017. 
       The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee may waive the share ownership requirements in the event of a severe hardship or in circumstances in which compliance would prevent the participant from complying with a court order. 
   Hedging and Pledging of Company Securities  
       Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits our trustees and employees, including our named executive officers, from engaging in the following transactions: (i) trading in call or put options involving our securities and other derivative securities; (ii) engaging in short sales of our securities; (iii) holding our securities in a margin account; (iv) all forms of hedging or monetization transactions, such as zero-cost collars and forward sale contracts; and (v) pledging our securities to secure margins or other loans, subject to limited exceptions. 
   Board Self-Evaluation  
       Pursuant to the Company's Corporate Governance Guidelines and the charters of the Compensation, Audit and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committees, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will oversee the annual self-evaluation of the Board and each committee. The self-evaluation will include presentations to the Board by each committee chairperson, and may, if deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board, include reviews and/or presentations by the Company's independent advisors, including its legal counsel and independent auditing firm. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee reports the assessments to the Board, and if the Board determines that changes in its governance practices need to be made, management and the  Table of Contents
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will work with the Board to implement the necessary changes. 
   Clawback Policy  
       Pursuant to the Company's Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy, in the event of a restatement of the Company's financial results (other than a restatement caused by a change in applicable accounting rules or interpretations), the result of which is that any performance-based compensation paid to certain of our executive officers would have been a lower amount had it been calculated based on such restated results, the Board, or the Compensation Committee if such authority is delegated by the Board, shall review such performance-based compensation. If the Board determines that the executive officer engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct which materially contributed to the need for a restatement, the committee may seek to recover from the executive the pre-tax portion of the difference between the performance-based compensation actually paid and the amount that would have been paid had the performance-based compensation been calculated based on the restated financial statements for the three-year period prior to the restatement. 
      Communications with the Board         
       The Chairman, or the Lead Trustee if the Chairman is an executive officer of the Company, will serve as the communication conduit for third parties who wish to communicate with the Board. Shareholders and other interested parties may communicate with the Board or specified individual trustees by sending written correspondence to the "Chairman" or "Lead Trustee" c/o the Chief Legal Officer of JBG SMITH Properties, 4445 Willard Avenue, Suite 400, Chevy Chase, MD 20815, who will then directly forward such correspondence to the Chairman or Lead Trustee, as applicable. The Chairman or Lead Trustee will decide what action should be taken with respect to the communication, including whether such communication should be reported to the full Board. 
      Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation         
       No member of the Compensation Committee is or ever has been an officer or employee of the Company, and no member of the Compensation Committee had any relationships during 2018 requiring disclosure by us under the SEC's rules requiring disclosure of certain relationships and related-party transactions. No executive officer serves as a member of a board of trustees or compensation committee, or other committee serving an equivalent function, of any other entity that has one or more of its executive officers serving as a member of the Board or Compensation Committee. Accordingly, during 2018 there were no interlocks with other companies within the meaning of the SEC's proxy rules. 
      EXECUTIVE OFFICERS         
       The following table sets forth certain information regarding our executive officers.

    COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS         
       This Compensation Discussion and Analysis discusses the principles underlying our policies and decisions with respect to the compensation of our named executive officers. Specifically, this section provides an overview of our executive compensation philosophy, the overall objectives of our executive compensation program and each compensation component that we provide. Each of the key elements of our executive compensation program is discussed in more detail below. The following discussion should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures appearing later in this Proxy Statement. 
       This section presents information concerning compensation arrangements for our named executive officers for 2018. Compensation decisions for our named executive officers are made by the Compensation Committee. 
       For the year ended 2018, our named executive officers and their titles were as follows: 
      Executive Summary         
       Our Compensation Committee administers our executive compensation programs. 
   2018 Business Performance Highlights  
       In 2018, we achieved several significant accomplishments, including: 
      Executive Compensation Philosophy and Objectives         
       The primary objectives of our executive compensation are to (1) align the interests of our executives with those of our shareholders; (2) attract and retain the highest caliber executives in our industry; and (3) motivate executives to achieve corporate performance objectives as well as individual goals. To fulfill these objectives, we have an executive compensation program that includes three major  Table of Contents elements—base salary, annual bonus incentives and long-term equity incentives, which may include stock options, restricted shares or partnership unit awards and performance-based equity awards. Other than the employment agreements and equity incentive plan, which are described below, we have not adopted any compensation policies, procedures or plans with respect to named executive officer compensation. 
       The cornerstones of our executive compensation program that help us achieve our objectives include: 
       Holistically, we evaluate our executive pay program and make pay decisions within the context of a total compensation framework to ensure our overall compensation objectives are met. In doing so, we recognize the distinct nature of the individual elements of our pay program but are mindful of the interrelationship of the various components to the successful execution of our overall pay strategy. 
       Our Compensation Committee implemented a program governing incentive compensation payable to our named executive officers for 2018. This program comprised short-term cash and long-term equity-based incentives, and included performance metrics against which short-term incentive compensation was measured.  Table of Contents
       Consistent with our philosophy, we have developed strong compensation practices while avoiding others in pursuit of our compensation objectives. These practices are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

      Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation         
       The Company provides its shareholders annually with the opportunity to cast an advisory vote on executive compensation, and in 2018 approximately 95% of the shares voted were in support of the 2017 compensation of the named executive officers. The Compensation Committee viewed this advisory vote as an expression by the shareholders of their general satisfaction with the Company's executive compensation program. Consistent with the advisory vote of the shareholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the Company will hold advisory votes on executive compensation annually until the next say-on-frequency vote is conducted, which will be no later than 2024. 
      Role of the Compensation Committee and Management         
       The Compensation Committee comprises non-employee independent trustees who are responsible for the overall design and administration of our executive compensation programs. For a more detailed description of the responsibilities of the Compensation Committee, see "Corporate Governance and Board Matters — Committees of the Board — Compensation Committee." 
       When determining the compensation of our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee considers several factors it deems important, including: Table of Contents
       The Compensation Committee may, in its discretion, delegate all or a portion of its duties and responsibilities to a subcommittee of the committee. The Compensation Committee makes compensation decisions for our executive officers after careful review and analysis of appropriate performance information and market compensation data. The Compensation Committee determines the compensation for the Chief Executive Officer. In connection with determining compensation of executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee seeks input from the Company's Chief Executive Officer. Any recommendations given by the Chief Executive Officer will be based upon the Chief Executive Officer's assessment of the Company's overall performance, each executive officer's individual performance, marketplace compensation practices and employee retention considerations. The Compensation Committee reviews the Chief Executive Officer's recommendations, and in its sole discretion determines all executive officer compensation. The Chief Executive Officer will not provide any recommendations to the Compensation Committee regarding his own compensation. 
      Role of the Compensation Consultant         
       For 2018, the Compensation Committee engaged the services of FPL Associates, L.P. ("FPL"), an executive compensation consultant, to provide advice and counsel in carrying out its duties. FPL provided the Compensation Committee with market data on executive pay practices and levels and provided recommendations regarding the structure of executive pay opportunities, equity-based incentives and the equity incentive plan. 
       The Compensation Committee has the sole authority to approve the compensation consultant's fees and terms of its engagement. The Compensation Committee has reviewed its relationship with FPL to ensure that it believes that FPL is independent from management. This review process includes a review of the services FPL provides, the quality of those services, and fees associated with the services during the fiscal year, as well as consideration of the factors impacting independence that are set forth in NYSE rules. 
      Use of Comparative Market Data         
       The Compensation Committee believes that for our compensation to be effective, it must be competitive with other real estate companies with which we may compete for executive talent. The Compensation Committee uses industry peer group data as one element of assessing and determining pay for our executive officers. Peer group data provides an insight into overall market pay levels, market trends, governance practices related to compensation and industry performance. 
       With assistance from FPL, the Compensation Committee undertook a comprehensive review of its peer group of companies with the goal of evaluating the competitiveness of the Company's executive compensation program. The peer group was selected based on various criteria considered by the Compensation Committee, including industry (public REITs, and where appropriate, office, multifamily, and/or diversified REITs), size (defined by total capitalization), having a Washington DC/metropolitan presence, and/or an active development pipeline. As a result of this peer group review and evaluation, while being mindful of best practices for selecting a peer set, the Compensation Committee determined to continue to use the peer group shown below. 
       FPL noted in its peer group recommendation that the Company has two somewhat unique characteristics compared to the peers and broader industry that are not directly captured in its total capitalization: (1) the Company's significant development pipeline adds a degree of complexity that may not be matched at a number of its peers and (2) the Company manages a meaningful funds business which distinguishes it from most other public REITs. 
       The peer group recommended by the compensation consultant and approved by the Compensation Committee consists of 14 public real estate companies. As of September 30, 2018, this peer group had total capitalization ranging from approximately $3.7 billion to $34 billion, with a median of  Table of Contents approximately $7.5 billion. Our total capitalization at that time of approximately $7.2 billion ranked below the median. This peer group comprises the following companies: 
      Changes in Executive Management         
       At the time of the formation transaction in 2017, management expected that certain executives' roles would change once the integration of JBG and Vornado's Washington, DC business was completed in mid-2018. As a result, Brian Coulter, James Iker and Robert Stewart were determined to no longer be executive officers, and M. Moina Banerjee, upon the assumption of additional responsibilities and duties, has been determined to be an executive officer. Mr. Coulter has transitioned from his role as Co-Chief Development Officer to a role as Strategic Advisor, with Mr. Reynolds assuming full responsibility as Chief Development Officer. Mr. Iker continues his role of overseeing the wind down of the JBG Legacy Funds and serving as a voting member of our Investment Committee. Mr. Stewart, while no longer an executive officer, focuses on advising management, serves as a voting member of our Investment Committee and continues to serve as Vice Chairman of our Board of Trustees. 
      Elements of Executive Compensation Program         
       The following is a summary of the elements of and amounts paid under our executive compensation programs for fiscal year 2018. 
        Target Pay Mix.    We believe that the executive management team's compensation should be appropriately at-risk and meaningfully dependent upon the achievement of robust and objective performance requirements. As illustrated below, approximately 85% of the Chief Executive Officer's total direct 2018 compensation and 77.5% of the other named executive officers' total direct 2018 compensation is variable and subject to Company and individual performance results. The share of long-term incentive awards significantly increased this year compared to 2017 because of the special  Table of Contents one-time Amazon equity award, which we do not expect to occur in 2019. See "— Special Amazon Equity Award" below. 
        Annual Base Salary.    Our named executive officers' base salaries represent a fixed level of compensation that is meant to reward them fairly for their value to the Company based on their respective roles and responsibilities. Our named executive officers' base salaries were negotiated as a part of their employment agreements, each of which provides that the officer's annual base salary will be reviewed not less frequently than annually by the Compensation Committee. Pursuant to the employment agreements, the base salary cannot be decreased below the base salary set forth in the table below. When establishing and reviewing base salaries, our Compensation Committee considers each executive's role and responsibility, experience, knowledge, unique skills and future potential with our Company, as well as salary levels for similar positions in our target market and internal pay equity. For 2019, other than Mr. Reynolds, our named executive officers' salaries remained unchanged. Mr. Reynolds' salary was increased to reflect his additional duties and responsibilities following his promotion from Co-Chief Development Officer to sole Chief Development Officer. Our named executive officers' annual base salaries for 2018 and 2019 are set forth in the table below.

        Annual Cash Bonus.    Each named executive officer has an opportunity to earn an annual cash bonus, which is designed to motivate achievement at both a company and individual level. Under the terms of their employment agreements, each of our named executive officers, except Ms. Banerjee, has a defined annual target bonus of 100% of his respective base salary. Ms. Banerjee's annual target cash bonus is the greater of 100% of her base salary or $425,000. Additionally, our executives have the option to elect to receive all or a portion of their cash bonuses payable in LTIP Units. As indicated in the charts below, Messrs. Kelly, Paul and Theriot each participated in this option, electing to receive 100%, 100% and 50%, respectively, of their 2018 cash bonuses in the form of fully vested LTIP Units. Although fully vested at grant, pursuant to the partnership agreement, LTIP Units are not redeemable for common shares until two years after the date of grant.  Table of Contents
      2018 Actual Executive Pay Mix Before and After Cash Bonus Equity Election         
       Our Compensation Committee strives to make compensation decisions that reward management for executing our strategy for creating long-term value. We do not rely on a strict formulaic framework for measuring performance against short-term goals to determine compensation awards for a particular year, but instead aim for a balanced quantitative and qualitative approach, as outlined below, that our Committee believes is appropriate to support our continued success. We focus on key drivers of value creation such as capital allocation, development activity, leasing, Core Funds From Operations (FFO), Property-level Net Operating Income (NOI) and balance sheet management. 
       The Compensation Committee believes that combining a quantitative and a qualitative assessment against pre- established goals allows it to:
       The target bonus for each of Messrs. Kelly, Paul, Theriot and Reynolds and 108% of Ms. Banerjee's target bonus were approved as his or her actual bonus by the Compensation Committee based on 2018 performance. In determining 2018 bonus amounts, the Compensation Committee focused primarily on the performance metrics established by the Committee at the beginning of 2018 and described below, all of which were met or exceeded, as well as the Company's achievement of the accomplishments set forth under "Executive Summary — 2018 Business Performance Highlights" above.    Table of Contents 
       The table below summarizes the Company's 2018 performance against each of the target performance goals established by the Compensation Committee, as well as the significance of each performance goal for purposes of determining executive compensation: 
Why is this goal important? Recycling capital from asset sales and recapitalizations allows us to efficiently access capital to deleverage and create balance sheet capacity for future investment opportunities. 
Performance:    The Company exceeded its goal for asset sales and recapitalizations by approximately $175 million or approximately 25%. 
Why is this goal important? Development deliveries drive substantial value creation in our portfolio, and measure our ability to execute on our development pipeline both on time and within budget. 
Performance:    During 2018, the Company delivered three of its under construction assets ahead of schedule and below budget. Also, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's remaining under construction assets were on schedule and on budget. 
Why is this goal important? We generate revenue and cash by leasing operating and development assets. Our ability to effectively lease these assets is an important measure of progress toward stabilizing our operating portfolio and development assets. When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the tenant, the term of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the costs of tenant improvements and other landlord concessions, current and anticipated operating expenses, real estate taxes, vacancy and expected future demand for the space, the impact of any expansion rights and general economic factors. 
Performance:    The Company leased approximately 1.76 million square feet, which exceeded its goal for commercial leasing activity by approximately 35%. 
Why is this goal important? Our ability to achieve stabilized occupancy levels in our multifamily portfolio is a key measure of market demand and the ability of our dedicated in-house leasing teams to both effectively attract new tenants and retain existing tenants. 
Performance:    The Company achieved average residential occupancy levels of approximately 92%, which exceeded its goal by 1.6%.  Table of Contents
Why is this goal important?    Core FFO is important in comparing our levered operating performance from period-to-period and as compared to similar real estate companies. 
Performance:    The Company achieved Core FFO of approximately $240 million, which exceeded its goal by approximately 13.7%. 
Why is this goal important?:    NOI is a supplemental portfolio performance measure that reflects only those revenue and expense items that are incurred at the asset level, excluding non-cash items, and is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful starting point for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. 
Performance:    The Company exceeded its goal of approximately $363 million for property-level net operating income. 
Why is this goal important? Our goal was to successfully integrate our predecessor companies, preserve our dynamic, collaborative corporate culture and achieve significant operational synergies. 
Performance:    The Company achieved 100% of the expected $35 million of formation transaction synergies. 
Why is this goal important? Maintaining prudent leverage, a well-laddered debt maturity profile and sufficient liquidity provides capacity for future investment opportunities. 
Performance:    The Company maintained appropriate ratios of net debt/adjusted EBITDA, net debt/total enterprise value and fixed-rate debt as a percentage of total debt. 
Why is this goal important? The successful transition and integration of all accounting and technology data and processes from initially separate accounting and technology platforms to the Company's systems is a key operational efficiency driver.  Table of Contents
Performance:    The Company successfully transferred the accounting for all legacy Vornado assets from Vornado to the Company and completed the conversion of the related data and business processes from Vornado's technology platform to the Company's systems. 
        Equity Incentive Compensation.    We provide equity awards pursuant to the JBG SMITH 2017 Omnibus Share Plan (the "2017 Plan"), which serve as the long-term incentive element of our target pay mix for our executive compensation. The 2017 Plan provides for grants of options, share-based awards, partnership unit awards and performance-based equity awards to trustees, officers and employees of JBG SMITH and its subsidiaries. In addition, we grant equity awards pursuant to the partnership agreement of our operating partnership, to the extent the awards are based on interests in our operating partnership. The purpose of the equity awards is to attract, retain and motivate our trustees, officers and employees by providing them with a proprietary interest in our long-term success or compensation based on the attainment of performance goals. 
   2018 Annual Equity Grants  
       On February 2, 2018 each named executive officer received an award of LTIP Units with time-based vesting requirements (the "Time-Based LTIP Units") under the 2017 Plan and the partnership agreement. The Time-Based LTIP Units vest in four equal annual installments beginning on January 1, 2019, subject to continued employment. On February 2, 2018, we also granted LTIP Units with performance-based vesting requirements ("Performance-Based LTIP Units") to each named executive officer under the 2017 Plan and the partnership agreement. Performance-Based LTIP Units are subject to performance-based vesting and vest based on the relative performance of the TSR of our common shares compared to the companies in the FTSE NAREIT Equity Office Index ("Peer Companies"), over the three-year performance period beginning on January 31, 2018, inclusive of dividends and stock price appreciation. TSR means, for the Company and the Peer Companies, the total return (expressed as a percentage) that would have been realized by a shareholder who bought one share of common stock of such company at a certain baseline value on the applicable grant date, reinvested each dividend and other distribution declared during the performance period with respect to such share (without deduction for any taxes with respect to such dividends or other distributions), and sold such shares at a certain common share price on the applicable valuation date (without deduction for any taxes with respect to any gain on such sale or any charges in connection with such sale). Appropriate adjustments to TSR are made to take into account all stock dividends, stock splits, reverse  Table of Contents stock splits and certain other events that occur during the performance period. Once the Compensation Committee determines the number of Performance-Based LTIP Units that become earned following the end of the three-year performance period, 50% of any Performance-Based LTIP Units that are earned vest on the date the number of Performance-Based LTIP Units that become earned is determined and the remaining 50% on January 30, 2022, subject to continued employment. 
       The percentage of Performance-Based LTIP Units that may be earned based on the relative TSR of JBG SMITH compared to the Peer Companies over the three-year performance period is set forth in the table below. The Performance-Based LTIP Unit award will be forfeited in its entirety if the relative performance is below the 35th percentile of Peer Companies. If JBG SMITH's three-year TSR is negative for the performance period, then 50% of the Performance-Based LTIP Units that otherwise would have been earned based on relative TSR may be earned if JBG SMITH's TSR becomes positive within seven years following the end of the three-year performance period (with the other 50% being forfeited at the end of the three-year performance period).

        Special Amazon Equity Award.    In September 2017, Amazon announced its search for a second headquarters location in the United States (HQ2). 238 U.S jurisdictions submitted proposals competing to be selected by Amazon for its HQ2. JBG SMITH partnered with the Commonwealth of Virginia, Arlington County and the City of Alexandria in submitting a proposal for National Landing to be the location of HQ2. In November 2018, Amazon announced that it had selected JBG SMITH's assets in National Landing for a second headquarters, subject to negotiation of definitive documentation. This resulted in a proposed transaction with Amazon to:
       This transaction, combined with substantial expected investments from Amazon, state and local governments and Virginia Tech and George Mason University, is expected to have a positive impact on the Company's portfolio through accelerated market stabilization and submarket repositioning which we anticipate will increase occupancy in our properties. Further, the expected increase in jobs both from Amazon and others is expected to drive substantial increases in future demand for commercial and residential space in our market. 
       Given the increase in Company value expected from this transaction, the Compensation Committee determined in November 2018 that the Company's executives deserved substantial bonuses for their efforts in bringing Amazon to the Company's properties, and approved a special one-time equity award for each named executive officer. In determining the amount of this special equity award, the Committee considered the time and effort expended by each named executive officer during the 14-month pursuit and the economic benefit that is expected to accrue to the Company from Amazon. Given the direct and indirect efforts of all Company employees in the Amazon transaction, the Committee approved a special bonus pool not only for the named executive officers, but also for substantially all other employees of the Company. These employees received either a special equity or  Table of Contents special cash bonus at approximately the same time as the named executive officers received their special equity award. The special equity award for executive officers comprised 50% time-based LTIP Units that vest 50% on each of the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date and 50% performance-based LTIP Units (with the same TSR performance conditions as our annual award of performance-based LTIP Units) with the performance-based LTIP Units that are earned vesting 50% on November 1, 2022 and 50% on November 1, 2023. The Committee created longer vesting periods for this award than the standard annual awards in light of the long-term nature of Amazon's commitment to its second headquarters. At the grant date, vesting was conditioned on Amazon entering into definitive lease or asset purchase documentation with the Company. 
       The table below shows each named executive officer's 2018 salary, cash bonus and equity compensation with and without the special, one-time Amazon equity award. See "Compensation of Executive Officers — Summary Compensation Table" below for a summary of all compensation earned in 2018.

      Other Benefits and Policies         
       Retirement Savings Opportunities.    Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan established pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") that is available to all our employees. We do not offer defined benefit pension or supplemental executive retirement plans to any of our employees. 
        Perquisites and Supplemental Benefits.    In addition to allowing participation in our 401(k) plan described above, we offer our executives participation in health and other insurance policies that are available to all of our employees. In certain cases, we may provide reimbursement for relocation expenses. Consistent with our culture of fairness and transparency, we believe that that our executives generally should not be entitled to perquisites and supplemental benefits that are not available to all employees of the Company. 
        Clawback Policy.    The Board has adopted our Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy that generally provides that the Company may seek to recover certain performance-based compensation paid to an executive if the executive officer engaged in fraud or intentional misconduct which materially contributed to a restatement of the Company's financial results. See "Corporate Governance and Board Matters — Company Policies — Clawback Policy." 
      Employment Agreements         
       We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Kelly, Paul, Theriot, Reynolds and Ms. Banerjee. These agreements protect our executives by providing:
       In addition, these agreements protect the Company from certain business risks such as threats from competitors, loss of confidentiality, disparagement and solicitation of employees. Consistent with good governance practices, our employment agreements do not include Section 280G excise tax gross-ups. The employment agreements are described in more detail below under "Compensation of Executive Officers — Narrative Disclosure to Summary Compensation Table and Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table" section below. 
      Tax and Accounting Considerations         
       Code Section 162(m).    Generally, Section 162(m) of the Code ("Section 162(m)"), as amended by H.R. 1, colloquially known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, disallows a tax deduction for any publicly held corporation for individual compensation exceeding $1.0 million in any taxable year to its chief executive officer, its chief financial officer and each of its three other most highly compensated executive officers. The IRS has previously issued private letter rulings holding that Section 162(m) does not apply to compensation paid to employees of a real estate investment trust's operating partnership under certain circumstances. We have therefore determined that compensation paid to the Company's executive officers by our operating partnership or a subsidiary of our operating partnership for services to our operating partnership should not be subject to this limit. 
        Code Section 409A.    Section 409A of the Code ("Section 409A"), requires that "nonqualified deferred compensation" be deferred and paid under plans or arrangements that satisfy the requirements of the statute with respect to the timing of deferral elections, timing of payments and certain other matters. Failure to satisfy these requirements can expose employees and other service providers to accelerated income tax liabilities, penalty taxes and interest on their vested compensation under such plans. Accordingly, as a general matter, it is our intention to design and administer our compensation and benefits plans and arrangements for all of our employees and other service  Table of Contents providers, including our executive officers, so that they are either exempt from, or satisfy the requirements of, Section 409A. 
        Accounting for Share-Based Compensation.    We follow FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 ("ASC Topic 718"), for our share-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to calculate the grant date "fair value" of their share-based awards using a variety of assumptions. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their share-based awards in their income statements over the period that an employee is required to render service in exchange for the award. Grants of share options, restricted shares, restricted share units and other equity-based awards under our equity incentive award plans will be accounted for under ASC Topic 718. Our Compensation Committee will regularly consider the accounting implications of significant compensation decisions, especially in connection with decisions that relate to our equity incentive award plans and programs. As accounting standards change, we may revise certain programs to appropriately align accounting expenses of our equity awards with our overall executive compensation philosophy and objectives.

   Executive Employment Agreements  
       We have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Kelly, Paul, Theriot, Reynolds and Ms. Banerjee. The material terms of their employment agreements are described below. 
        Term. The initial term of each employment expires on July 18, 2020, subject to automatic one-year renewals, unless 180 days' prior written notice of non-renewal is provided by either party or the executive officer is earlier terminated or resigns. 
        Base Salary, Target Bonus and Benefits. The employment agreements provide for annual base salaries for each of the foregoing executive officers, as set forth in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Executive Compensation Program — Annual Base Salary." Each such executive officer's employment agreement provides that his or her base salary is subject to review at least annually for possible increase, but not decrease. The employment agreements also establish annual cash bonus targets for each executive officer, expressed as a percentage of annual base salary, as set forth in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Executive Compensation Program –Annual Cash Bonus." In addition, the employment agreements provide that each executive officer will be entitled to participate in benefit plans and programs as are made available to our senior level executives or to our employees generally. 
       2017 Equity Grants. Pursuant to their employment agreements, each of Messrs. Kelly, Paul, Theriot and Reynolds received an equity grant under the 2017 Plan and the partnership agreement, in the form of Time-Based LTIP Units and Performance-Based LTIP Units, in connection with the formation transaction. The amount and terms of grants after this award are subject to the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee. 
        Severance. Under each employment agreement, if the executive is terminated without "cause" or resigns for "good reason" (each as defined in his or her employment agreement), he or she will be entitled to certain severance benefits, including enhanced benefits upon a qualifying termination that occurs in connection with a change in control, as described in detail below under "—Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
        Net-Better Cutback. If any payments to any executive officer would constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and would cause the executive officer to become subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code, then such payments will be reduced to the amount that would not cause the named executive officer to be subject to the excise tax if such a reduction would put the executive officer in a better after-tax position than if the executive officer were to pay the excise tax.  Table of Contents 
       Restrictive Covenants. Each executive officer is subject to a perpetual non-disclosure covenant, a non-competition covenant through the later of July 18, 2020 and the first anniversary of the date the executive officer's employment terminates for any reason, and a non-solicitation of employees and consultants covenant through the later of July 18, 2020 and the second anniversary of the date the executive officer's employment terminates for any reason. 
   LTIP Units  
       Pursuant to the partnership agreement, the partnership may issue compensatory partnership interests in the form of LTIP Units, which, in general, are a special class of limited partnership units of the partnership that are structured in a manner intended to qualify as "profits interests" for federal income tax purposes. LTIP Units may be subject to vesting requirements as determined prior to grant. Generally, LTIP Units receive the same quarterly (or other period) per-unit profit distributions as the outstanding common limited partnership units ("OP Units") beginning as of the date specified in the vesting agreement pursuant to which the LTIP Units are issued (the "Distribution Participation Date"). Net income and net loss are allocated to each LTIP Unit from the Distribution Participation Date for such LTIP Unit in amounts per LTIP Unit equal to the amounts allocated per OP Unit for the same period, with certain exceptions, including special allocations as provided under the partnership agreement. If LTIP Units are held for more than three years from the date of grant before being transferred, any gain (assuming the applicable tax elections are made by the grantee) realized by the recipient upon disposition will be taxed as long-term capital gain. 
       The partnership maintains a capital account balance for each LTIP Unit as of the date of grant, and a corresponding "Book-Up Target," which will generally correspond to the capital account balance of the general partner on a per-unit basis, and the Book-Up Target will be reduced by certain specified allocations and forfeitures until the LTIP Unit capital account balance has reached parity with the capital account balance of the general partner on a per-unit basis (as provided in the partnership agreement), and the Book-Up Target equals zero. The partnership will maintain at all times a one-to-one correspondence between LTIP Units and OP Units for conversion, distribution and other purposes, except as provided in the partnership agreement, and will make corresponding adjustments to the LTIP Units to maintain such correspondence upon the occurrence of certain specified adjustment events. A holder of LTIP Units has the right to convert all or a portion of vested LTIP Units into OP Units, which are then subsequently redeemable for common shares, as provided in the partnership agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event may a holder of LTIP Units convert a vested LTIP Unit the Book-Up Target of which has not been reduced to zero. 
       LTIP Units are not entitled to the redemption right described above, but any OP Units into which LTIP Units are converted are entitled to this redemption right beginning on the second anniversary of the date of the grant of the LTIP Units. LTIP Units, generally, vote with the OP Units and do not have any separate voting rights except in connection with actions that would materially and adversely affect the rights of the LTIP Units. 
   Performance-Based LTIP Units  
       Under the 2017 Plan, participants may earn awards in the form of Performance-Based LTIP Units based on the achievement of certain financial goals, which may include absolute TSR and TSR relative to our peer group over a specified measurement period, or other performance metrics. 
       Performance-Based LTIP Units are valued by reference to the value of a common share. The employment conditions, the length of the period for vesting and other applicable conditions and restrictions of Performance-Based LTIP Unit awards, including computation of financial metrics and/or achievement of pre-established performance goals, are established prior to grant. Such Performance-Based LTIP Unit awards may provide the holder with rights to distributions or dividend equivalents prior to vesting. It is anticipated that net income and net loss will be allocated to each Performance-Based LTIP Unit from the date of issuance until the Distribution Participation Date in amounts per  Table of Contents
Performance-Based LTIP Unit equal to 10% of the amounts allocated per OP Unit for the same period. 
       Like LTIP Units, Performance-Based LTIP Unit awards are structured in a manner intended to qualify as "profits interests" for federal income tax purposes, meaning that, under current law, no income will be recognized by the recipient upon grant or vesting, and we will not be entitled to any deduction. The holder of the Performance-Based LTIP Units is entitled to receive distributions with respect to such Performance-Based LTIP Units to the extent that may be provided for in the partnership agreement, as modified by the award agreement, and is not entitled to receive distributions prior to the applicable Distribution Participation Date. If Performance-Based LTIP Units are held for more than three years from the date of grant before being transferred, any gain (assuming the applicable tax elections are made by the grantee) realized by the recipient upon disposition will be taxed as long-term capital gain. 
   Formation Units  
       "Formation Units" are a class of partnership interests in the partnership that were generally granted to certain individuals in connection with the formation transaction under the partnership agreement and the 2017 Plan. Formation Units are intended to qualify as "profits interests" for federal income tax purposes and are designed to have economics comparable to stock options in that, assuming vesting, they allow the recipient to realize value above a threshold level set at the time of award to be equal to 100% of the then-fair market value of a common share. 
       The Formation Units vest 25% on each of the third and fourth anniversaries, and 50% on the fifth anniversary, of the formation transaction, subject to continued employment. The value of vested Formation Units is realized through conversion into a number of LTIP Units, and subsequent conversion into OP Units determined on the basis of how much the value of a common share has increased since the award date. The conversion ratio between Formation Units and OP Units, which starts out at zero, is the quotient of (i) the excess of the value of a common share on the conversion date above the per share value at the time the Formation Unit was granted over (ii) the value of a common share as of the date of conversion. This conversion ratio is similar to a "cashless exercise" of stock options, whereby the holder receives a number of shares equal in value to the difference between the full value of the total number of shares for which the option is being exercised and the total exercise price. Like options, Formation Units have a finite term (10 years) over which their value may increase and during which they may be converted into LTIP Units (and in turn, OP Units). 
       Because the Formation Units are outstanding partnership interests, until conversion to vested LTIP Units, holders of Formation Units will receive special allocations of liquidating gains and liquidating losses as provided under the partnership agreement. Holders of Formation Units will not receive distributions or allocations of net income or net loss prior to vesting and conversion to vested LTIP Units and, as a result, will be required to fund their tax liability relating to any special allocations they receive with respect to their Formation Units from other sources. However, upon conversion of Formation Units to vested LTIP Units, the holder will be entitled to receive a distribution per unit equal to 10% of the per unit distributions received by holders of OP Units during the period from the grant date of the Formation Units through the date of such conversion, or such other fraction as specified in the applicable award agreement. Upon conversion of Formation Units to vested LTIP Units, the holder generally is entitled to receive allocations of net income and net loss such that the ratio of (i) the total amount of net income or net loss with respect to each Formation Unit in such taxable year to (ii) the total amount distributed to that Formation Unit with respect to such period is equal (as nearly as practicable) to the ratio of (i) to (ii) with respect to the general partner's OP Units for such taxable year, with certain exceptions, including any special allocations as provided under the partnership agreement. As a result, assuming that the partnership makes distributions equal to or greater than its taxable income, holders of Formation Units should receive distributions that equal or exceed the amount of any allocations of taxable income they have been allocated.  Table of Contents
       If Formation Units are held for more than three years from the date of grant of the Formation Units before being transferred, any gain (assuming the applicable tax elections are made by the grantee) realized by the recipient upon disposition will be taxed as long-term capital gain.

      2018 Option Exercises and Shares Vested         
       The following table sets forth information regarding the option exercises and share vesting during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. The Company has no outstanding options. There were no option exercises in fiscal 2018 and the amount shown under "stock awards" represents the vesting of Time-Based LTIP Units. The value on vesting is calculated by multiplying the number of LTIP Units vested on each date by the market value of our common shares on such date, which is assumed to be the per share closing price on the NYSE.

      Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control         
       The following summarizes the payments that we may be required to make to our named executive officers in connection with a termination of employment or change in control. 
 Employment Agreements  
       As described above, the Company previously entered into employment agreements with each of its named executive officers. The following discussion summarizes the payments we may be required to make under the employment agreements upon the following termination events: (i) termination by us without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" other than a termination within two years following a "change in control" of the Company; (ii) termination by us without "cause" or by the named executive for "good reason" within two years following a "change in control" of the Company; and (iii) death or disability of the named executive officer. The potential payments to the named executive officers will vary depending on which one of these termination events occurs. 
       Regardless of the reason for any termination of employment, each named executive officer is entitled to receive the following benefits upon termination pursuant to his employment agreement with the Company: (i) payment of any unpaid portion of the named executive officer's base salary through the effective date of termination; (ii) payment of any accrued but unused vacation pay through the effective date of termination, to the extent provided by the Company's vacation policy; (iii) reimbursement for any outstanding reasonable business expenses; and (iv) payment of any compensation or benefits as may be required by any Company employee benefit plans or programs. 
 Termination by us for "Cause" or by the named executive officer without "Good Reason"  
       If we terminate any named executive officer's employment agreement for "cause" or the named executive officer terminates his or her employment agreement without "good reason," the executive will only receive the benefits described in the paragraph immediately above, regardless of the reason for the termination of employment. 
 Termination by us without "Cause" or by the named executive officer for "Good Reason", outside of a Change in Control  
       If we terminate any named executive officer without "cause" or a named executive officer terminates his or her employment for "good reason," in either case other than following the execution of a definitive agreement the consummation of which would result in, or within two years following, a change in control, the named executive will have the right to receive, in addition to the benefits to be provided regardless of the reason for the termination of employment, a severance payment that will consist of: (i) cash payment equal to one times the sum of the named executive officer's base salary and target bonus, (ii) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination, determined based on actual performance, (iii) health care continuation for 18 months, (iv) certain equity vesting benefits as described in the following sentence, and (v) any unpaid annual bonus for the year preceding the year of termination if the relevant measurement period for such bonus concluded prior to the termination date. With respect to the equity vesting benefits referenced in (iv) above, any outstanding unvested portion of the Formation Units the named executive officer received in connection with the formation transaction (the "Initial Formation Award") and any LTIP Units or other equity awards without performance conditions will vest, and for any Performance-Based LTIP Units and other performance-based awards, a pro rata portion of the awards scheduled to vest on the next vesting date will vest. In addition, any vested stock options held by the terminated named executive officer will remain exercisable for 60 days following termination (or, if earlier, for the remainder of the term of the option) and any vested and unconverted portion of the named executive officer's profits interests will remain convertible.  Table of Contents
 Termination by us without "Cause" or by the named executive officer for "Good Reason", following a Change in Control  
       If we terminate any named executive officer without "cause" or the named executive officer terminates his or her employment for "good reason," in either case following the execution of a definitive agreement the consummation of which would result in, or within two years following, a change in control, the named executive will have the right to receive, in addition to the benefits to be provided regardless of the reason for the termination of employment, a severance payment that will consist of: (i) cash payment equal to two times (or three times for W. Matthew. Kelly) the sum of such named executive officer's base salary and target bonus, (ii) a pro rata amount of his target annual bonus for the year of termination, (iii) health care continuation for two years, (iv) certain equity vesting benefits as described in the next sentence, and (v) any unpaid annual bonus for the year preceding the year of termination if the relevant measurement period for such bonus concluded prior to the termination date. With respect to the equity vesting benefits referenced in (iv) above, all outstanding unvested equity-based awards (including the named executive officer's Initial Formation Award) will vest. In addition, any vested options held by the terminated named executive officer will remain exercisable for 60 days following termination (or, if earlier, for the remainder of the term of the option) and any vested and unconverted portion of the named executive officer's profits interests will remain convertible. 
       For purposes of the employment agreements, the terms, "Cause," "Good Reason" and "Change in Control" are defined as follows: 
       "Cause" generally means the named executive officer's (i) conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony; (ii) willful and continued failure to use reasonable best efforts to substantially perform his or her duties (other than such failure resulting from the named executive officer's incapacity due to physical or mental illness) that the named executive officer fails to remedy to our reasonable satisfaction within 30 days after our written notice of such failure; or (iii) willful misconduct that is materially economically injurious to us. 
       "Good reason" generally means: (i) a reduction in base salary or target annual bonus, (ii) a material diminution in position, authority, duties or responsibilities or the assignment of duties materially and adversely inconsistent with the named executive officer's position as provided under the named executive officer's employment agreement; (iii) a relocation of employment to a location outside of the Washington, DC metropolitan area; or (iv) our material breach of any provision of the employment agreement or any equity agreement with the named executive officer, which will be deemed to include (x) the named executive officer's not holding the title prescribed under the employment agreement, (y) failure of our successor to assume the employment agreement and (z) the named executive officer no longer reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer (or, in the case of W. Matthew. Kelly, our Board). 
       "Change in Control" means the occurrence of one of the following events: 
         (i)  Any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) (a "Person") becomes the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of 30% or more of either (1) the then-outstanding common shares (the "Outstanding Company Common Shares") or (2) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of trustees (the "Outstanding Company Voting Securities"); provided, however, that, for purposes of this section, the following acquisitions shall not constitute a Change of Control: (a) any acquisition directly from the Company, (b) any acquisition by the Company, (c) any acquisition by any employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its affiliates or (d) any acquisition by any entity pursuant to a transaction that complies with the provisions of sections (iii)(1), (2) and (3) below; 
        (ii)  Any time at which individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the board of trustees of the Company (the "Incumbent Board") cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority of the Board; provided, however, that any individual becoming a trustee subsequent to the date hereof whose election, or nomination for election by the Company's shareholders, was approved by a vote of at least  Table of Contents a majority of the trustees then comprising the Incumbent Board shall be considered as though such individual were a member of the Incumbent Board, but excluding, for this purpose, any such individual whose initial assumption of office occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest with respect to the election or removal of trustees or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board; 
       (iii)  Consummation of a reorganization, merger, statutory share exchange or consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries, a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or the acquisition of assets or stock of another entity by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (each, a "Business Combination"), in each case unless, following such Business Combination, (1) all or substantially all of the individuals and entities that were the beneficial owners of the Outstanding Company Common Shares and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities immediately prior to such Business Combination beneficially own, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the then-outstanding shares of common stock and the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, as the case may be, of the entity resulting from such Business Combination (including, without limitation, an entity that, as a result of such transaction, owns the Company or all or substantially all of the Company's assets either directly or through one or more subsidiaries) in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Business Combination of the Outstanding Company Common Shares and the Outstanding Company Voting Securities, as the case may be, (2) no Person (excluding any entity resulting from such Business Combination or any employee benefit plan (or related trust) of the Company or such entity resulting from such Business Combination) beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 30% or more of, respectively, the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the entity resulting from such Business Combination or the combined voting power of the then-outstanding voting securities of such entity, except to the extent that such ownership existed prior to the Business Combination, and (3) at least a majority of the members of the board of directors of the entity resulting from such Business Combination were members of the Incumbent Board at the time of the execution of the initial agreement or of the action of the Board providing for such Business Combination; or 
       (iv)  Approval by the shareholders of the Company of a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company. 
       The compensation payable to named executive officers upon such terminations or change in control will be paid in a single lump sum. The other benefits will be conditioned upon the named executive's continued compliance with the non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality and other covenants contained in the employment agreement. All of the foregoing benefits payable upon termination are conditioned upon the named executive's execution of a general release of claims. 
 Death or Disability  
       If a named executive's employment is terminated by reason of "disability" or death, the executive, or his or her beneficiary, legal representative or estate, in the case of his death, will be entitled to receive: (i) vesting of any outstanding unvested portion of the Initial Formation Award, (ii) vesting of a prorated portion of any outstanding unvested Performance-Based LTIP Units scheduled to vest on the next vesting date (if earned pursuant to the terms and conditions of the award agreement) based on the number of days completed in the vesting cycle then in process for such awards up to and including the date of termination, divided by the total number of days in such vesting cycle, (iii) vesting of all outstanding unvested LTIP Units, (iv) a pro rata bonus for the year of termination, determined based on actual performance, and (v) any unpaid annual bonus for the year preceding the year of termination if the relevant measurement period for such bonus concluded prior to the termination date. Under the employment agreement, the Company may terminate the named executive's employment for "disability" if, as a result of the executive's incapacity due to physical or mental illness, he or she has been substantially unable to perform his or her duties under the agreement for a continuous period of 180 days, and within 30 days after written notice of termination is given after such 180-day period, the executive shall not have returned to the substantial performance of his or her duties on a full-time basis.  Table of Contents 
   2017 Plan  
       The 2017 Plan provides that if the Company experiences a change in control, then the Compensation Committee may take one or more of the following actions with respect to outstanding awards, in its sole discretion: (i) settle the awards for an amount of cash or securities; (ii) provide for the assumption of or the issuance of substitute awards that will substantially preserve the otherwise applicable terms of any affected awards; (iii) modify the terms of such awards to add events, conditions or circumstances (including termination of employment within a specified period after a change in control) upon which the vesting of such awards or lapse of restrictions thereon will accelerate; (iv) deem any performance conditions satisfied at target, maximum or actual performance through closing or provide for the performance conditions to continue (as is or as adjusted by the committee) after closing or (v) provide that for a period of at least 20 days prior to the change in control, any stock options or stock appreciation rights that would not otherwise become exercisable prior to the change in control will be exercisable as to all shares subject thereto (but any such exercise will be contingent upon and subject to the occurrence of the change in control and if the change in control does not take place within a specified period after giving such notice for any reason whatsoever, the exercise will be null and void) and that any stock options or stock appreciation rights not exercised prior to the consummation of the change in control will terminate and be of no further force and effect as of the consummation of the change in control. Under the 2017 Plan, the term "change in control" has the same meaning assigned to such term in the employment agreements. 
   Unit Issuance Agreements  
       Our named executive officers received consideration consisting of OP Units in connection with the formation transaction for their ownership interests in the JBG management company that was contributed to us. These OP Units were issued pursuant to Unit Issuance Agreements that contained vesting and/or transfer restrictions. Fifty percent of such units vested at the consummation of the formation transaction, with the remaining fifty percent scheduled to vest in equal monthly installments over a 30-month period beginning on the first day of the 31st month after the formation transaction and ending on the first day of the 60th month after the formation transaction as long as the individual remains employed by us (subject to accelerated vesting upon the employee's death or "disability," or the termination of the employee's employment with us or its affiliate without "cause" or by the employee for "good reason," or upon the occurrence of a "change in control" or upon non-renewal by us of the employee's employment agreement, as those terms are defined in the executive's employment agreement). The OP Units that are fully vested at the time of issuance will not be transferable or redeemable, including for our common shares or otherwise, for three years following the formation transaction (subject to early termination of the transfer restrictions upon the occurrence of certain specified events similar to those that trigger accelerated vesting, as described above), except that up to 10% of an individual's total OP Units may be sold, pledged or redeemed for our common shares during this period (subject to the transfer and redemption restrictions imposed on the OP Units generally by the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership). The OP Units that vest after issuance will be subject to the foregoing restrictions on transfer and redemption for five years following the formation transaction (subject to early termination of the transfer restrictions upon the occurrence of certain specified events similar to those that trigger accelerated vesting, as described above). 
   Quantification of Benefits under the Termination and Change in Control Events  
       The following table summarizes the cash payments and estimated equivalent cash value of benefits that would have been provided to our named executive officers under the terms of their employment  Table of Contents agreements described above upon termination under various scenarios, or upon a change in control without a termination, as of December 31, 2018.

      Equity Compensation Plan Information         
       The following table sets forth certain information concerning our common shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan and our 2018 Employee Share Purchase Plan (the "Share Purchase Plan") as of December 31, 2018. 
      CEO Pay Ratio         
       As required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, presented below is the ratio of annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee (excluding our CEO). The ratio presented below is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
       To identify the "median employee" from our employee population, we used W-2 Medicare compensation for employees (annualizing such compensation for employees who had worked less than the 12 month period) and excluding our CEO from the calculation. We did not use any statistical sampling techniques and did not make any cost of living adjustments in identifying our median employee. Using this methodology, we determined that we had 922 employees as of December 31, 2018. We identified our median employee from this employee population. 
       The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K for our CEO was $11,324,932. The 2018 annual total compensation as determined under Item 402 of Regulation S-K  Table of Contents for our median employee was $93,450. The ratio of our CEO's annual total compensation to our median employee's annual total compensation for fiscal year 2018 is 121 to 1. 
       Our CEO's compensation as calculated above includes the grant date fair value of a one-time equity award granted in November 2018, which award is not scheduled to vest until the fourth and fifth anniversary of the grant date. See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Executive Compensation Program — Special Amazon Equity Award" for more information on this one-time equity award. SEC disclosure rules require us to include one-time special awards to our named executive officers in our calculation of the CEO pay ratio, even though they are one-time in nature. These one-time awards were designed to compensate our employees for the successful pursuit that resulted in Amazon selecting our properties in National Landing, Arlington, Virginia for a second headquarters. These awards are one-time in nature and are not a continuing feature of our long-term incentive plan. Excluding this one-time equity award, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO to the annual total compensation of our median employee would have been 50 to 1. We believe this normalized CEO pay ratio is a more useful tool for comparing our CEO's annual compensation to our median employee because it includes the regular, ongoing components of our CEO's compensation program that are expected to continue in 2019 and beyond. 
       The SEC's rules for calculating the required pay ratio permit companies to use reasonable estimates and assumptions in their methodologies, and companies have different employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, pay ratios reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above.  Table of Contents 
    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT         
       As of February 26, 2019, we had approximately 122.6 million common shares outstanding and 15.2 million OP Units outstanding (other than OP Units owned by us) for an aggregate of approximately 137.8 million outstanding shares and OP Units. This section sets forth information regarding the beneficial ownership of our executive officers, trustees and holders known to us to hold more than 5% of our common shares. 
      Security Ownership of Trustees and Executive Officers         
       The table below sets forth the beneficial ownership of the Company's securities by its trustees, named executive officers and trustees and executive officers as a group as of February 26, 2019. 
       The SEC has defined "beneficial ownership" of a security to mean the possession, directly or indirectly, of voting power and/or investment power over such security. A shareholder is also deemed to be, as of any date, the beneficial owner of all securities that such shareholder has the right to acquire within 60 days after that date through (a) the exercise of any option, warrant or right, (b) the conversion of a security, (c) the power to revoke a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement, or (d) the automatic termination of a trust, discretionary account or similar arrangement. In computing the number of shares beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, common shares subject to options or other rights (as set forth above) held by that person that are currently exercisable or will become exercisable within 60 days thereafter are deemed outstanding, while such shares are not deemed outstanding for purposes of computing percentage ownership of any other person. Each person named in the table has sole voting and investment power with respect to all securities shown as beneficially owned by such person, except as otherwise indicated in the table or footnotes below. 
       Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each named person is c/o JBG SMITH Properties, 4445 Willard Avenue, Suite 400, Chevy Chase, MD 20815. 
       To our knowledge, no shares beneficially owned by any executive officer or trustee have been pledged as security.

      Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance         
       Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and trustees, and persons who own more than 10% of our outstanding common shares, to file reports of securities ownership and changes in such ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, trustees and greater than 10% shareholders also are required by rules promulgated by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
       Based solely upon a review of Forms 3 and 4 and amendments thereto and written executive representations furnished to us during the most recent fiscal year, no person who at any time during the fiscal year was a trustee, officer, or beneficial owner of more than 10% of any class of our equity securities failed to file on a timely basis, as disclosed in the above forms, reports required by Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the most recent fiscal year.

    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS         
      Related Party Transactions         
       Our Board has adopted a written statement of policy regarding transactions with related persons, which we refer to as our "related party transactions policy." Our related party transactions policy requires that a "related party," which is defined as (i) any person who is or was a trustee, nominee for trustee, or executive officer of the Company at any time since the beginning of the last fiscal year, even if such person does not presently serve in that role; (ii) any person known by the Company to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Company's common shares when the related party transaction in question is expected to occur or exist (or when it occurred or existed); and (iii) any person who is or was an immediate family member of any of the foregoing when the related party transaction in question is expected to occur or exist (or when it occurred or existed), must promptly disclose any "related party transaction" (defined as any transaction directly or indirectly involving any related party that is required to be disclosed under Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K) to the Chief Legal Officer. Related party transactions must be approved or ratified by either the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee or the full Board. 
      Agreements with Vornado         
       In connection with the formation transaction, the Company and Vornado entered into certain agreements pursuant to which the Company received substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Vornado's Washington, DC segment, which operated as Vornado / Charles E. Smith, provided a framework for our relationship with Vornado after the formation transaction and provided for the allocation between the Company and Vornado of Vornado's assets, liabilities and obligations (including its assets, employees and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after our separation from Vornado. 
   Transition Services Agreement  
       The Company and Vornado entered into a Transition Services Agreement in connection with the formation transaction pursuant to which Vornado and its subsidiaries are obligated to provide various corporate support services to the Company on an interim, transitional basis. The services to be provided to the Company initially include information technology, financial reporting and SEC compliance, insurance and payroll and benefits. The costs of the services to be provided to the Company are based on fully burdened cost and are expected to diminish over time as the Company fills vacant positions and builds its own infrastructure. We believe that the terms are comparable to those that would have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis. 
       The Transition Services Agreement will terminate on the expiration of the term of the last service provided under it, which will generally be up to 24 months following July 17, 2017. Either party may terminate the agreement upon a change in control of the other party, and the Company, as the recipient for a particular service, generally can terminate that service prior to the scheduled expiration date. In 2018, we incurred total charges of approximately $3.6 million for services provided under the Transition Services Agreement. 
   Tax Matters Agreement  
       In connection with the formation transaction, Vornado and the Company entered into a Tax Matters Agreement which generally governs Vornado's and our respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the formation transaction with respect to taxes (including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business and taxes, if any, incurred as a result of any failure of the formation transaction and certain related transactions to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes), tax attributes, tax returns, tax elections, tax contests and certain other tax matters.  Table of Contents
       In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, the Company is liable for any taxes (other than taxes related to the pro rata distribution on July 17, 2017 by Vornado to its common shareholders of all of our common shares held by Vornado (the "distribution"), which will be allocated in the manner described in the next paragraph) attributable to the Company and our subsidiaries, unless such taxes are imposed on the Company or any of the REITs contributed by Vornado (i) with respect to a period before the distribution as a result of any action taken by Vornado after the distribution, or (ii) with respect to any period as a result of Vornado's failure to qualify as a REIT for the taxable year of Vornado that includes the distribution. 
       In addition, the Tax Matters Agreement imposes certain restrictions on the Company and our subsidiaries (including restrictions on share issuances, business combinations, sales of assets and similar transactions) that are designed to preserve the tax-free status of the distribution by Vornado and certain related transactions. The Tax Matters Agreement provides special rules that allocate tax liabilities in the event the distribution by Vornado, together with certain related transactions, is not tax-free. In general, under the Tax Matters Agreement, each party is responsible for any taxes imposed on Vornado or the Company that arise from the failure of the distribution by Vornado, together with certain related transactions, to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code (including as a result of Section 355(e) of the Code), to the extent that the failure to so qualify is attributable to actions, events or transactions relating to such party's respective shares, assets or business, or a breach of the relevant representations or covenants made by that party in the Tax Matters Agreement. 
   Cleaning Services Agreements  
       Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement certain subsidiaries of the Company and a subsidiary of Vornado entered into agreements pursuant to which a subsidiary of Vornado provides cleaning, engineering and security services to certain properties received in connection with the formation transaction. The initial term of these agreements is two years from the formation transaction, with each agreement subject to automatic renewal for additional one-year terms, unless terminated earlier by either party. In 2018, we paid approximately $20.9 million pursuant to these agreements. 
   Property Management Agreements  
       The Company and Vornado entered into management contracts in connection with the formation transaction whereby the Company provides property management, asset management, leasing brokerage and other similar services with respect to certain Vornado real property assets located in the Washington, DC metropolitan area that were not contributed to us in the formation transaction. In 2018, total revenue related to these services was approximately $2.1 million pursuant to these management agreements. 
      Registration Rights Agreements         
       In connection with the Master Transaction Agreement, we entered into a registration rights agreement with certain parties that received common shares in the formation transaction (the "Shares Registration Rights Agreement") and a separate registration rights agreement with certain parties that received OP Units in the formation transaction (the "Units Registration Rights Agreement" and together with the Shares Registration Rights Agreement, the "Registration Rights Agreements"). 
       As required under the Shares Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement to register for resale the common shares issued in the formation transaction. The registration statement was declared effective on September 29, 2017. We were required to pay all expenses related to our registration obligations under such Shares Registration Rights Agreement, except for any brokerage and sales commission fees and disbursements of each holder's counsel, accountants and other holder's advisors, and any transfer taxes relating to the sale or disposition of the common shares by such holder. Under the Shares Registration Rights Agreement, we were obligated to have such registration  Table of Contents statement remain effective until all common shares have been sold or are eligible to be resold without registration under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have satisfied our obligations under the Shares Registration Rights Agreement. 
       Under the Units Registration Rights Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, we agreed to file one or more registration statements within 13 months following the consummation of the formation transaction that cover either the issuance or the resale of common shares issued in exchange for OP Units issued in the formation transaction. We also are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the registration statement(s) to become effective as promptly as practicable after filing and (i) for registration statement(s) relating to the issuance of common shares, remain effective until all OP Units issued in the formation transaction have been redeemed or exchanged or the common shares eligible for registration no longer exist as a class of securities, or (ii) for registration statement(s) relating to the resale of common shares, remain effective until all common shares have been sold or are eligible to be resold without registration under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act. If we determine to register the resale of the common shares, each holder of OP Units issued in the formation transaction desiring to be covered by the registration statement will be required to provide us with all information regarding the holder and the holder's plan of distribution that is required to be included in the registration statement. We will pay all the expenses relating to the registration of common shares. 
       The registration of either the issuance or the resale of the common shares to be received upon redemption of OP Units generally will enable holders of OP Units to immediately resell under U.S. federal securities laws any common shares received upon the redemption of OP Units that were issued in the formation transaction. The Registration Rights Agreements permit us to suspend the use of any registration statement if we have material information that has not yet been included in the registration statement, we are engaging in an underwritten offering of our own shares or in certain other circumstances. We are not permitted to suspend the use of any registration statement pursuant to these provisions for more than 180 days in any 12-month period. 
       The Registration Rights Agreements also provide for customary indemnification obligations of both the Company and the holders in connection with any registration statement. In general, we will indemnify each person receiving the registration rights for any liability arising out of any actual or alleged material misstatements or omissions contained in a registration statement or related prospectus, except for misstatements or omissions relating to the information provided by that person. Each person receiving the registration rights provided us with corresponding indemnification relating to the information provided by the holder. The rights under any agreement with respect to common shares issuable upon exchange of OP Units generally are transferable in connection with any permitted transfer of the OP Units. 
      Management Subcontracts         
       Pursuant to the terms of the Master Transaction Agreement, we provide services for the benefit of the JBG Legacy Funds, which are entities owned in part by members of our senior management, and other third parties. Such services are provided pursuant to management subcontracts and other service agreements, which were entered into in connection with the formation transaction. In 2018, we earned approximately $33.8 million, including reimbursements, in aggregate fees pursuant to these agreements. 
      Robert A. Stewart Employment Agreement         
       In connection with the formation transaction we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Robert Stewart, our Executive Vice Chairman, the terms of which are substantially the same as employment agreements with our named executive officers. Under the terms of this agreement, we paid Mr. Stewart an annual salary of $500,000 and issued him 29,117 Time-Based LTIP Awards and 53,620 Performance-Based LTIP Awards in 2018 with a grant date fair value of $1,827,376.

      Mitchell N. Schear Consulting Agreement         
       In connection with our formation, on March 10, 2017, we entered into a consulting agreement with Mitchell N. Schear, which took effect upon the closing of the formation transaction (the "Consulting Agreement"). The purpose of the Consulting Agreement was to secure Mr. Schear's expertise in managing what was Vornado's Washington, DC division prior to the formation transaction to facilitate a smooth transition from Vornado and integration of its operations with those of JBG. The Consulting Agreement, which had an initial term through December 31, 2017, provided for the payment of consulting fees at the rate of $166,667 per month and for business expense reimbursements and additional cash allowances of $2,750 per month related to Mr. Schear's services. Although the consulting period under this agreement expired on December 31, 2017, Mr. Schear is entitled to payments of $169,417 per month thereunder through July 2019. In 2018, Mr. Schear was paid $2.0 million pursuant to this agreement. Mr. Schear is subject to a perpetual non-disclosure covenant and, through the first anniversary of the closing of the formation transaction, was subject to a non-competition covenant and a non-solicitation of employees and consultants covenant. 
      Partnership Agreement         
       In connection with the formation transaction, in July 2017, we entered into an amended and restated operating partnership agreement with the limited partners, some of whom are our trustees and executive officers, in our operating partnership. As of the Record Date, we owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 89% of the partnership interests in our operating partnership. In the future, we may issue additional interests in our operating partnership to trustees or executive officers. 
       Subject to certain specified notice requirements, periodic limits and minimum thresholds set forth in the partnership agreement, a limited partner may generally exercise a redemption right to redeem OP Units at any time beginning the later of (1) August 1, 2018, and (2) twelve months from the date of the issuance of the limited partnership units held by the limited partner, subject to certain limitations in terms of timing and the total number of OP Units that can be redeemed in a single year. In addition, we may reduce or waive the holding period. See " — Registration Rights Agreements" for additional information regarding the registration rights with respect to the common shares that may be issued to the limited partners upon the exchange of their OP units. 
      Indemnification Agreements         
       We entered into indemnification agreements with each of our trustees and certain of our executive officers that provide for indemnification to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law. Maryland law permits a real estate investment trust to indemnify its present and former trustees and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that (a) the act or omission of the trustee or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (i) was committed in bad faith or (ii) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (b) the trustee or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or (c) in the case of any criminal proceeding, the trustee or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful. 
       However, under Maryland law, a Maryland real estate investment trust may not indemnify for an adverse judgment in a suit by or in the right of the real estate investment trust or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses. In addition, Maryland law permits a real estate investment trust to advance reasonable expenses to a trustee or officer upon the real estate investment trust's receipt of (a) a written affirmation by the trustee or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the real estate investment trust and (b) a written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the real estate investment trust if it shall ultimately be determined that the standard of conduct was not met.

      Householding of Proxy Materials         
       If you and other residents at your mailing address own shares of common shares in street name, your broker or bank may have sent you a notice that your household will receive only one annual report and proxy statement for each company in which you hold shares through that broker or bank. This practice of sending only one copy of proxy materials is known as "householding." If you did not respond that you did not want to participate in householding, you were deemed to have consented to the process. If the foregoing procedures apply to you, your broker has sent one copy of our Annual Report and Proxy Statement to your address. You may revoke your consent to householding at any time by sending your name, the name of your brokerage firm and your account number to Broadridge, Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way, Edgewood, NY 11717 (telephone number: 1-866-540-7095).
