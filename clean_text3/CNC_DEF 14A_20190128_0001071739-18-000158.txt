What do I need to do if I plan to attend the meeting in person? 
If you would like to attend the meeting, please bring evidence to the meeting that you own common stock, such as a stock certificate, or, if your shares are held by a broker, bank or other nominee, please bring a recent brokerage statement or a letter from the nominee confirming your beneficial ownership of such shares.

At the close of business on December 24, 2018, there were 206,184,000 shares of our common stock outstanding, net of treasury shares. Our by-laws require that a majority of the shares of our common stock issued and outstanding on that date be represented, in person or by proxy, at the meeting in order to constitute the quorum we need to transact business. We will count abstentions and broker non-votes in determining whether a quorum exists. A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee holding shares for a beneficial owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary voting power for that particular item and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner. 
The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date is necessary to approve the amendment to the Company's certificate of incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of common stock. Abstentions with respect to the proposal will have the same effect as a vote against the proposal. 
Our Board of Directors is not aware of any matters that are expected to come before the meeting other than those referred to in this proxy statement. If any other matter should properly come before the meeting, the persons appointed as proxies by the Board of Directors intend to vote the proxies in accordance with their best judgment.

PROPOSAL: AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Proposal: Approval of an Amendment to the Centene Certificate of Incorporation to Increase the Number of Authorized Shares of Common Stock  
[END TABLE]
Overview
Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, currently provides that the total number of shares of stock which we have authority to issue is 410,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 400,000,000 shares of common stock and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock.
We have proposed to increase the authorized shares of common stock from 400,000,000 shares of common stock to 800,000,000 shares of common stock (the Charter Amendment). In addition, to effect this change, the total number of shares of capital stock authorized in the certificate of incorporation, as amended, would increase from 410,000,000 to 810,000,000. 
In December 2018, our Board of Directors voted unanimously to recommend to the stockholders that the certificate of incorporation, as amended, be amended to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance by 400,000,000. Under Delaware corporate law, we are required to obtain approval from stockholders to amend the Company's certificate of incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance. If the Charter Amendment is approved by the stockholders at the special meeting, the Charter Amendment will be effective upon the filing of a certificate of amendment setting forth such amendment with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (or at such later time as may be specified therein), which filing is expected to occur promptly after the special meeting. The full text of the form of the Charter Amendment, which would replace paragraph (a) of Article FOURTH of the Company's certificate of incorporation in its entirety, is attached as Appendix A to this proxy statement. 
The affirmative vote of holders of a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the record date for the special meeting is required to approve the Charter Amendment proposal.
Reasons for Proposal
Our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes us to issue up to 410,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 24, 2018, we had a total of approximately 206,184,000 shares of common stock outstanding, and approximately 12,562,000 additional shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to our stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan. As a result, as of December 24, 2018, we had approximately 181,254,000 shares of common stock available for future issuance in excess of the outstanding common stock, our future obligations to issue common stock, and other shares of common stock that we had reserved under existing stock plans. 
In December 2018, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock in the form of a 100% stock dividend expected to be distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record on December 24, 2018, subject to the approval of this proposal. Without an increase in our authorized shares, there would not be enough authorized shares of common stock to effect the two-for-one split of our common stock. In addition to making sure we have sufficient authorized shares to effect the two-for-one split, the Board of Directors believes that it is important to have available for issuance a number of authorized shares of common stock that will be adequate to provide for future stock issuances to meet future corporate needs. Immediately after giving effect to the Charter Amendment and the two-for-one split, we expect to have approximately 362,508,000 shares of common stock available for future issuance in excess of the outstanding common stock, our future obligations to issue common stock, and other shares of common stock that we had reserved under existing stock plans.

PROPOSAL: AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
[END TABLE]
The additional authorized shares would also be available for issuance from time to time in the discretion of the Board of Directors, without further stockholder action except as may be required for a particular transaction by law or the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The shares of common stock would be issuable for any proper corporate purpose, including future acquisitions, capital raising transactions consisting of either equity or convertible debt, stock dividends, stock splits, or issuances under current and future stock plans. The Board of Directors believes that these additional shares will provide us with needed flexibility to issue shares in the future without potential expense and delay incident to obtaining stockholder approval for a particular issuance. Except to the extent of our existing obligations on the date of mailing of this proxy statement and the two-for-one stock split discussed above, we do not currently have any plans, understandings or agreements for the issuance or use of the additional shares of common stock to be approved under this proposal.
Certain Risks Associated with the Charter Amendment
There can be no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock after the Charter Amendment will remain constant in proportion to the increase in the number of shares of our common stock outstanding before the Charter Amendment.
The market price of our common stock will also be based on our performance and other factors, some of which are unrelated to the number of shares outstanding. These factors include the status of the market for our common stock at the time, our reported results of operations in future periods, and general economic, market and industry conditions. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may not be sustainable at the direct arithmetic result of the Charter Amendment.
Principal Effects on Outstanding Common Stock
Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and to receive ratably dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors from funds legally available therefor, subject to the payment of any outstanding preferential dividends declared with respect to any preferred stock that from time to time may be outstanding. Upon the Company's liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably in any assets available for distribution to stockholders after payment of all of the Company's obligations, subject to the rights to receive preferential distributions of the holders of any preferred stock then outstanding.
The proposed amendment to the certificate of incorporation, as amended, to increase the number of shares of authorized common stock would not affect the rights of existing holders of common stock except to the extent that future issuances of common stock will reduce each existing stockholder's proportionate ownership. Holders of common stock do not have any preemptive rights to subscribe for the purchase of any shares of common stock, which means that current holders of common stock do not have a prior right to purchase any new issue of common stock in order to maintain their proportionate ownership.
The issuance of additional shares of common stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of the Company.
Interests of Certain Persons in the Proposal
Certain of our officers and directors have an interest in the proposal as a result of their ownership of shares of our common stock. However, we do not believe that our officers or directors have interests in the proposal that are different from or greater than those of any of our other stockholders.
Stock Incentive Plan 
Upon completion of the Charter Amendment, the number of shares of our common stock subject to our equity incentive plans, as well as the number of shares subject to outstanding awards and exercise prices subject to outstanding options, shall be appropriately adjusted.

PROPOSAL: AMENDMENT TO CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION 
[END TABLE]
Accounting Matters 
The Charter Amendment will not affect the par value per share of common stock, which will remain unchanged. As a result of the Charter Amendment, at the effective time, the stated capital on our balance sheet attributable to the common stock, which consists of the par value per share of the common stock multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of the common stock issued and outstanding, will be increased in proportion to the ratio of the Charter Amendment. Correspondingly, the additional paid-in capital account, which consists of the difference between the stated capital and the aggregate amount paid upon issuance of all currently outstanding shares of common stock, will be reduced by the amount by which the stated capital is increased. The stockholders' equity, in the aggregate, will remain unchanged. In addition, the per share amount of net income or loss, for all periods, will be restated because there will be more outstanding shares of common stock.
The Board of Directors recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the proposal to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation.
