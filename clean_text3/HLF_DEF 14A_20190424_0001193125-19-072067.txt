Information concerning solicitation and voting 
Place, time and date of meeting.    This Proxy Statement is being furnished to the Company's shareholders in connection with the solicitation of proxies on behalf of our Board of Directors for use at the Meeting to be held on Wednesday, April 24, 2019 at 8:30 a.m., Pacific Daylight Time, and at any subsequent adjournment(s) or postponement(s) thereof, for the purposes set forth herein and in the accompanying Notice of Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The Meeting will be held at 800 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 406, Los Angeles, CA 90015. Our telephone number is (213) 745-0500. 
Record date and voting securities.    Only shareholders of record at the close of business on February 26, 2019, or the Record Date, or duly authorized proxy holders of such shareholders of record, are entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the Meeting. The Company has one series of common shares, or Common Shares, outstanding. As of the Record Date, 152,894,238 Common Shares were issued and outstanding and held of record by 526 registered holders. 
Voting.    Each shareholder is entitled to one vote for each Common Share held on the Record Date on all matters submitted for consideration at the Meeting. A quorum, representing the holders of not less than a majority of the issued and outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote at the Meeting, must be present in person or by proxy at the Meeting for the transaction of business. Common Shares that reflect abstentions are treated as Common Shares that are present and entitled to vote for the purposes of establishing a quorum and determining the outcome of any matter submitted to the shareholders for a vote that requires the approval of a specified percentage of shares present and entitled to vote. 
"Broker non-votes" are Common Shares held in "street name" through a broker or other nominee over which the broker or nominee lacks discretionary power to vote and for which the broker or nominee has not received specific voting instructions. Thus, if you do not give your broker or nominee specific instructions, your Common Shares may not be voted on certain matters. Common Shares that reflect "broker non-votes" are treated as Common Shares that are present and entitled to vote for the purposes of establishing a quorum. However, for the purposes of determining the outcome of any matter as to which the broker or nominee has indicated on the proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote, those Common Shares will be treated as not present and not entitled to vote with respect to that matter, even though those Common Shares are considered present and entitled to vote for the purposes of establishing a quorum and may be entitled to vote on other matters. 
If you are a beneficial shareholder and your broker or nominee holds your Common Shares in its name, the broker or nominee is permitted to vote your Common Shares with respect to proposal 3, which involves the ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, even if the broker or nominee does not receive voting instructions from you. 
Directors are elected under a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections (i.e., an election where the number of persons nominated for election does not exceed the number of directors to be elected). The election of directors at the Meeting constitutes an uncontested director election. Under a majority voting standard in uncontested director elections, each vote is required to be counted "for" or "against" a director nominee's election. In order to be elected, the votes cast "for" such nominee's election must exceed the number of votes cast "against" such nominee's election. Abstentions and "broker non-votes" will not affect the outcome of the election of directors. 
In respect of proposals 2 and 3, which involve an advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers and ratification of the appointment of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, respectively, each proposal must receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Shares present or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter. In respect of determining the outcome of proposals 2 and 3, abstentions have the effect of a vote "against" while "broker non-votes" will not affect the outcome of either proposal. 
The results of the advisory vote on the compensation of the Company's named executive officers are not binding on the Board of Directors. 
Revocability of proxies.    Any proxy given pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before its use by either: (a) delivering to the Corporate Secretary of the Company a written notice of revocation or a duly executed proxy bearing a later date; (b) granting a subsequent proxy through the Internet or telephone; or (c) attending the Meeting and voting in person. However, please note that if you would like to vote at the Meeting and you are not the shareholder of record, you must request, complete and deliver a proxy from your broker or other nominee. 
Proxy solicitation.    The Company bears the expense of printing and mailing proxy materials. Proxies may be solicited by certain of our directors, officers and employees, without additional compensation, in person, by telephone, facsimile or electronic mail. We will, upon request, reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners of Common Shares. 
Meeting attendance.    Only shareholders of record and beneficial owners as of the Record Date, their authorized proxy holders, and invited guests of the Board of Directors may attend the Meeting. 
If you are a shareholder of record, in order to be admitted to the Meeting, you will need to produce picture identification (such as a valid driver's license or passport) and either a copy of a form of proxy card or a Notice showing your name and address. If you are a beneficial owner and you wish to vote in person at the Meeting, you will need to obtain a proxy from the shareholder of record. If you are a beneficial owner or other authorized proxy holder, in order to attend the Meeting, you will need both an admission ticket and picture identification (such as a valid driver's license or passport). To obtain an admission ticket to the Meeting, please send your written request to our Corporate Secretary at c/o Herbalife International of America, Inc., 800 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 406, Los Angeles, California 90015 or electronically by emailing corpsec@herbalife.com. Your request must be received on or before April 14, 2019 and include a copy of a form of proxy card or voting instruction form confirming your appointment as a proxy holder of a shareholder of record. In your request, please include the address where your admission ticket should be mailed to, and any special assistance needs. The Board requests that persons attending the Meeting observe a professional business dress code. The Company also does not permit the use of cameras or other recording devices at the Meeting. 
Meaning of shareholder of record.    You are a shareholder of record only if your name is recorded on the Company's register of members. If your name is not recorded on the Company's register of members, any shares you hold in the Company are held beneficially. In this case you may still be entitled to direct the holder of your shares as to who should be appointed as proxy in respect of those shares and/or how to vote those shares on your behalf. 
Shareholders who have purchased their shares on an exchange may hold those shares through a depository, in which case they are beneficial shareholders and not shareholders of record. If you hold your shares in "street name," you are not a shareholder of record. 
If you wish to inquire as to whether or not you are a shareholder of record, please contact our Corporate Secretary at c/o Herbalife International of America, Inc., 800 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 406, Los Angeles, California 90015. 
Additional information.    This Proxy Statement contains summaries of certain documents, but you are urged to read the documents yourself for complete information. The summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the complete text of the document.

Director independence 
Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. Carmona, Christodoro, Dunn, Gary, Graziano, LeFevre, Lynn, Montelongo and Nelson and Mmes. Otero and Paláu-Hernández is independent under Section 303A.02 of the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, Listed Company Manual and the Company's Categorical Standards of Independence, which are included as part of our Principles of Corporate Governance. Our Principles of Corporate Governance are available on our website at www.herbalife.com by following the links through "Investor Relations" to "Corporate Governance." The NYSE's independence guidelines and the Company's Categorical Standards include a series of objective tests, such as the person is not an employee of the Company and has not engaged in various types of business dealings involving the Company that would prevent the person from being an independent director. The Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that none of the foregoing directors had any relationship with the Company that would compromise his or her independence. 
Messrs. Tartol and Mendoza are not independent due to their status as Herbalife Nutrition Members. 
Messrs. Richard P. Bermingham and Keith Cozza, former directors who served on the Board through April 2018, were deemed independent under the NYSE listing standards and the Company's Categorical Standards of Independence. Mr. Pedro Cardoso, a former director who served on the Board through April 2018, was not independent due to his status as an Herbalife Nutrition Member. 
Dr. Carmona received $50,000 in speaking fees in 2018 as disclosed in the subsection "2018 Director Compensation". We leverage Dr. Carmona's professional experience as the 17th Surgeon General of the United States to provide training and education to Herbalife Nutrition Members at various Company-sponsored sales events, such as Extravaganzas. Additionally, Messrs. Christodoro, Cozza, Gary, Graziano, Lynn and Nelson are affiliated with the Icahn Parties (as defined in Part 3 — "Proposal 1: the election of directors"), which beneficially own approximately 35,227,904 Common Shares as of the Record Date. However, the Board of Directors affirmatively determined that such relationships did not compromise their independent judgment or their ability to act independent of the Company's management. 
Board meetings and attendance 
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, the Board of Directors held nine meetings. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate of the total number of meetings of the Board of Directors and the total number of meetings held by all committees of the Board of Directors during the period in which he or she served during 2018. Each director is expected to dedicate sufficient time, energy and attention to ensure the diligent performance of his or her duties, including attending meetings of the shareholders of the Company, the Board of Directors and committees of which he or she is a member. All current members of the Board of 
 Directors standing for election attended the Company's 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders. 
The independent members of the Board of Directors regularly meet in executive session, without the presence of management, which are held in conjunction with each regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Directors. These executive sessions are led by the Lead Director. Additional meetings of the Board of Directors, executive sessions of non-management directors and sessions of independent directors may be held from time to time as required or determined to be necessary. 
Board leadership 
Mr. Johnson is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and was a member of the Company's management in 2018, serving as Executive Chairman until January 2019. Mr. Johnson continues to be a member of the Company's management after he re-assumed the role as our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, beginning January 8, 2019. As Chairman and CEO, Mr. Johnson serves as a key link between the Board and other members of management. The Board believes having a board leadership structure featuring an executive as Chairman with a separate Lead Director best serves the interests of the Company and its shareholders because the Board believes that strong, independent Board leadership is a critical aspect of effective corporate governance. 
The Lead Director is an independent director elected for a two-year term by the independent directors. The appointment is reconsidered biannually, concurrently with our annual general meeting of shareholders. The Lead Director chairs the Board meetings during all executive sessions and when the Chairman is unable to participate in Board meetings, and is a contact point for major shareholders and third parties who wish to contact the Board independently of the Chairman and CEO.

The Board periodically reviews the structure of the Board and Company leadership as part of the succession planning process. 
The Board's role in risk oversight 
The full Board of Directors has the ultimate responsibility for risk oversight regarding the Company. The Board oversees a Company-wide approach to risk management, designed to enhance shareholder value and to support the achievement of strategic objectives and to improve long-term organizational performance. The first aspect of the Board's approach to risk oversight is to determine the appropriate level of risk for the Company generally, followed by an assessment of the specific risks the Company faces and the steps management is taking to manage those risks. The full Board's involvement in setting the Company's business strategy facilitates those assessments, culminating in the development of a strategic plan that reflects the Board's and management's consensus as to appropriate levels of risk for specific aspects of the Company's business and the appropriate measures to manage those risks. Additionally, the full Board of Directors participates in a periodic enterprise risk management assessment during its quarterly meetings. In this process, risk is assessed throughout the business with a focus on risks arising out of various aspects of the 
 Company's strategic plan and its implementation, including financial, legal, compliance, operational/strategic and compensation risks. The Board also assesses its role in risk oversight throughout the Company's business. In addition to the discussion of risk with the full Board at least once a year, the independent directors discuss risk management during executive sessions without management present with the Lead Director presiding. 
While the full Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various Board committees also have responsibility for risk management in their respective focus areas. In particular, the audit committee focuses on financial risk, including internal controls, and assesses the Company's risk profile with the Company's internal auditors. The internal controls risk profile drives the internal audit plan for the coming year. The audit committee also reviews risks related to the Company's cyber security matters and handles violations of the Company's Code of Ethics and related corporate policies. Finally, the compensation committee periodically reviews compensation practices and policies to confirm that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking. Management regularly reports on these risks to the relevant committee or the full Board, as appropriate, and additional review or reporting on enterprise risks is conducted as needed or as requested by the Board or the relevant committee.

 Common Shares and/or vested equity awards with a value equal to five times such director's annual retainer within two years of such director's appointment or election to the Board of Directors. In October 2018, the Board of Directors approved an update to this guideline to allow non-management directors up to five years from the date of such director's appointment or election to the Board of Directors to achieve the desired stock ownership guidelines, which aligns with the Company's stock ownership guidelines for named executive officers. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, all non-management directors and named executive officers are in compliance with the current guidelines.

Directors may at any time review a log of all communications received by the Company and addressed to members of the Board of Directors and request copies of any such correspondence.

Committees of the board 
Our Board of Directors has a standing audit committee, nominating and corporate governance committee, and compensation committee. Our Board of Directors has also constituted the implementation oversight committee as discussed below. 
Audit committee 
The audit committee currently consists of Messrs. LeFevre, Dunn and Nelson. From January 1, 2018 until April 24, 2018, the audit committee consisted of Messrs. Bermingham, Montelongo and Nelson. Each director who served on the audit committee in 2018 is independent as discussed under "Director Independence." As required by Rule 303A.07 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, the Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each of Messrs. LeFevre, Dunn and Nelson is "financially literate", and that Mr. LeFevre is an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K.
The Board also determined that former audit committee members Messrs. Bermingham and Montelongo were "financially literate" as required by Rule 303A.07 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and that Mr. Bermingham was an "audit committee financial expert," as defined in Item 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K. 
The principal duties of the audit committee include the following: 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the audit committee which is available on the Company's website at www.herbalife.com by following the links through "Investor Relations" to "Corporate Governance," and in print to any shareholder who requests it as set forth under Part 7 —"Annual report, financial and additional information." In 2018, the audit committee met thirteen times. 
Nominating and corporate governance committee 
The nominating and corporate governance committee currently consists of Ms. Otero and Messrs. Carmona, Christodoro and Lynn. Mr. Dunn served on the nominating and corporate governance committee from January 1, 2018 until April 24, 2018. Ms. Otero was appointed to the committee on April 24, 2018. 
Each director who served on the nominating and corporate governance committee in 2018 is independent as discussed under the subsection "Director Independence." The principal duties of the nominating and corporate governance committee are as follows: 
In identifying candidates to serve on the Board, the nominating and corporate governance committee first determines the evolving needs of the Board taking into account such factors as it deems appropriate. Such factors include, among others, the current composition of the Board of Directors, the range of talents, experiences and skills that would best complement those already represented on the Board of Directors, the balance of management and independent directors and the need for financial or other specialized expertise, as discussed in greater detail under Part 3 — "Proposal 1: The Election of Directors — Director Qualifications." The nominating and corporate governance committee also considers candidates for director suggested by its members and other directors, as well as by management and shareholders. The nominating and corporate governance committee may also retain a third-party executive search firm on an ad-hoc basis to identify and review candidates upon request of the committee from time to time. 
If the nominating and corporate governance committee decides, on the basis of its preliminary review, to proceed with further consideration, the committee members, as well as other directors as appropriate, interview the nominee. After completing this evaluation and interview, the nominating and corporate governance committee makes a recommendation to the full Board of Directors, which makes the final determination whether to nominate the candidate after considering the nominating and corporate governance committee's report. 
A shareholder who wishes to recommend a prospective nominee for the Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of the Company's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, or the Articles, should notify the Corporate Secretary in writing with the appropriate supporting materials, as more fully described under Part 7 — "Shareholder nominations." 
The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the nominating and corporate governance committee, which is available on the Company's website at www.herbalife.com by following the links through "Investor Relations" to "Corporate Governance" or in print to any shareholder who requests it as set forth under Part 7 — "Annual report, financial and additional information." In 2018, the nominating and corporate governance committee met six times.

Each director who served on the compensation committee in 2018 is independent as discussed under the subsection "Director Independence." The principal duties of the compensation committee include the following: 
Among other duties, the compensation committee is responsible for making the initial risk assessment of the Company's compensation programs and determining whether those programs require modification to remain consistent with the Board's determinations as to the levels of risk that are appropriate for the Company. In its assessment, the compensation committee reviewed the Company's compensation structure and noted numerous ways in which risk is potentially mitigated by practices and policies that include: the balanced mix between short- and long-term incentives; the use of multiple performance measures for the CEO's annual incentive awards; strong internal controls; the use of stock ownership guidelines; and the existence of an anti-hedging policy. In light of its analysis, the compensation committee believes that the architecture of the Company's compensation programs provides various safeguards to protect against undue risk-taking. 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for the compensation committee which is available on the Company's website at www.herbalife.com by following the links through "Investor Relations" to "Corporate Governance" or in print to any shareholder who requests it as set forth under Part 7 — "Annual report, financial and additional information." In 2018, the compensation committee met four times. 
Implementation oversight committee 
On July 28, 2016, the Board of Directors established the implementation oversight committee to oversee the implementation of the Federal Trade Commission's Consent Order entered into on July 15, 2016, or the Consent Order. The implementation oversight committee is comprised of independent members of the Board of Directors and was initially set to exist for a period of two years, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors. On July 23, 2018, the Board of Directors approved an amendment to the charter of the implementation oversight committee to extend the committee's existence until the committee or the Board of Directors determines otherwise. Mr. Nelson serves as chair, and Ms. Otero and Messrs. Christodoro and Lynn serve as members, of the implementation and oversight committee.

  Part 3       Proposals to be voted on at the meeting 
[END TABLE]
Proposal 1: The election of directors 
Generally 
The Articles presently provide for not less than one nor more than 15 directors. The Board of Directors, or the Board, has, by resolution, presently fixed the number of directors at 14. There currently is a full complement of 14 members of the Board. Directors are elected at each annual general meeting of shareholders to hold office for one-year terms until the next annual general meeting of shareholders. 
The Board has nominated each of Michael O. Johnson, Jeffrey T. Dunn, Richard H. Carmona, Jonathan Christodoro, Hunter C. Gary, Nicholas Graziano, Alan LeFevre, Jesse A. Lynn, Michael Montelongo, Juan Miguel Mendoza, James L. Nelson, Maria Otero, Margarita Paláu-Hernández and John Tartol for election as directors to serve one-year terms expiring at the 2020 annual general meeting. Each nominee is a current member of the Board. The nominations of Messrs. Christodoro, Gary, Graziano, Lynn, and Nelson were made pursuant to that certain Second Amended and Restated Support Agreement, or the Support Agreement, dated July 15, 2016, by and among the Company and Carl C. Icahn, Icahn Partners Master Fund LP, Icahn Offshore LP, Icahn Partners LP, Icahn Onshore LP, Beckton Corp., Hopper Investments LLC, Barberry Corp., High River Limited Partnership, Icahn Capital LP, IPH GP LLC, Icahn Enterprises Holdings L.P. and Icahn Enterprises G.P. Inc., or collectively, the Icahn Parties. A copy of the Support Agreement was filed by the Company in its current report on Form 8-K on July 15, 2016. In consideration of these nominations, the Icahn Parties have agreed to vote their Common Shares in favor of the Board's nominees for director at the Meeting and thereafter for so long as any Icahn Party designee is a member of the Board. As of the Record Date, the Icahn Parties beneficially own approximately 35,227,904 Common Shares. The Support Agreement also includes standstill and voting provisions applicable to the Icahn Parties' ownership of Common Shares. The Company did not receive any shareholder nominations for directors. 
The persons named as proxies on the accompanying proxy card intend to vote the Common Shares as to which they are granted authority to vote for the election of the nominees listed hereunder. The form of proxy card does not permit shareholders to vote for a greater number of nominees than 14. Although the Board does not know of any reason why any nominee will be unavailable for election, in the event any nominee should be unavailable at the time of the Meeting, the proxies may be voted for a substitute nominee as selected by the Board of Directors or just for the remaining nominees, leaving a vacancy. Alternatively, the Board may reduce the size of the Board. 
Director qualifications 
The Board believes that the Board, as a whole, should possess a combination of skills, professional experience and diversity of backgrounds necessary to oversee the Company's business. In addition, the Board believes that there are certain attributes that every director should possess, as reflected in the Board's membership criteria discussed hereunder. Accordingly, the Board and the nominating and corporate governance committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's overall composition, as well as the Company's current and future needs. 
The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for developing and recommending Board membership criteria to the Board for approval. The criteria, which are set forth in the Company's Principles of Corporate Governance, are available on the Company's website, www.herbalife.com, by following the links through "Investor Relations" to "Corporate Governance," and include business experience and skills, independence, judgment, integrity, the ability to commit sufficient time and attention to Board activities and the absence of potential conflicts with the Company's interests. In addition, the nominating and corporate governance committee periodically evaluates the composition of the Board to assess the skills and experience that are currently represented on the Board, as well as the skills and experiences that the Board will find valuable in the future, given the Company's current situation and strategic plans. The nominating and corporate governance committee seeks a variety of occupational, educational and personal backgrounds on the Board in order to obtain a range of viewpoints and perspectives and to enhance the diversity of the Board as a group in areas including professional experience, geography, race, gender, ethnicity and age. This periodic assessment of the Board's composition enables the Board to update the skills and experience it seeks in the Board as a whole, and in individual directors, as the Company's needs evolve and change over time and to assess the effectiveness of efforts at pursuing diversity. In identifying director candidates from time to time, the nominating and corporate governance committee may establish specific skills and experiences that it believes the Company should seek in order to constitute a balanced and effective Board. 
In evaluating director candidates, and considering incumbent directors for re-nomination to the Board, the nominating and corporate governance committee considers a variety of factors. These include each nominee's independence, financial literacy, personal and professional accomplishments and experience, each in light of the composition of the Board as a whole and the needs of the Company in general, and for incumbent directors, past performance on the Board. The nominating and corporate governance committee also considers the terms of the Support Agreement. The process undertaken by the nominating and corporate governance committee in recommending qualified director candidates is described in Part 2 under "Committees of the board — Nominating and corporate governance committee." 
Set forth below is biographical information about the 14 nominees standing for election at the Meeting, including each such person's specific experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that led our Board of Directors to conclude that such individual should serve on our Board of Directors. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES NAMED IN THIS PROXY STATEMENT TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

Mr. Tartol's qualifications to serve on our Board include his 37 years of experience as an independent Herbalife distributor, which brings a first-hand understanding of the function and specific needs of our independent Herbalife distributors, the ultimate drivers of our business, to the Board. His tenure as a distributor also provides valuable insight into the Company's growth and development over the 37-year period. 
Proposal 2: Approve, on an advisory basis, the Company's named executive officer compensation 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and encourage a long-term commitment from talented and high-performing executives to lead the Company's global success selling nutrition products including: food, dietary supplements and personal care products that are regulated at varying levels in the 94 countries where we operate through a direct selling independent sales organization. Our program is further designed to advance our shareholders' interests in a manner that is consistent with our Company value of "operating with integrity and transparency." The compensation program places strong emphasis on long-term sustainable growth and enhanced value for our shareholders through an annual equity grant program that rewards executives with the ability to participate in our share price appreciation and to share equally in potential downside if key targets that drive shareholder value are not achieved. By encouraging long-term performance and enhanced shareholder value, our executives are encouraged to operate our business with integrity, focusing on fostering strategic growth while being mindful to mitigate against risk. In addition to emphasizing long-term growth, our compensation program attracts talented executives by offering a competitive base salary and annual cash incentives, which encourages our executives to achieve short-term financial goals. 
The vast majority of the compensation of the Company's named executive officers — the officers identified in Part 4 — "Compensation discussion and analysis" — is tied to Company operating and share price performance. Volume Points, operating income and earnings per share (adjusted, as applicable) are used to determine executives' annual incentive compensation. Long term incentives were provided to our named executive officers in 2018 in the form of an annual grant of restricted stock units, or RSUs, which are subject to service criteria, and performance share units, or PSUs, which are subject to performance and service criteria. These awards directly align the long-term interests of our executives with those of our shareholders. 
At our 2018 annual general meeting, our shareholders expressed strong support for our 2017 executive compensation program, with approximately 98% of votes cast in favor of the advisory vote proposal. When designing our 2018 executive compensation program, the compensation committee of the Board of Directors, or the Committee, considered, among other things, the Company's growth, profit and non-financial objectives, benchmarking against market practices, the Company's financial performance, incentives that reward shareholder value creation and any shareholder feedback. 
We believe that the Company's financial performance is facilitated by the "pay for performance" design of our compensation program. Our program motivates our executives to deliver financial results, with the appropriate level of risk-taking, against three performance metrics in a manner that ultimately aligns with the realized growth of shareholder equity value. 
Additional information regarding the Company's compensation program applicable to the named executive officers is described in Part 4 — "Compensation discussion and analysis" and the related tables and narrative disclosure. For the reasons discussed above, the Board of Directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favor of the following resolution: 
"Resolved, that the shareholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K and described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the compensation tables and the accompanying narrative disclosure, in the proxy statement." 
While the shareholder vote on the resolution is non-binding, the Board of Directors values the opinions that shareholders express in their votes and in any additional dialogue. It will consider the outcome of the vote and those opinions when making future compensation decisions. The next shareholder advisory vote on the Company's executive compensation is expected to occur at the 2020 annual general meeting. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ADVISORY RESOLUTION ON THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION. 
Proposal 3: Ratification of the appointment of independent registered public accounting firm 
The audit committee has selected PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2018. Services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by PwC in fiscal years 2018 and 2017 are described below under "Fees to independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal years 2018 and 2017." Additional information regarding the audit committee is set forth in the "Audit committee report." 
The Articles do not require that our shareholders ratify the selection of PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. However, we are requesting ratification because we believe it is a matter of good corporate practice. If the Company's shareholders do not ratify the selection, the audit committee will reconsider whether or not to retain PwC, but may, nonetheless, retain PwC as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the audit committee in its discretion may change the appointment at any time if it determines that the change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. 
The Company has been advised that representatives of PwC will be present at the Meeting where they will have an opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Audit committee report 
The audit committee is responsible for monitoring our financial auditing, accounting and financial reporting processes and our system of internal controls, and selecting the independent registered public accounting firm on behalf of the Board of Directors. Our management has primary responsibility for our internal controls and reporting process. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PwC, is responsible for performing an independent audit of our consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or the PCAOB, and issuing an opinion thereon. In this context, the audit committee met regularly and held discussions with management and PwC. Management represented to the audit committee that the consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
The audit committee hereby reports as follows: 
Based on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the audit committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited consolidated financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, which have been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The audit committee also selected PwC to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.

Pre-approval policy 
The audit committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures for audit and non-audit services which the Company's independent auditors have historically provided. Pursuant to those policies and procedures, the

Strategic accomplishments 
In addition to the financial performance discussed above, the Company achieved key strategic accomplishments in 2018 that provided significant support for the Company's continued growth and success. These include: 
Compensation program that aligns pay and performance 
Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, motivate and encourage a long-term commitment from talented and high-performing executives to lead the Company's global success selling nutrition products. Our program is further designed to advance our shareholders' interests in a manner consistent with our Company value of "operating with integrity and transparency." The compensation program places strong emphasis on long-term sustainable growth and enhanced value for our shareholders through an annual equity grant program that rewards executives with the ability to participate in our share price appreciation and to share equally in potential downside if key targets that drive shareholder value are not achieved. By encouraging long-term performance and enhanced shareholder value, our executives are committed to operating our business with integrity, focusing on fostering strategic growth while being mindful to mitigate against risk. In addition to emphasizing long-term growth, our compensation program attracts talented executives by offering a competitive base salary and annual cash incentives, which encourage our executives to achieve short-term financial goals. The Committee has the responsibility for establishing, developing and implementing these programs while ensuring an appropriate level of risk-taking by the Company's executives. 
The direct compensation of our NEOs in 2018 consisted of base salary, annual cash incentives, and grants of equity in the form of performance share units, or PSUs and time-vesting restricted share units, or RSUs. To create, and reinforce, a "pay for performance" philosophy and culture and increase alignment with the expectations of investors in the Company, the annual cash incentives and equity components of compensation comprise the vast majority of the total compensation of our NEOs. In setting target compensation, the Committee annually reviews and assesses the total compensation opportunity for each NEO against comparable executives within the list of comparator companies selected by the Committee to serve as a market benchmark, along with other comparative factors. Although there is no targeted mix of compensation elements, the proportion of compensation designed to be delivered in variable pay versus base salary increases with the ability of the executive to influence overall Company performance. 
For 2018, the percentage of targeted direct compensation provided in the form of annual and long-term incentives tied to the Company's performance was 86% for our former Chief Executive Officer, and between 68% to 76% for our other NEOs. As reflected under the "2018 summary compensation table," actual compensation paid provided in the form of such incentives was 83% of total compensation for Mr. Goudis and between 72% to 79% of total compensation for our other NEOs. 
Targeted Direct Compensation Actual Direct Compensation Former CEO NEOs (other than 2018 CEO) Former CEO NEOs (other than 2018 CEO) 
Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. 
In 2018, grants to NEOs pursuant to our long-term incentive program consisted of PSUs (75%) and RSUs (25%). With this allocation of equity awards, the Company's executive compensation program retains its most effective feature, its direct emphasis on multi-year performance, which ensures that NEO pay is aligned with the Company's performance over several years, while also aligning the interests of NEOs with our shareholders through share ownership. The NEOs each received PSUs and RSUs in February 2018 as part of their long-term incentive award granted in the ordinary course. 
The use of PSUs accomplishes the following goals:

At our 2018 annual general meeting, our shareholders demonstrated their strong support of our executive compensation program, with approximately 98% of votes cast in favor of the advisory "say on pay" vote proposal. We believe this vote reflects strong support for our executive compensation program structure, which focuses on optimizing (a) incentives and metrics that result in the greatest degree of alignment with shareholder interests, and (b) recruitment, engagement, motivation and retention of executives. Although no changes were made to our executive compensation program based on the 2018 say-on-pay vote, we continue to evaluate our program to find ways we can further align management incentives with shareholder interests, which we view to be essential to our long-term success.

 Our executive compensation program is simple in design, and follows guidelines that have repeatedly proven effective in creating a pay for  performance culture, a keen focus on profitability as well as retaining key executives. These guidelines include:   ☑   tying the vast majority of the income  opportunity available to our NEOs to long-term growth in shareholder value;   ☑   incorporating a performance measure or measures  related to improving, in the case of PSUs, several metrics tied to creating shareholder value, to trigger the vesting of annual equity awards for all NEOs;   ☑   making annual incentive awards available only to  the extent key financial performance goals ensuring profitable and efficient business growth are achieved;   ☑   imposing caps on awards payable to each NEO  under our annual incentive plan;   ☑   imposing two additional caps on amounts payable under our annual incentive plan, so that aggregate payments to all employees collectively must be less than: (i) 10% of the  Companys Operating Income for the year, and (ii) the annual bonus payout to the most senior Herbalife Nutrition Members;   ☑   the Committee retaining and regularly consulting  with an independent compensation advisor;   ☑   the Committee annually reviewing current public data regarding the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group when compensation decisions are made;   ☑   subjecting our Section 16 officers to  compensation clawbacks in the event of a financial misstatement per the Companys clawback policy; and   ☑   encouraging our NEOs to hold Common Shares  and/or vested equity awards with an aggregate value equal to five times, with respect to our CEO, or two times, with respect to our other NEOs, their respective base salaries.     The Committee is committed to maintaining and adopting prevailing best practices with regard to executive compensation. As such, we DO NOT DO  the following:   ☒   we do not guarantee our executives any annual incentive award amounts  all annual bonuses require financial performance against annually established goals as established by  the Committee;   ☒   we do not re-price or back-date equity awards;   ☒   we do not issue equity awards with below market  exercise prices;   ☒   we do not provide supplemental retirement benefits;   ☒   we do not provide excise tax gross ups to our  NEOs;   ☒   we do not encourage excessive or imprudent risk-taking;   ☒   we do not provide benefits or perquisites to executive officers that are not provided to other employees, other than the spousal travel reimbursement; and   ☒   we do not permit employees to hedge, pledge,  short sell or engage in derivative transactions of our Common Shares  these types of transactions which are intended to lock in gain on share price appreciation are prohibited.

Executive compensation program objectives 
As a leader in the nutritional products industry, manufacturing approximately 60% to 65% of our own products that are sold through a direct selling distribution channel and generating approximately 80% of our net sales outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2018, we operate in an environment of challenging regulatory, economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Our success depends on the leadership of a highly-talented, adaptive and dedicated executive team. Our executive compensation program provides competitive rewards to our NEOs who contribute to our annual success in achieving growth in revenues and profitability, as well as making strategic decisions that should lead to increasing shareholder returns over time. 
The Committee believes that shareholder interests are advanced if the Company assembles, motivates and rewards a high-performing management team. To promote this objective, the Committee developed its executive compensation program guided by a "pay for performance" organizing framework and the resulting underlying principles listed below: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Principle    Implication on HLF  Program    Rationale 
 The program must attract and encourage a long-term commitment from talented executives necessary to lead our global nutrition  business and advance shareholders interests in a manner consistent with our company value of operating with integrity and transparency.        Strong emphasis on long-term incentives and shareholder value creation.     Performance considerations reflect  the Companys values and strategy and an appropriate balance of risk and reward.      Focus on long-term performance and shareholder value helps mitigate risk and encourages  growth.     Operating with integrity  and transparency is a key corporate value that must be central to how we conduct our business.

 Compensation opportunities must be competitive with the pay practices of companies that operate in global markets and able to  attract and retain high-performing, highly-employable executive talent with similar executive skills and capabilities.      Peer group reflects the market in which we reasonably compete for executive talent.     We reference both proxy-sourced  market data from our peer group as well as general industry survey data from Mercer (a nationally recognized compensation survey).     The Committees independent advisor provides the Committee with the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of market data to understand the scope of the market, with target  compensation for top executives spanning from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile based on a variety of factors, including individual  performance, internal equity, succession planning and business strategy.     Overall, our executives are within a competitive range of market, with appropriate variance based on  incumbent-specific characteristics.        The Company recruits high-performing executives with known track records in  competitive, complex and global businesses.     To attract the talent the Company needs to lead its business, compensation opportunities must be  reasonably attractive to similar opportunities at our peers.

 A majority of total compensation is at-risk and tied to achievement of annual  financial and non-financial performance goals and improvement in long-term shareholder value.      83% of actual 2018 compensation for Mr. Goudis, our former CEO who resigned in  January 2019, and between 72% and 79% of actual 2018 compensation for our other NEOs were incentive-based directly linked to performance.     75% of long-term incentives awarded in 2018 were  performance-based and 25% were time-vesting equity.     Value of PSUs align with sustained long-term shareholder value and vesting requires achievement of  performance goals that support our business.      Annual and long-term incentive plans use growth objectives, profit objectives, non-financial objectives. These plans are forward-looking and backward-looking, to ensure a comprehensive set of metrics are used to consider overall performance of the Company and our executive  team.

   Principle    Implication on HLF  Program    Rationale 
 Incentive compensation must provide superior pay for superior performance that meets or exceeds the expectations of our  shareholders.      Superior performance expectations are built into performance targets and ranges of our  incentive plans such that when incentive targets are met, the Company is exceeding peer financial performance and meeting shareholder expectations.     Our incentive plans are calibrated to deliver above-median compensation for meeting superior performance  targets, and, in the case of PSUs, deriving value through increased shareholder value.        The only way for our executives to earn above-market compensation is by meeting or  exceeding financial and non-financial goals.

Establishing CEO compensation 
The Chair of the Committee, with input from the independent compensation advisor, recommends the CEO's compensation to the Committee in an executive session not attended by the CEO. Once a recommendation has been established by the Committee, the CEO's compensation is reviewed with, and approved by, the independent members of the Board in an executive session. 
Role of executive officers in executive compensation decisions 
The CEO reviews compensation data gathered from a group of peer companies approved by the Committee and described under the subsection "— Peer Group", or the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group, and, along with general industry compensation surveys, considers each executive officer's performance and scope of responsibility, and makes a recommendation to the Committee on changes to base salary, annual incentive awards and equity awards for each executive officer other than himself. The CEO participates in Committee meetings at the Committee's request to provide relevant background information regarding the Company's strategic objectives and to evaluate the performance of and compensation recommendations for the other executive officers. The Committee utilizes the information provided by the CEO along with input from its independent compensation advisor and the knowledge and experience of Committee members in making compensation decisions. 
Base salaries 
Base salaries for our NEOs are intended to reflect the scope of their responsibilities, performance, skills and experience as compared with relevant and comparable market talent. When establishing base salaries for NEOs, the Committee considers market data and positions target pay for the NEOs based on a number of factors, including experience and tenure of the executive, scope of responsibilities, business performance and individual performance. 
The Committee reviews base salaries of our NEOs annually, generally in February. In its annual review of the base salaries for our NEOs for 2018, the Committee determined to have the base salaries of our NEOs remain generally unchanged. On May 1, 2018, Mr. DeSimone transitioned to the role of Co-President, Chief Strategic Officer, Dr. Agwunobi transitioned to the role of Co-President, Chief Health and Nutrition Officer, and Mr. Chiu transitioned to the role of Chief Financial Officer. In connection with the new roles assumed by Dr. Agwunobi and Mr. Chiu, the Committee approved changes to each of their base salaries. The Committee also approved changes to Mr. Pezzullo's base salary when he assumed additional responsibilities and direct reports in connection with the aforementioned transitions. The chart below shows the 2016 and 2017 base salaries for the NEOs, the base salaries approved by the Committee for 2018, the current base salaries as of December 31, 2018, and the rationale for the applicable salary changes.

Annual incentive awards & long-term incentive program 
Annual incentive awards 
Our annual cash incentive plan is designed to motivate and reward the achievement of annual financial targets that create value for our shareholders. The Committee establishes financial performance targets and goals for our annual incentive plan each year, taking into consideration that such targets and goals align with and support the Company's business strategy, recognize current business conditions, align with the current year financial budget, align with Wall Street analysts and public investor expectations and require performance that is competitive with those of the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group. The criteria used for 2018 consisted of targeted Volume Points, serving as a proxy for sales, and targeted Operating Income, subject to adjustments as discussed below, which ensures our executives make decisions that improve our profitability. 
In addition to setting performance targets, the Committee has established two limits within the annual incentive plan that can affect the aggregate value of the awards. The first limit is the requirement that the aggregate payments made under the annual incentive plan cannot exceed 10% of the Company's Operating Income for the year. The second limit is the requirement that the total bonus payout to all employees of the Company should not exceed the annual bonus payout to the most senior Herbalife Nutrition Members. 
Incentive bonus awards are subject to approval by the Committee, and continuous employment through the date such bonus award payment is made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, may provide for payment of any incentive bonus award to a terminated employee, which award shall be paid at the time incentive bonus awards are paid to active employees. 
Mr. Goudis' annual target opportunity as a percentage of his base salary during 2018 was set forth in his November 2016 employment agreement, which became effective on June 1, 2017. That agreement provided for an annual target bonus opportunity equal to 120% of Mr. Goudis' base salary. 
 Subject to the limits described above, target incentives for our executives are set by the Committee depending on the employee's position, scope of responsibilities, ability to influence Company results, and competitive pay practices among the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group. 
The chart below summarizes the 2018 annual incentive plan performance measures and weightings for our NEOs.

Targets and award determination 
Annual financial performance targets are aligned to what we believe to be the expectations of our investors and what we believe is achievable at the time of the annual budget review process. The annual budget review for the 2018 performance period occurred in February 2018. Budget figures are built from the "bottom up" based on input from operating regions regarding trends in their respective markets, including the general economic environment, sale and consumption of our products, sales leader activity and retention, and the degree of risk in achieving forecasted revenue and expense levels. 
For purposes of our annual incentive plan, the performance measures are defined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       certain products or markets in order to better align qualification thresholds across markets. Any changes to this approach may have an impact on the use of Volume Points as a proxy for sales  trends in future periods.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that the Company's financial performance is facilitated by the "pay for performance" design of our compensation program. Our program motivates our NEOs to deliver financial results, with the appropriate level of risk-taking, against performance metrics in a manner that ultimately aligns with the realized growth of shareholder equity value. Our NEOs have the opportunity to earn annual incentive awards provided that the Company achieves aggressive growth targets in Volume Points and Operating Income. 
Because we assign a Volume Point value to a product when it is first introduced into a market, which value is unaffected by subsequent exchange rate and price changes, we believe that Volume Points exhibit the most accurate available measure of organic growth or decline in the local demand for our products. 
Motivating Operating Income growth ensures that Volume Point growth is achieved in a cost-effective manner and that cost efficiencies and productivity enhancements are pursued throughout the Company. 
The following table shows the performance targets set by the Committee with respect to 2018 and the Company's performance relative to those targets.

With the exception of Dr. Agwunobi, who became an executive officer in May 2018, when he was promoted to Co-President, annual incentive awards for 2018 are payable to our NEOs only if and to the extent Volume Points or Operating Income meet and exceed 95% of the applicable performance target. Targets are set at budget during the annual budget process, and modified, if necessary, at the first Board meeting of the performance period. For 2018 annual incentive plan performance purposes, our Operating Income was calculated consistent with our adjusted EPS presentations and earnings guidance provided to the investment community, adjusting for: 
Our Operating Income was further adjusted to include the following for bonus purposes: 
For 2018, other than Dr. Agwunobi who was not an executive officer until May 2018, target-level bonuses were awarded for results between 95% and 108% of the applicable target, and bonus awards above 96.25% of target increase on a prorated basis in steps. Should 95% of the applicable financial target not be achieved, there is no bonus funding or payouts to the NEOs. The Committee determined to increase the maximum percentage to 108% in order to encourage the Company's high performance culture. This bonus scale is designed to encourage realistic target-setting and prudent risk-taking while simultaneously creating consequences for not meeting target and capping the potential payout in order to avoid excessive incentive awards as compared to performance. Our 2018 annual incentive opportunities as a percentage of base salary were established as follows:

Long-term incentive awards 
Each year, the Committee determines the form of equity grant. For 2018, to further align our compensation program for our NEOs with the interests of our shareholders, the Committee updated the equity mix and the performance measures applicable to long-term incentive awards to be comprised of 75% PSUs and 25% RSUs. 
Additional details of the 2018 equity awards made to our NEOs can be found below and in the tabular disclosure below under "— 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards."

Performance Share Units 
In 2018, the Committee utilized PSUs as part of the Company's long-term incentive program. All such PSUs awarded in 2018 will vest on December 31, 2020, subject to the Company's achievement of the performance targets set by the Committee as measured over the three-year performance period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020, subject further to continued Company service. Such targets were established based on the Company's five-year plan reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors in October 2017, and again in February 2018, or the Five-Year Plan. The number of PSUs that will become earned and vested will be determined based on the Company's performance against the performance targets. As such, the minimum number of PSUs that may become earned is zero. The maximum number of PSUs that may become earned and vested is 200% of the PSU award granted to the participant. 
The number of PSUs that will become earned upon vesting is based on achievement of performance targets for Local Currency Net Sales, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EPS. Each of these metrics makes up one-third of the PSU award granted to the NEOs, and are defined as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     acquisitions, and divestitures not assumed in the Five-Year Plan, and adjusted to reflect currency rates assumed in the Five-Year Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
       China grant income; impact from business acquisitions and dispositions; impact from new accounting pronouncements adopted; one-time costs related to  internal restructuring transactions; valuation allowances for income tax and prior period tax settlement cost or accruals relating to income tax; changes in debt costs, capital structure and share count from the Five-Year Plan; non-cash interest costs relating to the Company's convertible notes and prepaid forward share repurchase contract; and excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation exercises.  
[END TABLE]
We believe that the grant of PSUs increases the alignment of equity compensation with shareholder value and reward our NEOs for accelerating the Company's growth. Further, if PSUs are earned, the NEOs will be aligned with shareholders through share ownership. PSUs comprised 75% of the Company's 2018 long-term incentive program for our NEOs. 
Restricted Stock Units 
The Committee incorporated RSUs as a component of long-term equity compensation to the executive officers in order to align the Company's compensation program with general market practices and align executives with shareholders through share ownership. RSUs awarded to our NEOs in fiscal year 2018 will vest, subject to continued employment, in three annual installments: 20% on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and 60% on the third anniversary of the grant date. RSUs comprised 25% of the Company's 2018 long-term incentive program for our NEOs. 
Equity award grant policy 
It is the Company's policy to make annual equity grants to all eligible employees during an "open trading window," which typically begins the second trading day following our release of quarterly financial results. We also follow a quarterly grant approval process where awards are authorized for newly-hired employees and to newly promoted executives other than our executive officers. All equity awards made to our NEOs and other executives are made pursuant to this equity grant policy, which was approved by the Committee. 
We encourage all Section 16 officers to utilize a 10b5-1 plan when exercising or selling any of the Company's equity. 
Hedging 
Because hedging transactions often result in the establishment of a short position in company securities and limit or eliminate an employee's ability to profit from an increase in value of a company's securities, Company policy prohibits all employees, including Section 16 Officers, from entering into hedging transactions with respect to the Company's Common Shares. 
Pledging 
Company policy prohibits executives from pledging their Common Shares as collateral for a loan or for any other purpose. 
Clawback policy 
The Board has adopted a policy that enables it to clawback incentive compensation earned by our Section 16 Officers and any other employee under certain circumstances as determined by the Board. 
Benefits and perquisites 
The Company's U.S.-based employees, including the NEOs, participate in a variety of savings, health and welfare and paid time-off benefits typically provided by competitors for the services of the Company's employees. Health and welfare and paid time-off benefits help ensure that the Company has a healthy, productive and focused workforce. 
In addition, in fiscal year 2018, our NEOs were eligible to participate in the following executive benefits and perquisites: 
The Company does not provide benefits or perquisites to executive officers that are not provided to other employees, other than the spousal travel reimbursement, which we provide to support important business objectives. Building strong relations with Herbalife Nutrition Members is critical to our business. We host worldwide Member events to continue to strengthen our relations with Herbalife Nutrition Members and encourage our senior executives to invite their spouses or partners, as the case may be, to attend certain international Member events to help foster and build relationships with Herbalife Nutrition Members and their spouses or partners. Beginning August 2018, we reimburse senior executives for authorized travel expenses of an accompanying spouse or partner to Member events, including any related tax impact, in support of the Company's business. 
Employment and severance agreements 
The Company previously entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Goudis, our former Chief Executive Officer. The agreement established the terms and conditions for the employment relationship the former executive had with the Company during 2018 and specified compensation, executive benefits, preservation of confidential and proprietary information, non-solicitation, non-disparagement, and other conditions. 
In conjunction with his resignation in January 2019, Mr. Goudis entered into the Separation Agreement, pursuant to which Mr. Goudis: (i) will not compete with the Company and its business between January 8, 2019 and December 31, 2019, or the Relevant Period, (ii) will not solicit any of the Company's employees, distributors or customers during the Relevant Period, (iii) will not disparage, defame or make any negative or derogatory statements about the Company or any of its affiliates, past or current officers, directors, employees or members, and (iv) will cooperate with the Company in connection with any internal or external investigations. Additionally, the Separation Agreement includes a customary general release by Mr. Goudis of all claims against the Company and its affiliates and reinforces Mr. Goudis' obligation to not disclose any confidential information. The foregoing items are collectively referred to as the Payment Requirements. In exchange for the foregoing, the Company will pay Mr. Goudis remuneration in the amount of $3,500,000, seventy-five percent (75%) of which will be paid in equal installments between January 8, 2019 and November 30, 2019, and twenty-five percent (25%) of which will be paid in a lump sum on the first regular payroll day after December 1, 2019. All such payments are contingent upon Mr. Goudis' continued compliance with the Payment Requirements. Breach of any of the Payment Requirements will allow the Company to terminate any additional payments and recoup any previously paid amounts. Furthermore, the Separation Agreement provided that all of Mr. Goudis' unvested equity awards would be forfeited, and any vested and unexercised stock appreciation rights would expire in accordance with their existing terms. 
The Company has also previously entered into a severance agreement with Mr. DeSimone. The agreement contains severance and change in control provisions as detailed further below. Further, Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi, participate in the Herbalife International of America, Inc. Executive Officer Severance Plan, or the Severance Plan, which was approved by the Committee on October 31, 2016 and made effective as of November 1, 2016. Mr. Goudis was also a participant of the Severance Plan prior to his separation from the Company in January 2019. 
As a result of these agreements, each of the NEOs who are still with the Company is eligible for certain benefits and payments if his employment terminates for various reasons or as a result of a change in control of the Company, as applicable. The Company has provided these benefits to these NEOs to allow them to focus on the value of strategic alternatives to shareholders without concern for the impact on their continued employment, as each of their offices is at heightened risk of turnover in the event of a change in control. Separation benefits include cash payments and other benefits in an amount the Company believes is appropriate, taking into account the time it is expected to take a separated executive to find another job. Separation benefits are intended to ease the consequences to the executive of an unexpected termination of employment. The Company requires a general release with non-compete and non-solicitation provisions in connection with the individual separation agreements. 
We consider it likely that it will take more time for higher-level employees to find new employment commensurate with their prior experience, and therefore senior management generally are paid severance for a longer period. Additional payments may be approved by the Committee in some circumstances as a result of negotiation with executives, especially where the Company desires particular non-disparagement, cooperation with litigation, non-competition and non-solicitation terms. 
The severance agreement for Mr. DeSimone and the Severance Plan specifically detail various provisions for benefits and cash payments in the event of a separation. Generally, these agreements provide for certain benefits upon death, disability, resignation by the executive with good reason or termination by the Company without cause. They also provide for the acceleration of unvested equity awards in connection with a change in control. 
The equity compensation awards granted to the NEOs contain change in control and termination provisions. In general, these arrangements provide for benefits upon a termination of such executive's employment in connection with a change in control. These arrangements are intended to preserve morale and productivity and encourage retention in the face of the disruptive impact of a change in control of the Company. Based on a competitive analysis of the severance and change in control arrangements maintained by the corporations in the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group, the Committee believes that these benefits are customary among the Herbalife Peer Group for executives in similar positions as these three executives. Please refer to the discussion under "— Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control" for a more detailed discussion of our severance and change in control arrangements. 
Compensation advisor 
The Committee retained Meridian Compensation Partners LLC through 2018 to assist in evaluating our executive compensation programs and in setting executive officer compensation. 
During its period of engagement in 2018, Meridian regularly participated in Committee meetings and advised the Committee with respect to compensation trends and best practices, plan design, competitive pay levels, CEO long-term performance equity grants, individual pay decisions with respect to our NEOs and other executive officers, and proxy statement disclosure. While Meridian regularly consulted with management in performing work requested by the Committee, Meridian did not perform any separate services for management. 
The Committee has determined that Meridian is independent and that its work with the Committee during fiscal year 2018 did not raise any conflict of interest. 
Peer group 
Our level of compensation for our NEOs was compared to compensation paid by the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group. The criteria used to identify the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group were: (1) principal operations in the U.S. with an international presence — we operate in 94 countries around the world in a highly regulated business where approximately 80% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, were generated outside of the United States; (2) financial scope — our management talent should be similar to that of companies of a similar size in terms of revenues and market capitalization; (3) industry — we compete for talent with other companies in consumer product related industries; and (4) common "peer of peers" — we examined companies that are most frequently considered peers by Herbalife Nutrition's peers. Annually, the Committee reviews the peer group and updates the group as appropriate. 
With respect to pay decisions regarding 2018 NEO compensation, the industry peer group was comprised of the fourteen (14) companies listed below. All of the peer companies were within the range of approximately 50% and 180% of Herbalife's trailing twelve-month revenues at the time the peer group was established in July 2017. The peer group median revenue of $4.0 billion and median market capitalization of $6.2 billion, in each case at the time the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group was established, were comparable to those of Herbalife Nutrition. During this period, the Herbalife Nutrition Peer Group consisted of the following:

Tax implications 
Section 162(m) of the Code 
The Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Prior to the enactment of such law, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed a tax deduction for compensation over $1 million paid to our NEOs who are "covered employees" under this rule. Performance-based compensation was exempt from this deduction limitation if specified requirements set forth in the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations were met. Our 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, 2014 Stock Incentive Plan, grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights and PSUs were designed with the intent to be deductible (or, as applicable, permit the grant of awards that could be deductible) under Section 162(m). Commencing with our fiscal year 2018 year, the Tax Act eliminated the performance-based compensation exception to the deductibility limitation under Section 162(m), other than with respect to certain "grandfathered" performance-based awards granted prior to November 2, 2017; provided such awards are not materially modified. 
As in prior years, the Committee will continue to take into account the tax and accounting implications (including with respect to the expected lack of deductibility under the revised Section 162(m)) when making compensation decisions, but reserves its right to continue to make compensation decisions based on other factors if it determines that it is in the best interests of the 
 Company and its shareholders to do so. Further, considering the elimination of the exception for performance-based compensation, the Committee may determine to make changes or amendments to the Company's existing compensation programs in order to revise aspects of our executive compensation programs that were initially designed to comply with Section 162(m) but that may no longer serve as an appropriate incentive measure for our executive officers. Finally, interpretations of and changes in applicable tax laws and regulations, as well as other factors beyond the control of the Committee, may affect deductibility of compensation, and there can be no assurance that compensation paid to our executive officers who are covered by Section 162(m) will be deductible in the future.

Narrative disclosure to summary compensation table and grants of plan-based awards 
Equity Awards. In fiscal year 2018, we granted each of our NEOs long-term performance-based compensation in the form of PSUs and RSUs. The number of PSUs granted was calculated by dividing 75% of the total equity award value by the closing price of our stock on the date of grant. All equity awards shown in this table were granted under the 2014 Stock Plan. PSUs awarded to our NEOs in fiscal year 2018 will vest, subject to continued employment, on December 31, 2020 subject to the achievement of the performance targets set by the Committee as measured over the performance period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2020 as determined by the Committee. Such targets were established based on the Five-Year Plan. The number of PSUs that will become earned and vested will be determined based on the Company's performance against the performance targets. As such, the minimum number of PSUs that may become earned and vested is 0%. The maximum number of PSUs that may become earned and vested is 200% of the PSU award granted to the participant. The final number of PSUs earned also will be based on achievement of Local Currency Net Sales, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EPS targets as further discussed in the "Long-Term Incentive Awards" section. RSUs awarded to our NEOs in fiscal year 2018 will vest, subject to continued employment, in three annual installments: 20% on the first and second anniversaries of the grant date and 60% on the third anniversary of the grant date. 
 The circumstances pursuant to which the vest of PSUs and RSUs accelerate are described below in the section entitled "— Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation Awards. These amounts reflect the potential threshold, target and maximum annual incentive bonus awards payable to our NEOs as annual incentive bonuses for fiscal year 2018. Target bonus amounts assume achievement of the objective goals at the target amounts. Maximum bonus amounts assume achievement of the objective goals at the maximum for a payout of 200% of target. The NEOs received actual bonuses for fiscal year 2018 in the amounts shown in the "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
Richard Goudis. Herbalife International of America, Inc. entered into an amended and restated executive employment agreement with Mr. Goudis effective as of June 1, 2017, pursuant to which he served as the Company's Chief Executive Officer during fiscal year 2018. Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Goudis received an annual salary of $1,000,000. In conjunction with his resignation in January 2019, Mr. Goudis entered into the Separation Agreement, pursuant to which all of Mr. Goudis' unvested equity awards were forfeited, and any vested and unexercised stock appreciation rights would expire in accordance with their existing terms. Additional details of the Separation Agreement can be found above under "— Employment and Severance Agreements."

[END TABLE]
Non-qualified deferred compensation plans.    We maintain the Senior Executive Plan, which is applicable to eligible employees at the rank of Senior Vice President and higher. 
The Senior Executive Plan is unfunded and benefits are paid from the Company's general assets, except that the Company has contributed amounts to a "rabbi trust" whose assets will be used to pay benefits if we remain solvent, but can be reached by our creditors if we become insolvent. The Senior Executive Plan allows eligible employees, who are selected by the administrative committee that manages and administers the plan, or the Deferred Compensation Committee, to elect annually to defer up to 75% of their annual base salary and up to 
 100% of their annual bonus for each calendar year, or the Annual Deferral Amount. We make matching contributions on behalf of each participant in the Senior Executive Plan, which matching contributions are 100% vested at all times. 
Effective January 1, 2013, the matching contribution under the Senior Executive Plan was changed to 3.5% of a participant's annual base salary in excess of the qualified plan annual compensation limit and the amount by which deferrals reduce 401(k) eligible pay below the IRS limit. 
Each participant in the Senior Executive Plan may determine how his or her Annual Deferral Amount and matching contributions, if any, will be deemed to be invested by choosing among several investment funds or indices designated by the Deferred Compensation Committee. The Senior Executive Plan, however, does not require us to actually acquire or hold any investment fund or other assets to fund the Senior Executive Plan. The entire interest of each participant in the Senior Executive Plan is always fully vested and non-forfeitable. 
In connection with a participant's election to defer an Annual Deferral Amount, the participant may also elect to receive a "Scheduled In-Service Withdrawal" equal to the Annual Deferral Amount and the matching contributions, if any, attributable thereto plus earnings, and shall be payable two or more years after the end of the plan year in which the Annual Deferral Amount is actually deferred. As of January 2004, the Senior Executive Plan was amended to allow for deferral of the short-term payout date if the deferral is made within the time period specified therein. Subject to the short-term payout provision and specified exceptions for unforeseeable financial emergencies, a participant may not withdraw, without incurring a ten percent (10%) withdrawal penalty, all or any portion of his or her account under the Senior Executive Plan prior to the date that such participant either (1) is determined by the Deferred Compensation Committee to have incurred permanent and total disability or (2) dies or otherwise terminates employment. 
Potential payments upon termination or change in control 
The information below describes certain compensation that would have become payable under existing plans and contractual arrangements assuming a termination of employment and/or change in control had occurred on December 31, 2018 based upon the closing price of a Common Share on the NYSE on December 31, 2018 of $58.95, given the NEOs' compensation and service levels as of such date. In addition to the benefits described below, upon any termination of employment, each of the NEOs would also be entitled to the amount shown in the column labeled "Aggregate Balance at Last FYE" in the "2018 Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation" table. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an employment agreement that was effective for fiscal year 2018 with Mr. Goudis and a severance agreement that was effective for fiscal year 2018 with Mr. DeSimone. On October 31, 2016, the Committee approved the Severance Plan. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, Messrs. Goudis, Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi were participants in the Severance Plan. Our other executive officers other than the Executive Chairman are eligible to participate in the Severance Plan, subject to being designated to participate by the Committee. The employment agreement, severance agreement and participation in the Severance Plan are described in more detail below. In addition, the Company has also entered into award agreements governing the equity-based compensation awards (including RSUs and PSUs) granted to each of the NEOs. 
Richard Goudis 
Pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Goudis' employment could have been terminated at any time for any reason or for no reason without payment on termination. 
Under the Severance Plan, in the event Mr. Goudis' employment was terminated by Herbalife International of America, Inc. without "Cause" (as defined in the Severance Plan), other than in connection with his death or disability, or by Mr. Goudis for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Severance Plan), he would have been entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal to 2.0x his annualized base salary, which lump sum amount as of December 31, 2018 was equal to $2,000,000, reduced to 1.5x after five years of participation in the Severance Plan, and a payment of a pro-rata annual cash bonus payment for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurred (based on the actual performance of Herbalife International of America, Inc. over the entire year and the number of days worked by Mr. Goudis in such year), payable at the same time as bonuses were paid to executives generally for such year. In the event Mr. Goudis' employment was terminated for reason of death, disability, for Cause or resignation without Good Reason, Mr. Goudis would not have received any payments other than for accrued but unpaid obligations. Payment of the severance payment was subject to and conditioned upon the execution of a general release in favor of the Company and additional requirements set forth in the Severance Plan. 
Mr. Goudis' award agreements that governed his stock appreciation rights and RSUs contained change in control and termination provisions. The Committee could have accelerated the vesting of Mr. Goudis' awards in the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the 2014 Plan. Except as set forth above, all unvested stock appreciation rights and RSUs would have been forfeited upon the termination of Mr. Goudis' employment with the Company. 
Pursuant to Mr. Goudis' PSU award agreement, upon a Change in Control, as defined in the 2014 Plan, Mr. Goudis would have had the right to receive a payment based on performance through a date determined by the Committee prior to the Change in Control, unless such performance could not have been determined, in which case Mr. Goudis would have had the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable. Additionally, under Mr. Goudis' PSU award agreement, if Mr. Goudis' employment had been terminated prior to the vesting of his PSUs, such unvested PSUs would have been forfeited. 
Pursuant to Mr. Goudis' Separation Agreement, Mr. Goudis forfeited all of his unvested equity awards and non-equity incentive awards, and no Change in Control payments were made. Additional details of the Separation Agreement can be found above under "— Employment and Severance Agreements." 
John G. DeSimone 
Pursuant to our severance agreement with John DeSimone, or the DeSimone Severance Agreement, if Mr. DeSimone is terminated by the Company without Cause or resigns for Good Reason, each as defined below, he is entitled to be paid a lump sum amount equal to two times his then current annual salary, which lump sum amount as of December 31, 2018 was equal to $1,238,000, in addition to all other accrued but unpaid entitlements. The Company will also provide Mr. DeSimone with outplacement services for up to six months by a provider selected and paid for by the Company in an amount not to exceed $20,000. In the event that Mr. DeSimone is qualified for and elects COBRA coverage under the Company's health plans after a termination without Cause or a resignation for Good Reason, the Company will continue to pay its share of the cost of premiums under such plans until Mr. DeSimone is reemployed, or for a period of two years, whichever occurs first. If Mr. DeSimone is terminated by the Company without Cause, resigns for Good Reason, or retires, dies, or resigns as a result of a disability, he will be entitled to receive a pro rata bonus payment, at such time bonuses are paid to the Company's other senior executives, based on the number of months worked in the applicable year. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, as defined below, 100% of all unvested stock options, stock appreciation rights and stock unit awards granted to Mr. DeSimone prior to or after the date of the DeSimone Severance Agreement will immediately vest and, to the extent applicable, become exercisable as of immediately prior to such Change of Control. As a precondition to the Company's obligation to pay the amounts described above, Mr. DeSimone must execute a general release of claims. 
Mr. DeSimone's award agreements governing his stock appreciation rights and RSUs contain change in control and termination provisions. The Committee may accelerate the vesting of Mr. DeSimone's awards in the event of a Change in Control, as defined in the 2014 Plan. Except as set forth above, all unvested stock appreciation rights and RSUs shall be forfeited upon the termination of Mr. DeSimone's employment with the Company. 
Pursuant to Mr. DeSimone's PSU award agreements, upon a Change in Control, as defined in the 2014 Plan, Mr. DeSimone will have the right to receive a payment based on performance through a date determined by the Committee prior to the Change in Control, unless such performance cannot be determined, in which case Mr. DeSimone has the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable. If Mr. DeSimone's employment is terminated prior to the vesting of his PSUs, such unvested PSUs will be forfeited. 
Dr. John Agwunobi, David Pezzullo and Shin-Shing Bosco Chiu 
Under the Severance Plan, in the event Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi's respective employments are terminated by Herbalife International of America, Inc. without "Cause" (as defined in the Severance Plan), other than in connection with their death or disability, or by Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Severance Plan), they will be entitled to a lump sum severance payment equal to 1.0x their annualized base salary, which lump sum amount as of December 31, 2018 was equal to $565,000, $430,000 and $525,000, respectively, reduced to 0.5x after five years of participation in the Severance Plan, and a payment of a pro-rata annual cash bonus payment for the fiscal year in which the date of termination occurs (based on the actual performance of Herbalife International of America, Inc. over the entire year and the number of days worked by each of Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi in such year), payable at the same time as bonuses are paid to executives generally for such year. Payment of the severance payment is subject to and conditioned upon the execution of a general release in favor of the Company and additional requirements set forth in the Severance Plan. 
Pursuant to each of Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi's stock appreciation rights and RSU award agreements, the Committee has the discretion to accelerate the vesting of stock appreciation rights and RSUs upon a Change in Control, as such term is defined in the 2014 Plan. If Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi's respective employments are terminated prior to the vesting of his stock appreciation rights and RSUs, such unvested stock appreciation rights and RSUs will be forfeited. 
Pursuant to each of Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi's PSU award agreements, upon a Change in Control, as defined in the 2014 Plan, Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi each will have the right to receive a payment based on performance through a date determined by the Committee prior to the Change in Control, unless such performance cannot be determined, in which case Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi will each have the right to receive a payment equal to the target amount payable. If Messrs. Pezzullo, Chiu and Dr. Agwunobi's respective employments are terminated prior to the vesting of his PSUs, such unvested PSUs will be forfeited.

Pay ratio disclosure 
In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer. Mr. Goudis, who was our CEO in 2018, had an annual total compensation in 2018 of $6,111,730. For purposes of determining the required ratio, in order to better reflect our employee compensation practices, annual total compensation for our median employee and for our CEO includes the dollar value of non-discriminatory medical, dental and vision benefits and employer contributions for disability insurance coverage and our employee assistance program, which are not required to be reported as compensation for our CEO in the Summary Compensation Table included in this Proxy Statement. Our median employee's annual total compensation for 2018 was $37,220. As a result, we estimate that Mr. Goudis' 2018 annual total compensation was approximately 164 times that of our median employee. 
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Goudis' Separation Agreement, Mr. Goudis forfeited his eligibility for a cash incentive award for 2018 as of January 8, 2019. The above estimate gives effect to the forfeiture of such cash incentive award. Mr. Goudis' 2018 annual total compensation would have been approximately 224 times that of our median employee but for his separation. 
The SEC's rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their employee populations and compensation practices. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies have different employee populations and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
The reported pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. For these purposes, we identified the median compensated employee using base salary and bonus paid from October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018, which we annualized for any employee who did not work for the entire year. We identified our employee population as of October 1, 2018 based on our Human Resources records.

Beneficial ownership 
The following table sets forth the beneficial ownership of Common Shares as of February 26, 2019, the Record Date, of (1) each director, (2) each of the named executive officers, (3) all directors and executive officers as a group and (4) each person or entity known to the Company to beneficially own more than five percent (5%) of outstanding Common Shares. The Common Shares are the Company's only class of voting securities that are issued and outstanding. 
Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting and investment power with respect to Common Shares. Except as otherwise indicated below, to our knowledge, all persons listed below have sole voting and investment power with respect to their Common Shares, except to the extent authority is shared by spouses under applicable law. Common Shares subject to stock options, warrants and other equity awards that are exercisable or have vested or will become exercisable or vest within 60 days of February 26, 2019 are considered outstanding and beneficially owned by the person holding the security for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of that person, but are not treated as outstanding for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person.

[END TABLE]
The Company has several written policies applicable to the review and approval of related party transactions. Pursuant to the audit committee charter, any related party transaction in which a director has an interest must be reviewed and approved by the audit committee. The Company's Conflicts of Interest Policy generally prohibits any Company employee from conducting any activity that is or could be construed as a conflict with the Company's interests or as an interference with the employee's duty to serve the Company at all times to the best of his or her ability. Pursuant to that policy, any related party transaction involving employees, including executive officers, must be reviewed and approved by both the Company's legal and internal audit departments. 
In February 2016, our Board of Directors approved a written policy, or the Related Party Transaction Policy, regarding the consideration by the audit committee of transactions between the Company and any director, officer or holder of more than 5% of our voting securities and their affiliates (each, a related party) involving or expected to involve an amount of at least $120,000 in which the related party has a direct or indirect interest. 
 Transactions, along with all relevant facts and circumstances, shall be submitted to the audit committee for consideration unless it is not possible to convene an audit committee meeting, in which case the chair of the audit committee may review the transaction, with his or her determination submitted to the full audit committee for its review and consideration at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Related Party Transaction Policy also outlines certain transactions that are deemed to be pre-approved by the audit committee. The Related Party Transaction Policy is in addition to the Company's Conflicts of Interest Policy described above. 
The transactions summarized under the subsection "Transactions prior to Related Party Transaction Policy" were entered into prior to the implementation of the Related Party Transaction Policy. Mr. Tartol's family's earnings, Mr. Mendoza's family's earnings, and the compensation of the spouse of one of our non-NEO executive officers summarized under the subsection "Other transactions" fall within the category of transactions that are deemed to be pre-approved pursuant to the Related Party Transaction Policy. 
Transactions prior to Related Party Transaction Policy 
Registration rights agreement 
Michael O. Johnson, our Chairman and CEO, is a party to a registration rights agreement with the Company. If we at any time propose to register any Company securities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, for sale to the public, in certain circumstances, Mr. Johnson may require us to include his shares in the securities to be covered by the registration statement. Such registration rights are subject to customary limitations specified in the agreement. 
Indemnification of directors and officers 
The Articles provide that, to the fullest extent permitted by Cayman Islands Law, every director, agent or officer of the Company shall be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against any liability incurred by him as a result of any act or failure to act in carrying out his functions other than such liability (if any) that he may incur by his own willful misconduct. To the fullest extent permitted by Cayman Islands Law, such director, agent or officer shall not be liable to the Company for any loss or damage in carrying out his functions unless the liability arises through the willful misconduct of such director, agent or officer. 
The Company is a Cayman Islands exempted company incorporated with limited liability. As such, it is governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands with respect to the indemnification provisions. Cayman Islands law does not limit the extent to which a company's articles of association may provide for indemnification of officers and directors, except to the extent any such provision may be held by the Cayman Islands courts to be contrary to public policy, such as to provide indemnification against civil fraud or the consequences of committing a crime. The Articles provide for indemnification of officers and directors for losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred in their capacities as such, except in the case of (a) any fraud or dishonesty of such director or officer, (b) such director's or officer's conscious, intentional or willful breach of his obligation to act honestly, lawfully and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the Company or (c) any claims or rights of action to recover any gain, personal profit or other advantage to which the director or officer is not legally entitled. 
The Company has entered into an indemnification agreement with each of its directors and certain of its officers to supplement the indemnification protection available under the Articles. These indemnity agreements generally provide that the Company will indemnify the parties thereto to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
In addition to the indemnification provisions set forth above, the Company maintains insurance policies that indemnify its directors and officers against various liabilities, including those arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act that might be incurred by any director or officer in his capacity as such. 
Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to managers, officers or persons controlling us pursuant to the foregoing, we have been informed that, in the opinion of the SEC, such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable.

Section 16(a) beneficial ownership reporting compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Company's directors and executive officers and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of equity securities of the Company. Directors, officers and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by them. To the Company's knowledge, based solely on a review of the copies of such filings on file with the Company and written representations from the Company's directors and executive officers, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to the Company's directors, executive officers and greater-than-ten-percent beneficial owners were complied with on a timely basis for fiscal year 2018, except for the following: (a) a late Form 4 filed on February 27, 2018 by Ms. Ibelis Montesino, who was an executive officer at the time but not an NEO, to report a grant of restricted stock units and the fulfillment of performance thresholds under four previously granted SARs award, (b) a late Form 4 filed on March 6, 2018 by Mr. Pedro Cardoso, a former director, to report an exercise of SARs, and (c) a Form 5 filed on February 14, 2019 by Mr. Edi Hienrich, one of our executive officers who is not an NEO, to late report two SARs exercises in March and May 2018 completed by his spouse, along with four sales of the Common Shares issued upon such exercises, in each case pursuant to the spouse's 10b5-1 plan.

"Householding" of proxy materials 
The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries such as brokers to satisfy delivery requirements for certain proxy materials with respect to two or more shareholders sharing the same address by delivering a single set of these proxy materials addressed to those shareholders. This process, which is commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for shareholders and cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers household proxy materials, unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected shareholders. Once you have received notice from your broker or us that they or we will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in householding and would prefer to receive a separate set of proxy materials, or if you are receiving multiple copies of the proxy materials and wish to receive only one, please notify your broker if your Common Shares are held in a brokerage account or the Company if you hold Common Shares directly. You can notify the Company by sending a written request to our Corporate Secretary at c/o Herbalife International of America, Inc., 800 W. Olympic Blvd., Suite 406, Los Angeles, California 90015, or by calling the Corporate Secretary at (213) 745-0500. However, please note that if you want to receive a paper proxy or voting instruction form or other proxy materials with respect to the Meeting, you should follow the instructions to request such materials included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that was sent to you. 
Shareholder nominations 
Your attention is drawn to Articles 77 to 80 of the Articles in relation to the requirements applicable to any shareholder who wishes to nominate a person for election as a director. 
For such nomination to be properly brought before an annual general meeting by a shareholder, a shareholder notice addressed to the Corporate Secretary must have been delivered to or mailed and received at the registered office of the Company or such other address as the Corporate Secretary may designate not less than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting, or not later than the 10th day following the date of the first public announcement of the date of such meeting, whichever is later, nor more than 120 days prior to the date of such meeting. 
The notice to the Corporate Secretary must set forth (a) as to each person whom the shareholder proposes to nominate, all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for appointment of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, including such person's written consent to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if appointed, and (b) as to the shareholder giving the notice (i) the name and address of such shareholder, as they appear on the register of members, (ii) the class and number of Common Shares that are owned beneficially and/or of record by such shareholder, (iii) a representation that the shareholder is a registered holder of Common Shares entitled to vote at such meeting and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the meeting to propose such nomination and (iv) a statement as to whether the shareholder intends or is part of a group that intends (x) to deliver a proxy statement and/or form of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the Company's outstanding share capital required to approve or elect the nominee for appointment and/or (y) otherwise to solicit proxies from shareholders in support of such nomination. 
The Company may require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as may reasonably be required by the Company to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to serve as a director of the Company. No person nominated by a shareholder shall be eligible for election as a director of the Company unless nominated in accordance with these procedures. 
Shareholder proposals for the 2020 annual general meeting

For notice to be proper, it must set forth: (i) the name and address of the shareholder who intends to make the proposal as it appears in the Company's records, (ii) the class and number of Common Shares of the Company that are owned by the shareholder submitting the proposal and (iii) a clear and concise statement of the proposal and the shareholder's reasons for supporting it. 
 If the Chairman of the meeting determines that any such proposed business has not been properly brought before the meeting, he shall declare such business out of order, and such business shall not be conducted at the meeting.
