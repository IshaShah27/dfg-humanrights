Dear Stockholder: 
You are cordially invited to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. ("PFLT" or the "Company") to be held on February 5, 2019 at 9:45 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Dechert LLP, located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York. 
The Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the Proxy Statement of the Company, which is accessible on the Internet or by request, provides an outline of the business to be conducted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. At the meeting, you will be asked to: (1) elect two directors of the Company and (2) ratify the selection of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019. I will also report on the progress of the Company during the past year and respond to stockholders' questions. 
It is important that your shares be represented at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, I urge stockholders to follow the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials to vote your proxy on the Internet. We encourage you to vote via the Internet, as it saves us significant time and processing costs. However, on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials you also will find instructions on how to request a hard copy of the Proxy Statement and proxy card free of charge and you may vote your proxy by returning your proxy card to us after you request the hard copy materials. If you hold your shares through a TASE member, please follow the voting instructions in the Proxy Statement, which are otherwise different to that of other stockholders.  
Your vote and participation in the governance of the Company is very important to us. 
Sincerely yours, 
Arthur H. Penn

NOTICE OF ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS 
TO BE HELD ON February 5, 2019 
December 6, 2018 
Notice is hereby given to the owners of shares of common stock (the "Stockholders") of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. ("PFLT" or the "Company") that: 
The 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company (the "Annual Meeting") will be held at the offices of Dechert LLP, located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, on February 5, 2019 at 9:45 a.m., Eastern Time, for the following purposes:

[END TABLE]
You have the right to receive notice of, and to vote at, the Annual Meeting if you were a stockholder of record of the Company at the close of business on November 19, 2018. The Company is furnishing a Proxy Statement and proxy card to the Stockholders on the Internet, rather than mailing printed copies of those materials to each Stockholder. If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the Proxy Statement and proxy card unless you request them. Instead, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will instruct you as to how you may access and review the Proxy Statement, and vote your proxy, on the Internet. 
Your vote is extremely important to us. If you are unable to attend the Annual Meeting, we encourage you to vote your proxy on the Internet by following the instructions provided on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. You may also request from us free of charge hard copies of the Proxy Statement and proxy card for the Company by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. In the event there are not sufficient votes for a quorum or to approve the Company's proposals at the time of the Annual Meeting, the Annual Meeting may be adjourned in order to permit further solicitation of proxies by the Company. 
THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, INCLUDING THE INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE PROPOSALS. 
By Order of the Board of Directors,

PROXY STATEMENT 
for 
2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders 
To be held on February 5, 2019 
This document will give you the information you need to vote on the matters listed on the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders ("Notice of Annual Meeting"). Much of the information in this Proxy Statement is required under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), and some of it is technical in nature. If there is anything you do not understand, please contact us at 212-905-1000. 
This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (the "Board") of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital Ltd. ("PFLT", the "Company," "we," "us" or "our") for use at the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Meeting") to be held on Tuesday, February 5, 2019 at 9:45 a.m., Eastern Time, at the offices of Dechert LLP, located at 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, New York, and at any postponements or adjournments thereof. This Proxy Statement and the Company's Annual Report for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 are being provided to the stockholders thereof (the "Stockholders") via the Internet on or about December 10, 2018. In addition, a Notice of Annual Meeting and a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials are being sent to Stockholders of record of the Company as of November 19, 2018 (the "Record Date"). 
We encourage you to vote your shares, either by voting in person at the Meeting or by voting by proxy (i.e., authorizing someone to vote your shares). Shares represented by duly executed proxies will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you execute a proxy without specifying your voting instructions, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board. If any other business is brought before the Meeting, your shares will be voted at the proxy's discretion unless you specifically state otherwise on your proxy. 
You may revoke a proxy at any time before it is exercised by notifying the Company's Secretary in writing, by submitting a properly executed, later-dated proxy or by voting in person at the Meeting. Any Stockholder entitled to vote at the Meeting may attend the Meeting and vote in person, whether or not he or she has previously voted his or her shares via proxy or wishes to change a previous vote. 
You will be eligible to vote your shares electronically via the Internet, by telephone or by mail. 
Purpose of Meeting
At the Meeting, you will be asked to vote on the following proposals: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
    1.  To elect two directors to the Board, who will each serve until the 2022 annual meeting of stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualifies ("Proposal 1"); and 
    2.  To ratify the selection of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019 ("Proposal 2"). 
[END TABLE]
Voting Securities 
You may vote your shares at the Meeting only if you were a Stockholder of record of the Company at the close of business on November 19, 2018. There were 38,772,074 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Common Stock") outstanding on the Record Date. Stockholders are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock held.  Quorum Required 
For the Company to conduct business at the Meeting, a quorum of Stockholders for the Company must be present at the Meeting. The presence at the Meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding on the Record Date will constitute a quorum of the Company. Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes (as defined below) will be treated as shares present at the Meeting for quorum purposes. If there are not enough votes for a quorum of the Company, the chairman of the Meeting will adjourn the Meeting to permit the further solicitation of proxies. 
Votes Required 
Election of Directors 
The election of a director to the Board requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast for and affirmatively withheld at the Meeting in person or by proxy. If you vote "Withhold Authority" with respect to a nominee, your shares will not be voted with respect to the person indicated. Votes to withhold authority with respect to a nominee will be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have the effect of a vote against the nominee. Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes will have no effect on the result of the vote. 
Stockholders of the Company may not cumulate their votes. 
Ratification of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Meeting in person or by proxy is required to ratify the appointment of RSM US LLP to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Abstentions will not be included in determining the number of votes cast and, as a result, will have no effect on this proposal. 
Broker Non-Votes 
"Broker Non-Votes" are votes that are not cast by a broker, bank or other nominee (the "Broker") on a non-routine matter because the shares entitled to cast the vote are held in "street name", the Broker lacks discretionary authority to vote the shares and the Broker has not received voting instructions from the beneficial owner. Proposal 1 is a non-routine matter. As a result, if you hold shares of the Company's Common Stock in street name, your Broker will not be permitted to exercise voting discretion with respect to Proposal 1. 
Accordingly, if you are a Stockholder and you do not vote or give your Broker specific instructions on how to vote for you, your shares will have no effect on the result of Proposal 1.
Proposal 2 is a routine matter. As a result, if you beneficially own shares of Common Stock of the Company and you do not vote or provide your Broker with proxy instructions, your Broker will be able to vote your shares for you on Proposal 2. 
Adjournment and Additional Solicitation
If there appears not to be enough votes to approve a proposal at the Meeting, the chairman of the Meeting may adjourn the Meeting to permit further solicitation of proxies.
A Stockholder vote may be taken on any of the proposals in this Proxy Statement prior to any such adjournment if there are sufficient votes for approval of such proposal.  Information Regarding This Solicitation 
We will bear the expense of the solicitation of proxies for the Meeting, including the portion of the cost of preparing and posting this Proxy Statement and the Annual Report to the Internet and the cost of mailing the Notice of Annual Meeting, the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and any requested proxy materials to the Stockholders. We intend to use the services of Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of investor communications solutions, to aid in the distribution and collection of proxy votes. We expect to pay market rates for such services. If brokers, trustees or fiduciaries and other institutions holding shares in their own names or in the names of their nominee, which shares are beneficially owned by others, forward the Proxy Statement and proxy card to, and obtain proxies from, such beneficial owners, we will reimburse such persons for their reasonable expenses in so doing. 
We combine any mailings for multiple accounts going to a single household, which is commonly referred to as "householding," by delivering to that address a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other communications for all accounts who have consented or are deemed to have consented to receiving such communications in such manner in accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC. If you have received notice from your Broker that it will be "householding" communications to your address, "householding" will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent. We will promptly deliver a separate copy of these documents to you upon written or oral request to our Investor Relations Department at 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10022 or 212-905-1000. If, at any time, you no longer wish to participate in "householding" and would prefer to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other communications, please notify your Broker. Stockholders who currently receive multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or other communications at their addresses and would like to request "householding" of their communications should contact their Brokers.
In addition to the solicitation of proxies by the use of the Internet, proxies may be solicited in person and/or by telephone, mail or facsimile transmission by directors or officers of the Company, officers or employees of PennantPark Investment Advisers, LLC, our investment adviser (the "Adviser"), PennantPark Investment Administration, LLC, our administrator (the "Administrator"), and/or by a retained solicitor. No additional compensation will be paid to such directors, officers or regular employees for such services. If we retain a solicitor, we have estimated that we will pay approximately $60,000 for such services. If we engage a solicitor, you could be contacted by telephone on behalf of the Company and be urged to vote. The solicitor will not attempt to influence how you vote your shares, but will only ask that you take the time to cast a vote. You may also be asked if you would like to vote over the telephone and to have your vote transmitted to our proxy tabulation firm. The address of each of the Adviser and the Administrator is 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10022. 
Stockholders, other than those who hold shares through a Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ("TASE") member, may provide their voting instructions through the Internet, by telephone or by mail by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. These options require Stockholders to input the Control Number, which is provided with the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. If you vote using the Internet, after visiting www.proxyvote.com and inputting your Control Number, you will be prompted to provide your voting instructions. Stockholders will have an opportunity to review their voting instructions and make any necessary changes before submitting them and terminating their Internet link. Stockholders who vote via the Internet, in addition to confirming their voting instructions prior to submission, will receive upon request an e-mail confirming their instructions. 
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a TASE member, please complete, sign and date the form of proxy card that we filed via MAGNA and attach to it an ownership certificate from the TASE member through which your shares are registered (i.e., your broker, bank or other nominee) indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on November 19, 2018, the record date for voting, and return the proxy card along with the ownership certificate, to the Company's Israeli counsel, Goldfarb Seligman & Co., c/o Daniel Kahn, 98 Yigal Alon Street, 36th Floor, Tel Aviv 6789141, Israel (email: daniel.kahn@goldfarb.com). The proxy card and ownership certificate must be received no later than January 31, 2019, to be included in the tally of shares voted.  If a Stockholder, other than those who hold shares through a TASE member, wishes to participate in the Meeting, but does not wish to give a proxy by Internet, the Stockholder may attend the Meeting in person or request and submit a proxy card by following the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
If your shares of Common Stock are held by a TASE member, and you wish to participate in the Meeting, you need to bring an ownership certificate from the TASE member through which your shares are registered (i.e., your broker, bank or other nominee) indicating that you were the beneficial owner of the shares on November 19, 2018, the record date for voting. 
Any proxy authorized pursuant to this solicitation may be revoked by notice from the person giving the proxy at any time before it is exercised. A revocation may be effected by (i) resubmitting voting instructions via the Internet voting site, by telephone, by obtaining and properly completing another proxy card that is dated later than the original proxy and returning it, by mail, in time to be received before the Meeting, (ii) by attending the Meeting and voting in person or (iii) by a notice, provided in writing and signed by the Stockholder, delivered to the Company's Secretary on any business day before the date of the Meeting.  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management 
As of the Record Date, to our knowledge, no person would be deemed to "control" (as such term is defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act")) the Company. 
Our directors consist of an interested director and four independent directors. An interested director is an "interested person" of the Company, as defined in the 1940 Act, and independent directors are all other directors (the "Independent Directors"). 
The following table sets forth, as of December 3, 2018, certain ownership information with respect to the Company's Common Stock for those persons who directly or indirectly own, control or hold with the power to vote, five percent or more of the Company's outstanding Common Stock and all officers and directors of the Company, as a group.

 Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), the Company's directors and other executive officer and any persons holding more than 10% of the Company's Common Stock are required to report their beneficial ownership and any changes therein to the SEC and the Company. Specific due dates for those reports have been established, and the Company is required to report herein any failure to file such reports by those due dates. Based on the Company's review of Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed by such persons and information provided by the Company's directors and other executive officer, the Company believes that, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to such persons were met in a timely manner.

[END TABLE]
The Company believes that maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance is a crucial part of its business, and is committed to having in place the necessary controls and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as its own ethical standards of conduct.  Director Independence 
NASDAQ corporate governance rules require listed companies to have a board of directors with at least a majority of independent directors. Under NASDAQ corporate governance rules, in order for a director to be deemed independent, the Board must determine that the individual does not have a relationship that would interfere with the director's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his responsibilities. On an annual basis, each director is required to complete an independence questionnaire designed to provide information to assist the Board in determining whether the director is independent under NASDAQ corporate governance rules, the 1940 Act and applicable corporate governance guidelines. The Board has determined that each of its directors, other than Mr. Penn, is independent under the applicable listing standards of the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the New York Stock Exchange and under the Exchange Act and the 1940 Act. The Company's governance guidelines require any director who has previously been determined to be independent to inform the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Company's Corporate Secretary of any change in circumstance that may cause his status as an Independent Director to change. The Board limits membership on its Audit Committee, its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and its Compensation Committee to Independent Directors. 
Board's Oversight Role in Management 
The Board performs its risk oversight function primarily through (1) its three standing committees, described more fully below, which report to the entire Board and are comprised solely of Independent Directors and (2) monitoring by the Company's Chief Compliance Officer (the "CCO") in accordance with the Company's compliance policies and procedures. 
As described below in more detail under "Audit Committee", "Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee", and "Compensation Committee", the Board's Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee assist the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities. The Audit Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include overseeing the Company's accounting and financial reporting processes, including the annual audit of the Company's financial statements, the Company's systems of internal controls regarding finance and accounting, pre-approving the engagement of an independent registered public accounting firm to render audit and/or permissible non-audit services and evaluating the qualifications, performance and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include selecting, researching and nominating directors for election by the Company's Stockholders, developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and the Company's management. The Compensation Committee's risk oversight responsibilities include determining, or recommending to the Board for determining, the compensation of the Company's chief executive officer and all other executive officers, paid directly by the Company, if any, and assisting the Board with matters related to compensation, as directed by the Board. Each of the Audit Committee, Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee consists solely of Independent Directors.
The Board also performs its risk oversight responsibilities with the assistance of a CCO. The Company's CCO prepares a written report annually discussing the adequacy and effectiveness of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers. The CCO's report, which is reviewed by the Board, addresses, at a minimum: (1) the operation of the compliance policies and procedures of the Company and certain of its service providers since the last report; (2) any material changes to such policies and procedures since the last report; (3) any recommendations for material changes to such policies and procedures as a result of the CCO's annual review; and (4) any compliance matter that has occurred since the date of the last report about which the Board would reasonably need to know to oversee the Company's compliance activities and risks. In addition, the CCO meets separately in executive session with the Independent Directors at least once each year and presents quarterly reports to the Board. 
The Company believes that the Board's role in risk oversight is effective and appropriate given the extensive regulation to which it is already subject as a business development company. Specifically, as a business development company, the Company must comply with certain regulatory requirements that control the levels of  risk in its business and operations. For example, the ability of the Company to incur indebtedness is limited by the asset coverage ratio set forth in the 1940 Act (as modified by any exemptive relief granted by the SEC) and the Company generally must invest at least 70% of its total assets in "qualifying assets." The Company also has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (a "RIC") under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain income source and asset diversification requirements. 
The Company believes that the extent of the Board's and its committees' roles in risk oversight complements the Board's leadership structure. Because they are comprised solely of Independent Directors, the Audit Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee are able to exercise their oversight responsibilities without any conflict of interest that might discourage critical questioning and review. Through regular executive session meetings with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the CCO and the Chief Executive Officer, the Independent Directors have similarly established direct communication and oversight channels that the Board believes foster open communication and early detection of issues of concern. 
The Company believes that the Board's role in risk oversight must be evaluated on a case by case basis and that the current configuration and allocation of responsibilities among the Board and its committees with respect to the oversight of risk is appropriate. However, the Board and its committees continually re-examine the manner in which they administer their respective risk oversight functions, including through formal annual assessments of performance, to ensure that they meet the Company's needs. 
Board's Composition and Leadership Structure 
The 1940 Act requires that at least a majority of the Company's directors not be "interested persons" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the Company. Currently, four of the five directors on the Board are Independent Directors; however, the Chairman of the Board is an interested person of the Company. The Independent Directors believe that the combined position of Chief Executive Officer of the Company and Chairman of the Board of the Company results in greater efficiencies in managing the Company, by eliminating the need to transfer substantial information quickly and repeatedly between the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman, and the ability to capitalize on the specialized knowledge acquired from the duties of the roles. The Board has not identified a lead Independent Director; however, the Board has determined that its leadership structure, in which 80% of the directors are Independent Directors and, as such, are not affiliated with the Adviser or the Administrator, is appropriate in light of the services that the Adviser and the Administrator provide to the Company and the potential conflicts of interest that could arise from these relationships. 
Information about Each Director's Experience, Qualifications, Attributes or Skills 
The Board believes that the significance of each director's experience, qualifications, attributes and/or skills is an individual matter (meaning that experience that is important for one director may not have the same value for another) and that these factors are best evaluated at the Board level, with no single director, or particular factor, being indicative of Board effectiveness. However, the Board believes that directors need to have the ability to review, evaluate, question and discuss critical information provided to them, and to interact effectively with management, service providers and counsel, in order to exercise effective business judgment in the performance of their duties. The Board believes that its members satisfy this standard. Experience relevant to having this ability may be achieved through a director's educational background, business or professional training or practice (e.g., finance, accounting or law), public service or academic positions, experience from service as a board member (including the Board of the Company) or as an executive of investment companies, public companies or significant private or not-for-profit entities or other organizations and/or other life experiences. To assist them in evaluating matters under federal and state law, the Independent Directors have their own independent legal counsel, who participates in Board meetings and interacts with the Adviser and the Company's counsel. Both the Independent Directors' and the Company's counsel have significant experience advising funds and fund board members. The Board and its committees have the ability to engage other experts as appropriate. The Board evaluates its performance on an annual basis.  Role of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
As Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Penn assumes a leading role in strategic planning and supports major transaction initiatives of the Company. Mr. Penn also manages the day-to-day operations of the Company, with the support of the other investment professionals and officers. As Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Penn has general responsibility for the implementation of the policies of the Company, as determined by the Board, and for the management of the business and affairs of the Company. 
Experience, Qualifications, Attributes and/or Skills that Led to the Board's Conclusion that such Members Should Serve as Directors of the Company 
The Board believes that, collectively, the directors have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes and skills, which allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Company and protecting the interests of its Stockholders. Below is additional information about each director (supplementing the information provided in the table above) that describes some of the specific experiences, qualifications, attributes and/or skills that each director possesses, and which the Board believes has prepared each director to be an effective director.

Committees of the Board 
The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and a Compensation Committee. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Board held seven board meetings, four Audit Committee meetings, one Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meeting and one Compensation Committee meeting. All directors attended at least 75% of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the respective committees on which they served. The Company requires each director to make a diligent effort to attend all Board and committee meetings, and encourages directors to attend the Company's annual stockholders' meetings. Last year, all members of the Board attended the annual stockholders' meeting. 
Audit Committee 
The members of the Audit Committee of the Company are Messrs. Bernstein, Brozost, Flug and Katz, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act and the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. Messrs. Flug and Katz serve as Co-Chairmen of the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee operates pursuant to an Audit Committee Charter approved by the Board. The charter sets forth the responsibilities of the Audit Committee, which include: selecting or retaining each year an independent registered public accounting firm (the "auditors") to audit the accounts and records of the Company; reviewing and discussing with management and the auditors the annual audited financial statements of the Company, including disclosures made in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, and recommending to the Board whether the audited financial statements should be included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K; reviewing and discussing with management and the auditors the Company's quarterly financial statements prior to the filings of its quarterly report on Form 10-Q; pre-approving the auditors' engagement to render audit and/or permissible non-audit services; reviewing and approving all related party transactions; and evaluating the qualifications, performance and independence of the auditors. The Audit Committee is also responsible for aiding the Board in fair valuing the Company's portfolio securities that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available. Such investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The Board and Audit Committee use the services of nationally recognized independent valuation firms to help them determine the fair value of certain securities held by the Company. The Board has determined that each of Messrs. Flug and Katz is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under Item 407 of Regulation S-K under the Exchange Act. The Audit Committee Charter is available on the Company's website (http://www.pennantpark.com).  Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
The members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company are Messrs. Bernstein, Brozost, Flug and Katz, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act and the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. Messrs. Bernstein and Brozost serve as Co-Chairmen of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for selecting, researching and nominating directors for election by the Company's Stockholders, selecting nominees to fill vacancies on the Board or a committee of the Board, developing and recommending to the Board a set of corporate governance principles and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and the Company's management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Company has adopted a written Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter that is available on the Company's website (http://www.pennantpark.com). 
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider Stockholder recommendations for possible nominees for election as directors when such recommendations are submitted in accordance with the Company's bylaws, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter and any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding director nominations. Nominations should be sent to Thomas J. Friedmann, Secretary, c/o PennantPark, 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10022. When submitting a nomination to the Company for consideration, a Stockholder must provide all information that would be required under applicable SEC rules to be disclosed in connection with the election of a director, including the following minimum information for each director nominee: full name, age and address; principal occupation during the past five years; directorships on publicly held companies and investment companies during the past five years; number of shares of the Company's Common Stock owned, if any; and a written consent of the individual to stand for election if nominated by the Board and to serve if elected by the Stockholders. 
Criteria considered by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee in evaluating the qualifications of individuals for election as a director of the Board include: compliance with the independence and other applicable requirements of the NASDAQ corporate governance rules and the 1940 Act, and all other applicable laws, rules, regulations and listing standards; the criteria, policies and principles set forth in the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee Charter; and the ability to contribute to the effective management of the Company, taking into account the needs of the Company and such factors as the individual's experience, perspective, skills and knowledge of the industry in which the Company operates. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity in identifying individuals for election as members of the Board, but the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider such factors as they may deem are in the best interests of the Company and its Stockholders. Those factors may include a person's differences of viewpoint, professional experience, education and skills, as well as his or her race, gender and national origin. In addition, as part of the Board's annual self-assessment, the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluate the membership of the Board and whether the Board maintains satisfactory policies regarding membership selection. 
Compensation Committee 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for determining, or recommending to the Board for determining, the compensation of the Company's chief executive officer and all other executive officers, paid directly by the Company, if any. The Compensation Committee also assists the Board with all matters related to compensation, as directed by the Board. The current members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Bernstein, Brozost, Flug and Katz, each of whom is independent for purposes of the 1940 Act and the NASDAQ corporate governance rules. As discussed below, none of our executive officers are directly compensated by the Company and, as a result, the Compensation Committee does not produce and/or review and report on executive compensation practices. The Compensation Committee Charter is available on the Company's website (http://www.pennantpark.com).  Communication with the Board of Directors 
Stockholders with questions about the Company are encouraged to contact our Investor Relations Department at 590 Madison Avenue, 15th Floor, New York, New York 10022 or by visiting the investor relations web page on our website (http://www.pennantpark.com).

 Total     $  458,666        $  427,030    
[END TABLE]
Audit Fees: Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that were normally provided in connection with statutory and regulatory filings. 
Audit-Related Fees: Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under "Audit Fees." These services include attestation services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. 
Tax Fees: Tax fees consist of fees billed for professional services for tax compliance. These services include assistance regarding federal, state and local tax compliance. 
All Other Fees: Other fees would include fees billed for products and services other than the services reported above. 
The Audit Committee has established a pre-approval policy that describes the permitted audit, audit-related, tax and other services to be provided by RSM, as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. The policy requires that the Audit Committee pre-approve the audit and permissible non-audit services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm in order to assure that the provision of such service does not impair the auditors' independence with respect to the Company. In addition, all audit-related, tax and other services provided by RSM to the Company during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 were approved by the Audit Committee in accordance with such policy. 
Any requests for audit, audit-related, tax and other services that have not received general pre-approval must be submitted to the Audit Committee of the Company for specific pre-approval and cannot commence until such approval has been granted. Normally, pre-approval is provided at regularly scheduled meetings of the Audit Committee. However, the Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member or members to whom such authority is delegated shall report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent registered public accounting firm to Company management.  THE BOARD, INCLUDING ITS INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE FOR RATIFICATION OF RSM AS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO THE COMPANY FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER 30, 2019. 
Audit Committee Report (1) 
The following is the report of the Audit Committee with respect to the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed the Company's audited financial statements with management and RSM, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present. The Audit Committee included in its review results of RSM's audits, the Company's internal controls and the quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee also reviewed the Company's procedures and internal control processes designed to ensure full, fair and adequate financial reporting and disclosures, including procedures for certifications by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer that are required in periodic reports filed by the Company with the SEC. The Audit Committee is satisfied that the Company's internal control systems are adequate and that the Company employs appropriate accounting procedures. 
The Audit Committee also has discussed with RSM matters relating to RSM's assessment about the quality, as well as the acceptability, of the Company's accounting principles as applied in its financial reporting as required by PCAOB Auditing Standard 1301 (Communications with Audit Committees). In addition, the Audit Committee has discussed with RSM its independence from management and the Company, as well as the matters in the written disclosures received from RSM and required by Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Rule 3520 (Auditor Independence). The Audit Committee received a report from RSM confirming its independence and discussed the report with RSM. The Audit Committee discussed and reviewed with RSM the Company's critical accounting policies and practices, internal controls, other material written communications to management and the scope of RSM's audits and all fees paid to RSM during the fiscal year. The Audit Committee adopted guidelines requiring review and pre-approval by the Audit Committee of audit and non-audit services performed by RSM for the Company. The Audit Committee has reviewed and considered the compatibility of RSM's performance of non-audit services with the maintenance of RSM's independence as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. 
Based on the Audit Committee's review and discussions referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board (and the Board has approved) that the Company's audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 for filing with the SEC.
