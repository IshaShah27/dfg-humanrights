Dear Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Stockholder: 
I am pleased to invite you to attend the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the "Annual Meeting") of Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. ("Ceridian") to be held on Wednesday, May 1, 2019 at 9:00 a.m. Central Daylight Time at Ceridian's offices at 3311 East Old Shakopee Road, Minneapolis, Minnesota. 
Details regarding the meeting and the business to be conducted are more fully described in the accompanying Notice of 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement. 
We are providing access to our proxy materials over the Internet under the United States Securities and Exchange Commission's "notice and access" rules. As a result, we are mailing to many of our stockholders a notice instead of a paper copy of this Proxy Statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders. The notice contains instructions on how to access those documents over the Internet. The notice also contains instructions on how you can receive a paper copy of our proxy materials, including this Proxy Statement, our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, and a form of proxy card or voting instruction card. All stockholders who do not receive a notice, including stockholders who have previously requested to receive paper copies of proxy materials, will receive a paper copy of the proxy materials by mail unless they previously have requested delivery of proxy materials electronically. This distribution process also conserves natural resources and reduces the costs of printing and distributing our proxy materials. 
Your vote is important. In order to ensure your representation at the meeting, whether or not you plan to attend the meeting, please vote your shares as promptly as possible. Your participation will help to ensure the presence of a quorum at the meeting and save Ceridian the extra expense associated with additional solicitation. If you hold your shares through a broker, your broker is not permitted to vote on your behalf on certain proposals unless you provide specific instructions to the broker by completing and returning any voting instruction form that the broker provides (or following any instructions that allow you to vote your broker-held shares via telephone or the internet). For your vote to be counted, you will need to communicate your voting decision by the date of the Annual Meeting. Voting your shares in advance will not prevent you from attending the Annual Meeting, revoking your earlier submitted proxy or voting your stock in person. 
Thank you for your ongoing support of and continued interest in Ceridian. 
Sincerely, 
David D. Ossip  
Chair of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer

 Votes Required to Adopt Proposals     Each share of our Common Stock outstanding on the Record Date is entitled to one vote on any proposal presented at the Annual Meeting and the  holder of the Special Voting Share on the Record Date is entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding. At the close of business on the Record  Date, there were 138,181,331 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting and the Special Voting Share represents an additional 2,352,923 shares issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the  Annual Meeting.   Proposal 1, regarding the election of directors requires the  approval of a plurality of votes cast. This means that the three nominees receiving the most "FOR" votes from the holders of shares present at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on the election of directors  will be elected. Only votes "FOR" will affect the outcome. There is no cumulative voting for the election of directors.   To be approved, each of Proposal 2, approval of the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and Proposal 3, ratification of  the appointment of KPMG LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, must receive "FOR" votes from the holders of a majority of the Voting Stock represented at the Annual  Meeting (in person or represented by proxy) and voting on the matter.

       If you "ABSTAIN" from voting, it will have no effect with  respect to Proposals 2 and 3. Broker non-votes will have no effect on Proposal 2 because brokers do not have discretionary authority to vote on the approval of the Global Employee Stock Purchase  Plan. Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 3, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with Proposal 3.

Because brokers have discretionary authority to vote on Proposal 3, we do not expect any broker non-votes in connection with Proposal 3. 
Broker Non-Votes     A broker non-vote occurs when a nominee, such as a broker or bank, holding shares for a beneficial  owner does not vote on a particular proposal because the nominee does not have discretionary authority to vote with respect to that proposal and has not received instructions with respect to that proposal from the beneficial owner. In the event that  a broker, bank, custodian, nominee or other record holder of our Common Stock indicates on a proxy that it does not have discretionary authority to vote certain shares on a particular proposal, then those shares will be treated as broker non-votes with respect to that proposal. In this regard, the election of directors (Proposal 1) and the approval of the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (Proposal 2) are  matters considered non-routine under applicable rules. A broker or other nominee cannot vote without instructions on non-routine matters, and therefore we expect broker non-votes on Proposal 1 and Proposal 2. Proposal 3 is a routine matter, so we do not expect any broker non-votes on this proposal.   Thus, if you do not instruct your broker how to vote with respect to either  Proposal 1 and Proposal 2, your broker may not vote with respect to that proposal. Accordingly, if you own shares through a nominee, such as a broker or bank, please be sure to instruct your nominee how to vote to ensure that your vote is  counted on all of the proposals.

Emerging Growth Company     As a company with less than $1.07 billion in gross revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an "emerging growth  company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the "JOBS Act"). An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other regulatory requirements for up to five years that are  otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include, among other matters, an exemption from the requirement to seek non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden  parachute arrangements, and reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements.   We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of  our initial public offering) unless, prior to that time, we have more than $1.07 billion in annual gross revenue, have a market value for our Common Stock held by non-affiliates of more than  $700.0 million as of the last day of our second fiscal quarter of the fiscal year and a determination is made that we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer," as defined in Rule 12b-2  promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period, whether or not issued in  a registered offering. We have availed ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations with respect to executive compensation disclosure in this Proxy Statement and expect to continue to avail ourselves of the reduced reporting obligations available  to emerging growth companies in future filings. As a result of our decision to avail ourselves of certain provisions of the JOBS Act, the information that we provide may be different than what you may receive from other public companies in which you  hold an equity interest.

 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Board Membership 
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our Board. Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board will consist of between one and 14 directors. Pursuant to that certain voting agreement (the "Voting Agreement") by and among the Company, and certain affiliates of Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. ("THL") and Cannae Holdings, Inc. ("Cannae"), which was spun off from Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNF"), the authorized number of directors has been established at nine directors. During the term of the Voting Agreement, THL and Cannae have certain governance rights, including the right to determine the total number of directors. THL and Cannae together are referred to as the "Sponsors." Our Board currently has one vacancy in Class II and consists of eight members: David D. Ossip, Brent B. Bickett, Ronald F. Clarke, William P. Foley, II, Thomas M. Hagerty, Ganesh B. Rao, Andrea S. Rosen and Gerald C. Throop. We are maintaining one vacancy because we anticipate electing an independent director to our audit committee by April 30, 2019. 
Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for so long as THL and Cannae collectively hold 50% or more of the then outstanding voting power, then THL and Cannae will have the power to designate a total of five directors to the Board. The allocation of the power to designate the five directors will be determined by reference to the outstanding voting power held by Cannae. If THL and Cannae collectively hold 50% or more of the then outstanding voting power, then: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for so long as Cannae holds at least 12.5% of the then outstanding voting power, THL and Cannae shall have the  power to designate (by mutual agreement) five directors to the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• for so long as Cannae holds at least 7.5% but less than 12.5% of the then outstanding voting power, THL shall be  entitled to designate in its own right four directors and Cannae shall be entitled to designate in its own right one director; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if Cannae holds less than 7.5% of the then outstanding voting power, THL shall be entitled to designate in its  own right all five directors and Cannae shall not be entitled to designate any directors.  
[END TABLE]
As of March 4, 2019, THL and Cannae collectively hold over 50% of our outstanding voting power, with THL holding 43.7% and Cannae holding 23.3%. Thus, THL and Cannae have together designated Messrs. Bickett, Clarke, Foley, Hagerty and Rao to our Board. 
Once THL and Cannae cease to collectively hold 50% or more of the then outstanding voting power, then each of THL and Cannae will be able to in their own right designate: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• four directors, for so long as it holds at least 40% of the then outstanding voting power;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• three directors, for so long as it holds at least 30% of the then outstanding voting power;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• two directors, for so long as it holds at least 20% of the then outstanding voting power; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• one director, for so long as it holds at least 10% of the then outstanding voting power.  
[END TABLE]
The Voting Agreement will terminate as to each Sponsor when the Sponsor is no longer entitled to designate a director to the Board, and will terminate upon the time when neither Sponsor is entitled to designate a director to the Board. 
Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our Board is divided into three classes, with one class being elected at each annual meeting of stockholders. Each director serves a three-year term, with termination staggered according to class. Class I consists of three directors, Class II consists of two directors, and Class III consists of three directors. The Class I directors, whose terms will expire at the Annual Meeting, are Messrs. Bickett, Clarke, and Rao. The Class II directors, whose terms will expire at the 2020   Annual Meeting of Stockholders, are Messrs. Foley and Hagerty. The Class III directors, whose terms will expire at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, are Messrs. Ossip and Throop and Ms. Rosen.

Code of Conduct 
We have a Code of Conduct that applies to all of our employees, officers and directors. A copy of the Code of Conduct is available on our website located at www.ceridian.com. Any amendments or waivers from our Code of Conduct granted to directors or executive officers will be disclosed on our website promptly following the date of such amendment or waiver. 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
Our Board has adopted corporate governance guidelines in accordance with the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") and the Toronto Stock Exchange ("TSX"), which serve as a flexible framework within which our Board and its committees operate. These guidelines cover a number of areas, including Board composition, roles of the chair and lead independent director, director nominations and Board criteria, Board meetings and executive sessions, Board committees, management succession, Board compensation, expectations of directors, Board performance evaluations, and access to management and outside advisors. A copy of our corporate governance guidelines is posted on our website at www.ceridian.com. 
Indemnification of Directors and Officers 
Our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL"). 
We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors. These indemnification agreements provide the directors with contractual rights to indemnification and expense advancement and reimbursement to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, subject to certain exceptions contained in those agreements. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
Our Board's role in overseeing the management of our risks is conducted primarily through committees of our Board, as disclosed in the descriptions of each of the committees, below, and in the charters of each of the committees. Our full Board (or the appropriate board committee in the case of risks that are under the purview of a particular committee) discusses with management our major risk exposures, including cyber risk, their potential impact on us and the steps we take to manage them. When a Board committee is responsible for evaluating and overseeing the management of a particular risk or risks, the chair of the relevant committee reports on the discussion to the full Board during the committee reports portion of the next Board meeting. This enables the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role, particularly with respect to risk interrelationships.  Director Independence and Controlled Company Exemption 
Our Sponsors beneficially own more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors. As a result, we qualify as a "controlled company" under the rules of the NYSE. "Controlled companies" under those rules are companies of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group or another company. On this basis, we will continue to avail ourselves of the "controlled company" exemption under the corporate governance rules of the NYSE. As a controlled company, we are not required to have a majority of "independent directors" (as defined under the rules of the NYSE) on our Board; or have a compensation committee and a corporate governance and nominating committee composed entirely of independent directors. The "controlled company" exemption does not modify the independence requirements for the audit committee. The NYSE and the SEC rules require that our audit committee be composed of at least three members, subject to certain permitted phase-in rules for newly public companies. We are currently in compliance with these "phase-in" provisions, with two of the three members of our audit committee satisfying applicable independence requirements and we intend for all members of the audit committee to meet the required independence standards within one year of our IPO (April 30, 2019). 
Additionally, even though we qualify as a controlled company, we have a majority of independent directors serving on our Board. Our Board has affirmatively determined that Messrs. Bickett, Clarke, Foley, and Throop and Ms. Rosen are independent directors under the applicable rules of the NYSE. In assessing the independence of Messrs. Bickett, Foley, Hagerty, and Rao, the Board considered their relationships with the Sponsors, as well as their interests, as applicable, in any related party transactions described below under "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions". 
If at any time we cease to be a "controlled company" under the rules of the NYSE, our Board will take all action necessary to comply with the corporate governance rules of the NYSE, including as applicable, appointing a majority of independent directors to the Board and establishing certain committees composed entirely of independent directors, subject to a permitted "phase-in" period. We are currently in compliance with the applicable "phase-in" provisions. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Mr. Ossip, our Chief Executive Officer, serves as Chair of our Board. He presides over meetings of our Board and holds such other powers and carries out such other duties as are customarily carried out by the Chair of our Board. Our Board believes that the current board leadership structure provides effective independent oversight of management while allowing our Board and management to benefit from Mr. Ossip's leadership and years of managerial and strategic experience. Mr. Ossip is best positioned to identify strategic priorities, lead critical discussions and execute our strategy and business plans, and he possesses detailed in-depth knowledge of the issues, opportunities and challenges facing us. Our Board believes that Mr. Ossip's combined role enables strong leadership, creates clear accountability, facilitates information flow between management and our Board and enhances our ability to communicate our message and strategy clearly and consistently to our stockholders. 
Meetings of the Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Our Board held five meetings in fiscal year 2018. Each director attended at least 75 percent of all meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served that were held during fiscal year 2018 (and to the extent that such meetings were held during the time that each director served on our Board). All directors are encouraged to attend our annual meetings of stockholders. 
Committees of the Board of Directors 
Our Board has established an audit committee, a compensation committee and a corporate governance and nominating committee. Each committee operates under a charter that has been approved by our Board and has   the composition and responsibilities described below. Members serve on these committees until their resignations or until otherwise determined by our Board. The charter of each committee is available on our website at www.ceridian.com.

The audit committee is currently composed of Messrs. Rao and Throop and Ms. Rosen. Mr. Throop serves as chair of the audit committee and each of Mr. Throop and Ms. Rosen qualify as an "audit committee financial expert" as such term has been defined by the SEC in Item 407(d) of Regulation S-K. Our Board has affirmatively determined that each of Ms. Rosen and Mr. Throop meet the definition of an "independent director" for the purposes of serving on the audit committee under applicable NYSE rules and Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act. In accordance with the NYSE and the SEC rules, we intend for all members of the audit committee to meet the required independence standards within one year of our IPO. In connection therewith, Mr. Rao will step down from the audit committee by the one-year anniversary of our IPO (April 30, 2019), and we intend to appoint a new independent director by such date. The audit committee is governed by a charter that complies with the rules of the NYSE.

[END TABLE]
Our compensation committee is composed of Messrs. Clarke, Foley, Hagerty, and Rao. Mr. Hagerty serves as chair of the compensation committee. We have elected to avail ourselves of the "controlled company" exemption under the rules of the NYSE, which exempts us from the requirement that we have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. The compensation committee is governed by a charter that complies with the rules of the NYSE. 
The compensation committee met three times during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
No member of our compensation committee has ever been one of our executive officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or   compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or compensation committee. 
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee 
The primary purposes of our corporate governance and nominating committee is to, among other things: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

The corporate governance and nominating committee met two times during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Identifying and Evaluating Director Nominees 
The Board has delegated to the corporate governance and nominating committee the responsibility of identifying suitable candidates for nomination to the Board (including candidates to fill any vacancies that may occur) and assessing their qualifications in light of the policies and principles in our corporate governance guidelines, the committee's charter and any other criteria for selection of directors as established by the Board. The corporate governance and nominating committee may gather information about the candidates through interviews, detailed questionnaires, comprehensive background checks or any other means that the committee deems to be appropriate in the evaluation process. Based on the results of the evaluation process, the corporate governance and nominating committee recommends new candidates for the Board's approval as director nominees for election to the Board. 
In identifying prospective director candidates, the corporate governance and nominating committee may consider all facts and circumstances that it deems appropriate or advisable, including, among other things, such factors as integrity, experience, judgment, independence, diversity, skills, education, expertise, length of service, understanding of our business and industry, other commitments and the size and composition of the Board. Although our Board does not currently maintain a specific policy with respect to board diversity, our Board believes that it should be a diverse body reflecting our business, workforce, customer base and society in general, and our Board has directed our corporate governance and nominating committee to consider the benefits of diverse viewpoints when making determinations regarding nominations of directors in order to ensure a diverse mix of skills, background and experience.

PROPOSAL ONE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Nominees 
Our Board has nominated Brent B. Bickett, Ronald F. Clarke, and Ganesh B. Rao for election as Class I directors to hold office until the 2022 Annual Meeting or until their successors are duly elected and qualified, subject to their earlier death, resignation or removal. Each of the nominees is a current member of our Board and has consented to serve if elected. 
Unless you direct otherwise through your proxy voting instructions, the persons named as proxies will vote all proxies received "FOR" the election of each of the nominees. If any nominee is unable or unwilling to serve at the time of the Annual Meeting, the persons named as proxies may vote for a substitute nominee chosen by the present Board. In the alternative, the proxies may vote only for the remaining nominees, leaving a vacancy on the Board. The Board may fill such vacancy at a later date or reduce the size of the Board. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unwilling or unable to serve if elected as a director. 
Recommendation of the Board 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL TWO 
APPROVAL OF CERIDIAN HCM HOLDING INC. GLOBAL EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
At the Annual Meeting, our stockholders will be asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "GESPP"). The GESPP was approved unanimously and adopted by the Board at its meeting on November 9, 2018, at which time it became effective, subject to approval by our stockholders. We commenced the first offering period under the GESPP on January 1, 2019, with the actual purchase of shares of our Common Stock under the GESPP contingent upon approval by our stockholders. 
If this proposal is approved by the holders of a majority of the votes represented by our Voting Stock and voting on the matter, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the GESPP will be 2,500,000, which will be used to satisfy the purchase of shares of Common Stock under either the Code Section 423 Component or the Non-Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP. We do not maintain any other employee stock purchase plans. However, we do maintain the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan, which allows us to grant various forms of equity compensation awards to our employees, officers and non-employee directors and to those of our subsidiaries. 
If this proposal is approved by our stockholders as described above, the first offering period will conclude and the first purchase of shares of Common Stock under the GESPP will occur on June 28, 2019. In the event that our stockholders as described above do not approve this proposal, all contributions made under the GESPP for the applicable offering period will be refunded to participants, without interest, as soon as reasonably practicable and no shares of Common Stock will be issued under the GESPP. 
The following description of the GESPP is a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the plan document for the GESPP, a copy of which is attached as Annex A to this Proxy Statement. 
Purpose 
The purpose of the GESPP is to provide an incentive to eligible employees by giving them an opportunity to become owners of Ceridian and play a role in our future. 
Plan Administration 
The GESPP will be administered by the compensation committee of the Board. The compensation committee will have broad administrative authority over the GESPP. All questions regarding (a) the interpretation of the GESPP, any form of agreement or other document employed by us in the administration of the GESPP, (b) any purchase rights granted under the GESPP, and (c) the correction of any errors arising under the GESPP will be determined by the compensation committee and such determinations will be final and binding upon all persons having an interest in the GESPP or the purchase rights. The compensation committee also will determine all relevant terms and conditions of the purchase rights granted to employees, provided that all employees have the same rights and privileges within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and any applicable regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Code"), for purposes of the Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP. Any of the compensation committee's administrative tasks may be assigned to an individual designated by us to receive enrollment agreements, withdrawal notices and other communications from eligible employees (the "Administrator"). 
Available Shares 
Subject to adjustment for certain changes in recapitalization or reorganization, in which we are a party, the maximum aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the GESPP will be   2,500,000 shares of Common Stock. For the sake of clarity, the aggregate share limitation may be used to satisfy the purchase of shares of Common Stock under either the Code Section 423 Component or the Non-Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP. Shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the GESPP may consist of authorized but unissued shares and/or reacquired shares (treasury shares). If any rights to purchase shares of Common Stock granted under the GESPP expire or are terminated or canceled, the shares of Common Stock allocable to the unexercised portion of such rights will again be available for issuance under the GESPP. 
Offerings 
The GESPP will be implemented by offering all eligible employees an option to purchase shares of Common Stock, which the employee may or may not exercise during an offering period ("Purchase Right"). The duration of each offering period will be the calendar year commencing on January 1 and concluding on December 31 of each year (each, an "Offering Period"). Each Offering Period will consist of four quarterly purchase periods (each, a "Purchase Period") commencing on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1; provided, the initial Purchase Period under the GESPP will run from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2019. 
Eligibility 
Our employees (or those employees of our subsidiaries that are designated for offering participation in either the Code Section 423 Component or Non-Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP) may participate in offerings under the GESPP provided they were employed prior to the start of an enrollment period for an applicable Purchase Period ("Eligible Employee"). 
No employee will be eligible to participate in the GESPP if, immediately after the grant of Purchase Rights, the employee would own, directly or indirectly, stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of our stock, a future parent corporation, or our subsidiary companies, including any stock that such employee may purchase under all outstanding Purchase Rights and other equity compensation awards. In addition, no employee may purchase more than $25,000 worth of shares of Common Stock (determined based on the fair market value of the shares at the time such Purchase Right is granted) under the GESPP and any Non-Code Section 423 Component sub-plans of our subsidiary companies for each calendar year during which such Purchase Right is outstanding. 
As of the date of this proposal, approximately 4,498 employees in the United States and other countries will be eligible to participate in the GESPP if approved by our stockholders as described above. 
Participation 
An Eligible Employee who elects to participate in the GESPP ("Participant") must enroll in the GESPP by timely submitting a properly completed enrollment agreement to the Administrator during the enrollment period that precedes each Purchase Period, authorizing payroll deductions in whole percentages from 1% to 10% of his or her compensation to be deducted from each pay period during the Offering Period. The compensation committee may, in its sole discretion, permit additional lump sum contributions on a periodic basis during the Offering Period in a form and manner as determined by the compensation committee; provided, the amount of any additional lump sum contributions made by a Participant, when combined with other Participant contributions, shall not exceed the maximum amount allowed under the terms of the GESPP. 
Payment of Purchase Price; Payroll Deductions 
The purchase of shares during each Offering Period will be funded by a Participant's payroll deductions accumulated during the Offering Period. Participant payroll deductions will commence on the first pay day following the first day of the Offering Period and will continue to be deducted each pay day through the end of the Offering Period. Interest will not be paid on Participant accumulated payroll deductions, which will be   deposited with our general funds and may be used by us for any corporate purpose. A Participant may not increase, but may decrease the rate of payroll deductions once during an Offering Period by timely submitting an amended enrollment agreement to the Administrator. A Participant who elects to decrease the rate of his or her payroll deductions to 0% will remain in the GESPP unless he or she elects to withdraw from the GESPP. Unless a Participant's participation is withdrawn, his or her Purchase Right will be exercised automatically on each Purchase Date. 
Purchase Price 
The price at which a share of Common Stock will be purchased on the last trading day of each Purchase Period (the "Purchase Date") will be the lower of (i) 85% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the first trading day of the Offering Period, or (ii) 85% of the fair market value of a share of Common Stock on the Purchase Date (the "Purchase Price"). 
Purchase Limits 
Each Participant will be granted a Purchase Right to purchase on the Purchase Date for such Offering Period up to a maximum number of shares of Common Stock determined by dividing such Participant's contributions accumulated prior to such Purchase Date by the applicable Purchase Price; provided, however, that in no event will a Participant be permitted to purchase more than $25,000 worth of shares of Common Stock (determined based on the fair market value of the shares at the time such Purchase Right is granted) under the GESPP and any Non-Code Section 423 Component sub-plans of our subsidiary companies for each calendar year during which such Purchase Right is outstanding. 
Termination of Employment 
In the event a Participant's employment is terminated, prior to a Purchase Date, for any reason, including retirement, disability or death, or in the event he or she is no longer eligible to participate in the GESPP, his or her rights under any offering under the GESPP will terminate immediately. Contributions credited to the Participant's account since the last Purchase Date will be, as soon as practicable, returned to the Participant, or, in the case of the Participant's death, to the Participant's legal representative. 
Voluntary Withdrawal 
Participants may withdraw from the GESPP at any time and receive a refund of all payroll deductions, without interest, credited to his or her GESPP account that have not been applied toward the purchase of shares of Common Stock by submitting a withdrawal election to the Administrator no later than the 15th day of the month in which the applicable Purchase Date falls. The payroll deductions will be returned as soon as practicable after the withdrawal and may not be applied to the purchase of shares of Common Stock in any other offering under the GESPP. Participants who withdraw from the GESPP will be prohibited from resuming participation for the same Offering Period, but may participate in any subsequent Offering Period. 
Restrictions on Transferability 
Payroll deductions credited to a Participant's account and any Purchase Rights granted under the GESPP may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution) by the Participant. Any attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition will be without effect, except that we may treat such act as an election to withdraw from the GESPP.  Effect of Recapitalization and Reorganization 
In the event of certain changes in our capitalization, the compensation committee will appropriately adjust the number and class of shares of Common Stock subject to the GESPP and each Purchase Right and/or the Purchase Price. The compensation committee also has discretion to make equitable adjustments to the GESPP in the event of other changes in our capital structure or business to prevent the substantial dilution or enlargement of rights granted to, or available for, Participants under the GESPP. 
Effect of Change in Control 
In the event of a change in control, as defined by the GESPP, any surviving or acquiring corporation may assume our rights and obligations under the GESPP. If the surviving or acquiring corporation does not assume our rights and obligations under outstanding Purchase Rights, the Purchase Date of the then current Offering Period will be accelerated to a date before the date of the change in control, but the number of shares of Common Stock subject to outstanding Purchase Rights will not be adjusted. All Purchase Rights that are neither assumed nor exercised as of the date of the change in control will terminate and cease to be outstanding effective as of the date of the change in control. 
Amendment and Termination 
The Board or the compensation committee may amend the GESPP at any time; provided that any outstanding Purchase Right granted before an amendment of the GESPP is not materially adversely affected by any such amendment, except as necessary to comply with applicable laws, listing requirements or governmental regulations (including Section 423 of the Code), or as necessary to obtain or maintain favorable tax, listing or regulatory treatment. An amendment must be approved by our stockholders as described above within 12 months of the adoption of such amendment if the amendment authorizes the sale of more shares of Common Stock than are authorized for issuance under the GESPP or changes the definition of the corporations or companies that may be designated by the compensation committee as participating in the GESPP. 
Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences 
The following is a summary of the principal United States federal income tax consequences to Participants in the United States and to us with respect to participation in the Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP. The rules concerning the federal income tax consequences with respect to participation in the GESPP are quite technical. Moreover, the applicable statutory provisions are subject to change, as are their interpretations and applications which may vary in individual circumstances. Therefore, the following is designed to provide a general understanding of the federal income tax consequences. In addition, the following discussion does not set forth any gift, estate, social security or state or local tax consequences that may be applicable, and such discussion is limited to the U.S. federal income tax consequences to individuals who are citizens or residents of the United States, other than those individuals who are taxed on a residence basis in a foreign country. Because the tax consequences to any Participant may depend on his or her particular situation, each Participant should consult his or her own tax adviser regarding the federal, state, local, and other tax consequences of the grant or exercise of a Purchase Right or the sale or other disposition of shares of Common Stock acquired under the GESPP. The GESPP is not subject to any of the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. The GESPP is not, nor is it intended to be, qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. 
Rights granted under the GESPP are intended to qualify for favorable federal income tax treatment associated with rights granted under an employee stock purchase plan which qualifies under the provisions of Section 423 of the Code. 
A Participant will be taxed on amounts withheld for the purchase of shares of Common Stock, but will not recognize taxable income as a result of the granting or exercise of a Purchase Right until a sale or other   disposition of the acquired shares. The taxation upon such sale or other disposition will depend upon the holding period of the acquired shares. 
If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of more than two years after the beginning of the Offering Period and more than one year after the shares are transferred to the Participant, then the lesser of the following will be treated as ordinary income: (i) the excess of the fair market value of the shares at the time of such sale or other disposition over the Purchase Price, or (ii) the excess of the fair market value of the shares as of the beginning of the Offering Period over the Purchase Price (determined as of the beginning of the Offering Period). Any further gain or any loss will be taxed as a long-term capital gain or loss. 
If the shares are sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of either of the holding periods described above, then the excess of the fair market value of the shares on the Purchase Date over the Purchase Price will be treated as ordinary income at the time of such sale or other disposition. The balance of any gain will be treated as capital gain. Even if the shares are later sold or otherwise disposed of for less than their fair market value on the purchase date, the same amount of ordinary income is attributed to the Participant, and a capital loss is recognized equal to the difference between the sales price and the fair market value of the shares on such purchase date. Any capital gain or loss will be short-term or long-term, depending on how long the shares have been held. 
There are no federal income tax consequences to us by reason of the grant or exercise of rights under the GESPP. We will be entitled to a deduction to the extent amounts are taxed and reported as ordinary income to a Participant for shares sold or otherwise disposed of before the expiration of the holding periods described above (subject to the requirement of reasonableness and the satisfaction of tax reporting obligations). 
New Plan Benefits 
Participation in the GESPP is voluntary and each eligible employee will make his or her own decision regarding whether and to what extent to participate in the GESPP. In addition, the Board and the compensation committee have not granted any Purchase Rights under the GESPP that are subject to stockholder approval of this proposal. Accordingly, the benefits or amounts that will be received by or allocated to our executive officers and other employees under the GESPP, as well as the benefits or amounts that would have been received by or allocated to our executive officers and other employees for fiscal year 2018 if the GESPP had been in effect, are not determinable. Our non-employee directors will be ineligible to participate in the GESPP. 
"FOR" votes from the holders of a majority of the votes represented by our Voting Stock present at the Annual Meeting or represented by proxy and voting on the matter are required in order to approve Proposal Two.

Report of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors 
The audit committee's general role is to assist the Board in monitoring our financial reporting process and related matters. Its specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter. 
The audit committee has reviewed our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 and met with management, as well as with representatives of KPMG LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss the consolidated financial statements. The audit committee also discussed with members of KPMG LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standard No. 16, "Communications with Audit Committees," as adopted by the PCAOB. 
In addition, the audit committee received the written disclosures and the letter from KPMG LLP required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence and discussed with members of KPMG LLP its independence. 
Based on these discussions, the financial statement review and other matters it deemed relevant, the audit committee recommended to the Board that Ceridian's audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal year 2018 be included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Employment and Separation Agreements 
As of December 31, 2018, we were party to employment agreements with each of our NEOs. Additionally, on August 7, 2018, we entered into a separation and consulting agreement with Mr. Elliott. The material provisions of each such agreement are described below. 
David D. Ossip 
In April 2012, we entered into an employment agreement with David D. Ossip, our Chief Executive Officer. The agreement provides for an indefinite term beginning on January 1, 2012. The agreement provides that Mr. Ossip would receive an annualized base salary, subject to annual compensation reviews by our Board. In 2018, Mr. Ossip's base salary was $700,000 USD. The agreement also provides that Mr. Ossip is eligible to receive an annual performance-based cash bonus based on Mr. Ossip's performance. In 2018, Mr. Ossip's annual cash bonus at target was $800,000 USD. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Mr. Ossip received $800,000 USD for his 2018 annual performance-based cash bonus, which represented approximately 114% of his base salary, of which forty percent (40%) was earned as a result of the achievement of a Company financial goal under the 2018 annual performance-based cash incentive plan and sixty percent (60%) was paid pursuant to the compensation committee's discretion in light of the many positive developments led by management in 2018, including the execution of one of the most successful initial public offerings in 2018 and new records in Dayforce and Cloud revenue. Further, in light of these positive developments, Mr. Ossip received an option to purchase 10,390 shares of Common Stock on February 8, 2019 representing the fair value of approximately 15% of his 2018 annual performance-based cash bonus at target. 
In addition to the above, Mr. Ossip participates in the employee health and welfare, retirement and other employee benefits programs offered generally from time to time by us to our senior executive employees. 
Either we or Mr. Ossip may terminate the agreement any time upon written notice or any time with 90 days' prior written notice, respectively. We may terminate Mr. Ossip's employment for death, "disability," or "cause," as defined in the employment agreement, by written notice to Mr. Ossip. Mr. Ossip may resign with prior written notice for "good reason."  If we terminate Mr. Ossip's employment without "cause" or Mr. Ossip terminates his employment for "good reason," then we must provide Mr. Ossip with (i) an amount equal to 24 months of his annual base salary, (ii) an amount equal to two times the average bonus payment paid to Mr. Ossip for the immediately preceding two years, (iii) reasonable executive-level outplacement services for a period of up to 12 months, not to exceed $12,000 CAD (or $8,800 USD as of December 31, 2018) and (iv) continuation of certain employment related benefits for the period prescribed under the Employment Standards Act (Ontario). 
In the event that Mr. Ossip's employment is terminated due to his death, we must provide Mr. Ossip's beneficiaries with (i) an amount equal to 12 months of his annual base salary, and (ii) a pro-rated bonus, if any, to which Mr. Ossip would have become entitled for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs based on actual performance. In the event that Mr. Ossip's employment is terminated due to "disability," we must provide Mr. Ossip with a pro-rated bonus, if any, to which Mr. Ossip would have become entitled for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs based on actual performance. 
For purposes of the agreement, "good reason" means any act, or failure to act, or omission by us that would constitute at law in the Province of Ontario constructive dismissal of Mr. Ossip, including without limitation the occurrence of one or more of the following conditions, without Mr. Ossip's consent: (i) any material adverse change in his duties, roles and responsibilities, (ii) any adverse change to Mr. Ossip's line of reporting or (iii) the relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 40 kilometers; provided that any such condition will only constitute good reason if Mr. Ossip provides us with a prior written notice of his intent to resign for good reason (which notice must reference the definition of good reason in his employment agreement and include a description of the factors constituting the alleged good reason) and we have not remedied the alleged violations within 30 days of such notice. 
For purposes of the agreement, "cause" means any event, act, or failure to act, or omission by Mr. Ossip which would constitute at law in the Province of Ontario cause for dismissal, including without limitation (i) conduct involving material theft or misappropriation of our assets and those of our affiliates, (ii) fraud or embezzlement of a material nature against us and our affiliates, (iii) any material act of dishonesty, financial or otherwise, against us and our affiliates or (iv) any conviction of an indictable offense under the Canadian Criminal Code. 
The agreement includes perpetual confidentiality provisions, as well as provisions relating to assignment of inventions. 
In addition, in March 2017, Mr. Ossip was granted options to purchase 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock and was granted restricted stock units relating to 500,000 shares of Common Stock (collectively, the "Equity Awards"). Such Equity Awards served as consideration for Mr. Ossip to enter into an Amended and Restated Restrictive Covenants Agreement with Ceridian Holding LLC, Ceridian LLC, Ceridian Canada Ltd. and Ceridian Dayforce Corporation, which became effective as of March 20, 2017 (the "Restrictive Covenants Agreement"). Under the Restrictive Covenants Agreement, Mr. Ossip has agreed, among other things, that subsequent to any termination, he will not engage in, consult for, or own more than 5% of any business that is similar to that of our business in any country in which we do business for a period of 24 months subsequent to such termination. We may elect to extend such restriction period by a total of either 12 months or 24 months, so long as we pay Mr. Ossip a lump sum equal to his prior year's base salary, plus $800,000 USD, for each year the restriction period is extended. 
Paul D. Elliott 
Separation and Consulting Agreement 
On August 7, 2018, we entered into a Separation and Consulting Agreement (the "Separation Agreement") with Paul D. Elliott, our then President and Chief Operating Officer in connection with his mutually agreed   termination of employment to be effective as of May 1, 2019 (the "Separation Date"). Mr. Elliott immediately resigned as our President but will continue to serve as our Chief Operating Officer through the Separation Date. Within ten business days following Mr. Elliott's execution of a general release of claims after the Separation Date, Mr. Elliott will receive: (i) a lump sum payment of $950,000 CAD (or $696,634 USD as of December 31, 2018), (ii) a pro-rated bonus for the 2019 fiscal year based on actual achievement of performance goals and (iii) reasonable executive-level outplacement services for a period of up to 12 months, not to exceed $12,000 CAD (or $8,800 as of December 31, 2018). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement, Mr. Elliott reaffirmed the restrictive covenants contained in his employment agreement. The Separation Agreement supersedes all previous agreements between us and Mr. Elliott relating to his employment other than to the extent that Mr. Elliott's employment agreement, as described below, is amended by the Separation Agreement and continues in force until the Separation Date, and each of us and Mr. Elliott released and discharged the other in respect of such previous agreements. 
Following the Separation Date, Mr. Elliott will be engaged without interruption as a consultant through June 30, 2020 (the "Consulting Period"). During the Consulting Period, Mr. Elliott will provide general business consultation services to us, including with respect to the operations and customer support areas of our business. The only consideration that Mr. Elliott will receive during the Consulting Period is continued vesting of his outstanding stock options in accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreements. 
Employment Agreement 
In April 2016, we entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Elliott. The agreement provides for an indefinite term beginning on April 20, 2016. The agreement provides that Mr. Elliott would receive an annualized base salary, subject to annual compensation reviews by our Board. In 2018, Mr. Elliott's base salary was $475,000 CAD (or $348,317 USD as of December 31, 2018). The agreement also provides that Mr. Elliott is eligible to receive an annual performance-based cash bonus with a target amount of 80% of his annual base salary. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Mr. Elliott received $380,000 CAD (or $278,654 USD as of December 31, 2018) for his 2018 annual performance-based cash bonus, which represented 80% of his base salary, of which forty percent (40%) was earned as a result of the achievement of a Company financial goal under the 2018 annual performance-based cash incentive plan and sixty percent (60%) was paid pursuant to the compensation committee's discretion in light of the many positive developments led by management in 2018, including the execution of one of the most successful initial public offerings in 2018 and new records in Dayforce and Cloud revenue. Further, in light of these positive developments, Mr. Elliott received an option to purchase 3,619 shares of Common Stock on February 8, 2019 representing the fair value of approximately 15% of his 2018 annual performance-based cash bonus at target. 
In addition, on November 18, 2013, we entered into a "Success Bonus Plan" with key employees as of that date, including Mr. Elliott. Under the terms of Mr. Elliott's Success Bonus Plan, he is entitled to receive a cash bonus of $600,000 USD, fifty percent (50%) of which was paid upon signing his employment agreement in April 2016, twenty-five percent (25%) was paid on April 28, 2017, and the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) was paid on April 30, 2018. 
In addition to the above, Mr. Elliott participated in the employee health and welfare, retirement and other employee benefits programs offered generally from time to time by us to our senior executive employees. 
Either we or Mr. Elliott may terminate the agreement any time upon written notice or any time with 60 days' prior written notice, respectively. We may terminate Mr. Elliott's employment for death, "disability," or "cause" by written notice to Mr. Elliott. Mr. Elliott may resign with prior written notice for "good reason." 
If we terminate Mr. Elliott's employment without "cause" or Mr. Elliott terminates his employment for "good reason," then we must provide Mr. Elliott with (i) an amount equal to 24 months of his annual base salary, (ii) a pro-rated bonus (at target level) for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs, (iii) reasonable   executive-level outplacement services for a period of up to 12 months, not to exceed $12,000 CAD (or $8,800 USD as of December 31, 2018), and (iv) continuation of certain employment related benefits for the period prescribed under the Employment Standards Act (Ontario). 
In the event that Mr. Elliott's employment is terminated due to his death, we must provide Mr. Elliott's beneficiaries with (i) an amount equal to 12 months of his annual base salary, and (ii) a pro-rated bonus, if any, to which Mr. Elliott would have become entitled for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs based on actual performance. In the event that Mr. Elliott's employment is terminated due to "disability," we must provide Mr. Elliott with a pro-rated bonus, if any, to which Mr. Elliott would have become entitled for the fiscal year in which his termination occurs based on actual performance. 
For purposes of the agreement, "good reason" means any act, or failure to act, or omission by us that would constitute at law in the Province of Ontario constructive dismissal of Mr. Elliott, including without limitation the occurrence of one or more of the following conditions, without Mr. Elliott's consent: (i) any material adverse change in his duties, roles and responsibilities, (ii) any adverse change to Mr. Elliott's line of reporting or (iii) the relocation of his principal place of employment by more than 50 kilometers; provided that any such condition will only constitute good reason if Mr. Elliott provides us with a prior written notice of his intent to resign for good reason (which notice must reference the definition of good reason in his employment agreement and include a description of the factors constituting the alleged good reason) and we have not remedied the alleged violations within 30 days of such notice. 
For purposes of the agreement, "cause" means any event, act or failure to act, or omission by Mr. Elliott which would constitute at law in the Province of Ontario cause for dismissal, including without limitation (i) conduct involving theft or misappropriation of our assets and those of our affiliates, (ii) fraud, embezzlement or an indictable offense under the Canadian Criminal Code, (iii) any material act of dishonesty, financial or otherwise, against us and our affiliates, (iv) intentional violations of law involving moral turpitude, (v) any material violation of our Code of Conduct and ethics policies, (vi) breach of Mr. Elliott's obligations under any non-competition, non-solicitation or other similar agreement made with any of us and our affiliates, or (vii) the continued failure by Mr. Elliott to attempt in good faith to perform his duties after receiving a written notice and a demand to rectify such failure within 60 days. 
The agreement includes perpetual confidentiality provisions and a non-disparagement provision, as well as provisions relating to assignment of inventions and non-competition and non-solicitation that apply during employment and two years thereafter. 
Leagh E. Turner 
In August 2018, we entered into an employment agreement with Leagh E. Turner, our President. The agreement provides for an indefinite term beginning on September 4, 2018. The agreement provides that Ms. Turner will receive an annualized base salary of $655,000 USD, subject to annual compensation reviews by our Board. The agreement also provides that Ms. Turner is eligible to receive an annual performance-based cash bonus with a target amount of 60% of her annual base salary. Pursuant to the agreement, she received a signing bonus of $200,000 USD on September 14, 2018, and a bonus of $393,000 USD since she was an employee on December 31, 2018. Also, Ms. Turner will receive additional consideration in the form of (i) up to $30,000 USD for the services of an executive coach of her choosing, and (ii) up to $20,000 USD for the cost of attending the Institute of Corporate Directors—Director Education Program (through the Rotman School of Management).

Either we or Ms. Turner may terminate the agreement any time with 90 days' prior written notice. We may terminate Ms. Turner's employment for death, "disability," or with or without "cause" by written notice to Ms. Turner. 
Ms. Turner's employment agreement also provides that if her employment is terminated without cause, she will receive a lump sum cash payment equal to (i) 18 months of total compensation (base salary plus incentive payment at target) if the termination occurs on or before the seventh anniversary of her start date, or (ii) 24 months of total compensation if the termination occurs after the seventh anniversary of her start date. Further, Ms. Turner will also receive a pro-rated portion of the variable incentive plan payment that she would have been entitled to receive for the fiscal year in which her termination occurs had she remained an employee of Ceridian Canada, executive outplacement service for a period of up to 12 months following termination in an amount not to exceed $10,000 USD, and continuation of healthcare coverage based on her termination date for up to 18 to 24 months following her termination of employment. 
Further, Ms. Turner's employment agreement provides that if her employment is terminated due to death or Disability (as such term is defined in her employment agreement), that she would receive a pro-rated portion of the variable incentive plan payment that she would have been entitled to receive for the fiscal year in which her death or Disability occurs had she remained continuously employed for the full fiscal year.

Potential Payments Upon Termination Of Employment Or Change Of Control

In addition, certain equity awards may be accelerated upon a change of control, as further described in "—Outstanding Equity Awards as of December 31, 2018".

The annual retention fee is comprised of restricted stock units valued at $150,000 and $50,000 in cash, which the independent non-employee director may also elect to be paid in whole or in part in the form of additional restricted stock units.

Equity Compensation Plan Information 
Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
As discussed above, our stockholders are being asked to consider and act upon a proposal to approve the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "GESPP"). The GESPP was approved unanimously and adopted by the Board at its meeting on November 9, 2018, at which time it became effective, subject to approval by our stockholders. The material terms of the GESPP are discussed above under Proposal 2—approval of the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 
Equity Incentive Plans 
Our Board adopted, and our stockholders approved, the 2013 Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the "2013 Plan"), and the Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The 2018 Plan authorizes us to grant incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. A total of 13,500,000 shares of our Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan. We filed a registration statement on Form S-8 covering the shares issuable under the 2013 Plan and the 2018 Plan on April 25, 2018. The following is a summary of the material features of the 2013 Plan and the 2018 Plan. 
2013 Plan. The 2013 Plan provides for the grant of options, share awards and other share-based awards to our directors, employees, and consultants as well as to directors, employees, and consultants of any of our subsidiaries or affiliates. A total of 9,356,904 shares of our Common Stock are subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan as of December 31, 2018. We do not intend to grant any further awards under the 2013 Plan. 
2018 Plan. The 2018 Plan was adopted by our Board and approved by our stockholders in connection with our initial public offering. The purpose of the 2018 Plan is to further align the interests of eligible participants with those of our stockholders by providing long-term incentive compensation opportunities tied to both our performance and that of our Common Stock. The 2018 Plan is intended to advance our interests and to increase stockholder value by attracting, retaining, and motivating key personnel upon whose judgment, initiative, and   effort the successful conduct of our business is largely dependent. Our Board and management believe that equity awards are necessary to remain competitive in our industry and are essential to recruiting and retaining the highly qualified employees who help us meet our goals. 
Any officer, employee, non-employee director, consultant or any natural person who is a consultant or advisor of ours or of any of our subsidiaries is eligible to receive Awards (as defined below) under the 2018 Plan. The selection of participants is within the sole discretion of the Committee (as defined below). Incentive stock options may be granted only to our employees and employees of certain of our subsidiaries. As of the date of this Proxy Statement, there are approximately 4,531 employees (including 8 officers and 7 non-employee directors) who are eligible to participate in the 2018 Plan on the basis of their services provided to us. 
The 2018 Plan is administered by the compensation committee of our Board, such other committee of the Board appointed by our Board to administer the 2018 Plan, or the Board, as determined by our Board (in each case, the "Committee"). 
A total of 13,500,000 shares of our Common Stock are reserved for issuance under the 2018 Plan (the "Share Reserve"), and a total of 5,218,315 shares of our Common Stock are subject to outstanding awards under the 2018 Plan as of December 31, 2018. The 2018 Plan permits the grant of (a) nonqualified stock options, (b) incentive stock options, (c) stock appreciation rights, (d) restricted stock awards, (e) restricted stock units, (f) cash incentive awards, and (g) stock awards (collectively, "Awards"). Awards may be granted singly or in combination. The Share Reserve will be increased on March 31 of each of the first ten calendar years during the term of the Plan, by the lesser of (i) three percent (3%) of the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding on each January 31 immediately prior to the date of increase or (ii) such number of shares of our Common Stock determined by the Board or Committee. As of March 31, 2019, the Share Reserve will increase by three percent (3%) of the number of shares of the Company's Common Stock outstanding on January 31, 2019 or 4,196,193 shares. 
No non-employee director may be granted, during any calendar year, Awards having a fair value (determined on the date of grant) that, when added to all other compensation paid to the non-employee director during the same calendar year for service as a member of our Board, exceeds $600,000, or for the non-executive chairman of the Board, if any, $750,000.

Beneficial ownership of shares is determined under rules of the SEC and generally includes any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Except as noted by footnote, and subject to community property laws where applicable, we believe based on the information provided to us that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of our Common Stock shown as beneficially owned by them.

(2)  Includes 32,739,227 shares of Common Stock held by Cannae Holdings, LLC, formerly known as Fidelity  National Financial Ventures, LLC. Cannae Holdings, LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cannae Holdings, Inc., a publicly traded company listed on the NYSE ("Cannae"). The chairman and the president of Cannae have voting and investment  power over such shares. The address of Cannae Holdings, Inc. is 1701 Village Center Circle, Las Vegas, Nevada 89134. On November 7, 2018, Cannae announced that one of its subsidiaries had entered into a three year margin loan pursuant to which  it could borrow up to $300.0 million. The margin loan is guaranteed by Cannae for a period of up to one year and is further secured by a pledge of 25.0 million shares of our Common Stock beneficially owned by Cannae. The loan requires that  a certain loan to value ratio (based on the value of the shares of our Common Stock pledged to secure the loan) be maintained. In the event that the ratio is not maintained, the borrower must post additional cash collateral and/or elect to repay a  portion of the loan. The loan also contains provisions that, subject to their terms, effectively require prepayment in the event of certain customary events of default, including Cannae's failure to comply with specified financial ratios or the  triggering of a requirement of prepayment under any other material indebtedness. In the event that Cannae borrows under the margin loan and there is an event of default, if Cannae fails to pledge additional cash collateral and/or repay a portion of  the loan when it is required to do so or if Cannae otherwise fails to comply with the respective terms of the margin loan and the lender accelerates payment of all amounts outstanding under the loan as a result of this  non-compliance, then the lender could foreclose on the pledged shares and sell the shares of Common Stock in the open market.

Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our directors and executive officers and persons who own more than ten percent of our Common Stock (the "Reporting Persons") to file with the SEC initial reports of beneficial ownership and reports of changes in beneficial ownership. The Reporting Persons are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all such reports. 
Based solely on our review of the copies of any Section 16(a) forms received by us or written representations from the Reporting Persons, we believe that with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, all Reporting Persons complied with all applicable filing requirements.  CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
Set forth below is a description of certain relationships and related person transactions between us or our subsidiaries and our directors, executive officers or holders of more than 5% of our voting securities. 
Registration Rights Agreement 
On April 30, 2018, in connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the Sponsors, David D. Ossip, Alon Ossip, the brother of David D. Ossip, and entities controlled by each of David D. Ossip and Alon Ossip in respect of the shares of Common Stock and Exchangeable Shares held by such holder immediately following the initial public offering. This agreement provides these holders (and their permitted transferees) with the right to require us, at our expense, to register shares of our Common Stock that they hold. The agreement also provides that we will pay certain expenses of these electing holders relating to such registrations and indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. 
Voting Agreement 
On April 30, 2018, in connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a voting agreement with the Sponsors, pursuant to which we are required to take all necessary action to cause the Board to include individuals designated by the Sponsors. These designation rights are described in this Proxy Statement in the section titled "Board of Directors and Corporate Governance—Board Membership." The voting agreement also requires the Sponsors to consult with one another regarding the transfer of their equity securities in us. 
Management Agreements 
Prior to our initial public offering, Ceridian was party to management agreements with affiliates of our Sponsors, FNF and THL Managers VI, LLC ("THLM"). FNF assigned its management agreement to Cannae in November 2017. Pursuant to these management agreements, Cannae and THLM each, respectively, agreed to provide us with financial advisory, strategic, and general oversight services. 
In April 2018, the management agreements terminated upon consummation of our initial public offering. Upon termination and pursuant to the terms of the management agreements, we paid a termination fee equal to the net present value of the management fee for a seven-year period, which was $11.3 million. 
We recorded a management fee expense in selling, general, and administrative expense of $12.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to these management agreements. 
Indebtedness 
Prior to its November 2017 split-off from FNF, Cannae was an affiliate of FNF. We redeemed $24.0 million of our previously-outstanding $475.0 million principal amount senior notes due 2021 (the "Senior Notes") from FNF and its subsidiaries on May 30, 2018. We had previously made $1.3 million in interest payments to FNF and its subsidiaries during the year ended December 31, 2018. FNF and its subsidiaries conducted the debt transactions through third parties in the ordinary course of their business and not directly with us. Following Cannae's split-off from FNF, FNF retained ownership of the Senior Notes. 
Service and Vendor Related Agreements 
We are a party to a service agreement with CompuCom Systems, Inc. ("CompuCom"), an investment portfolio company of THLM. Pursuant to the service agreement, CompuCom agrees to provide us with service desk and desk side support services. Pursuant to this arrangement, we made payments to CompuCom totaling $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Other Transactions 
On July 23, 2018, Ronald F. Clarke was appointed to our Board. Mr. Clarke has been the chief executive officer of FleetCor Technologies since August 2000 and chairman of its board of directors since March 2003. We provide services to FleetCor Technologies or one of its wholly owned affiliates through certain commercial arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business, which include: provision of Dayforce HCM services; reseller / referral arrangements whereby we resell / refer FleetCor Technologies services to its customers; and other administrative services. For these services, we have recorded revenue of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
We provide Dayforce and related services to The Stronach Group, for which we recorded revenue of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Alon Ossip, the brother of David D. Ossip, was the chief executive officer, and is currently a minority shareholder, of The Stronach Group. 
We provide Dayforce and payroll-related tax filing services to FNF, for which we recorded revenue of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
We provide Dayforce and related services to certain investment portfolio companies of THLM and Cannae. We recorded revenue of $1.8 million from American Blue Ribbon Holdings, LLC; $0.5 million from Essex Bargain Hunt Superstores; $0.5 million from Guaranteed Rate; $0.3 million from Phillips Feed Services; and $0.3 million from System One Holdings LLC for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Immediately subsequent to our initial public offering on April 30, 2018, THL / Cannae Investors LLC, one of our existing stockholders controlled by our Sponsors, purchased from us in a private placement $100.0 million of our Common Stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Based on the initial public offering price of $22.00 per share, 4,545,455 shares were issued in this private placement. 
Policies for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
Our Board has adopted a Code of Conduct that contains a written policy relating to the approval of related person transactions.

1.1  Purpose. The Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. Global Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  "GESPP") provides Eligible Employees an opportunity to become an owner of Ceridian HCM Holding Inc. (the "Company") and play a role in our future. The Company intends for the GESPP to have two components: a component that is  intended to qualify as an "employee stock purchase plan" under Code Section 423 (the "Code Section 423 Component"), and a component that is not intended to qualify as an "employee stock  purchase plan" under Code Section 423 (the "Non-Code Section 423 Component"). The provisions of the Code Section 423 Component shall be construed so as to  extend and limit participation in a uniform and non-discriminatory basis consistent with the requirements of Code Section 423. A right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the Non-Code Section 423 Component shall be effectuated via separate offerings under one or more sub-plans of the Non-Code  Section 423 Component of the GESPP for Employees of Participating Non-423 Subsidiaries in countries outside of the United States in order to achieve tax, employment, securities law or other purposes and  objectives, and to conform the terms of the sub-plans with the laws and requirements of such countries. Except as otherwise provided herein or in the applicable  sub-plan, the Non-Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP shall be operated and administered in the same manner as the Code Section 423 Component.

1.2  Term of the GESPP; Stockholder Approval.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Offering Period may commence after the Board has  adopted the GESPP but prior to the Company's stockholders approving the GESPP; provided, that any Purchase Rights granted pursuant to such Offering Period shall be contingent upon receipt of the approval of the GESPP by Company stockholders  within 12 months of the date the Board adopted the GESPP. If Company stockholders do not approve the GESPP, all Contributions made under the GESPP for the applicable Offering Period shall be refunded to Participants, without interest, as soon  as reasonably practicable and no shares of Common Stock shall be issued under the GESPP.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  (b)  In connection with each Offering Period made under the GESPP, no more than 500,000 (five hundred thousand)  aggregate shares of Common Stock may be purchased by all Participants pursuant to such Offering Period. If the aggregate purchase of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Purchase Rights granted under the Offering Period exceeds 500,000  (five hundred thousand) shares, then, in the absence of any Committee action otherwise, a pro rata (based on each Participant's accumulated Contributions for such Offering Period) allocation of the shares of Common Stock available will be made  in as nearly a uniform manner as will be practicable and equitable.

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
5.4  Limitation under Code Section 423(b)(8). Notwithstanding any provision in the  GESPP to the contrary, no Participant shall be granted a Purchase Right under the Code Section 423 Component of the GESPP to the extent that it permits his or her right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the GESPP to accrue at a rate  which, when aggregated with such Participant's rights to purchase shares under all other employee stock purchase plans of a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 423, exceeds  Twenty-Five Thousand U.S. Dollars ($25,000) in Fair Market Value of shares of Common Stock (or such other limit, if any, as may be imposed by the Code) for each calendar year in which such Purchase Right is outstanding at any time. Any Contributions  in excess of the amount specified in the foregoing sentence shall be returned to the Participant as soon as administratively practicable following the next Purchase Date.

No adjustment shall be made for dividends, distributions or other rights for  which the record date is prior to the date such certificate is issued, except as provided in Section 8.1. Nothing herein shall confer upon a Participant any right to continue in the employ of a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary or  a Participating Non-Code Section 423 Subsidiary, or interfere in any way with any right of a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary or a Participating  Non-Code Section 423 Subsidiary to terminate the Participant's employment at any time, except as otherwise provided under applicable law.

In the event, with respect to any Offering hereunder, that the number of whole  shares of Common Stock that might be purchased by all Participants in the GESPP on a Purchase Date exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock available in the GESPP as provided in Section 7.1, the Committee shall make a pro rata allocation of  the remaining shares in as uniform a manner as shall be practicable and as the Committee shall determine to be equitable.

The Company, a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary or a Participating Non-Code Section 423 Subsidiary may, but shall not be obligated to, withhold from any  compensation or other amounts payable to the Participant the amount necessary to meet such withholding obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the withholding obligations for any tax-related for  Participants who are Section 16 officers of the Company under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, shall be satisfied by withholding in shares of Common Stock to be issued upon purchase under the GESPP.

The Committee may direct that the certificates evidencing shares of Common Stock acquired by exercise of a Purchase Right refer to such requirement to give  prompt notice of disposition.

[BEGIN TABLE]
6.8  Clawback/Recoupment Policy. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all shares of  Common Stock acquired pursuant to the GESPP shall be and remain subject to any incentive compensation clawback or recoupment policy currently in effect or as may be adopted by the Board and, in each case, as may be amended from time to time.

[BEGIN TABLE]
7.3  Securities Laws. The Company shall not be obligated to issue any shares of Common Stock pursuant  to any offering under the GESPP at any time when the offer, issuance, or sale of shares covered by such Offering (i) has not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or does not comply with such other federal, state or non-U.S. laws, rules or regulations, or the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be listed, as the Company or the Board deems applicable, and (ii) in the opinion of  legal counsel for the Company, there is no exemption from the requirements of such laws, rules, regulations, or requirements available for the offer, issuance, and sale of such shares of Common Stock. Further, all shares of Common Stock acquired  pursuant to the GESPP shall be subject to the Company's policies concerning compliance with securities laws and regulations, as such policies may be amended from time to time. The issuance of shares of Common Stock under the GESPP shall be  subject to compliance with all applicable requirements of federal, state or non-U.S. laws, rules or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be  listed.

8.1  Adjustments for Changes in Shares of Common Stock. In the event of any stock dividend,  extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, recapitalization, combination, reclassification, or similar change in the capital structure of the Company, or in the event of any merger (including a merger effected for the purpose of  changing the Company's domicile), sale of assets, spin-off or other reorganization in which the Company is a party, appropriate adjustments shall be made in the number and class of shares of Common Stock  subject to the GESPP and each Purchase Right, and/or in the Purchase Price. If a majority of the shares of Common Stock which are of the same class as the shares of Common Stock that are subject to outstanding Purchase Rights are exchanged for,  converted into, or otherwise become (whether or not pursuant to a Change of Control as described in Section 8.2) shares of another corporation, the Committee may unilaterally amend the outstanding Purchase Rights to provide that such Purchase  Rights are exercisable for new shares of such other corporation. In the event of any such amendment, the number of shares of Common Stock subject to, and the Purchase Price of, the outstanding Purchase Rights shall be adjusted in a fair and  equitable manner, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion. In no event may the Purchase Price be decreased to an amount less than the par value, if any, of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Purchase Right. Subject to  applicable laws, rules or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be listed, the adjustments determined by the Committee pursuant to this Section 8.1 shall be final, binding and  conclusive.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

10.1  Code Section 409A. Purchase Rights granted under the GESPP are exempt from the  application of Code Section 409A. In furtherance of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision in the GESPP to the contrary, if the Committee determines that a Purchase Right granted under the GESPP may be subject to Code Section 409A  or that any provision in the GESPP would cause a Purchase Right under the GESPP to be subject to Code Section 409A, the Committee may amend the terms of the GESPP and/or of an outstanding Purchase Right granted under the GESPP, or take such  other action the Committee determines is necessary or appropriate, in each case, without the Participant's consent, to exempt any outstanding Purchase Rights that may be granted under the GESPP from or to allow any such Purchase Rights to  comply with Code Section 409A, but only to the extent any such amendments or action by the Committee would not violate Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company will have no liability to a Participant or any other party  if the Purchase Right under the GESPP that is intended to be exempt from or compliant with Code Section 409A is not so exempt or compliant or for any action taken by the Committee with respect thereto. The Company makes no representation that  the right to purchase shares of Common Stock under the GESPP is compliant with Code Section 409A.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.2  Tax Qualification. Although the Company may endeavor to (i) qualify a Purchase Right for favorable  tax treatment under the laws of the United States or jurisdictions outside of the United States or (ii) avoid adverse tax treatment (e.g., under Code Section 409A), the Company makes no representation to that effect and expressly disavows  any covenant to maintain favorable or avoid unfavorable tax treatment, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the GESPP. The Company shall be unconstrained in its corporate activities without regard to the potential negative tax impact on  Participant's under the GESPP.  
[END TABLE]
SECTION 11 
INDEMNIFICATION 
In addition to such other rights of indemnification as they may have as members of a committee or officers or employees of a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary or a Participating Non-Code Section 423 Subsidiary, the Committee, the Board and any persons to whom authority to act for the Committee, the Board, or the Company is delegated shall be indemnified by the Company against all reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the defense of any action, suit or proceeding, or in connection with any appeal therein, to which they or any of them may be a party by reason of any action taken or failure to act under or in connection with the GESPP, or any right granted hereunder, and against all amounts paid by them in settlement thereof (provided such settlement is approved by independent legal counsel selected by the Company) or paid by them in satisfaction of a judgment in any such action, suit or proceeding, except in relation to matters as to which it shall be adjudged in such action, suit or proceeding that such person is liable for gross negligence, bad faith or intentional misconduct in duties; provided, however, that within sixty (60) calendar days after the institution of such action, suit or proceeding, such person shall offer to the Company, in writing, the opportunity at its own expense to handle and defend the same. 
SECTION 12 
PLAN AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION; MISCELLANEOUS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.1  Termination. The Committee may terminate the GESPP at any time, except that such termination  shall not affect Purchase Rights previously granted under the GESPP.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.2  Amendment. Subject to applicable laws, rules or regulations or the requirements of any stock exchange  upon which the shares of Common Stock may then be listed, the Board or the Committee may make such modification or amendment to the GESPP as it shall deem advisable; provided, however, that no amendment may materially adversely affect a Purchase  Right previously granted under the GESPP (except to the extent permitted by the GESPP or as may be necessary to qualify the GESPP as an employee stock purchase plan pursuant to Code Section 423 or to obtain qualification or registration of the  shares of Common Stock under applicable federal, state or non-U.S. securities laws).  
[END TABLE]
An amendment must be approved by the stockholders of the Company within twelve (12) months of the adoption of such amendment if (i) such amendment would authorize the sale of more shares of Common Stock than are authorized for issuance under the GESPP or (ii) would change the definition of the corporations or companies that may be designated by the Committee as Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiaries or Participating Non-Code Section 423 Subsidiaries. In the event that the Board or the Committee approves an amendment to increase the number of shares of Common Stock authorized for issuance under the GESPP, the Board or Committee, as applicable and in its sole discretion, may specify that any such additional shares of Common Stock only may be issued pursuant to Purchase Rights granted after the date on which the stockholders of the Company approve such amendment, and such designation by the Board or Committee, as applicable, shall not be deemed to have adversely affected any Purchase Right granted prior to the date on which the stockholders approve the amendment. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.3  Death. Unless otherwise provided in an Enrollment Agreement or procedures established by the  Committee from time to time, in the event of the Participant's death, any accumulated Contributions not used to purchase shares of Common Stock shall be paid to and any shares of Common Stock credited to the deceased Participant's  brokerage or Plan account shall be transferred to the Participant's heirs or estate as soon as reasonably practicable following the Participant's death in accordance with applicable law; provided, for Participants employed in the United  States by the Company or a Participating Code Section 423 Subsidiary, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, permit such Participants to make a beneficiary designation in relation to the Participant's interests under the GESPP in such  manner and at such times as determined by the Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.4  Transferability. Contributions credited to a Participant's Plan account and any rights with regard  to the purchase of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a Purchase Right or to receive shares of Common Stock under the GESPP may not be assigned, alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise disposed of in any way (other than by will, the laws of  descent and distribution or as otherwise provided in the GESPP) by the Participant. Any such attempt at assignment, transfer, pledge or other disposition shall be without effect, except that the Company may treat such act as an election to withdraw  from the GESPP in accordance with Section 3  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.5  Use of Funds. All Contributions received or held by the Company under the GESPP may be used by  the Company for any corporate purpose, and the Company shall not be obligated to segregate such Contributions except as may be required by applicable local law, as determined by the Committee, and if so required by the laws of a particular  jurisdiction, shall apply to all Participants in the relevant Offering except to the extent otherwise permitted by U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.423-2(f). Until shares of Common Stock are issued,  Participants shall only have the rights of an unsecured creditor, although Participants in specified Offerings may have additional rights where required under local law, as determined by the Committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.6  Severability. If any particular provision of the GESPP is found to be invalid or otherwise  unenforceable, such determination shall not affect the other provisions of the GESPP and the GESPP shall be construed in all respects as if such invalid provision were omitted.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.7  Governing Law and Jurisdiction. Except to the extent that provisions of the GESPP are governed by  applicable provisions of the Code or any other substantive provision of federal law, the GESPP shall be  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.8  Currency. Unless otherwise specified, all references to currency throughout the GESPP shall be to U.S.  dollars.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.9  Headings. Headings are given to the Sections and subsections of the GESPP solely as a convenience to  facilitate reference. Such headings shall not be deemed in any way material or relevant to the construction or interpretation of the GESPP.
