MANPOWERGROUP INC.

Proxy Statement 
This proxy statement relates to the solicitation of proxies by the board of directors of ManpowerGroup Inc. for use at the annual meeting of shareholders to be held at 9:00 a.m., local time, on May 10, 2019 or at any postponement or adjournment of the annual meeting, for the purposes set forth in this proxy statement and in the accompanying notice of annual meeting of shareholders. The annual meeting will be held at ManpowerGroup's International Headquarters, 100 Manpower Place, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. 
Under rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission, ManpowerGroup is making this proxy statement and other annual meeting materials available on the Internet instead of mailing a printed copy of these materials to each shareholder. Shareholders who received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") by mail will not receive a printed copy of these materials other than as described below. Instead, the Notice contains instructions as to how shareholders may access and review all of the important information contained in the materials on the Internet, including how shareholders may submit proxies by telephone or over the Internet. 
If you received the Notice by mail and would prefer to receive a printed copy of ManpowerGroup's proxy materials, please follow the instructions for requesting printed copies included in the Notice. 
The expense of this solicitation will be paid by us. No solicitation other than by mail and via the Internet is contemplated, except that our officers or employees may solicit the return of proxies from certain shareholders by telephone. In addition, we have retained Innisfree M&A Incorporated to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $15,000 plus expenses. 
Only shareholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 are entitled to notice of and to vote the shares of our common stock, $.01 par value, registered in their name at the annual meeting. As of the record date, we had outstanding 60,039,776 shares of common stock. The presence, in person or by proxy, of a majority of the shares of the common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum at the annual meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are proxies from brokers or nominees indicating that such persons have not received instructions from the beneficial owners or other persons entitled to vote shares, will be treated as present for purposes of determining the quorum. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to cast one vote on each matter to be voted upon at the annual meeting. With respect to the proposals to elect the individuals nominated by our Board of Directors to serve as directors for one year, to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for 2019 and the advisory vote on approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as voting on the proposals. 
The Notice is being mailed to shareholders commencing on or about March 26, 2019. 
If a proxy is properly submitted to us and not revoked, it will be voted in accordance with the instructions contained in the proxy. Each shareholder may revoke a previously granted proxy at any time before it is exercised by advising the secretary of ManpowerGroup in writing (either by submitting a duly executed proxy bearing a later date or voting by telephone or via the Internet) or by telephone of such revocation. Attendance at the annual meeting will not, in itself, constitute revocation of a proxy. Unless otherwise directed, all proxies will be voted for the election of each of the individuals nominated by our board of directors to serve as directors for one year, will be voted for the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for 2019 and will be voted for approval of the compensation of our named executive officers.

1. Election of Directors 
Our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors will consist of three to fifteen members. Our board of directors currently consists of twelve members. All directors are elected annually to serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and until the directors' successors are duly elected and shall qualify. 
The board of directors may appoint additional directors, in accordance with our articles of incorporation, based upon the recommendation of the nominating and governance committee and subject to re-election by our shareholders at the next annual meeting of shareholders. 
The following individuals are being nominated as directors, each for a one-year term expiring at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders: 
In accordance with the Company's corporate governance guidelines regarding retirement, John R. Walter is retiring from the board of directors effective May 10, 2019, and will therefore not be seeking re-election. 
The nominating and governance committee reviewed the qualifications of the directors listed above who are seeking election or re-election and recommended to the board of directors that each be elected or re-elected to serve for an additional one-year term. The board of directors has confirmed the nominations. 
In accordance with our articles of incorporation and bylaws, a nominee will be elected as a director if the number of votes cast in favor of the election exceeds the number of votes cast against the election of that nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast. If the number of votes cast in favor of the election of a director is less than the number of votes cast against the election of the director, the director is required to tender his or her resignation from the board of directors to the nominating and governance committee. The nominating and governance committee will recommend to the board of directors whether to accept or reject the tendered resignation or whether other action should be taken. Any such resignation will be effective only upon its acceptance by the board of directors. The board of directors will act on the recommendation of the nominating and governance committee and publicly disclose its decision, and the rationale behind its decision, within 90 days from the date of the announcement of the final results of balloting for the election.

[END TABLE]
Each director attended at least 75% of the board meetings and meetings of committees on which he or she served in 2018. The board of directors held five regular meetings during 2018. The board of directors did not take action by written consent during 2018. 
Under the Company's corporate governance guidelines, an individual cannot be nominated for election to the board of directors after his or her 72nd birthday. Any director who turns 72 during his or her normal term will continue in office until the expiration of that term. As previously stated, Mr. Walter will retire from the board of directors at the end of his current term, May 10, 2019, and will therefore not be seeking re-election. 
Under ManpowerGroup's bylaws, nominations, other than those made by the board of directors or the nominating and governance committee, must be made pursuant to timely notice in proper written form to the Secretary of ManpowerGroup. To be timely, a shareholder's request to nominate a person for election to the board of directors at an annual meeting of shareholders, together with the written consent of such person to serve as a director, must be received by the Secretary of ManpowerGroup not less than 90 days nor more than 150 days prior to the anniversary of the annual meeting of shareholders held in the prior year. To be in proper written form, the notice must contain certain information concerning the nominee and the shareholder submitting the nomination, including the disclosure of any hedging, derivative or other complex transactions involving the Company's common stock to which a shareholder proposing a director nomination is a party.

Board Independence and Related Party Transactions 
The board of directors has adopted categorical standards for relationships deemed not to impair independence of non-employee directors to assist it in making determinations of independence. The categorical standards are included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and are available on ManpowerGroup's website at http://investor.manpowergroup.com/governance. As required under the Corporate Governance Guidelines, our board of directors reviews and determines the independence of all directors on an annual basis. 
In making its independence determinations, the nominating and governance committee evaluates the various commercial and employment transactions and relationships known to the committee that exist between ManpowerGroup and the entities with which certain of our directors or members of their immediate families are, or have been, affiliated. The nominating and governance committee also reviews any other relevant facts and circumstances regarding the nature of these relationships to determine whether other factors, regardless of the categorical standards, might compromise a director's independence. 
The board of directors has determined that ten of twelve of the current directors of ManpowerGroup are independent under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange after taking into account the categorical standards and the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Ms. Boswell is President, US Customer Development at Unilever, which has engaged ManpowerGroup to provide services to  the company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Payne is a trustee of Northwestern Mutual. Northwestern Mutual and certain of its affiliates have engaged  ManpowerGroup to provide services to the company.  
[END TABLE]
The independent directors are Ms. Boswell, Ms. Dominguez, Mr. Downe, Mr. Ferraro, Ms. Howard, Ms. Hemingway Hall, Mr. Payne, Mr. Read, Ms. Sartain, and Mr. Walter. 
Mr. Van Handel previously served as an executive officer of the company and, as such, does not currently qualify as independent under the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Prising also does not qualify as independent under the listing rules of the New York Stock Exchange because he is currently an executive officer. 
The nominating and governance committee will evaluate eligible shareholder-nominated candidates for election to the board of directors in accordance with the procedures described in ManpowerGroup's bylaws and in accordance with the guidelines and considerations relating to the selection of candidates for membership on the board of directors described under the heading "Board Composition and Qualifications of Board Members." 
ManpowerGroup does not have a policy regarding board members' attendance at the annual meeting of shareholders. All of the directors attended the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
Any interested party who wishes to communicate directly with the lead director or with the non-management directors as a group may do so by calling 1-800-210-3458. The third-party service provider that monitors this telephone number will forward a summary of all communications directed to the non-management directors to the lead director.

[END TABLE]
In connection with its consideration of possible candidates for board membership, the committee also has identified areas of experience that members of the board should as a goal collectively possess. The below graphic lists these skills and attributes and indicates which of the director nominees possess each. As shown, these skills and attributes are well represented within this group. 
Gina R. Boswell Cari M. Dominguez William Downe John F. Ferraro Patricia Hemingway Hall Julie M. Howard Ulice Payne, Jr. Jonas Prising Paul Read Elizabeth P. Sartain Michael J. Van Handel Previous Board Experience serving as a director of another public company International Business Experience in diverse geographic, political and regulatory environments Corporate Governance Supports our goals of strong Board and management accountability Active or Former CEO/Chairperson or other C-Suite Officer Served in a senior leadership role at a large organization Sales Experience developing strategies to grow sales and market share Government Relations Understanding of government regulations affecting our business Human Resources Experience building knowledge, skills and abilities of employees Marketing and Branding Experience in a senior management position managing marketing/branding Technology Experience with technology, cybersecurity, information systems/data management or privacy Accounting or Financial Oversight Experience to provide valuable insight in overseeing finances Operations Experience with our business, strategy and marketplace dynamics. 
The Company believes that the present composition of the board of director nominees satisfies the guidelines for selecting board candidates set out above; specifically, the nominees include individuals who have a variety of experience and backgrounds, the nominees include a core of business executives having substantial experience in management as well as one member having government experience, and nine of eleven of the nominees are independent under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange.

The board of directors and the nominating and governance committee evaluated each of the director nominees' contributions to the board of directors as well as their role in the operation of the board of directors as a whole. The nominating and governance committee considered both the background and experience of each director nominee as well as the qualifications set forth in the biographies on pages 5 to 10 of this proxy statement. 
Board Diversity and Tenure 
The composition of the nominees for the board also reflects diversity of gender, race and age, an objective that the nominating and governance committee continually strives to enhance when searching for and considering new directors. Based on the composition of the nominees for our board of directors, we believe this objective has been achieved.

Board Leadership Structure 
Chairman of the Board 
Under ManpowerGroup's bylaws and in accordance with the Company's corporate governance guidelines, the board of directors can choose whether the roles of chairman and chief executive officer should be combined or separated, based on what it believes is best for the Company and its shareholders at a given point in time. Jonas Prising has been chairman of the board of directors since December 31, 2015. The board of directors has evaluated the Company's leadership structure and determined that the presence of our independent lead director who, as described below, has meaningful oversight responsibilities, together with a strong leader in the combined role of chairman and chief executive officer, serves the best interests of ManpowerGroup and its shareholders. The board of directors believes that in light of Mr. Prising's extensive knowledge of ManpowerGroup and its industry, gained through his tenure with the Company, he is well positioned to serve as both chairman and chief executive officer of the Company. 
Lead Director 
The board of directors has selected Mr. Downe, retired CEO of BMO Financial Group, to serve as lead director. Our corporate governance guidelines provide that if the same person holds the chief executive officer and chairman roles or if the chairman is not independent, the board of directors will designate one of the independent directors to serve as the lead director. The lead director helps ensure that there is an appropriate balance between management and the independent directors and that the independent directors are fully informed and able to discuss and debate the issues that they deem important. 
Our corporate governance guidelines contemplate that the lead director will be appointed annually and that he or she should be willing to serve for at least three years in such capacity. The board of directors believes having a lead director serving continuous terms provides greater continuity to the role, enhances board leadership and performance and facilitates effective oversight of the performance of senior management. Mr. Downe has served as lead director since May 2017, and at a board meeting in February 2019, the board of directors re-appointed Mr. Downe to serve as lead director for another year. 
The lead director's duties include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Preside at executive sessions of the non-employee directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Preside at all other meetings of directors where the chairman of the board is not present;

Board Effectiveness and Evaluation 
Our board of directors is committed to performing effectively for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders at both the board and committee level. Each year, the nominating and governance committee oversees the board and committee evaluation process and determines the format and framework for the process. 
Annual Evaluation Process 
The purpose of the annual evaluation process is to ensure that the board continues to operate at a high level, with an opportunity for self-reflection and improvement. Historically, we have conducted an internal assessment at the board level and at each of the committees, making use of both externally developed questionnaires and internal discussion materials. The responses to the written questionnaires, and the internal discussion materials, formed the basis for a self-evaluation process conducted by each committee, which was then summarized for the full board. The board followed a similar process, conducted by the board in full, regarding its own effectiveness. 
Independent Consultant 
For 2018, we determined to expand the process. The nominating and governance committee engaged a third-party consultant, experienced in corporate governance matters, to assist with the board and committee evaluation process. Directors were interviewed by the independent third party, and gave specific feedback addressing board effectiveness, individual contributions, committee functioning, and similar topics, as well as suggestions to enhance the efficiency and productivity of the board in general. Directors responded to questions designed to elicit this information, and the independent third party synthesized the results and comments received during such interviews. These findings were then presented by the independent third party and the chair of the nominating and governance committee to the nominating and governance committee and to the board, followed by a review and discussion by the full board. Each committee also conducted a committee assessment discussion. The board believes this facilitated process provided additional insight and perspective that it can utilize to further enhance effectiveness, including in areas such as board and committee composition, information flow between management and the board, development of materials for board discussion, focus on corporate strategy and director recruitment. 
Board Oversight of Risk 
The board of directors is responsible for overseeing management in the execution of management's Company-wide risk management responsibilities. The board of directors fulfills this responsibility both directly and through its standing committees (as discussed further below), each of which assists the board in overseeing a part of the Company's overall risk management. 
The committees of the board oversee specific areas of the Company's risk management as described below: 
Audit Committee 
The audit committee is responsible for assisting the board of directors with its oversight of the performance of the Company's risk management functions including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Periodically reviewing and discussing with management the Company's risk management framework, including policies,  practices and procedures regarding risk assessment and management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Periodically receiving, reviewing and discussing with management reports on selected risk topics as the committee or  management deems appropriate from time to time; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Periodically reporting to the board of directors on its activities in this oversight role.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee 
The executive compensation and human resources committee reviews and discusses with management the Company's compensation policies and practices and management's assessment of whether any risks arising from such policies and practices are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Nominating and Governance Committee 
The nominating and governance committee evaluates the overall effectiveness of the board of directors, including its focus on the most critical issues and risks. 
As part of this oversight, the committees engage in reviews and discussions with management (and others if considered appropriate) as necessary to be reasonably assured that the Company's risk management processes (1) are adequate to identify the material risks that we face in a timely manner, (2) include strategies for the management of risk that are responsive to our risk profile and specific material risk exposure, (3) serve to integrate risk management considerations into business decision-making throughout the Company, and (4) include policies and procedures that are reasonably effective in facilitating the transmission of information with respect to material risks to the senior executives of the Company and each committee. 
Compensation Consultant 
The executive compensation and human resources committee directly retains Mercer (US) Inc. to advise it on executive compensation matters. Mercer reports to the chair of the committee. On an annual basis, the committee and Mercer enter into an engagement letter, which sets out the services to be performed by Mercer for the committee during the ensuing year. Mercer's primary role is to provide objective analysis, advice and information and otherwise to support the committee in the performance of its duties. Mercer's fees for executive compensation consulting to the committee in 2018 were $342,680. 
The committee requests information and recommendations from Mercer as it deems appropriate in order to assist it in structuring and evaluating ManpowerGroup's executive compensation programs and practices. The committee's decisions about executive compensation, including the specific amounts paid to executive officers, are its own and may reflect factors and considerations other than the information and recommendations provided by Mercer. 
Mercer was engaged by the committee to perform the following services in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Evaluate the competitiveness of our total executive compensation and benefits program for the senior executives, including  base salary, annual incentive, total cash compensation, long-term incentive awards, total direct compensation, retirement benefits and total remuneration against the market;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assess how well the compensation and benefits programs are aligned with the committee's stated philosophy to align pay  with performance, including analyzing our performance against comparator companies;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and recommend the companies used in our comparator group and our industry peer group;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide advice and assistance to the committee on the levels of total compensation and the principal elements of  compensation for our senior executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Advise committee on salary, target incentive opportunities and equity grants as well as on the design and features of our  short-term and long-term incentive programs for our senior executives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Brief the committee on trends in executive compensation and benefits among large public companies and on regulatory,  legislative and other developments; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assist in reviewing the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and other executive compensation disclosures to be included in  this proxy statement.  
[END TABLE]
The committee has reviewed whether the work provided by Mercer raises any conflict of interest. Factors considered by the committee include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other services provided to the Company by the consultant;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• What percentage of the consultant's total revenue is made up of fees from the Company;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Policies or procedures of the consultant that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any business or personal relationships between individual consultants involved in the engagement and committee members;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     1. Election of  Directors   
     1. Election of  Directors

[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any shares of the Company's stock owned by individual consultants involved in the engagement; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants  involved in the engagement.  
[END TABLE]
Based on its review, the committee does not believe that Mercer has a conflict of interest with respect to the work performed by the Company or the committee in 2018. The committee has also evaluated the independence of Mercer pursuant to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the New York Stock Exchange and no relationships were identified that would impact Mercer's independence. 
Ultimately, the consultant provides recommendations and advice to the committee in an executive session where management is not present, which is when critical pay decisions are made. This approach protects the committee's ability to receive objective advice from the consultant so that the committee may make independent decisions about executive pay at our company. 
Besides Mercer's involvement with the committee, it and its affiliates also provide other non-executive compensation services to us. These services are approved by management who oversee the specific areas of business for which the services are provided. 
The total amount paid for these other services provided in 2018 was $379,175. These services included actuarial and pension reporting services, workers compensation reporting and insurance services. The majority of these services are provided not by Mercer itself, but by other companies owned by Marsh & McLennan, the parent company of Mercer, which therefore, are considered affiliates even though they operate independently of Mercer. 
The committee concluded that the services provided by the Marsh & McLennan affiliates (other than Mercer), did not raise any conflicts of interest. 
The committee believes the advice it receives from the individual executive compensation consultant is objective and not influenced by Mercer's or its affiliates' other relationships with us because of the procedures Mercer and the committee have in place, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consultant receives no incentive or other compensation based on the fees charged to us for other services provided by  Mercer or any of its affiliates;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consultant is not responsible for selling other Mercer or affiliate services to us;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mercer's professional standards prohibit the individual consultant from considering any other relationships Mercer or  any of its affiliates may have with us in rendering his or her advice and recommendations; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The committee evaluates the quality and objectivity of the services provided by the consultant each year and determines  whether to continue to retain the consultant.

Executive Summary 
2018 Compensation Reflected Challenging Environment in 2018 
Our executive compensation programs are designed to reward performance. Our results are highly dependent on labor market conditions, business cycles and other macroeconomic forces. During 2018 we experienced a softening in the economic environment in which our revenue growth, while still positive, was lower than we have experienced in the past several years. It is our experience that during declines in the economic cycle, or periods of uncertainty, we will see declines in our revenue, or its rate of growth, and this occurred during the second half of 2018. We will also typically experience decreasing profit margins during such periods. 
Our consolidated revenues were up 2.5% in constant currency in 2018 compared to 2017. Our operating leverage and profitability in 2018 reflected a deteriorating economic environment in Europe, where the majority of our business is located. Management's actions to mitigate the impact of reduced revenue growth involved pricing discipline and strong cost management. As a result, we accomplished solid financial performance in 2018 in light of the economic environment. Although our key performance metrics of Earnings Per Share ("EPS") and Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") recorded year-over-year improvements for purposes of our compensation plans, they fell short of the challenging targets that were set by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the "Committee") at the beginning of 2018. Accordingly, our short-term compensation program paid out considerably below targeted levels. For our long-term incentives, our key performance metric of Operating Profit Margin Percent ("OPMP"), which we use in the three-year performance periods in our performance share units, declined in 2018, coming in below the level for the prior two years. This not only reduced the OPMP payout percentage for the three-year performance period that began in 2016 and ended in 2018, but will likewise have an adverse impact on the payout percentage for previously granted performance share unit awards covering 2017-2019 and 2018-2020. 
We Continue to Focus on Three Key Performance Metrics 
We believe these three key performance metrics continue to identify whether we are running our business effectively for our shareholders. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Earnings Per Share. Focuses our NEOs on producing financial results that align with shareholder interest. We  consider this metric a critical measure of executive performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis   
     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Return on Invested Capital. Even though we operate in the services industry, our business is capital intensive.  We must pay our associates and consultants before we typically bill and collect from our clients. ROIC measures how efficiently we are converting our services into cash.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating Profit Margin Percent. Measures how efficiently our NEOs have deployed our operating resources to  generate a profit. We believe using this metric drives a long-term focus on achieving sustainable profits, and it is the cornerstone of our long-term incentive plan.  
[END TABLE]
The results of these three key performance metrics, as reported for 2018, were as follows: 
Earnings Per Share - Diluted ("EPS"), as reported Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") Operating Profit Margin Percent ("OPMP"), as reported 
In addition to these three metrics, the Committee also sets individual operating objectives for each executive officer. 
When it adopted financial targets at the beginning of the 2018 performance year, the Committee determined that certain items should be excluded from our performance metrics to ensure our NEOs are compensated only for the underlying performance of our business: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Constant Currency. We eliminate the impact of changes in exchange rates for EPS and ROIC. This allows us to better  capture year-over-year changes in underlying performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Share Repurchases. We remove the benefit of share repurchases from our EPS calculation except to the extent  necessary to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under our equity plans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restructuring Costs. We exclude restructuring costs from our EPS, ROIC and OPMP calculations, net of the savings  related to these costs. This allows us to better reflect the Company's performance for the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Goodwill Impairment. We exclude goodwill impairment charges from our EPS and ROIC calculations. This, too, better  reflects the Company's performance for the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other Non-Recurring Costs. We exclude from OPMP any non-recurring accrual adjustments greater than $10 million that pertain to prior periods. As explained above, excluding these costs better reflects the Company's performance during the year.   
[END TABLE]
The following table shows the impact of each of these items on our performance metrics for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 EPS    $ 8.56     $ (0.04)    $ (0.19)    $ 0.42     $ 0.02       n/a     $ 8.77

Our Executive Pay is Designed to be Variable and Affordable 
We believe the interests of our shareholders are served when strong operating performance drives enhanced financial performance. Therefore, the pay for our CEO and our other executive officers is closely aligned with our results, and their compensation varies year-over-year based on whether they have achieved collective and individual performance goals set by our Committee. This also reflects our philosophy of affordability — compensation is higher when our executives have delivered financial results that make it more affordable for the Company and lower when financial results underperform and make it less affordable for the Company. 
CEO Compensation Declined in 2018, in Alignment with Pay-For-Performance Principles 
We remain committed to performance-based compensation. Approximately 75% of Mr. Prising's 2018 target compensation was tied to Company performance and 90% of his total pay was variable. Given our below-target financial performance in 2018, Mr. Prising's total compensation in 2018 was 94% of target. (In 2017, when our performance exceeded the Committee's financial targets, his total compensation was 103% of target.) The discussion below highlights each component of Mr. Prising's compensation in 2018. 
Annual Cash Incentive: Payout Was 61% of Target. In light of the financial performance of the Company and the Committee's assessment of Mr. Prising's achievement of his operating objectives as CEO, Mr. Prising's annual cash incentive payout was 61% of target. 
The following table shows the actual cash incentive payout to Mr. Prising for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       2018 Actual Payout $% Compared     to Target

Long-Term Equity Awards: Approximately 60% are Based on Performance. Mr. Prising's 2018 compensation package included three types of long-term equity awards: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approximately 60% were performance share units, again using a three-year performance period, and calibrated to OPMP. In  2018, OPMP for the 2018 performance share unit grant was well-below target, which also has an adverse impact to the performance share units granted in 2017 and 2016. For the 2016 performance share unit grant, Mr. Prising earned 96% of the  target level performance share units for the 3-year performance period of 2016-2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approximately 20% were stock options that vest over a four-year period.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Approximately 20% were restricted stock units that cliff vest in full after three years.  
[END TABLE]
Other Compensation Was Limited. The level of perquisites provided to Mr. Prising is limited. We reimburse him for financial planning expenses, which are capped at $12,000 per year. Mr. Prising's Other Compensation in 2018 also included a Company match and profit-sharing contribution under our Nonqualified Savings Plan, in which Mr. Prising has elected to participate. Mr. Prising does not have a current pension plan, does not participate in the Company's auto program and does not participate in the Company's 401(k) plan for "catch-up" contributions for employees over 50. 
Realizable Pay for Our CEO Declined Significantly in 2018 
We calculated realizable pay for Mr. Prising to show the impact of Company performance and stock price on his compensation granted or awarded during the year. The Company's stock price declined significantly during 2018: from $126.11 on January 1, 2018 to $64.80 as of December 31, 2018. The combination of the stock price decline and the Company's below-target operating performance resulted in Mr. Prising's calculated realizable pay being $6.2 million for 2018. This is substantially lower than $11.4 million of total compensation shown in the Summary Compensation Table using SEC reporting methodology. It also reflects a 56% decrease from his realizable pay for 2017, when strong operating performance and considerable stock price appreciation resulted in realizable pay that was greater than reported compensation. See page 50 for further details. 
Our Business is Impacted by Global Macroeconomic Forces, Business Cycles and Complexity 
We derive approximately 88% of our revenue from outside the United States, with the largest portions coming from our operating segments in Southern Europe (43%), Northern Europe (24%) and Asia Pacific Middle East (13%). Our business is truly global in nature and complexity. Through our global network including approximately 2,600 offices in 80 countries and territories, we serve global, multinational and local clients across multiple industry segments and provide a broad range of workforce solutions including recruitment and assessment, training and development, career management, outsourcing and workforce consulting. 
We Utilize a Broad Group of Comparators for Compensation 
It is difficult to find an industry-specific group of peer companies for benchmarking our executive compensation. We are significantly larger than other U.S.-listed companies in our industry (with $22.0 billion in revenue in 2018, compared to $5.8 billion of our nearest U.S.-listed competitor). Our two largest competitors, Adecco and Randstad, are based in Europe, and although the Committee reviews available compensation data for these two companies, their pay practices are different, and full compensation information is not disclosed. To ensure that we are utilizing meaningful data, the Committee's independent compensation consultant, Mercer, has customized a peer group, which consists of 90 companies within the S&P 500. This peer group has a median revenue that approximates that of ManpowerGroup, with a range of approximately 70% to approximately 180% of our revenue. The peer group is designed to properly benchmark our NEOs' compensation against the relevant talent marketplace. The Committee believes that using this group provides a robust basis for comparing us to companies of similar scale and also represents the universe of top-tier companies we consider when looking for executive talent.

ManpowerGroup Compensation Principles 
Our Committee is guided by a series of principles, listed below. Within the framework of these principles, the Committee considers governance trends, the competitive market, corporate, business unit and individual results, and various individual factors. 
ManpowerGroup's executive compensation guiding principles are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay for results: We tie a significant portion of compensation to the achievement of Company and business  unit goals as well as to recognize individual accomplishments that contribute to success. For example, in 2018, approximately 60% of the CEO's and 56% of the CFO's target compensation, respectively, was tied to short- and long-term  financial performance goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Not pay for failure: We set threshold goals for each performance-based incentive element of our  executive compensation program. The Committee believes these threshold goals are the lowest acceptable levels at which it is appropriate for the NEOs to receive an award. If the threshold level is not met, NEOs do not receive a payout related to  that performance measure. In 2018, our results were between the threshold level and target level for EPS and ROIC under the annual incentive plan as well as for OPMP under the performance share unit grants.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Align with shareholder interests: The Committee sets performance goals and chooses compensation  elements that closely align executives' interests with those of shareholders. For example, performance share

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     units, which make up approximately 45% of target compensation for the CEO and 38% for the CFO, respectively, are tied to operating profit margin, which we believe helps to drive enterprise value.  Stock options and restricted stock units are directly aligned with shareholders' economic interests as the ultimate value the NEOs realize is dependent upon the value of our stock. In addition, a substantial portion of the annual cash incentive  awards paid to our CEO and CFO is based on achievement of EPS and ROIC goals for the year.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Balance cash and equity: We balance the mix of cash and equity compensation to align compensation to  both long- and short-term results of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use internal and external performance reference points: We evaluate the elements of our compensation program  against appropriate comparator company practices as well as other executives within the Company. However, identifying our competitive market is a challenge. See page 37 for further information regarding our competitive market.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recognize the cyclical nature of our business: Our business is highly cyclical, and our financial results are  impacted by global economic cycles, which are difficult to predict. In determining executive compensation, the Committee tries to strike an appropriate balance between fixed and variable pay, and to create meaningful incentives at all points in an  economic cycle.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay competitively: In order for ManpowerGroup to be successful, we need senior executives who have the  capability and experience to operate in a global and complex environment. The Committee believes it must provide pay opportunities to the NEOs that are competitive in order to attract and retain executives of this caliber.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain executives: The Company structures its compensation program for the NEOs so that the  overall target outcome generally falls within the median of the competitive market. The Committee believes this is the appropriate level to provide in order to attract and retain executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assure total compensation is affordable: Our NEOs' compensation is variable year-over-year, which means  compensation is higher when financial objectives are achieved and incremental compensation is more affordable for the Company and compensation is lower when financial results decline and it is less affordable for the Company. In addition, payouts  under the annual cash incentive plan and the performance share units are capped at the outstanding performance levels, which make the maximum cost predictable and ensures affordability.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clearly communicate plans so that they are understood: We clearly communicate to each NEO their specific  goals, targets and objectives to ensure our executives are focused on achieving the financial and operational results that the Committee believes will best promote shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Say on Pay Vote 
ManpowerGroup held a non-binding shareholder advisory vote at its 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders to approve the compensation of ManpowerGroup's NEOs, also known as "Say on Pay." This shareholder resolution was approved by approximately 92% of the votes cast. This was the fifth consecutive year we received a say on pay result above 90%, which we believe demonstrates our shareholders' satisfaction with the alignment of our NEOs' compensation with the Company's performance. In some years, this result has been as high as 98%. Accordingly, we have not made significant changes to the compensation program for 2019 in response to this vote. 
Shareholder Engagement 
We believe that shareholder engagement is an important part of our governance practices. Over the past four years, we have enhanced our shareholder outreach program, to better understand our investors' perspectives on our compensation philosophies and our governance structure, and to answer their questions. These efforts are conducted by members of executive management, and have included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Contacting our top shareholders, representing more than 50% of our shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Meeting with shareholders representing approximately 40% of our shares.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Presenting shareholder feedback to the Committee as well as the nominating and governance committee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis

[END TABLE]
The Committee evaluated this feedback, as well as our say on pay voting results (92% in 2018 and 91% in 2017), among other factors in developing our executive compensation programs as discussed in this CD&A. Similarly, our nominating and governance committee has reviewed the feedback concerning our governance practices in developing our governance policies, including our approach to board refreshment. 
Additionally, our executive management team, primarily through our Chairman and CEO and Executive Vice President and CFO, regularly engage in dialogue with our shareholders through our quarterly earnings calls, investor meetings and conferences, and other channels for communication.

Measures used to determine annual incentive for NEOs in 2018:     The annual  incentives for the NEOs were made under the Annual Incentive Plan (Incentive Plan). The Incentive Plan provides for the payment of annual cash rewards to a participant based on the Companys attainment of one or more performance  metrics and operating objectives established for that participant for the relevant year. The maximum individual limit in any year under the Incentive Plan is $5 million.     The performance metrics used to determine NEOs annual incentive were:     EPS and  ROIC for all NEOs.     Adjusted Operating Unit Profit (AOUP) for Mr. Chandrashekar, who during  2018 had responsibility for an operating unit (i.e. for a geographical region). See page 42 for the definition of AOUP.      The EPS and ROIC levels achieved were between the threshold and target  level.     The AOUP level for Mr. Chandrashekar was at the outstanding level.     Each of the  NEOs received a percentage of their incentive for achieving a specified level of their individual operating objectives.     See page 40 for more  information.

Nonqualified Savings Plan    Similar to a 401(k) plan, however not as flexible in regard to timing of the payouts of the retirement benefits  for nonqualified plans. These benefits are unsecured and subject to risk of forfeiture in bankruptcy.        Used to provide NEOs  with reasonably competitive benefits to those in the competitive market. NEOs are eligible to participate after the first year of employment.      Mr. Prising, Mr. McGinnis, Ms. Swan and Mr. Buchband participated in the NQSP in 2018. 
Career Shares    Used selectively by the Committee, taking into account what is most appropriate for an NEO in view of the  retention incentive provided by the award. Restricted stock units vest completely on a single date several years into the future.        Used as an incentive  in the form of restricted stock units to attract and retain executives. The Committee considers each year whether to make any such grants and to whom.      No grants of career shares were made to the NEOs in 2018.

Our executive compensation program is designed to motivate our NEOs to contribute to the Company's long-term performance and success. As such, the following pay components include pay for results features: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual Incentive Award: Performance goal ranges for our cash-based annual incentive award were established for  Messrs. Prising, McGinnis, Buchband and Green and Ms. Swan for the performance metrics EPS and ROIC. For Mr. Chandrashekar, performance ranges were established for EPS, ROIC and AOUP, since his responsibilities included an operating unit  for 2018. Award opportunities are established for achievement at threshold, target and outstanding levels. Payouts are generally based on actual performance on these metrics as well as the individual operating objectives for each NEO.

• Performance Share Units: Approximately 60% of the NEOs' long-term awards for 2018 were made in the form of  performance share units. As stated earlier, the NEOs receive a certain number of shares of stock at the end of a specified period based on achievement measured against pre-established performance goals for  that period, typically operating profit margin percent. For 2018, the Committee again used a three-year performance period (2018-2020) for performance share unit awards. Award opportunities are established for achievement at threshold, target and  outstanding levels. The Committee believes using operating profit margin percent is appropriate because it is a driver of shareholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options: Approximately 20% of the NEOs' long-term awards are made in the form of stock options. The  Committee believes stock options provide an important overall longer term incentive for the NEOs. Because stock options are granted at a specific value on the date of grant, the ultimate compensation realized will depend on the stock price at the  time of exercise.  
[END TABLE]
Target Total Compensation 
Target total compensation is the value of the compensation package that is intended to be delivered based on performance against pre-established goals. The following chart illustrates for each of the NEOs the composition of his or her target total compensation for 2018 among the various compensation elements: 
2018 Target Compensation Components 
The Committee's compensation consultant, Mercer, provides the Committee with market data that is used in setting target levels for compensation for the NEOs. Actual compensation paid out to the NEOs in a given year may vary significantly from the target levels depending on the actual performance achieved under the pre-established financial and operating goals set by the Committee. The target compensation is detailed for each NEO in the following table.

One reason we utilize the customized set of comparison companies is that it is difficult to find an industry-specific group of peer companies. Our two largest competitors, Adecco and Randstad, are based in Europe, and although we review available compensation data for these two companies, their pay practices are different and full compensation data is not disclosed. Our nearest U.S. public competitor had revenue of approximately $5.8 billion in 2018 compared to our revenue of $22.0 billion and the other U.S. public competitors are even smaller. Mercer has confirmed to the Committee that attempting to use such competitors would not produce meaningful data. 
The Committee also utilizes data from U.S. compensation surveys published by Mercer and other third-party data providers that are recommended by Mercer as a means to evaluate compensation for certain NEO positions. For the CEO, CFO and COO, their positions were only compared to companies within the subset group of the S&P 500. For NEOs with responsibility for leading a business unit, such as Mr. Chandrashekar, his position was compared to top division executives within the subset group of the S&P 500 Data and secondarily compared with U.S. compensation survey data of executives in similar sized groups and divisions. Compensation for global functional leaders was compared against U.S. compensation survey data recommended by Mercer for executives with similar roles and responsibilities. For Ms. Swan, her position was compared to human resource management executives of companies within the subset group of the S&P 500 and secondarily compared with U.S. compensation survey data of human resource management executives. For Mr. Buchband, his position was only compared with U.S. compensation survey data of legal executives. Both Ms. Swan and Mr. Buchband's market data were adjusted to reflect the scope of their responsibilities. For executives whose positions were located outside of the U.S., ManpowerGroup also took into account international (regional and local) compensation survey data in an effort to set compensation that is not only equitable among the members of a global team, but also competitive within the global markets where ManpowerGroup competes for talent.

  (1)  For Mr. Prising, Mr. McGinnis and Mr. Green, the primary data source was the peer group subset of the  S&P 500. For Mr. Chandrashekar and Ms. Swan, the primary data source was a composite of the peer group subset of the S&P 500 and published surveys. For Mr. Buchband, the primary data source was published surveys.   
[END TABLE]
It was observed that Mr. Prising's and Mr. McGinnis's target compensation for 2017 fell below the median total direct compensation when benchmarked against survey data for CEOs and CFOs, respectively. The Committee determined that in light of this, adjustments to both Mr. Prising's and Mr. McGinnis's total direct compensation would be appropriate. Mr. Prising received an increase in equity while Mr. McGinnis received an increase in both base salary and equity in 2018. For all other NEOs, the Committee determined their target compensation was within a suitable range of the median. 
Assessing Individual Factors 
An individual NEO's total compensation or any element of compensation may be adjusted upwards or downwards relative to the competitive market based on a subjective consideration of the NEO's experience, potential, tenure and results (individual and relevant organizational results), internal equity (which means that comparably positioned executives within ManpowerGroup should have comparable award opportunities), the NEO's historical compensation, and any retention concerns. The Committee uses a historical compensation report to review the compensation and benefits provided to each NEO in connection with its compensation decisions concerning that NEO. 
The Committee's Decision-Making Process 
The Committee determines the CEO compensation levels, including base salary, establishing and determining the achievement of the financial goals and operating objectives for the annual cash incentives, and any equity-based compensation awards. Generally, the CEO establishes and determines the achievement of the goals and objectives for the annual incentives for the other NEOs, with the Committee making the final determinations. Similarly, the CEO generally recommends to the Committee any salary adjustments, cash incentive awards or equity-based awards for the other NEOs, which are then evaluated and determined by the Committee. Mercer also provided input to the Committee regarding the final 2018 compensation for all of the NEOs. This input reflected the Company's performance results for 2018, external market references against the peer group, internal compensation references and the individual performance of each of the NEOs. Under the Committee's charter, compensation for our CEO, CFO and President (who was our COO) is subject to ratification by the board of directors. Accordingly, the board of directors ratified the determinations for Mr. Prising, Mr. McGinnis and Mr. Green, who were our executives at this level.

Annual Incentive Plan 
In February 2018, the annual incentive awards for our NEOs were granted under the ManpowerGroup Inc. Annual Incentive Plan (the "Incentive Plan"). The Incentive Plan provides for the payment of annual cash awards to a participant based on the Company's attainment of one or more financial goals and operating objectives established for that participant for the relevant year. Under the Incentive Plan, the participant is assigned award opportunities for threshold, target, and outstanding performance upon the attainment of the financial goal or goals established for the participant, as determined by the Committee at the beginning of the year. Depending upon the actual performance of ManpowerGroup for the year as measured against these financial goals, and the assessment of the participant's performance in achieving the operating objectives, the participant would be paid a cash award following the close of the year. The maximum award that a participant may receive for any year under the Incentive Plan is $5 million. 
Setting Annual Incentive Goals and Equity Awards for Mr. Prising 
The annual financial goals for the CEO under the Incentive Plan are based on EPS and ROIC for the year. The process begins with collaboration among Mercer, the CFO and the Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Talent. The full Committee then reviews and determines the goals and range of award opportunities for achievement of the goals, including the weighting of each goal for the CEO, subject to ratification by the board of directors. In determining these goals, the Committee considers financial information including historical and projected earnings growth, the prior year financial results and the Company's expected financial performance for the current year, consulting with management, including financial personnel, and Mercer. 
Setting the operating objectives for the CEO begins with the CEO recommending to the Committee the objectives for himself for the year. The Committee reviews and ultimately approves these operating objectives, subject to any adjustments, in the context of ManpowerGroup's strategic and financial plans. 
At each Committee meeting during the year, the Committee reviews the progress the CEO is making towards the achievement of his financial goals and operating objectives for the year. After the close of each year, the Committee reviews and approves, subject to ratification by the board of directors, an award amount for the annual cash incentive based on whether the annual financial goals have been achieved and based on the CEO's performance towards each of his annual operating objectives. 
The Committee will generally determine and approve equity awards to the CEO and the related vesting schedules, at its regularly scheduled meeting in February each year, subject to ratification by the board of directors. The grant date for the awards is the date the Committee approves the awards. The exercise price for any options granted is the closing price on the date of grant. 
As part of the decision-making process for the CEO's compensation matters, any decisions of the Committee or ratifications by the board of directors regarding the CEO's compensation, are done in executive session without any management present. 
Setting Annual Incentive Goals and Equity Awards for Messrs. McGinnis, Chandrashekar, Buchband, Green, and Ms. Swan 
The process for setting the annual financial goals for the other NEOs also begins with collaboration among Mercer, the CFO and the Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Talent selecting the objective financial metrics and establishing proposed goals for those selected metrics for each of the NEOs. The recommended financial metrics and proposed goals are then reviewed and approved by the CEO. The EPS and ROIC metric are used for each NEO, with the same goals as those used for the CEO. The CFO and the Executive Vice President, Global Strategy and Talent recommend the proposed goals and award opportunities for Mr. Chandrashekar's other objective financial metric, AOUP, which is then reviewed and approved by the CEO. The Committee reviews these recommended financial goals, makes any adjustments it deems appropriate and then approves the financial goals and range of award opportunities, including the weighting of each goal. 
For 2018, Mr. Prising approved the operating objectives for Messrs. McGinnis, Chandrashekar, Buchband and Green and Ms. Swan, which were reviewed by the Committee.

[END TABLE]
After the close of each year, the Committee reviews and approves an award amount for the annual incentive to each NEO based on achievement of the NEO's annual objective financial goals under the Incentive Plan. The CEO determines the amount of any award to each of the NEOs for performance towards each of their annual operating objectives. The CEO presents the recommended award for each NEO to the Committee for its review and approval, subject to ratification by the board of directors for Messrs. McGinnis and Green. For Mr. Green, the Committee approved an incentive for 2018, based on actual results for the year but prorated through the date of his retirement as COO. 
The Committee generally determines and approves equity awards to the other NEOs, including vesting schedules, at its regularly scheduled meeting in February each year, and as required under the Committee's charter, subject to ratification by the board of directors in the case of the CFO and President. These are generally based on recommendations by the CEO (although not with regard to himself). The Committee may make grants to NEOs at other times during the year, as it deems appropriate. The grant date for the awards is the date the Committee approves the awards. The exercise price for any options granted is the closing price on the date of grant. 
Components of the 2018 Executive Compensation Program—Base Salary 
Base salaries for NEOs are set near the median of base salaries paid in the relevant competitive market, for the particular position, subject to individual performance factors as described earlier. For 2018, the Committee increased the base salary for Mr. McGinnis to $700,000. None of the other NEOs received an increase in base salary. 
Base salary levels affect the value of the annual incentive awarded to the NEOs because the incentive award is awarded as a percentage of base salary. A higher base salary will result in a higher annual incentive, assuming the same level of achievement against goals. The level of severance benefit each NEO may receive is also increased if his or her salary is increased. The value of long-term incentive awards is not determined as a multiple of base salary. 
Components of the 2018 Executive Compensation Program—Annual Cash Incentives 
As explained previously, all of the NEOs participate in the Incentive Plan, which provides for annual incentive compensation awards that are tied to ManpowerGroup's financial results. The Incentive Plan provides for the payment of annual cash rewards to a participant based on the Company's attainment of one or more financial goals and operating objectives established for that participant for the relevant year. The incentive amounts are based on achievement of pre-established goals using these metrics. The Incentive Plan provides for a variety of financial goals that are used in determination of the amount of any annual incentives earned by the NEOs. The financial goals include EPS, ROIC and AOUP, as well as other metrics. The operating objectives are typically tied to broad strategic or operational initiatives. 
How the Committee Sets Underlying Goals for EPS and ROIC 
As noted above, the annual cash incentives for NEOs are based on two objective factors — EPS and ROIC — plus regional operating unit performance, where applicable, and individual performance objectives. For EPS and ROIC, the Committee sets target outcomes at a number that reflects an annual growth target. For 2018, when setting the targets, the Committee established the targets of EPS and ROIC excluding anticipated restructuring charges. As mentioned earlier, the Committee has also determined to exclude the impact of currency when calculating EPS and ROIC to ensure that payments under our annual incentives reflect the underlying performance of our business. The Committee has also determined to exclude the benefit of current year share repurchases in excess of dilution when calculating EPS. The calculation of EPS and ROIC are as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• EPS — net earnings per share — diluted, including net earnings from continuing and discontinued  operations, but excluding the impact of currency, restructuring charges net of related savings, any cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles, extraordinary items or goodwill impairment or the benefit of current year share repurchases  in excess of dilution.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ROIC — consolidated net operating profit after taxes divided by average capital. Net operating profit equals  earnings before income taxes plus net interest expense and goodwill impairment (including the results of continuing and discontinued operations) minus taxes, excluding the impact of currency and restructuring charges net of related savings. Average  capital is the average monthly ending balance of capital employed plus or minus adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
The EPS target is generally based on the Company's targeted long-term growth rate for EPS, but may be adjusted year-by-year based on economic conditions and the Company's expected financial performance for the year. From that target, the Committee then sets levels for threshold and outstanding performance. The threshold EPS growth rate reflects a level of performance that is below target but still appropriate for a partial award to be earned. Conversely, the outstanding EPS growth rate reflects a level of performance appropriate for the maximum incentive to be earned. So the comparisons are valid between the two years, the growth rates are based on growth over results of the previous year excluding non-recurring items. 
The ROIC target is then determined based on the earnings growth reflected by the EPS target as well as consideration by the Committee of factors relating to the Company's level of capital. The other financial performance metrics under the plan used to determine the annual incentives earned by the other NEOs are determined in a similar way, taking into consideration the economic conditions and expected financial performance of each individual region, where applicable, as well as the overall EPS and ROIC targets. This methodology is not the same as the Company's financial budgeting or business outlook for the year. As a result, target performance for purposes of achieving an incentive award will not be the same as performance at the budgeted financial plan, which may be higher or lower than target performance depending on economic conditions and trends at the time. 
Why the Company Uses EPS and ROIC 
The Committee believes using EPS as a performance goal keeps the NEOs focused on producing financial results that align with shareholder interests. In that regard, ManpowerGroup is in a cyclical business, which is influenced by economic and labor market cycles that are outside of ManpowerGroup's control, and it is important that the senior executives manage short-term results closely to be able to adjust strategy and execution in quick response to external cycle changes. The Company uses ROIC as a performance goal for the NEOs because it measures how effectively our senior management is converting our services into cash. Although we are a provider of services, and not a manufacturer of products, our business is still highly capital intensive. Our requirement for capital arises from the timing characteristics of our business. We typically pay our associates and consultants before we can bill and collect from our clients. 
Using an ROIC metric incentivizes our executives to carefully manage our accounts receivable and other capital investments in order to maximize the return on capital deployed. Our goal is to continuously improve our internal capital employed each year resulting in stable to improving ROIC. For 2018, the Committee continued its practice of setting threshold, target and outstanding goals for EPS and ROIC that were based on its view of appropriate rates of EPS growth compared to prior year achievement. In setting these levels for 2018, the Committee assumed continuing improvement in global economic conditions. Correspondingly, the EPS and ROIC targets for outstanding performance represent what the Committee believed was an appropriate growth rate for outstanding performance. The Committee believed the threshold levels for EPS and ROIC were the minimum levels at which it would be appropriate to earn an incentive, based on global economic conditions as they existed at the time when the goals were set. 
The following table shows the EPS and ROIC goals established by the Committee for 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

   EPS           $      8.48                $      9.20                $      9.91

The Committee Also Uses AOUP for Certain NEOs 
Where an individual executive has specific responsibility for a geographic operating unit, the Committee also uses AOUP as a financial performance metric, to drive profitability in the executive's business unit, while factoring in the cost of carrying accounts receivable. The calculation of AOUP is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• AOUP — Operating unit profit less a cost of net capital.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Operating unit profit is equal to revenues less direct costs and branch and national headquarters operating costs  translated into U.S. Dollars in constant currency. It includes the results of continuing and discontinued operations and excludes items consistent with the adjustments to EPS.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Cost of net capital is average net capital multiplied by 12%. Average net capital equals average trade accounts receivable  less allowance for doubtful accounts and other miscellaneous adjustments, calculated based on the average of the monthly ending balances, translated into U.S. Dollars using the same monthly exchange rates as used for operating unit profit.   
[END TABLE]
In 2018, Mr. Chandrashekar was the only NEO with AOUP used as a performance metric for his annual incentive goals.

Components of the 2018 Executive Compensation Program—Long-Term Incentives 
Each year the Committee determines the appropriate mix of performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units that should comprise the long-term incentives for the NEOs. This flexibility allows the Committee to tailor its program to create the incentive structure that it believes will best align executive performance and the needs of the Company. The Committee determined for 2018 that the performance needs of the Company would be best met through a package of awards for the NEOs made up of 60% performance share units, 20% stock options and 20% restricted stock units. We believe this will further align the NEOs' interests with long-term shareholder value, particularly as 60% of the awards vest based on the achievement of performance criteria. 
The performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units awarded in 2018 have the characteristics below. The specific long-term incentive grants for each officer are shown in the Grants of Plan Based Awards table on page 56. 
Performance Share Units 
For the performance share units granted in 2018, vesting will be based on achievement of a pre-established goal for average annual operating profit margin percent, over a three-year period ending December 31, 2020. The Committee believes operating profit margin percent correctly focuses executive officers on the long-term profitability of the Company. Following completion of the 2018-2020 performance period, the Committee will compare operating profit margin percent performance against target levels. The number of shares earned will vest and be settled in common stock in February 2021, after the Committee determines the achievement of the performance goals. 
Why the Company Uses Annual Operating Profit Margin and How it Sets Goals 
The following table shows the goals established by the Committee for the 2018-2020 performance period for these performance share units and the associated payout percentage: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Average Operating Profit Margin Percent  2018-2020                  3.10%                 4.10%                 4.50%

   Payout Percentage                  50%                 100%                 200%    
   Payout Percentage                  50%                 100%                 200%    
[END TABLE]
To determine the average operating profit margin percent at the end of the three-year period, the actual performance results from each year will be averaged to determine the three-year average performance results. The final award will be determined by using the 3-year payout scale relative to the 3-year average performance. 
When determining the financial goals for 2018, the Committee determined that for the 2018 financial year, restructuring charges would be excluded from the operating profit margin percent calculation. This increased the operating profit margin percent for 2018 by 0.19% to 3.81%. The Committee also determined, for the 2018 financial year, operating profit margin would exclude any non-recurring accrual adjustments greater than $10 million that pertain to prior periods. This exclusion decreased OPMP by 0.07% to 3.74%. 
Under new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2018, we started to record certain pension costs in interest and other expense, moving them out of operating income, beginning with our 2018 fiscal year. This resulted in an increase to our OPMP. Following the principle under our equity plan that OPMP should be adjusted to reverse the impact of any change in accounting principles, the fiscal year 2018 OPMP calculation as it relates to performance share unit grants made in 2016 and 2017 was further reduced by 0.01%. Accordingly, for the 3-year performance periods of 2016-2018 and 2017-2019, the OPMP achieved for 2018 is calculated as 3.73% instead of 3.74%. This accounting change was contemplated in the targets set by the Committee at the beginning of 2018, and therefore no adjustment is made for purposes of the performance period beginning in 2018. 
An operating profit "gate" was also established for the performance share units to ensure operating profit margins are achieved without significantly decreasing revenues. This gate was set at $780 million, meaning participants cannot receive more than 100% of the target level payout unless average operating profit for the 2018-2020 performance period exceeds $780.0 million.

Shares Earned for the 2016-2018 Performance Period 
Based on the Company's average operating margin percent for the 3-year performance period of 2016-2018, the Committee determined the 2016 performance share unit awards vested at 96% of the target level. The operating profit dollar gate for these awards was also reached. These shares vested and were settled in common stock in February 2019, after the Committee determined the achievement of the performance goals. The number of shares earned for each of the NEOs is as follows:

[END TABLE]
Changes for 2019 
The Committee determined to modify the terms of the performance share units granted to the NEOs in 2019. In addition to the three-year operating profit margin goal and operating profit "gate," the Committee will add a modifier to the final performance share unit payout that can increase or decrease the final payout by up to 30%. This modifier will be based on an evaluation of pre-established strategic growth objectives over the performance period. At the end of the 3-year performance period, the Committee will first determine the initial payout of the performance share units based on the average operating margin percent for the 3-year performance period and the gate. The Committee will then assess the achievement (or non-achievement) of the strategic growth objectives over the 3-year period and modify the final payout of the performance share units based on their assessment. The modifier will not decrease the payout below the threshold payout nor increase the payout above the outstanding payout. 
Stock Options 
The Committee uses stock options to align the interests of the NEOs with long-term shareholder value. Consistent with past years, these will vest ratably over a four-year period. 
Restricted Stock Units 
As stated earlier, the Committee chose to include restricted stock units because they align the interests of the NEOs with long-term shareholder value and add balance to the compensation program as they provide both upside potential and downside risk. In addition, restricted stock units provide a retention incentive to the NEOs as they are only payable in stock if the NEO remains with the Company through the vesting date. The restricted stock units have a three-year cliff vest. 
Career Shares, Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans 
Career Shares 
The Committee selectively grants restricted stock units in order to provide a retention incentive. These career shares vest completely on a single date several years into the future. The Committee considers each year whether to make any such grants. None of the NEOs received a career share grant in 2018. 
Retirement and Deferred Compensation Plans 
ManpowerGroup maintains tax-qualified 401(k) plans for its U.S. employees. For compliance reasons, once an executive is deemed to be "highly compensated" within the meaning of Section 414(q) of the Internal Revenue 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis   
     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis   
     Compensation Discussion and  Analysis   
[END TABLE]
 Code, the executive is no longer eligible to participate in ManpowerGroup's 401(k) plans except for "catch-up" contributions for employees over 50. ManpowerGroup maintains a separate non-qualified savings plan for "highly compensated" employees, including eligible executives. The non-qualified plan provides similar benefits to the tax-qualified 401(k) plans, including a Company match and enhanced matching contribution. However, the nonqualified savings plan is a poor substitute because of the inflexibility as to the timing of the payouts and taxability of the retirement benefits relative to a qualified plan. Furthermore, the plan benefits are unsecured and subject to risk of forfeiture in bankruptcy. The Committee maintains this program in an effort to provide NEOs with reasonably competitive benefits to those in the competitive market. 
As required under applicable law, we contribute to the Central Provident Fund of Singapore on behalf of Mr. Chandrashekar. The Central Provident Fund is a nondiscriminatory, tax qualified savings plan operated and managed by the government of Singapore, to which the employers of Singapore-based employees are required to contribute. All employees of our Singapore branch participate in the Central Provident Fund. 
Other Benefits 
The NEOs are provided health and dental coverage, company-paid term life insurance, disability insurance, paid time off, and paid holiday programs applicable to other employees in their locality. These rewards are designed to be competitive with overall market practices, while keeping them at a reasonable level. 
ManpowerGroup reimburses NEOs for financial planning assistance. This benefit is provided to ensure that executives prepare adequately for retirement, file their taxes and conduct all stock transactions appropriately. In addition, for several of our NEOs, the company pays dues at a club in Milwaukee that is used for business entertainment. Any personal use of the club would be covered by the executive; however none of the NEOs used this club for personal use in 2018. ManpowerGroup also reimburses the NEOs for annual physicals. 
ManpowerGroup also maintains a broad-based auto program that covers approximately 300 management employees in the U.S., including the U.S. based NEOs, except Mr. Prising who no longer participates in the program. Pursuant to this program, ManpowerGroup pays 75% of the cost of a leased car for NEOs based in the U.S. who participate in the program. Consistent with local practice in Singapore, where Mr. Chandrashekar is based, ManpowerGroup provided him with a car in 2018. 
Except in connection with expatriate assignments, as discussed below, ManpowerGroup does not pay tax gross ups on taxable benefits for its NEOs. 
Consulting Agreement with Mr. Green 
As previously stated, Mr. Green retired from his position as COO on August 31, 2018 and from the Company on October 1, 2018. Effective October 1, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Green to provide various consulting services to the Company, including services related to our joint venture in China. This agreement can be terminated at any time. 
We Provide Limited Expatriate Benefits 
In connection with Mr. Chandrashekar's role as Executive Vice President, Operational Excellence and IT, and President, Asia Pacific Middle East, Mr. Chandrashekar receives tax equalization payments related to any compensation earned for the time required to be spent in the United States as part of his role. He also receives certain other benefits, including a car and return visit expenses and payment of his tax preparation expenses. 
Severance Agreements 
ManpowerGroup has entered into severance agreements (which include change of control benefits) with each of the NEOs. These severance agreements are more fully described on pages 66-68. The Committee believes that severance and change of control policies are necessary to attract and retain senior talent in a competitive market. The Committee also believes that these agreements benefit ManpowerGroup because they clarify the NEOs' terms of employment and protect ManpowerGroup's business during an acquisition. Furthermore, the Committee 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
   Compensation Discussion and  Analysis     
[END TABLE]
 believes that change of control benefits, if structured appropriately, allow the NEOs to focus on their duties and responsibilities during an acquisition. 
The agreements do not provide for any tax gross up payments and require a double trigger in order for our NEOs to receive benefits following a change in control. 
Governance Features of our Executive Compensation Programs 
We Have Stock Ownership Guidelines for Executive Officers 
The Committee believes that NEOs should hold a meaningful stake in ManpowerGroup to align their economic interests with those of other shareholders. To that end, the Committee adopted stock ownership guidelines that currently require each executive to own a target number of shares based on a salary multiple, dependent on the NEO's position. Under the guidelines, the Committee takes into account actual shares owned by the executive, unvested restricted stock units, and unvested performance share units calculated at the threshold level. The Committee does not consider any stock options or performance share units above the threshold level held by the NEOs. Additionally, to enforce our stock ownership policies, we limit the ability of an executive officer to sell equity until he or she is in compliance with the guidelines. An executive who has not yet met, or who falls below, the stock ownership guidelines, is required to hold 50% of the shares received from the exercise of stock options or the vesting of restricted stock units or performance share units until the ownership guidelines have been satisfied. The following table shows the status as of December 31, 2018 of each of the NEOs guidelines:

Realizable Pay in 2018 
We also calculate realizable pay for Mr. Prising. This is a measure of the value of compensation granted or awarded during the reporting year. It shows the impact of Company performance and stock price on potential pay values for Mr. Prising, and provides an alternative means to the Summary Compensation Table on page 54 to evaluate the alignment between pay and performance. 
In particular, our calculation of realizable pay does not value equity awards using the accounting grant date fair value metric, as required in the Summary Compensation Table under Topic 718. Instead, for realizable pay we measure equity awards at their period-end value, in this case using the year-end stock price on December 31, 2018 of $64.80. 
For realizable pay our method of calculating equity award values is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Stock Options. We use the "intrinsic value" of the stock options granted to Mr. Prising in February  2018, meaning the spread between the grant price and the price of the underlying stock at year end.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Units. We use the year-end value of the restricted stock  units awarded to Mr. Prising in February 2018 and value these shares using the year-end stock price on December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Performance Share Units. We calculate performance share units using the target performance shares granted in 2018  and value these shares using the year-end stock price on December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
Our realizable pay calculation reflects the significant equity component of Mr. Prising's total compensation and illustrates how the value of Mr. Prising's 2018 compensation is sensitive to movements in our stock price. The Company's stock price declined significantly during 2018: from $126.11 on January 1, 2018 to $64.80 as of December 31, 2018. In addition, the December 31, 2018 stock price was lower than the fair market value used to value the equity grants of $122.87 as of February 15, 2018 (the closing stock price on the date of grant). The combination of the stock price decline during the year, and the Company's below-target operating performance resulted in Mr. Prising's calculated realizable pay being $6.2 million for 2018. This is substantially lower than $11.4 million of total compensation shown in the Summary Compensation Table using SEC reporting methodology. It also reflects a 56% decrease from his realizable pay for 2017, when strong operating performance and considerable stock price appreciation resulted in realizable pay that was greater than reported compensation. 
The table below shows realizable pay for Mr. Prising in 2018 as compared to his compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54.

(1)  Because the stock price of $64.80 as of December 31, 2018 was less than the stock price on February 15, 2018  (the date of grant) of $122.87, there is no intrinsic value of the stock options.

Other Material Tax Implications of the Executive Compensation Program 
Tax Implications for ManpowerGroup 
For tax years occurring prior to 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally disallowed a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation over $1,000,000 paid in any tax year to any "covered employee." Prior to 2018, covered employees included the corporation's CEO and each of its three most highly compensated NEOs (other than the CEO and CFO) in service as of the end of any such tax year. However, Section 162(m) also provided that qualifying performance-based compensation would not be subject to the deduction limit if certain requirements were met. Accordingly, for tax years prior to 2018, the Committee generally sought to structure compensation amounts and plans to meet the requirements for deductibility under that provision where it thought such structures were appropriate. However, the Committee had the ability to implement compensation arrangements that did not satisfy these requirements for deductibility if it determined that such arrangements were appropriate under the circumstances. 
Pursuant to tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017 ("Tax Reform"), the exception to the $1,000,000 annual limitation for qualifying performance-based compensation was repealed for tax years starting in 2018, subject to limited transition relief for certain grandfathered arrangements that were in effect on November 2, 2017. In addition, Tax Reform amended the definition of covered employees so that the compensation of our CEO, CFO, and our three most highly compensated NEOs (other than the CEO and CFO and regardless of whether they serve at the end of the tax year) for any tax year would be subject to Section 162(m)'s deduction limitation. Further, for each NEO whose compensation was or is subject to this limitation in 2017 or any later tax year, that officer's compensation will remain subject to this annual deductibility limitation for any future tax year in which he or she receives compensation from ManpowerGroup, regardless of whether he or she remains a NEO. 
Accordingly, starting in 2018, ManpowerGroup is only able to deduct up to $1,000,000 per year of the compensation payable to any of our NEOs who is a "covered employee" as determined under Tax Reform, except to the extent that transition relief would apply to a payment. 
Tax Implications for NEOs 
The Committee generally seeks to structure compensation amounts and arrangements so that they do not result in penalties for the NEOs under the Internal Revenue Code. For example, Section 409A imposes substantial penalties and results in the loss of any tax deferral for nonqualified deferred compensation that does not meet the requirements of that section. The Committee has structured the elements of ManpowerGroup's compensation program so that they are either not characterized as nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A or meet the distribution, timing and other requirements of Section 409A. Without these steps, certain elements of compensation could result in substantial tax liability for the NEOs. Section 280G and related provisions impose substantial excise taxes on so-called "excess parachute payments" payable to certain executives upon a change of control and results in the loss of the compensation deduction for such payments by the executive's employer. The severance agreements with the NEOs limit the amount of the severance payment in the event that the severance payment will be subject to excise taxes imposed under Section 280G, but only where the after-tax amount received by the NEO would be greater than the after-tax amount without regard to such limitation.

Compensation Policies and Practices as They Relate to Risk Management 
Members of the Company's senior management team have considered and discussed the Company's compensation policies and practices and specifically whether these policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ManpowerGroup. Management has also discussed this issue with the executive compensation and human resources committee and has determined there are no risks arising from our compensation policies and practices that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ManpowerGroup. 
As ManpowerGroup operates in various countries around the world, we have several incentive plans. Our plans use various financial performance growth metrics, generally relating to profitability. As a result, there is no common incentive driving behavior. We also have controls in place that mitigate any impact these plans might have on us as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In general, each of our incentive plans has a threshold, target and outstanding payout level, which is not material to the  Company, that is earned based on the results of the financial metrics.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The annual incentive and performance share unit awards are capped at a maximum level such that employees cannot receive a  bonus that is significant enough to create a significant risk to the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have multiple financial metrics under the annual incentive which focus on company-wide and segment-wide goals and  objectives, and the results of those metrics are reviewed and approved at multiple levels in the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• There is an approval process of the various incentive plans in each country, which are approved by the general manager and  financial manager in the respective country to ensure the growth metrics are based on that respective country's performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Each of the NEOs is subject to stock ownership guidelines.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We have adopted a clawback policy.

[BEGIN TABLE]
• We do not permit executives to engage in short-selling of ManpowerGroup securities or trading in puts and calls on  ManpowerGroup securities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We do not permit our NEOs to pledge shares of our common stock.  
[END TABLE]
Based on the above factors, we do not believe our compensation policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ManpowerGroup.

Compensation Agreements and Arrangements 
Mr. Prising, Mr. McGinnis, Mr. Chandrashekar, Mr. Buchband, and Ms. Swan currently receive an annual incentive bonus determined pursuant to an incentive arrangement with ManpowerGroup and all have entered into severance agreements with ManpowerGroup. The annual incentive bonus arrangements are described in further detail in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis included in this proxy statement and the severance agreements for each executive officer are described in further detail in the section entitled "Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements" following the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
In connection with his assignment in Singapore as Executive Vice President, Operational Excellence and IT, and President, Asia Pacific Middle East, Mr. Chandrashekar also receives certain benefits. These include a car, return visit expenses to India for his family, a visit to the United States for his family, tax equalization payments related to any compensation earned by him for the time required to be spent in the United States as part of his role and payment of tax preparation expenses. 
Prior to his retirement in October 2018, Mr. Green had a severance agreement with ManpowerGroup. The severance agreement was similar to the agreement with Messrs. Chandrashekar, Mr. Buchband and Ms. Swan. The severance agreement expired upon Mr. Green's retirement and no amounts were due to him under the severance agreement as a result of his retirement. Mr. Green is bound by the terms of the non-competition provisions in the severance agreement for a period of one-year following his retirement. 
After Mr. Green's retirement, effective October 2, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Mr. Green to provide various consulting services to the Company, including services related to our joint venture in China.

2018 Annual Incentive Award Calculations 
The following tables illustrate the achievement of the performance targets in relation to the payment of the 2018 Annual Incentive Awards. The awards are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table on page 54 under the heading "Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation." 
For 2018, ManpowerGroup's EPS, as reported, was $8.56 and ROIC was 15.4%. 
When it adopted financial targets for the 2018 performance year, the Committee determined that certain items should be excluded from our performance metrics to ensure our NEOs are compensated only for the underlying performance of our business. For 2018, the Committee's calculation of EPS for Mr. Prising and the other NEOs excluded the changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which resulted in an EPS of $8.52, as well as the impact of share repurchase activity during the year (except to the extent necessary to offset dilution resulting from shares issued under equity plans), which further adjusted EPS downward to $8.33. The Committee additionally adjusted EPS upward by $0.42 to exclude restructuring costs, net of the savings related to these costs. The Committee also determined to exclude any goodwill impairment charges taken in 2018, which also increased EPS by $0.02. These adjustments resulted in the Committee utilizing an EPS figure of $8.77 in calculating annual incentive compensation for 2018. This compared to EPS goals of $8.48 at threshold, $9.20 at target and $9.91 at outstanding. 
The ROIC calculation in 2018 excluded the impact of currency, which resulted in ROIC of 15.3%. Similar to EPS, the Committee adjusted ROIC upward by 0.7% to exclude restructuring costs, net of the savings related to these charges. The Committee also determined to exclude goodwill impairment charges from the ROIC calculations for 2018 but the charge incurred in 2018 did not have a significant impact to ROIC. These adjustments resulted in the Committee utilizing an ROIC figure of 16.0% in calculating annual incentive compensation for 2018. This compared to ROIC goals of 15.6% at threshold, 17.0% at target and 18.6% at outstanding.

Grants Under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan 
Stock options. ManpowerGroup made grants of stock options to all of the executive officers under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in February 2018. The stock options granted in 2018 vest 25% per year over a four-year period and if they are not exercised, they expire in ten years (or earlier following a termination of employment). Additional vesting terms applicable to these options are described in further detail in the section entitled "Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements" following the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
PSUs. ManpowerGroup made grants of PSUs to all of the executive officers under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in February of 2018. Each executive officer received a performance share unit grant that will vest if the relevant performance goal of average Operating Profit Margin Percentage is met for the three-year performance period. See page 46 for a description of the goals established by the Committee for the 2018 performance share unit grant. 
No dividends are paid on the PSUs unless and until actual shares are issued to the executive officer upon the vesting of the PSUs and in such case, dividends would be paid only for record dates occurring after the issuance date. Additional vesting terms applicable to these grants are described in further detail in the section entitled "Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements" following the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
Restricted stock units. The restricted stock units granted to the executive officers under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in February 2018 have a three-year cliff vest and are earned as long as the executive officer continues to be employed by the Company. Dividend equivalents are paid on the restricted stock units under these awards. Additional vesting terms applicable to these grants are described in further detail in the section entitled "Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements" following the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Table. 
Career shares. ManpowerGroup did not make any career share grants to any of the NEOs in 2018.

Benefits paid under the Nonqualified Savings Plan will be paid to the executive officers upon their termination of employment, either in a lump sum, or in three, five or ten annual installments, as elected by the executive officers in accordance with the plan rules.

Termination of Employment and Change of Control Arrangements 
ManpowerGroup has entered into severance agreements (which include change of control benefits) with each of the NEOs. Each agreement generally has a three-year term, and such term is automatically extended for two years to the extent there is a change of control of ManpowerGroup within the two-year period prior to the expiration of the original term of the agreement. In addition to these severance agreements, the NEOs participate in a number of equity grants and benefit plans that contain vesting provisions that are triggered upon a change of control of ManpowerGroup and/or certain terminations of employment. Generally, benefits under these arrangements are triggered upon the involuntary termination of the executive's employment not for cause or upon a voluntary termination of employment for good reason. Terminations for other reasons (such as retirement, death, disability or a change of control) also trigger enhanced benefits under certain of these arrangements. Other than for Mr. Green, the tables following the descriptions of these arrangements illustrate the amount of enhanced benefits the NEOs would receive under all such arrangements if ManpowerGroup terminated their employment on December 31, 2018 for the reasons specified within the tables. None of the tables illustrate the value of any vested benefits payable to the NEOs upon a termination of employment (i.e., vested equity awards, or vested balances accrued under the Nonqualified Savings Plan), nor does any table illustrate the value of any enhanced benefits upon retirement of an NEO who was not eligible for retirement treatment as of December 31, 2018 with respect to any of their unvested benefits. As of December 31, 2018, only Ms. Swan was eligible for retirement treatment under certain of her outstanding awards. The tables below assume that in a "change of control," the acquiring or surviving company would have assumed all unvested equity awards. 
Darryl Green Retirement. Mr. Green retired from ManpowerGroup on October 1, 2018. Following his retirement, Mr. Green entered into a consulting agreement (the "Consulting Agreement") with ManpowerGroup to provide limited advisory services for a monthly fee beginning October 2, 2018. The table for Mr. Green which follows the descriptions of the below arrangements illustrates the benefits he became entitled to receive upon his retirement, including the benefits pursuant to the Consulting Agreement. The table does not illustrate the value of any benefits that may have been payable to him upon retirement but were otherwise vested prior to his retirement (i.e., vested equity awards or vested balances accrued under the Nonqualified Savings Plan). Due to Mr. Green's retirement, the description of the treatment of the arrangements below upon a change of control or termination of employment other than retirement does not apply to him. 
Severance agreements. Under the severance agreements, upon the involuntary termination of the NEO's employment (other than for cause, as described below) or upon the voluntary termination of employment by the NEO for good reason (as described below), the NEO is entitled to receive a severance payment equal to the sum of the executive's base salary and annual incentive. The severance payment to the CEO is capped at 2-1/2 times his base salary in effect at the time of the termination, while the CFO's severance payment is capped at 2 times his base salary in effect at the time of the termination. There is no cap applicable to the other NEOs. 
In the event an NEO's termination occurs in the two-year period following a change of control of ManpowerGroup or during a "protected period" (generally, the six-month period prior to a change of control), the severance payment payable to the CEO and CFO is equal to three times the sum of their base salary and annual incentive, while the severance payment to the other NEOs is equal to two times the sum of their base salary and annual incentive. The caps on payments to the CEO and CFO described in the paragraph above do not apply in the event of a change of control. All severance payments under the NEOs' agreements will generally be paid in a lump sum on the 30th day following the date of termination. The determination of the amount of the annual incentive used to calculate the severance payment will vary depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination and is further detailed in the footnotes accompanying the illustrative tables below. 
Cause is defined in the severance agreements, and generally includes: performance failures; failure to follow instructions; fraudulent acts; violation of ManpowerGroup policies; acts of moral turpitude which are likely to result in loss of business, reputation or goodwill to ManpowerGroup; chronic absences from work which are non-health related; crimes related to the NEO's duties; or willful harmful conduct to ManpowerGroup. Good reason is also defined in each severance agreement. A termination for good reason in the severance agreements for the NEOs is triggered by (i) any material breach by the Company or one of its affiliates of a material obligation to pay or provide benefits or compensation to the executive, (ii) a material diminution in base salary, (iii) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibility, coupled with a material reduction in the executive's target bonus 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation  Tables

   Compensation  Tables     
[END TABLE]
 opportunity, (iv) a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibility that is not coupled with a material reduction in the executive's target bonus opportunity, but that occurs within 2 years after a change of control; or (v) a material reduction in the executive's target bonus opportunity that is not coupled with a material diminution in the executive's authority, duties or responsibilities, but that occurs within two years after a change of control. In addition, under the severance agreements with Mr. Prising, Mr. McGinnis, Ms. Swan, and Mr. Buchband, good reason is triggered by a relocation to a new principal office that is in excess of 50 miles from the NEO's prior principal office. 
Under the severance agreements, the NEOs are bound by non-competition agreements in favor of ManpowerGroup for the one-year period following the termination of their employment for any reason, except where the termination occurs within the two-year period following a change of control or during a protected period and is either involuntary (other than for cause) or is for good reason. 
Under the severance agreements, upon the NEO's (i) involuntary termination (other than for cause), (ii) voluntary termination for good reason or (iii) termination due to the death or disability of the NEO, the NEOs are entitled to receive a prorated incentive for the year in which termination occurs. In addition, for all NEOs covered by U.S. health insurance, ManpowerGroup has agreed to pay for continued health insurance for the NEOs and their families for a 12-month period following an involuntary termination of their employment (other than for cause) or a voluntary termination of their employment for good reason. Furthermore, if such a termination occurs within the two-year period following a change of control or during a protected period, then ManpowerGroup has agreed to pay for continued health insurance for the NEOs and their families for an 18-month period. Finally, under the severance agreements, following an involuntary termination of the NEO's employment (other than for cause) or a voluntary termination of the NEO's employment for good reason, ManpowerGroup will pay for outplacement services for up to one year following the NEO's termination. This benefit is not included in the agreement with Mr. Prising. 
During 2018, ManpowerGroup entered into new severance agreements with Mr. Chandrashekar, Mr. Buchband and Mr. McGinnis. These new severance agreements are substantially similar to the ones they replaced and all expire on the first to occur of (1) the date two years after the occurrence of a change of control of the Company or (2) three years from the date the new severance agreement was entered into. Further, ManpowerGroup was party to a severance agreement with Mr. Green during 2018. This severance agreement was similar to the severance agreements with Mr. Buchband and Ms. Swan. Mr. Green is bound by the terms of the noncompetition provisions in the severance agreement for a period of one-year following his retirement. 
Stock options. As of December 31, 2018, each of the NEOs (other than Mr. Green) held unvested stock options granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. Under the terms of the stock option agreements that ManpowerGroup entered into with each of the NEOs, unvested options immediately vest upon the NEO's death or disability. Furthermore, upon a change of control where the options are converted on a tax free basis or where ManpowerGroup's shares remain publicly traded, the options only accelerate vesting in the event of the NEO's involuntary termination of employment (other than for cause) or a voluntary termination of employment for good reason during a protected period or within two years following a change of control. Alternatively, upon a change of control of ManpowerGroup where ManpowerGroup's shares do not remain publicly traded or where a publicly traded acquirer does not convert the options into options of the acquirer's shares on a tax free basis, such options immediately vest upon the change of control. For purposes of these stock option agreements, the definitions of cause and good reason are generally the same as those used in the NEO's severance agreements. Under the terms of the stock option agreements entered into with each of the NEOs, unvested options also immediately vest upon the NEO's "retirement." Here, retirement means the termination of the NEO's employment on or after age 55 and the NEO has completed 10 years of service with ManpowerGroup. Mr. Green's unvested stock options vested on his retirement on October 1, 2018. 
Restricted stock units and career shares. As of December 31, 2018, the NEOs (other than Mr. Green) held unvested restricted stock units and career shares (restricted stock units that vest completely on a single date several years into the future, for example, four or five years) granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. A NEO will become fully vested in his or her restricted stock units or career shares upon a termination of employment due to death or disability. All restricted stock units held by the NEOs will become fully vested upon a termination of employment due to the NEO's retirement. For these awards, "retirement" generally means the termination of the NEO's employment on or after age 55 if the NEO has completed 10 years of service with ManpowerGroup.

 Mr. Green's unvested restricted stock units vested on his retirement on October 1, 2018. Career shares do not vest upon retirement. Upon a change of control, the restricted stock units or career shares shall vest according to the same terms as described above for stock options. Also, restricted stock units and career shares are forfeited upon the NEO's involuntary termination of employment or a voluntary termination for good reason. 
PSUs. As of December 31, 2018, all NEOs held outstanding PSUs granted under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan. Generally, under these awards, upon a NEO's termination of employment due to retirement (here, employment termination after age 55 with 10 years of completed service), the NEO is entitled to receive a pro-rata number of shares based on the actual results at the end of the applicable performance period, prorated based on the time elapsed after the agreement date and during the applicable service periods. No proration will apply under the 2016, 2017 or 2018 award of performance units upon a NEO's termination of employment due to retirement (here, employment termination after age 55 with 10 years of completed service), if the Committee has approved a succession plan, as recommended by the CEO, for the NEO or with respect to his position. For any outstanding award of performance units share units held by Mr. Green upon his retirement on October 1, 2018, the Committee approved the succession plan for his position, so he is entitled to receive the full number of shares payable under each award at the end of each applicable performance period, based on actual results at the end of the applicable performance period. PSUs are forfeited upon an involuntary termination of employment or a voluntary employment termination for good reason prior to the end of the performance period. 
Generally, upon the death or disability of a NEO during the performance period, the NEO is entitled to receive the target amount of shares. In the event of a change of control of ManpowerGroup, if the NEO's employment were terminated prior to the end of the vesting period for such awards (either by ManpowerGroup other than for cause or by the NEO for good reason), the NEO generally would be entitled to accelerated vesting of any unpaid PSUs, where the total number of shares payable under the award will be based on an amount determined by the committee. 
Annual Incentive Plan. The ManpowerGroup Annual Incentive Plan (the "Annual Incentive Plan") provides that a bonus will become vested upon retirement. For purposes of this plan, "retirement" means a NEO terminates employment after he or she has (i) reached age 55 and (ii) completed 10 years of service. The amount of the bonus earned for the year of retirement will be based on the actual bonus that would have been earned had the NEO continued employment, but the bonus will be prorated based on the actual number of days the NEO was employed by ManpowerGroup during the year of retirement. Mr. Green received a prorated bonus under the Annual Incentive Plan for 2018 due to his retirement on October 1, 2018. Ms. Swan was the only NEO (other than Mr. Green) eligible for retirement under the Annual Incentive Plan. 
Nonqualified Savings Plan. The amount of any unvested benefits under the Nonqualified Savings Plan will become vested upon a participant's death, disability or retirement. For purposes of this plan, "retirement" means a NEO terminates employment after he or she has (i) reached age 60, (ii) has reached age 55 and completed 20 years of service with ManpowerGroup or (iii) has reached age 55, and ManpowerGroup determines that the retirement is bona fide and that the NEO will not perform services for any competitor of ManpowerGroup. All of the NEOs that participate in this plan other than Mr. McGinnis are already fully vested in their benefits under this plan and therefore, only Mr. McGinnis would receive any enhanced benefit upon his death, disability or retirement.

(2)  The "double trigger" column calculates the amounts earned upon an involuntary termination (other than for cause)  or a voluntary termination for good reason that occurs during a protected period (generally, six months prior to a change of control) or within the two-year period following a change of control.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  The amount of the severance payment under Mr. Prising's severance agreement is equal to his annual base salary  at the highest rate in effect during the terms of the agreement (here, $1,250,000) and his target bonus for the year of the termination (here, $1,875,000). In a double-trigger scenario, the amount of his severance payment is multiplied by three.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  In the case of his involuntary termination (other than for cause) or voluntary termination for good reason, the amount of  the prorated incentive payable to Mr. Prising under his severance agreement is based on the actual incentive earned for 2018 for the financial objectives and the target amount for the operating objectives. In the event of death, disability, or  certain terminations following a change of control, the prorated incentive is based on the target incentive for the year of termination. No proration has been applied here as this table illustrates the effect of such a termination on  December 31, 2018, immediately before the incentive was earned, so as not to understate the potential value of the benefit upon the applicable termination of employment. Note that an incentive amount has also been reported as 2018 compensation  for Mr. Prising in the Summary Compensation Table, as well as in the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table.

(5)  The value of stock options is illustrated here by measuring the difference between the closing stock price on  December 31, 2018 ($64.80) and the exercise price of each unvested stock option held by Mr. Prising on such date. The exercise price of each unvested stock option held by Mr. Prising is greater than the closing stock price on  December 31, 2018 ($64.80), resulting in no value being shown.

(6)  The value of PSUs is illustrated here by measuring the value of the number of shares payable under outstanding awards  (2016, 2017 and 2018 grants) using the closing stock price on December 31, 2018 ($64.80). In the case of a change of control, the payout is shown based on the number of shares earned based on actual performance for the 2016 award and assuming  the Committee would determine the amount of shares earned relating to the 2017 and 2018 awards will equal the target award. In the case of a death or disability, the payout is shown based on the target awards for 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Except as described below, non-employee directors may elect to receive deferred stock under the 2011 Equity Incentive Plan in lieu of their annual cash retainer. Elections may cover 50%, 75% or 100% of the annual cash retainer payable to the director for the election period for which the annual cash retainer is payable. An election period begins on January 1 of each year or the date of the director's initial appointment to the board of directors, whichever is later, and ends on the date a director ceases to be a director or December 31, whichever is earlier. The deferred stock will be granted to the director following the end of the election period to which the election applies. The number of shares of deferred stock granted to the director will be equal to the amount of the annual cash retainer to which the election applies, divided by the average of the closing prices of ManpowerGroup common stock on the last trading day of each full or partial calendar quarter covered by the election period. For the election period that ended on December 31, 2018, Mr. Downe, Mr. Ferraro, Ms. Howard and Mr. Walter elected to accept deferred stock in lieu of 100% of the annual cash retainer to which they were otherwise entitled. 
Shares of common stock represented by deferred stock granted to a director prior to January 1, 2007 will be distributed to the director within 30 days after the date the director ceases to be a member of the board of directors. Shares of common stock represented by deferred stock granted to a director on or after January 1, 2007 will be distributed to the director on the earliest of the third anniversary of the date of grant or within 30 days after the date 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Compensation  Tables     
   Compensation  Tables     
   Compensation  Tables     
[END TABLE]
 the director ceases to be a member of the board of directors. However, the director will have the right to extend the deferral period for these grants by at least five years, and thereafter to extend any previously extended deferral period by at least five more years, provided in each case this election to extend is made at least twelve months before the last day of the then current deferral period. 
In addition to the cash compensation (or elective deferred stock), each non-employee director received an annual grant of deferred stock. The grant was effective on the first day of 2018, and the number of shares granted equaled $160,000 divided by the closing sale price of a share of ManpowerGroup's common stock on the last business day of the preceding year, or 1,269 shares of deferred stock for 2018. Such deferred stock vests in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter during the year. Shares of common stock represented by vested deferred stock held by a director will be distributed to the director on the earliest of the third anniversary of the effective date of grant or within 30 days after the date the director ceases to be a member of the board of directors. 
The director will have the right to extend the deferral period as described above. A new non-employee director will receive a grant of deferred stock effective the date the director is appointed to the board, and the grant will be prorated for the period beginning on the date of the director's appointment and ending on December 31 of that year. 
Instead of receiving the annual grant of deferred stock, non-employee directors have the right to elect to receive the same number of shares of restricted stock. Like the deferred stock, any such grant will be effective on the first day of the year and will vest in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter during the year. Any such election will be effective only if made on or before December 31 of the preceding year or within 10 days of appointment to the board of directors. 
In light of the changes made to the non-employee director compensation program in 2018, the board of directors determined that no changes were needed to the program for 2019.

Non-Employee Director Stock Ownership Guidelines 
The nominating and governance committee believes that non-employee directors should hold a meaningful stake in ManpowerGroup to align their economic interests with those of the shareholders. To that end, the board of directors adopted stock ownership guidelines that currently require non-employee directors to own shares or hold vested deferred stock or vested restricted stock equal in value to five times the 2015 annual cash retainer ($90,000 at January 1, 2015, for a total guideline of $450,000). The committee takes into account vested deferred and restricted stock in determining targeted ownership levels. The following table details each non-employee director's stock ownership relative to the stock ownership guidelines:

We Prohibit Non-Employee Directors from Hedging, Pledging and Short-selling Our Securities 
Similar to our NEOs, under ManpowerGroup's Insider Trading Policy, non-employee directors are prohibited from engaging in short sales or hedging transactions involving ManpowerGroup securities, including forward sale or purchase contracts, equity swaps or exchange funds. Non-employee directors are also prohibited from engaging in puts, calls or other options or derivative instruments involving ManpowerGroup securities. Further, we do not allow non-employee directors to pledge ManpowerGroup securities at any time, which includes having ManpowerGroup stock in a margin account or using ManpowerGroup stocks as collateral for a loan.

[END TABLE]
CEO Pay Ratio 
In accordance with the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we have calculated a CEO Pay Ratio for 2018. This ratio is a reasonable estimate, calculated as described below. 
Measurement Date 
When we calculated our median employee in 2017, we utilized a measurement date at the beginning of our fourth quarter (October 1, 2017). We had an employee population of more than 600,000 individuals worldwide as of the measurement date. It is important to note that 95% of this population comprises our "associates" — these are the employees on assignment that day with our clients within the 80 countries and territories in which we operate. A majority of such assignments are temporary in nature, of different types and durations, which leads to considerable variation in our employee population on a daily basis. In accordance with Item 402(u), our employee population includes both our associates and the remaining 5% of our employees who represent our "permanent" (full and part-time) staff. 
Consistently Applied Compensation Measure 
For each of these individuals, compensation was calculated based on total taxable earnings as defined in their home country's payroll systems. Consistent with SEC rules, we annualized this number for part-time and full-time employees who were employed for less than the full year, but not for our associates whose positions are seasonal or temporary in nature. The individual who was our median employee for our calculation in 2017 is no longer employed by us. In accordance with Item 402(u), we determined that there was another similarly compensated individual as the 2017 median employee, and we have used that individual as the median employee for the calculations. We believe we have not had any significant changes to our employee population or our employee compensation arrangements since last year and we believe the selection of this individual as our median employee does not result in a significant change to our pay ratio disclosure. The median employee identified for 2018 is an associate located in Israel who worked as a caregiver for part of the year. Her total annual compensation was calculated in accordance with the requirements of the Summary Compensation Table as being $4,563. When calculated against Mr. Prising's compensation for 2018 of $11,444,010 as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table, it yields a CEO Pay Ratio of 2,508:1. 
Calculation Excluding Associates 
Supplementally, we have again calculated a CEO pay ratio excluding our associates for 2018. As noted above, most of the individuals who are counted as "employees" under Item 402(u) are in fact associates who are performing work for our clients on a temporary basis. For this supplemental calculation, the median employee was a junior sourcing consultant in one of our branch offices in Belgium. Her annualized total compensation was $46,558 for 2018. Under this calculation, the CEO pay ratio is 246:1. We believe this is a more representative indication of how our CEO pay compares to that of our workforce.

Audit Committee Report 
We have an audit committee that consists entirely of independent directors, each of whom meet the independence requirements set forth by the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC. The board of directors has adopted a charter for the audit committee, which is available on our web site at http://investor.manpowergroup.com/governance. The charter sets forth the responsibilities and authority of the audit committee with respect to our independent auditors, quarterly and annual financial statements, non-audit services, internal audit and accounting, risk assessment and risk management, business conduct and ethics, special investigations, use of advisors and other reporting and disclosure obligations, including the audit committee's obligations in monitoring the company's compliance with its code of business conduct and ethics as well as its policies and procedures regarding anti-corruption. The committee reviews its charter on a periodic basis and recommends updates as necessary. 
In 2018, the audit committee met five times. Over the course of these meetings, the audit committee met with our chief financial officer, other senior members of the finance department, senior members of the IT department, the chairperson of our disclosure committee, the head of internal audit, our chief legal officer and our independent auditors. During these meetings, the audit committee reviewed and discussed, among other things:

The audit committee met five times in private session with Deloitte & Touche LLP and met five times in private session with the head of internal audit. The purpose of the private sessions is to allow the participants to raise any concerns they may have and to discuss other topics in a confidential setting. 
In addition to the meetings discussed above, the chair of the audit committee, and any other audit committee member or other member of the board of directors who desired or was requested to participate, reviewed with management and our independent auditors our financial results for each quarter of 2018 prior to the quarterly release of earnings. 
In February 2019, the independent auditors and members of senior management reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with the audit committee, together with our disclosures under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

The aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Deloitte for the audit of our financial statements and attestation of our certification of our internal control over financial reporting as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the review of the financial statements included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for 2018 approved by the audit committee were $7,907,000.

These services consisted of issuing an audit report for one of our foreign subsidiaries regarding a government subsidy, issuing an audit report related to the statement of educational expenses for flex workers for one our subsidiaries and certification fees. 
The aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for audit-related services were $243,000 in 2018.

 requirements for permitted services and related disclosure and reporting standards. A copy of the policy is available on our web site at http://investor.manpowergroup.com/governance. Each of the services described under the headings "Audit-Related Fees" and "Tax Fees" was approved during 2017 and 2018 in accordance with the policy. 
The audit committee has also received the written disclosures and confirmation from Deloitte required by PCAOB Ethics and Independence Rule 3526 and discussed with Deloitte their independence. In particular, at each regular meeting during 2018 and at the meeting in February 2019 the audit committee reviewed and discussed the non-audit services provided by Deloitte to us that are described above. The audit committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit services described above is compatible with the independence of Deloitte and satisfied itself as to the auditor's independence. The audit committee believes that Deloitte has been objective and impartial in conducting the 2018 audit, and believes that the provision of these services has not adversely affected the integrity of our audit and financial reporting processes. 
In performing all of the functions described above, the audit committee acts only in an oversight capacity. The audit committee does not complete its reviews of the matters described above prior to our public announcements of financial results and, necessarily, in its oversight role, the audit committee relies on the work and assurances of our management, which has the primary responsibility for our financial statements and related reports and internal control over financial reporting, and of the independent auditors, who, in their report, express an opinion on the conformity of our annual financial statements to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the report of the independent auditors, the audit committee has recommended to the board of directors that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

2. Ratification of Independent Auditors 
The audit committee of the board of directors has appointed Deloitte & Touche LLP to audit our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019 and directed that such appointment be submitted to the shareholders for ratification. Deloitte & Touche LLP has audited our consolidated financial statements since the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005. Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the annual meeting and have the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire, and will also be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
If the shareholders do not ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the audit committee will take such action into account in reconsidering the appointment of our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
The affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on this proposal shall constitute ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP as our independent auditors for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast and, therefore, will have no impact on the approval of the proposal.

3. Advisory Vote on Approval of the Compensation of Named Executive Officers 
The Company seeks your advisory vote on our executive compensation program and asks that you support the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in the "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section and the accompanying tables contained in this Proxy Statement. We are providing this vote as required pursuant to Section 14A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are asking shareholders to approve the following resolution regarding our executive compensation program: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to the Company's named executive officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved. 
ManpowerGroup derives approximately 88% of its revenues from outside the United States, with the largest portions coming from the company's operating segments in Southern Europe (43%), Northern Europe (24%) and Asia Pacific Middle East (13%). Our business is truly global in nature and complexity. Through our global network of nearly 2,600 offices in 80 countries and territories, we serve global, multinational and local clients across all major industry segments and provide a broad range of workforce solutions including recruitment and assessment, training and development, career management, outsourcing and workforce consulting. 
To be successful, ManpowerGroup needs senior executives who have the capability and experience to operate effectively in this environment. A guiding principle of the company's compensation program is to provide pay opportunities to the executive officers that are competitive in attracting and retaining executives of this caliber. Other key objectives of the program are to align compensation to shareholder interests and, as an element of that objective, to pay for results and not pay for failure. 
Compensation packages for the executive officers generally include, as short-term arrangements, a base salary and an annual incentive bonus, and for long-term focus and value accumulation, performance share units, stock options and restricted stock units. The annual incentive is earned based on achievement of goals established at the beginning of each year. Likewise, PSUs represent a right to receive shares of company common stock based on achievement of goals established at the time the PSUs are granted. For both, award opportunities are established for achievement at threshold, target and outstanding levels. 
The Company structures the compensation packages of the executive officers so that the overall outcomes at target fall generally within the median range of the competitive market. For the annual incentive and the PSU components of the package, award levels for achievement of the applicable goals generally are set at the median of the competitive market for target results and the 75th percentile for outstanding results. However, actual outcomes may vary among the executive officers due to experience and other individual factors. In addition, because of the cyclical nature of the Company's business, actual outcomes may significantly exceed or fall short of this range after taking into account performance factors. 
As noted above, a key objective of the compensation program is to align compensation to shareholder interests. The company's compensation program addresses this objective on both a short-term basis and a long-term basis. Annual incentive awards are based on achievement of goals that are drivers of shareholder value and PSUs are earned based on operating profit margin percentage goals, a measure of how efficiently our executive officers have deployed our operating resources to generate a profit. We believe using this metric drives a long-term focus on achieving sustainable profits. In addition, a substantial portion of the annual incentive award paid to the executive officers is based on achievement of earnings per share and return on invested capital for the year. Earnings per share focuses our executive officers on producing financial results that align with the interests of our shareholders, while return on invested capital incentivizes our executive officers to manage our accounts receivable and other capital investments carefully in order to maximize capital deployed.

[END TABLE]
Both the short-term and long-term components of the compensation program reflect the objective that senior executives should be paid for results and not paid for failure. The executive officers' base salaries generally are at or below market median with a significant component of the annual cash opportunity based on the level of attainment of performance goals for the year. If the actual results fall short of the goals, the award level is correspondingly reduced or eliminated. 
As for the long-term components of the compensation program, the ultimate value received by an executive, through stock appreciation, will of course depend directly on the performance of the company. In addition, a significant component of the long-term compensation package consists of performance share units which are earned only to the extent the company achieves a pre-established level of performance tied to a designated performance metric, in this instance operating profit margin percent. 
Approval of the company's executive compensation policies and procedures requires that the number of votes cast in favor of the proposal exceeds the number of votes cast against it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as votes cast. Because this shareholder vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the board of directors. However, the executive compensation and human resources committee will take into account the outcome of the vote when considering future executive compensation arrangements.

Submission of Shareholder Proposals 
In accordance with our bylaws, nominations, other than by or at the direction of the board of directors, of candidates for election as directors at the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders must be received by us no earlier than December 12, 2019 and no later than February 10, 2020, and any other shareholder proposed business to be brought before the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by us no later than February 10, 2020. Unlike shareholder proposals properly made under Rule 14a-8 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, we are not required to include such nominations and other shareholder proposed business in the proxy statement solicited by the board of directors. To be considered for inclusion in the proxy statement solicited by the board of directors, shareholder proposals under Rule 14a-8 for consideration at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders must be received by us at our principal executive offices by November 9, 2019. Such nominations or proposals must be submitted to Richard Buchband, Secretary, ManpowerGroup Inc., 100 Manpower Place, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53212. To avoid disputes as to the date of receipt, it is suggested that any shareholder proposal be submitted by certified mail, return receipt requested. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires our directors and officers to file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission disclosing their ownership, and changes in their ownership, of our common stock. Copies of these reports must also be furnished to us. Based solely on a review of these copies, we believe that during 2018 all filing requirements were met. 
Other Voting Information 
Shareholders may vote over the Internet, by telephone or by completing a traditional proxy card. Votes submitted electronically over the Internet or by telephone must be received by 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on May 9, 2019. To vote over the Internet or by telephone, please refer to the instructions on the accompanying proxy card.

Shareholders voting via the Internet should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies that must be borne by the shareholder. 
Other Matters 
Although management is not aware of any other matters that may come before the annual meeting, if any such matters should be presented, the persons named in the accompanying proxy intend to vote such proxy as recommended by the board of directors or, if no such recommendation is given, in their discretion.

Richard Buchband, Secretary
