[BEGIN TABLE]
2.  Q:    WHY DID I RECEIVE A ONE-PAGE  NOTICE IN THE MAIL REGARDING THE INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS INSTEAD OF A FULL SET OF PROXY MATERIALS?  
[END TABLE]
A:    Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to our proxy materials and annual report over the Internet. Accordingly, we are sending to our stockholders of record and beneficial owners a notice of Internet availability of the proxy materials ("Internet Notice") instead of sending a paper copy of the proxy materials and annual report. All stockholders receiving the Internet Notice will have the ability to access the proxy materials and annual report on a website referenced in the Internet Notice or to request a printed set of the proxy materials and annual report. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials and annual report over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Internet Notice and in this proxy statement.

[END TABLE]
A:    Stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 7, 2019, or their duly appointed proxies, may attend the meeting. "Street name" holders (those whose shares are held through a broker or other nominee) should bring a copy of a brokerage statement reflecting their ownership of our common stock as of the record date. Space limitations may make it necessary to limit attendance to stockholders and valid picture identification may be required. Cameras, recording devices, and other electronic devices are not permitted at the meeting. The Company may implement additional procedures to ensure the comfort and safety of meeting attendees. Registration will begin at 1:00 p.m. (CDT), and the annual meeting will commence at 2:00 p.m. (CDT).

[BEGIN TABLE]
6.  Q:    WHO IS SOLICITING MY VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
A:    The Company's Board of Directors is sending you this proxy statement in connection with the solicitation of proxies for use at the 2019 annual meeting. The Company pays the cost of soliciting proxies. Proxies may be solicited in person or by telephone, facsimile, electronic mail, or other electronic medium by certain of our directors, officers, and employees, without additional compensation. In addition, we have retained Georgeson LLC to assist in the solicitation of proxies for a fee of approximately $15,000 plus associated costs and expenses. Forms of proxies and proxy materials may also be distributed through brokers, custodians, and other like parties to the beneficial owners of shares of our common stock, in which case we will reimburse these parties for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
7.  Q:    ON WHAT MAY I VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
A:    You may vote on the election of directors nominated to serve on our Board of Directors; the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019; the advisory say-on-pay resolution to approve our executive compensation; and the approval of amendments to the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation to eliminate supermajority voting requirements.

[END TABLE]

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
9.  Q:    HOW WILL VOTING ON ANY OTHER BUSINESS BE CONDUCTED?   
[END TABLE]
A:    It is not expected that any matter not referred to herein will be presented for action at the annual meeting. If any other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, including, without limitation, a motion to adjourn the annual meeting to another time and/or place for the purpose of, among other matters, permitting dissemination of information regarding material developments relating to any of the proposals or soliciting additional proxies in favor of the approval of any of the proposals, the persons named on the accompanying Proxy Card will vote the shares represented by such proxy upon such   matters in their discretion. Should the annual meeting be reconvened, all proxies will be voted in the same manner as such proxies would have been voted when the annual meeting was originally convened, except for the proxies effectively revoked or withdrawn prior to the time proxies are voted at such reconvened meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
10.  Q:    HOW DO I VOTE IF MY SHARES ARE REGISTERED DIRECTLY IN MY NAME?   
[END TABLE]
A:    You may vote in person at the annual meeting or authorize the persons named as proxies on the Proxy Card to vote your shares by returning the Proxy Card by mail, through the Internet, or by telephone. Although we offer four different voting methods, we encourage you to vote through the Internet as we believe it is the most cost-effective method for the Company. We also recommend that you vote as soon as possible, even if you are planning to attend the annual meeting, so that the vote count will not be delayed. Both the Internet and the telephone provide convenient, cost-effective alternatives to returning your Proxy Card by mail. If you choose to vote your shares through the Internet or by telephone, there is no need for you to mail back your Proxy Card. 
To Vote Over the Internet: 
Log on to the Internet and go to the website www.proxyvote.com (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Have your Proxy Card available when you access the website. You will need the control number from your Proxy Card to vote. 
To Vote By Telephone: 
On a touch-tone telephone, call 1-800-690-6903 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Have your Proxy Card available when you make the call. You will need the control number from your Proxy Card to vote. 
To Vote By Proxy Card: 
Complete and sign the Proxy Card and return it to the address indicated on the Proxy Card. If you received an Internet Notice instead of a paper copy of the proxy materials and annual report, you should follow the voting instructions set forth in the Internet Notice. 
You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by: (i) notifying our Corporate Secretary in writing at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203; (ii) voting in person; (iii) submitting a later-dated Proxy Card; (iv) submitting another vote by telephone or over the Internet; or (v) if applicable, submitting new voting instructions to your broker or nominee. If you have questions about how to vote or revoke your proxy, you should contact our Corporate Secretary at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203. For shares held in street name, refer to Question 11. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
11.  Q:    HOW DO I VOTE MY SHARES IF THEY ARE HELD IN THE NAME OF MY BROKER  (STREET NAME)?  
[END TABLE]
A:    If your shares are held by your broker or other nominee, often referred to as held in street name, you will receive a form from your broker or nominee seeking instruction as to how your shares should be voted. You should contact your broker or other nominee with questions about how to provide or revoke your instructions. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
12.  Q:    WHAT IS THE VOTE REQUIRED TO ELECT DIRECTORS?   
[END TABLE]
A:    Since Proposal 1 in this proxy statement is in respect of an uncontested director election, Proposal 1 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting to elect a nominee, which means that a nominee will be elected only if the   number of shares voted "for" that nominee exceeds the number of shares voted "against" that nominee. Accordingly, each nominee receiving a greater number of shares voted "for" such nominee than "against" such nominee shall be elected as a director. If an incumbent director does not receive a greater number of shares voted "for" such director than "against" such director, then such director must tender his or her resignation to the Board of Directors, which resignation shall be contingent upon acceptance thereof by the Board of Directors. If a nominee who is not an incumbent director does not receive a greater number of shares voted "for" such director than "against" such director, then such nominee will not be elected to the Board of Directors. In the event there is a contested director election, director nominees must receive affirmative votes from a plurality of the votes cast at the annual meeting to be elected. This means that the nominees receiving the greatest number of affirmative votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote will be elected as directors. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
13.  Q:    WHAT IS THE VOTE REQUIRED TO APPROVE THE OTHER PROPOSALS?   
[END TABLE]
A:    Ratification of Ernst & Young LLP: The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019 must receive affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote to be approved. 
Advisory Say-On-Pay Resolution: The advisory say-on-pay resolution to approve our executive compensation must receive affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote to be approved. Because your vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Company, the Board of Directors or our Compensation Committee. Although non-binding, our Compensation Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. 
Amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation: The proposal to approve amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate supermajority voting requirements must receive affirmative votes from the holders of at least 75% of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors to be approved. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
14.  Q:    WHAT CONSTITUTES A "QUORUM"?   
[END TABLE]
A:    The presence at the meeting, in person or by proxy, of the holders of a majority of the aggregate voting power of the common stock outstanding on the record date will constitute a quorum. There must be a quorum for business to be conducted at the meeting. Failure of a quorum to be represented at the annual meeting will necessitate an adjournment or postponement and will subject the Company to additional expense. Abstentions and broker non-votes are counted as present or represented for purposes of determining the presence or absence of a quorum. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
15.  Q:    WHAT IF I ABSTAIN FROM VOTING?  
[END TABLE]
A:    If you attend the meeting or send in your signed Proxy Card or vote by telephone or over the Internet, but abstain from voting on any proposal, you will still be counted for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. If you abstain from voting on Proposal 1, your abstention will have no effect on the outcome. If you abstain from voting on Proposals 2, 3 or 4, your abstention will have the same legal effect as a vote against these proposals.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
16.  Q:    WILL MY SHARES BE VOTED IF I DO NOT SIGN AND RETURN MY PROXY CARD OR  VOTE BY TELEPHONE OR OVER THE INTERNET?  
[END TABLE]
A:    If you are a registered stockholder and you do not sign and return your Proxy Card or vote by telephone or over the Internet, your shares will not be voted at the annual meeting. Questions concerning stock certificates and registered stockholders may be directed to EQ Shareowner Services at 1110 Centre Pointe Curve, Suite 101, Mendota Heights, Minnesota 55120-4100 or by telephone at 1-800-468-9716 (domestic) or 1-651-450-4064 (outside the U.S.). If your shares are held in street name and you do not issue instructions to your broker, your broker may vote your shares at its discretion on routine matters, but may not vote your shares on non-routine matters. Under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, Proposal 2 relating to the ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm is deemed to be a routine matter and brokers and nominees may exercise their voting discretion without receiving instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. Proposals 1, 3 and 4 are non-routine matters and, therefore, may only be voted in accordance with instructions received from the beneficial owner of the shares. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
17.  Q:    WHAT IS A "BROKER  NON-VOTE"?  
[END TABLE]
A:    Under NYSE rules, brokers and nominees may exercise their voting discretion without receiving instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares on proposals that are deemed to be routine matters. If a proposal is a non-routine matter, a broker or nominee may not vote the shares on the proposal without receiving instructions from the beneficial owner of the shares. If a broker turns in a Proxy Card expressly stating that the broker is not voting on a non-routine matter, such action is referred to as a "broker non-vote." 
[BEGIN TABLE]
18.  Q:    WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF A BROKER  NON-VOTE?  
[END TABLE]
A:    Broker non-votes will be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum but will not be counted for purposes of determining the outcome of the vote on any proposal, other than Proposal 2. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
19.  Q:    WHO WILL COUNT THE VOTES?  
[END TABLE]
A:    Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. has been engaged as our independent inspector of election to tabulate stockholder votes for the annual meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
20.  Q:    CAN I PARTICIPATE IF I AM UNABLE TO ATTEND?   
[END TABLE]
A:    If you are unable to attend the meeting in person, we encourage you to send in your Proxy Card or to vote by telephone or over the Internet. We will provide a live webcast of the annual meeting accessible at https://event.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1234705&tp_key=d97cba9a0b. The webcast will be one-way audio only, and webcast attendees will not be able to participate in or vote at the meeting via the webcast. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
21.  Q:    WHERE CAN I FIND THE VOTING RESULTS OF THE ANNUAL MEETING?   
[END TABLE]
A:    We intend to announce preliminary voting results at the annual meeting and publish final results in a Current Report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the SEC following the annual meeting. All reports we file with the SEC are publicly available when filed. Please refer to Question 24 for additional information.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
22.  Q:    WHEN ARE STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS DUE IN ORDER TO BE INCLUDED IN OUR  PROXY MATERIALS FOR THE NEXT ANNUAL MEETING?  
[END TABLE]
A:    Any stockholder proposal must be submitted in writing to our Corporate Secretary at HCA Healthcare, Inc., One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, prior to the close of business on November 16, 2019, to be considered timely for inclusion in next year's proxy statement and form of proxy. Such proposal must also comply with SEC regulations, including Rule 14a-8 regarding the inclusion of stockholder proposals in company-sponsored proxy materials. 
We have also adopted a proxy access right that permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning continuously for at least three years shares of our stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in our bylaws. Under our bylaws, to be considered timely, compliant notice of proxy access director nominations for next year's proxy statement and form of proxy must be submitted to the Corporate Secretary at the address specified above no earlier than October 17, 2019 and no later than November 16, 2019; provided, however, that if (A) the annual meeting is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of this year's meeting, or (B) no annual meeting is held this year, to be timely the stockholder notice must be received no later than 90 days prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth day after the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made, whichever occurs first. The foregoing is a summary of the requirements for stockholders to nominate persons for election to our Board of Directors, which requirements are set out fully in our bylaws, and the foregoing description is qualified by reference to the full text of our bylaws. You should consult our bylaws for more detailed information regarding the processes by which stockholders may nominate directors, including the specific requirements regarding the content of the written notices and other related requirements. Our bylaws are posted on the Corporate Governance portion of our website located at www.hcahealthcare.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
23.  Q:    WHEN ARE OTHER STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS DUE?   
[END TABLE]
A:    Our bylaws contain an advance notice provision that requires stockholders to deliver to us notice of a proposal to be considered at an annual meeting not less than 90 nor more than 120 days before the date of the first anniversary of the prior year's annual meeting. Such proposals are also subject to informational and other requirements set forth in our bylaws, a copy of which is available under the Corporate Governance portion of our website, www.hcahealthcare.com. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
24.  Q:    HOW CAN I OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY?   
[END TABLE]
A:    We will provide copies of this proxy statement and our 2018 Annual Report to Stockholders, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, without charge to any stockholder who makes a written request to our Corporate Secretary at HCA Healthcare, Inc., One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other SEC filings may also be accessed at www.sec.gov or on the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.hcahealthcare.com. Our website address is provided as an inactive textual reference only. The information provided on or accessible through our website is not part of this proxy statement and is not incorporated herein by this or any other reference to our website provided in this proxy statement.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
25.  Q:    HOW MANY COPIES SHOULD I RECEIVE IF I SHARE AN ADDRESS WITH ANOTHER  STOCKHOLDER?  
[END TABLE]
A:    The SEC has adopted rules that permit companies and intermediaries, such as brokers, to satisfy the delivery requirements for proxy statements and annual reports with respect to two or more stockholders sharing the same address by delivering a single Internet Notice or proxy statement addressed to those stockholders. This process, commonly referred to as "householding," potentially provides extra convenience for stockholders and cost savings for companies. The Company and some brokers may be householding our Internet Notice or proxy materials by delivering a single Internet Notice or proxy statement and annual report to multiple stockholders sharing an address unless contrary instructions have been received from the affected stockholders. Once you have received notice from your broker, or us, that they, or we, will be householding materials to your address, householding will continue until you are notified otherwise or until you revoke your consent.

Director  Independence.  Our Board of Directors currently consists of 13 directors. NYSE listing standards require that a majority of our directors be independent in accordance with the independence requirements set forth in such listing standards. In addition, our Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee must be composed solely of independent directors to comply with such listing standards and, in the case of our Audit and Compliance Committee, with SEC rules. 
Our Board of Directors affirmatively determines the independence of each director and director nominee in accordance with guidelines it has adopted, which include all elements of independence set forth in the NYSE listing standards as well as certain Board-adopted categorical independence standards. These guidelines are contained in our Corporate Governance Guidelines which are posted on the Corporate Governance portion of our website located at www.hcahealthcare.com. The Board first analyzes whether any director has a relationship covered by the NYSE listing standards that would prohibit an independence finding for Board or committee purposes. Management then provides the Board with relevant known facts and circumstances, and their analysis thereof, of any relationship of a director to HCA or to our management that does not fall within the parameters set forth in the Board's separately adopted categorical independence standards to determine whether or not that relationship is material. The Board may determine that a director who has a relationship that falls outside of the parameters of the categorical independence standards is nonetheless independent (to the extent that the relationship would not constitute a bar to independence under the NYSE listing standards). 
Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that Meg G. Crofton, Robert J. Dennis, Nancy-Ann DeParle, Charles O. Holliday, Jr., Ann H. Lamont, Geoffrey G. Meyers, Michael W. Michelson, Wayne J. Riley, M.D. and John W. Rowe, M.D. are independent from our management under both the NYSE's listing standards and our additional standards. The Board has also affirmatively determined that Messrs. Holliday, Meyers and Michelson and Dr. Riley,   the members of our Audit and Compliance Committee, meet the independence requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Any relationships between an independent director and HCA or our management fell within the Board-adopted categorical standards and, accordingly, were not specifically reviewed by our Board. 
On November 17, 2006, a predecessor entity, HCA Inc., was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners (formerly Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity) (each, a "Sponsor") and affiliates of HCA founder Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. (the "Frist Entities," and together with the Sponsors, the "Investors") and by members of management and certain other investors (the "Merger"). In connection with the Merger, we entered into a stockholders' agreement (the "Stockholders' Agreement") with Hercules Holding II (f/k/a Hercules Holding II, LLC) ("Hercules Holding") and the Investors which, among other things, currently provides for certain rights of the Frist Entities to nominate two members of our Board of Directors. See "Director Qualifications" and "Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions." 
Executive  Sessions.  Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that non-management directors shall meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions, which will typically occur at regularly scheduled Board meetings, without any member of management present and must so meet at least annually. In addition, at least annually the independent directors shall meet in separate executive session. Mr. Holliday is currently the non-management and independent presiding director. Effective following the annual meeting, Mr. Frist III will preside over meetings of the non-management directors, and Mr. Holliday will continue to serve as the independent presiding director. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines also provide that the independent and/or non-management directors shall be entitled, acting as a group by vote of a majority of such independent and/or non-management directors, to retain legal counsel, accountants, health care consultants, or other experts, at the Company's expense, to advise the independent and/or non-management directors concerning issues arising in the exercise of their functions and powers. 
Criteria for Director Nomination.  Our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Board persons to be nominated to serve as directors of the Company. When determining whether to nominate a current director to stand for re-election as a director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews and considers the performance of such director during the prior year using performance criteria established by the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also considers the requirements of any stockholders' agreement in existence which governs the composition requirements of the Company's Board of Directors. In recruiting and evaluating new director candidates, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assesses a candidate's independence, as well as the candidate's background and experience, current board skill needs and diversity. The Company endeavors to have a Board representing diverse experience at policy-making levels in business, education or areas that are relevant to the Company's business. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers any candidates proposed by any senior executive officer, director or stockholder, consistent with applicable law, the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws, the criteria set forth in our Corporate Governance Guidelines and the requirements of any stockholders' agreement in existence. 
Individual directors and any person nominated to serve as a director should demonstrate high ethical standards and integrity in their personal and professional dealings, be willing to act on and remain accountable for their boardroom decisions, and be in a position to devote an adequate amount of time to the effective performance of their director duties.  In addition, each director should contribute knowledge, experience, or skill in at least one area that is important to the Company. To provide such a contribution to the Company, a director must possess experience in one or more of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Business or management for complex and large consolidated companies or other complex and large institutions;   
• Accounting or finance for complex and large consolidated companies or other complex and large institutions;   
• Leadership, strategic planning, or crisis response for complex and large consolidated companies or other complex and large  institutions;  
• The health care industry; and  
• Other significant and relevant areas deemed by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to be valuable to the  Company.  
[END TABLE]
Each director must also take reasonable steps to keep informed on the complex, rapidly evolving health care environment. Prior to nominating a person to serve as a director, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates the candidate based on the criteria described above. In addition, prior to accepting re-nomination, each director should evaluate himself or herself as to whether he or she satisfies the criteria described above. 
Stockholder  Nominees.  Our bylaws provide that stockholders seeking to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring business before an annual or special meeting of stockholders must provide timely notice of their proposal in writing to the Corporate Secretary of the Company. Generally, to be timely, a stockholder's notice must be delivered to, mailed to or received at our principal executive offices, addressed to the Corporate Secretary of the Company, and within the following time periods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the case of an annual meeting, no earlier than 120 days and no later than 90 days prior to the first anniversary of the  date of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that if (A) the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days, or delayed by more than 60 days, from the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, or  (B) no annual meeting was held during the preceding year, to be timely the stockholder notice must be received no earlier than 120 days before such annual meeting and no later than the later of 90 days before such annual meeting or the  tenth day after the day on which public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• in the case of a nomination of a person or persons for election to the Board of Directors at a special meeting of the  stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, no earlier than 120 days before such special meeting and no later than the later of 90 days before such annual or special meeting or the tenth day after the day on which public  disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made.  
[END TABLE]
In no event shall an adjournment, postponement or deferral, or public disclosure of an adjournment, postponement or deferral, of a meeting of the stockholders commence a new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of the stockholder notice. 
The Company has also adopted a proxy access right that permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning continuously for at least three years shares of our stock representing an aggregate of at least 3% of the voting power entitled to vote in the election of directors, to nominate and include in our proxy materials director nominees, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements in our bylaws. The number of potential proxy access nominees nominated by all eligible stockholders shall not exceed the greater of (A) two or (B) 20% of the directors then in office. Under our bylaws, to be   considered timely, compliant notice of proxy access director nominations must be submitted to the Corporate Secretary at the address specified above no earlier than 150 days and no later than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the date the Company mailed its proxy statement for the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that if (A) the annual meeting is not within 30 days before or after the anniversary date of the preceding year's annual meeting, or (B) no annual meeting was held during the preceding year, to be timely the stockholder notice must be received no later than 90 days prior to such annual meeting or, if later, the tenth day after the day on which notice of the date of the meeting was mailed or public disclosure of the date of such meeting is first made, whichever occurs first. 
The foregoing is a summary of the requirements for stockholders to nominate persons for election to our Board of Directors, which requirements are set out fully in our bylaws, and the foregoing description is qualified by reference to the full text of our bylaws. You should consult our bylaws for more detailed information regarding the processes by which stockholders may nominate directors, including the specific requirements regarding the content of the written notices and other related requirements. Our bylaws are posted on the Corporate Governance portion of our website located at www.hcahealthcare.com. 
Board  Leadership Structure.  The Board of Directors regularly considers the appropriate leadership structure for the Company and has concluded that the Company and its stockholders are best served by the Board of Directors retaining discretion to determine whether the same individual should serve as both Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors, or whether the roles should be separated. The Board of Directors believes that it is important to retain the flexibility to make this determination at any given point in time based on what it believes will provide the best leadership structure for the Company. Accordingly, at different points in the Company's history, the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors roles have been held by the same person. At other times, the roles have been held by different individuals. In each instance, the decision on whether to combine or separate the roles was made in the best interests of the Company's stockholders, based on the circumstances at the time. 
Since the beginning of 2015, Mr. Johnson served as both the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and our Board of Directors has been satisfied that a combined Chairman and Chief Executive Officer structure served our stockholders well during that time. Throughout 2018, the Board of Directors reviewed its leadership structure in connection with Mr. Johnson's announcement of his plans to retire as Chief Executive Officer at the end of 2018. The Board of Directors determined that the transition to the new Chief Executive Officer would be best accomplished by having Mr. Johnson continue to serve as Chairman, which resulted in a separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the end of 2018. The Board of Directors believed this to be the appropriate leadership structure during this transition period in order to allow Mr. Johnson to continue to lead the Board in its governance and oversight responsibilities with regard to the Company, while allowing Mr. Hazen to focus on effectively transitioning into his new CEO role without any simultaneous change in Board leadership. However, pursuant to the amended and restated employment agreement the Company and Mr. Johnson entered into in September 2018, Mr. Johnson will retire and resign from his role as Chairman following the 2019 annual meeting. 
In order to facilitate an orderly succession plan, the Board of Directors has appointed Thomas F. Frist III to serve as Chairman upon Mr. Johnson's retirement from the Board of Directors and has reappointed Mr. Holliday to serve as the independent presiding director of the Board of Directors. Mr. Frist III is the son of HCA founder Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr. Mr. Frist III has been a member of the Board of Directors since 2006; he, along with certain other members of his family, collectively own approximately 20% of our common stock.  As Chairman, Mr. Frist III will lead the activities of the Board of Directors, including calling meetings of the Board and non-management directors, as necessary, setting the agenda for Board meetings in consultation with the CEO, chairing executive sessions of the non-management directors, engaging with stockholders as appropriate, acting as an advisor to Mr. Hazen on strategic aspects of the CEO role, with regular consultations on major developments and decisions likely to interest the Board of Directors. The Board believes that this leadership structure is appropriate given Mr. Frist III's experience, historical association with HCA and his significant ownership stake. The Board believes that this leadership structure improves the Board's ability to focus on key policy and operational issues and helps the Company operate in the long-term interests of stockholders. 
Consistent with our commitment to good governance, and as further described above, non-management directors meet at regularly scheduled executive sessions, which typically occur at regularly scheduled Board meetings, without any member of management present. In addition, at least annually the independent directors meet in separate executive session. Our Board believes its current leadership structure effectively allocates authority, responsibility, and oversight between management and the non-management and independent members of our Board. It gives primary responsibility for the operational leadership and strategic direction of the Company to our CEO, while the Chairman, coupled with strong independent director leadership in the form of an independent presiding director, facilitates our Board's independent oversight of management, promotes communication between management and our Board, engages with stockholders and leads our Board's consideration of key governance matters. We plan to continue to examine our corporate governance policies and leadership structure on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet the Company's needs. 
Board's Role in Risk Oversight.  Risk is inherent with every business. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risks the Company faces, while the Board of Directors, as a whole and through its committees, has responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In its risk oversight role, the Board of Directors has the responsibility to satisfy itself that the risk management processes designed and implemented by management are adequate and functioning as designed. Our Board of Directors oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management, designed to support the achievement of organizational objectives, including strategic objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and enhance stockholder value. A fundamental aspect of risk management is not only understanding the risks a company faces and what steps management is taking to manage those risks, but also understanding what level of risk is appropriate for a company. The involvement of the full Board of Directors in setting our business strategy is a key part of its assessment of management's appetite for risk and also a determination of what constitutes an appropriate level of risk for the Company. 
We conduct an annual enterprise risk management assessment, which is facilitated by our enterprise risk management team in collaboration with our internal auditors. The senior internal audit executive officer reports to the Chief Executive Officer and to the Audit and Compliance Committee in this capacity. In this process, we assess risk throughout the Company by conducting surveys and interviews of our employees and directors, soliciting information regarding business risks that could significantly adversely affect the Company, including the achievement of its strategic plan. We then identify any controls or initiatives in place to mitigate any material risk and the effectiveness of any such controls or initiatives. The enterprise risk management team annually prepares a report for senior management and, ultimately, the Board of Directors regarding the key identified risks and how we manage these risks both on an annual and ongoing basis. Members of senior management attend the quarterly Board meetings, as appropriate, and are available to address any questions or   concerns raised by the Board regarding risk management and any other matters. Additionally, each quarter, the Board of Directors receives presentations from senior management on strategic matters involving our operations. 
While the Board of Directors has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk. In particular, the Audit and Compliance Committee focuses on financial and enterprise risk exposures, including internal controls, and discusses with management, the senior internal audit executive officer, the senior chief ethics and compliance officer and the independent registered public accounting firm, our policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management. The Audit and Compliance Committee also assists the Board in fulfilling its duties and oversight responsibilities relating to the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the Company Code of Conduct and related Company policies and procedures, including the Corporate Ethics and Compliance Program. The Compensation Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the management of risks arising from our compensation policies and programs, as described below under "Executive Compensation — Compensation Risk Assessment." The Patient Safety and Quality of Care Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibility with respect to our policies and procedures relating to patient safety and the delivery of quality medical care to our patients. The Finance and Investments Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibility with respect to the Company's financial structure, investment policies and objectives and other matters of a financial and investment nature. 
Board Meetings and Director Attendance. During 2018, our Board of Directors held 11 meetings. All directors attended at least 75% of the Board meetings and meetings of the committees of the Board on which the director served, held during the period for which he or she served as a director. Our policy is to strongly encourage directors to attend the Company's annual stockholder meetings. Our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders was attended by all directors in service at such time. 
Board Committees.  Our Board of Directors currently has five standing committees: the Audit and Compliance Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Finance and Investments Committee, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Patient Safety and Quality of Care Committee. The Board of Directors receives recommendations from the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee regarding committee composition and determines the members of each committee. The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent as defined in the NYSE listing standards and in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Board of Directors has adopted a written charter for each of these committees. All committee charters are available on the Corporate Governance portion of our website located at www.hcahealthcare.com.  The chart below reflects the current composition of the standing committees.

Compensation Committee.  Our Compensation Committee is composed of Meg G. Crofton, Charles O. Holliday, Jr. (Chair), Ann H. Lamont and Geoffrey G. Meyers. Effective at the annual meeting, Ann H. Lamont will step down from the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. Our Board of Directors has affirmatively determined that each member of the Compensation Committee meets the definition of "independent director" for purposes of the NYSE rules, the definition of "outside director" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, and the definition of "non-employee director" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.

[END TABLE]
In addition, the Compensation Committee considers the proper alignment of executive pay policies with Company values and strategy by overseeing employee compensation policies, corporate performance measurement and assessment, and Chief Executive Officer performance assessment. 
The Compensation Committee may retain the services of independent outside consultants, as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, to assist in the strategic review of programs and arrangements relating to executive compensation and performance. In 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy Consulting Group, LLC ("Semler Brossy") to assist in conducting an assessment of competitive executive and director compensation. Semler Brossy is retained by, and reports directly to, the Compensation Committee. As required under the NYSE listing rules, the Compensation Committee has considered and assessed all factors relevant to Semler Brossy's independence from management, including but not limited to those set forth in Section 303A.05(c)(iv) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, as applicable. Based on this review, the Compensation Committee is not aware of any conflict of interest that has been raised by work performed by Semler Brossy. A consultant from Semler Brossy attends most of the Compensation Committee meetings and supports the Compensation Committee's role by providing independent expertise and advice. Semler Brossy's main responsibilities are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Review and advise on the Company's executive compensation programs, including base salaries, short- and long-term  incentives, and other benefits, if any;

• Prepare director pay assessment; and  
• Advise on current trends in compensation, including design and pay levels.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee may consider recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer and compensation consultants, among other factors, in making its compensation determinations.

Our stockholder and investor outreach typically includes investor road shows, analyst meetings, and investor conferences. We also hold conference calls for our quarterly earnings releases which are available in real time and as archived webcasts on our website. 
In the latter part of 2018, our non-management and independent presiding director and Compensation Committee Chair and members of management extended invitations to meet to approximately 20 of our largest stockholders (excluding Hercules Holding II) representing approximately 40 percent of our common stock. The resulting discussions focused primarily on the Company's board leadership, compensation philosophy, and corporate governance practices, including the transition to a new chief executive officer effective January 1, 2019. In connection with these outreach efforts, we generally found that the stockholders with whom we had an opportunity to engage were comfortable with our leadership and compensation and governance practices.  Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability.  The Company is committed to being a responsible and concerned citizen of all communities where it operates and is driven by its mission statement: Above all else, we are committed to the care and improvement of human life. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Patient-centered care – During 2018, we had approximately 30 million patient encounters, which included  approximately 8.8 million emergency room visits and over 200,000 baby deliveries. We believe our scale enables us to deliver quality outcomes for our patients, such as advancing the understanding for improving the health of newborns, reducing  healthcare-associated infections and detecting sepsis earlier and more accurately.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equity of care – We believe exceptional health care is built on a foundation of inclusion, compassion, dignity  and respect. It recognizes the diverse cultures and backgrounds of our patients, physicians and employees. Through our affiliates, we delivered health care services in approximately 160 languages and dialects. We strive to provide culturally  competent care to every patient we serve and foster a culture of inclusion that embraces and nurtures our patients, colleagues, partners, physicians and communities.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Clinical excellence – The Company values its role as a learning health system that seeks to harness the power  of health data to support knowledge generation and tools to support safe, effective, efficient and compassionate care. The Company also strives to advance medical knowledge and foster innovation through partnerships with top academic institutions  and government health agencies. These efforts include large-scale trials employing "practice-based research" intended to advance clinical knowledge faster than traditional randomized controlled trials.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Giving back – In many of the communities in which we operate, the Company's facilities play an essential  role in providing critical health care services to its patients.

Director Compensation.  The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations to the Board regarding all matters pertaining to compensation paid to directors for Board, committee and committee chair services. Under the Compensation Committee's charter, the Compensation Committee is authorized to engage consultants or advisors in connection with its review and analysis of director compensation. Directors who also serve as employees of the Company do not receive payment for services as directors. 
In making director compensation recommendations, the Compensation Committee takes various factors into consideration, including, but not limited to, the responsibilities of directors generally and the forms of compensation paid to directors by comparable companies. In 2018, the Compensation Committee retained Semler Brossy to assist in conducting an assessment of competitive executive and director compensation. The Board reviews the recommendations of the Compensation Committee and determines the form and amount of director compensation. 
The following text and table discuss the compensation of persons who served as a member of the Board during all or part of 2018, other than Messrs. Hazen and Johnson whose compensation is discussed under "Executive Compensation" below. Messrs. Hazen and Johnson were not separately compensated for Board service during 2018. We have omitted from this table the columns pertaining to non-equity incentive plan compensation, option awards, nonqualified deferred compensation and all other compensation, because they are inapplicable. 
Cash Compensation. Pursuant to the Company's Board of Directors Compensation program, each non-management director receives quarterly payment of the following cash compensation, as applicable (prorated for partial years):

Equity Compensation. In addition to the director compensation described above, each non-management director receives an annual board equity award with a value of $175,000, awarded upon joining the Board of Directors (prorated for months of service) and at each annual meeting of the stockholders thereafter. These equity grants consist of restricted share units ultimately payable in shares of our common stock and vest as to 100% of the award on the sooner of the date of the Company's next annual stockholders' meeting or the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the director's continued service on our Board of Directors. The restricted share units will also immediately vest upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (as defined in the applicable grant agreement). The directors may elect to defer receipt of shares under the restricted share units until the date they cease to be members of the Board of Directors. 
Reimbursements. All of our directors are reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with their service. 
Share Ownership. Each non-management director is expected to directly or indirectly acquire a number of shares of our common stock with a value of five times the value of the annual cash retainer for a director's service on the Board of Directors within three years from the date on which they are elected to the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2018, all of our directors with more than three years of service met these share ownership guidelines. 
Fiscal 2018 Director Compensation

  (1)  This column reflects the grant date fair value of restricted share unit awards granted to directors calculated in  accordance with applicable financial accounting standards. The fair value of restricted share unit awards is computed by multiplying the total number of shares subject to the award by the closing market price of the Company's common stock on  the date of grant.

 PROPOSAL 1 — ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The current Board of Directors of HCA consists of 13 directors. However, Mr. Johnson and Ms. Lamont are stepping down from the Board of Directors and will not be seeking re-election. Accordingly, the size of the Board of Directors will be reduced to 11 directors effective at the annual meeting. Our Board of Directors recommends that the nominees listed below be elected as members of the Board of Directors at the annual meeting. 
Each of the nominees, if elected, will serve a one-year term as a director until the annual meeting of stockholders in 2020 or until his or her respective successor is duly elected and qualified or until the earlier of his or her death, resignation or removal. If a nominee becomes unable or unwilling to accept nomination or election, the person or persons voting the proxy will vote for such other person or persons as may be designated by the Board of Directors, unless the Board of Directors chooses to reduce the number of directors serving on the Board. The Board of Directors has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve as a director if elected. 
The following are the nominee directors to be elected to serve on our Board of Directors, each of whom is currently a member of our Board of Directors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 John W. Rowe, M.D.     74   2014   Director 
 John W. Rowe, M.D.     74   2014   Director 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  As of March 7, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
The election of directors will be determined by a majority of the votes cast at the annual meeting. A majority of the votes cast means that the number of shares voted "for" a nominee exceeds the number of shares voted "against" such nominee. Abstentions and broker non-votes are not counted as votes cast with respect to a nominee and will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. For incumbent directors, if a nominee fails to receive "for" votes representing a majority of the votes cast, the director shall tender his or her resignation to the secretary of HCA for consideration by the Board of Directors, which resignation shall be contingent upon the acceptance thereof by the Board of Directors. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee would then be charged with making a recommendation to the Board of Directors for the action to be taken with respect to the resignation. The Board of Directors will act on the tendered resignation and publicly disclose its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind its decision. If the Board determines not to accept the resignation of the incumbent director, the incumbent director will continue to serve until the next annual meeting and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier death, resignation or removal. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES.  PROPOSAL 2 — RATIFICATION OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT 
REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit and Compliance Committee has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. Services provided to the Company and its subsidiaries by Ernst & Young LLP in fiscal 2018 are described below and under "Audit and Compliance Committee Report" located on page 87 of this proxy statement. 
Audit Fees.  The aggregate audit fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered for the audit of our annual consolidated financial statements, for the reviews of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, for the audit of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting, under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and services that are normally provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in connection with statutory and regulatory filings totaled $10.0 million for 2018 and $9.4 million for 2017. 
Audit-Related Fees.  The aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for assurance and related services not described above under "Audit Fees" were $2.3 million for 2018 and $2.1 million for 2017. Audit-related services principally include audits of certain of our subsidiaries, benefit plans and computer processing controls. 
Tax Fees.  The aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for professional services rendered for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning were $4.2 million for 2018 and $3.1 million for 2017. 
All Other Fees.  There were no fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP for products or services other than those described above in 2018 or 2017. 
The Board of Directors has adopted an Audit and Compliance Committee Charter which, among other things, requires the Audit and Compliance Committee to preapprove all audit and permitted nonaudit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the ability to delegate authority to a subcommittee for certain preapprovals. 
All services performed for us by Ernst & Young LLP in 2018 were preapproved by the Audit and Compliance Committee. The Audit and Compliance Committee concluded that the provision of audit-related services and tax services by Ernst & Young LLP was compatible with the maintenance of the firm's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions. 
Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP will be present at the annual meeting. They will have the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and we expect that they will be available to respond to questions. 
Ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP requires affirmative votes from the holders of a majority of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the annual meeting and entitled to vote. If the Company's stockholders do not ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit and Compliance Committee will reconsider the appointment and may affirm the appointment or retain another independent accounting firm. Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit and Compliance Committee may in the future replace Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm if it is determined that it is in the Company's best interests to do so. 
THE AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE AND THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP AS THE INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM OF THE COMPANY FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL 3 — ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires that we provide our stockholders with the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the compensation disclosure rules of the SEC. As described below in the "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has structured our executive compensation program to achieve the following key objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforce HCA's strategic initiatives;  
• Align the economic interests of our executives with those of our stockholders; and  
• Encourage attraction and long-term retention of key contributors.  
[END TABLE]
We urge stockholders to read the "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement beginning on page 38 of this proxy statement, which describes in more detail how our executive compensation policies and procedures operate and are designed to achieve our compensation objectives, as well as the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and other related compensation tables and narrative, appearing on pages 63 through 82, which provide detailed information on the compensation of our named executive officers. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors believe that the policies and procedures articulated in the "Executive Compensation — Compensation Discussion and Analysis" section of this proxy statement are effective in achieving our compensation objectives and contribute to the Company's performance. 
In accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act, we are asking stockholders to approve the following advisory resolution at the 2019 annual meeting of stockholders: 
RESOLVED, that the stockholders of the Company approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company's Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion, as set forth in the Company's 2019 Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A. 
This advisory resolution, commonly referred to as a "say-on-pay" resolution, is non-binding on the Company, the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committee. The say-on-pay proposal is not intended to address any specific item of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the executive compensation policies, practices, and plans described in this proxy statement. Although non-binding, the Compensation Committee will carefully review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding our executive compensation program. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE ADVISORY "SAY-ON-PAY" RESOLUTION TO APPROVE OUR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.  PROPOSAL 4 — APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. TO ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED THEREIN 
We are asking that stockholders approve amendments to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation") to eliminate the supermajority voting requirements contained therein. 
After careful consideration and upon the recommendation of the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board voted to approve, and to recommend to our stockholders that they approve, amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws (the "Bylaws") to remove supermajority voting standards required for our common stock currently in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws and to replace them with majority voting standards, as described below. In evaluating the current voting requirements, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board considered, among other matters, certain of the principal positions for and against the current voting standards imposed by our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws and reviewed trends and best practices in corporate governance, as well as the corporate governance practices and policies of a number of other corporations. Supermajority voting requirements like those contained in our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws are intended to facilitate corporate governance stability and provide protection against self-interested action by large stockholders by requiring broad stockholder consensus to make certain fundamental changes. However, while such protection can be beneficial to stockholders, the Board is aware that some stockholders and commentators oppose these provisions, viewing supermajority provisions as limiting the Board's accountability to stockholders and the ability of stockholders to participate in corporate governance. 
Currently, Article VI, Section 6 of our Certificate of Incorporation provides that certain amendments, alterations, changes, additions or repeals of our Bylaws require the affirmative vote of shares representing at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote on such amendments, alterations, changes, additions or repeals. 
Article XI of our Certificate of Incorporation provides that any amendment, or repeal of, or the adoption of any bylaw inconsistent with any of the provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation listed below, must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. The provisions covered by this supermajority voting requirement are in regards to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the "purpose" and duration of the Company (Article III and Article V, respectively);  
• matters relating to the Board, including authority to fix the size of the Board and the minimum number of directors,  authority to fill director vacancies and newly created directorships and authority to amend our Bylaws (Article VI);  
• the limitation of director liability and the indemnification of directors and officers of the Company (Article VII and  Article VIII, respectively);  
• the right of stockholders to call special meetings and stockholder action by written consent (Article IX);   
• the "Corporate Opportunities" doctrine (Article X); and  
• provisions related to the amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation (Article XI).  
[END TABLE]
Article VII of our Bylaws provides that certain amendments, alterations, changes, additions or repeals of our Bylaws must be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of   at least a seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote on such amendments, alterations, changes, additions or repeals. 
If this Proposal 4 is approved by a sufficient number of stockholders, only a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote on the matter would be required to approve (i) any future amendment, alteration, change, addition or repeal of our Bylaws by the stockholders and (ii) the adoption of any provision, whether in our Certificate of Incorporation or in our Bylaws, inconsistent with, or the amendment or repeal of any provision of, our Certificate of Incorporation. The summary of the proposed amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws set forth above is qualified in its entirety by the text of the proposed amendments, which are attached as Appendix A to this Proxy Statement. Additions of text to our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws contained in Appendix A are indicated by underlining and deletions of text are struck through. 
Vote Required.  This Proposal 4 to approve amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation to eliminate the supermajority voting requirements contained therein will be approved if it receives affirmative votes from the holders of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the voting power of all outstanding shares of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. If such approval is obtained, the amendment to our Bylaws described above, which has been conditionally adopted by our Board, will become immediately effective, and we would file promptly with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation following the 2019 Annual Meeting. If such approval is not obtained, our Certificate of Incorporation and our Bylaws will not be amended. 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT YOU VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF AMENDMENTS TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF HCA HEALTHCARE, INC. TO ELIMINATE THE SUPERMAJORITY VOTING REQUIREMENTS CONTAINED THEREIN.  OTHER MATTERS 
We are not aware of any matters other than those discussed in the foregoing materials contemplated for action at the annual meeting. The persons named in the Proxy Card will vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Board of Directors on any other matters incidental to the conduct of, or otherwise properly brought before, the annual meeting. The Proxy Card contains discretionary authority for them to do so.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
COMPENSATION RISK ASSESSMENT 
In consultation with the Compensation Committee (the "Committee") of the Board of Directors, members of Human Resources, Financial Reporting, Legal, Enterprise Risk Management and Internal Audit conducted an assessment of whether the Company's compensation policies and practices encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking by our employees, including our named executive officers. This assessment included a review of the risk characteristics of our business and the design of our incentive plans and policies. Although a significant portion of our executive compensation program is performance-based, the Committee has focused on aligning the Company's compensation policies with the long-term interests of the Company and avoiding rewards or incentive structures that could create unnecessary risks to the Company. 
Management reported its findings to the Committee, and the Committee agreed with management's assessment that our plans and policies do not encourage excessive or inappropriate risk taking and determined such policies or practices are not reasonably likely to have a material, adverse effect on the Company. 
COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS  
Named Executive Officers.  The following executive compensation discussion and analysis describes the principles underlying our executive compensation policies and decisions as well as the material elements of compensation for our named executive officers. Our named executive officers for 2018 were: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• R. Milton Johnson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• William B. Rutherford, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Samuel N. Hazen, President and Chief Operating Officer;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Jon M. Foster, President — American Group; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Charles J. Hall, President — National Group.  
[END TABLE]
Effective December 31, 2018, Mr. Johnson retired as Chief Executive Officer but retained the role of Chairman, and effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Hazen was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Elements of the new compensation arrangements and employment agreements implemented in connection with this leadership transition are discussed in the relevant sections below. 
Compensation Philosophy and Objectives.  The core philosophy of our executive compensation program is to support the Company's primary objective of providing the highest quality health care to our patients while enhancing the long-term value of the Company to our stockholders. Specifically, the Committee believes the most effective executive compensation program (for all executives, including named executive officers): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Reinforces the Company's strategic initiatives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Aligns the economic interests of our executives with those of our stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Encourages attraction and long-term retention of key contributors.  
[END TABLE]
 The Committee is committed to a strong, positive link between our business objectives and performance and our executive compensation and benefits practices. 
Our compensation philosophy also allows for flexibility in establishing executive compensation based on an evaluation of information prepared by management or other advisors and other subjective and objective considerations deemed appropriate by the Committee, subject to any contractual agreements with our executives. The Committee will also consider the recommendations of our Chief Executive Officer for executives other than himself. This flexibility is important to ensure our compensation programs are competitive and our compensation decisions appropriately reflect the unique contributions and characteristics of our executives. 
2018 Performance Highlights

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
Impact of Performance on 2018 Compensation.  Our compensation philosophy, which is described in more detail herein, is centered around creating a strong link between the performance of business objectives and the value of compensation. The compensation of our named executive officers in 2018 was directly impacted by our financial performance, quality objectives, and stockholder return as detailed below.  
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial    80% of 2018 annual Senior Officer Performance Excellence Program ("PEP") incentive awards were based on achieving a targeted level of EBITDA. Vesting for performance share units granted in 2018 are based on achievement  of a cumulative earnings per share ("EPS") goal for fiscal years 2018 – 2020. 
 Quality/Patient Care    20% of 2018 annual PEP incentive awards were based on Company performance against industry patient care and quality benchmarks. 
 Stockholder Return    50% of annual equity grants made in 2018 were in the form of stock appreciation rights designed to reward executives for future growth in stockholder value. 
[END TABLE]
The Company had strong financial and quality performance for 2018, and our results exceeded the targets established for EBITDA and quality-based metrics established for the year, which were designed to drive a strong pay for performance culture. In addition, the Company's cumulative financial performance for fiscal years 2016 – 2018 exceeded the EPS-based targets established for the three-year period, which were designed to reward long-term Company performance. As a result, annual incentive payouts for the named executive officers under the 2018 PEP were paid at 168.15% to 172.56% of target. Participants also earned 122.25% of the performance share units granted in 2016 tied to 2016 – 2018 cumulative EPS performance. 
2018 "Say-on-Pay" Advisory Vote.  The Company provided stockholders a "say-on-pay" advisory vote on its executive compensation in 2018, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. At our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders expressed substantial support for the compensation of our named executive officers, with approximately 91% of the votes cast for approval of the "say-on-pay" advisory vote on executive compensation. The Committee evaluated the results of the 2018 advisory vote and considered many other factors in evaluating the Company's executive compensation programs as discussed in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis. While each of these factors influenced the Committee's decisions regarding our named executive officers' compensation, in light of the substantial support expressed by our stockholders for our compensation program, the Committee did not make any changes to our executive compensation program and policies as a direct result of the 2018 "say-on-pay" advisory vote. 
Stockholder Engagement.  The Company engages with stockholders and solicits feedback on a regular basis with respect to a broad range of topics, including performance, strategy, corporate governance and executive compensation related matters. 
In the latter part of 2018, our non-management and independent presiding director and Compensation Committee Chair and members of management extended invitations to meet to approximately 20 of our largest stockholders (excluding Hercules Holding II) representing approximately 40 percent of our common stock. The resulting discussions focused primarily on the Company's board leadership, compensation philosophy, and corporate governance practices, including the transition to a new chief executive officer effective January 1, 2019. In connection with these outreach efforts, we generally found that the stockholders with whom we had an opportunity to engage were comfortable with our leadership and compensation and governance practices.  Key Compensation Practices and Policies 
The Company has adopted the following key programs, policies and practices to respond to evolving good governance practices in executive compensation and enhance the alignment of our executive compensation programs and stockholder interests: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Restrictions on Hedging and Pledging  Transactions:  Executive officers, directors and other Company insiders are restricted from (i) engaging in hedging transactions designed to reduce or limit economic risk with respect to such  individual's interest in Company securities and (ii) pledging Company securities as collateral for margin or other loans.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Performance-Based Long-Term Incentive Programs:  Since  2015, the Company has granted performance share unit ("PSU") awards which vest based on achievement of a three-year cumulative EPS goal, in addition to time-based stock settled stock appreciation right ("SAR") awards.     
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Policies that Discourage Short-Term Risk  Taking:  Annual incentive payouts under the PEP are subject to clawback if there are any financial restatements or inaccuracies later found in program metrics. Executive officers, directors and other  Company insiders are also restricted from engaging in transactions in which such individuals may profit from short-term speculative swings in the value of Company securities.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Double-Trigger Change in Control Provisions:  All SAR  and PSU awards granted since 2015 are subject to a "double-trigger" for accelerated vesting under certain change in control scenarios.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· No Tax Gross-Ups on Perquisites:  The Company does not provide any gross-up payments to our named executive officers to cover the taxes due on perquisite related income.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· No Excise Tax Gross-Ups on Change in Control  Payments:  In 2016, the Company amended the legacy employment agreements in place with its executive officers to remove provisions that could be interpreted to permit the payment of an excise tax gross-up on benefits received in connection with a change in control of the Company.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Share Ownership Guidelines:  The Company's share  ownership guidelines provide that our Chief Executive Officer should hold Company equity valued at least five times his base salary, and our other named executive officers should hold equity valued at least three times their respective base salaries  within five years of appointment to their position.    
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
· Policies that Reinforce the Company's Mission and  Values:  Annual incentive payouts under the PEP are subject to a certification by the CEO that the participant has acted in accordance with the Company's stated mission and values, the Code of Conduct  and other regulatory requirements. Further, all employees are required to complete annual Code of Conduct training to continue to receive their salary and benefits.    
[END TABLE]
 Overview of Executive Compensation Programs.  The Committee is generally charged with the oversight of our executive compensation and rewards programs. The Committee is currently composed of Meg G.

[END TABLE]
In addition, the Committee considers the proper alignment of executive pay policies with Company values and strategy by overseeing executive compensation policies, corporate performance measurement and assessment, and Chief Executive Officer performance assessment. 
The Committee may retain the services of independent outside consultants, as it deems appropriate in its sole discretion, to assist in the strategic review of programs and arrangements relating to executive compensation and performance. The Committee has retained Semler Brossy as its external advisor. The Committee considers advice and analysis presented by Semler Brossy in making decisions on compensation plan designs and compensation decisions for the executive officers and directors. As required under the NYSE listing rules, the Committee has considered and assessed all factors relevant to Semler Brossy's independence from management, including, but not limited to, those set forth in Section 303A.05(c)(iv) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, as applicable. Based on this review, the Committee is not aware of any conflict of interest that has been raised in connection with work performed by Semler Brossy.  Elements of Compensation 
Our compensation program is heavily weighted towards performance-based compensation, reflecting our philosophy of increasing the long-term value of the Company and supporting strategic imperatives. The following table summarizes the elements of our total compensation program for the named executive officers and provides the reasons these elements are included in the program: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
 Consistent with the Committee's commitment to a strong, positive link between our business objectives, our performance and our executive compensation practices, we have placed a significant emphasis on pay "at risk," based on the achievement of financial performance, quality patient care and the performance of our stock. The following charts illustrate that 93% of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer's total direct compensation and 85% of the other named executive officers' average total direct compensation for 2018 was performance-based pay, with a significant emphasis on long-term performance and stockholder value creation. For the purposes of these charts, total direct compensation includes salary, actual annual incentive payouts, and the grant date fair value of our annual equity grants made in 2018, as reported in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table (and excludes benefits and other compensation). 
Peer Group Market Data.  Our Human Resources team, in collaboration with Semler Brossy, collects and presents to the Committee compensation data from similarly-sized general industry companies, to the extent that comparable position matches and components of pay are available. The following nationally recognized survey sources were utilized in anticipation of establishing 2018 executive compensation: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Survey    Revenue Scope 
 Willis Towers Watson Executive Compensation Database    Greater than $20B     
 Hewitt Total Compensation Measurement    Greater than $25B     
[END TABLE]
These particular revenue scopes were selected because they were the closest approximations to HCA's revenue size. Each survey that provided an appropriate position match and sufficient sample size was utilized in the analysis.  Compensation data for top executive positions was also collected and reviewed for large public health care companies by Semler Brossy. These companies included, in addition to health care providers, companies in the health insurance, pharmaceutical, medical supply and related industries. This peer group's 2017 revenues ranged from $11.4 billion to $165.9 billion, with median revenues of $38.9 billion, which is comparable to our size. The companies in this analysis included:

Due to their size, LifePoint Hospitals, Inc. and Universal Health Services, Inc. are used only to obtain a general understanding of current industry compensation levels and practices. The 2017 median revenue of these four organizations was $14.3 billion. 
Consistent with our compensation philosophy, the Committee considers the market findings as only one input in developing our executive compensation programs, and will also consider, among other factors (typically not reflected in these data sources): the executive's individual performance during the year, his or her projected role and responsibilities for the coming year, his or her actual and potential impact on the successful execution of Company strategy, recommendations from our Chief Executive Officer (for executives other than himself) and the independent compensation consultant, the executive's prior compensation, experience, and professional status, internal pay equity considerations, and employment market conditions and compensation practices within our peer group. These factors are considered on a case-by-case basis for each executive without any specific weighting or formula.  Elements of Compensation – Base Salary 
Base salaries are intended to provide reasonable and competitive fixed compensation for regular job duties. We do not adjust salaries for all executive officers on an annual basis, but rather make changes based on changes in responsibilities, market pay practices, internal equity and other factors as discussed above on a case-by-case basis. Salaries for our named executive officers were adjusted for 2018 based on individual performance.

Elements of Compensation – Annual Incentive Compensation: PEP  
The PEP is intended to reward named executive officers for annual financial and quality performance, with the goals of providing high quality health care for our patients and increasing stockholder value. Accordingly, the Company's 2018 Senior Officer Performance Excellence Program (the "2018 PEP") was approved by the Committee to cover annual incentive awards for 2018. Each named executive officer in the 2018 PEP was assigned a 2018 annual award target expressed as a percentage of salary ranging from 85% to 170%. Incentive opportunity targets were intended to provide a meaningful incentive for executives to achieve or exceed performance goals and be competitive with market practices.

 Jon M. Foster   85%   85% 
 Charles J.  Hall   85%   85% 
[END TABLE]
 Actual awards under the 2018 PEP are generally determined using the following steps: 
1. The executive's conduct must reflect our mission and values by upholding our Code of Conduct and following our compliance policies and procedures. This step is critical to reinforcing our commitment to integrity and the delivery of high quality health care. In the event the Committee determines the participant's conduct during the fiscal year is not in compliance with the first step, he or she will not be eligible for an incentive award. 
2. The actual award amount is determined based upon Company performance on financial and quality performance measures. In 2018, 80% of the PEP award for all named executive officers was based upon one financial performance measure, EBITDA, as defined in the 2018 PEP, and 20% of the PEP award was based upon the Company's quality and patient experience performance, with a focus on CMS core measures, hospital acquired infections, and inpatient and emergency room patient experience performance against industry benchmarks. For hospital group presidents, 50% of the EBITDA portion of their 2018 PEP was based on Company EBITDA performance and 50% was based on the applicable group EBITDA performance. 
PEP – EBITDA Measure (80% of 2018 PEP) 
The 2018 PEP was designed to provide 100% of the EBITDA weighted portion of the target award for target EBITDA performance, 25% of the EBITDA weighted portion of the target award for threshold level of EBITDA performance, and a maximum of 200% of the EBITDA weighted portion of the target award for maximum EBITDA performance, with no payments made for performance below threshold levels. The Committee believes this payout curve is consistent with competitive practice. 
EBITDA is defined in the 2018 PEP as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, gains or losses on sales of facilities, gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, legal claim costs (benefit), asset or investment impairment charges, restructuring charges, any expenses for share-based compensation under Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 718, and any other gains or charges resulting from significant, unusual and/or nonrecurring events, as described in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual report for the fiscal year, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or the Committee in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer. 
Our 2018 threshold EBITDA performance level was set at 5% below the target goal and the maximum performance goal was set at 5% above the target goal to reflect potential performance volatility. EBITDA targets were linked to the Company's short-term and long-term business objectives to ensure incentives are provided for appropriate annual growth. 
PEP – Quality Measures (20% of 2018 PEP) 
The quality weighted portion of the 2018 PEP was based on the Company's performance on each of the following three quality and patient experience metrics as measured against industry benchmarks: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Healthcare-Associated Infections: Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI), Catheter-Associated Urinary  Tract Infection (CAUTI), Surgical Site Infections (SSI), Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) and Clostridium  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
    difficile (C. diff), in the entire patient population, as defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Healthcare Safety Network (CDC – NHSN).   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Core Measures: Measured as a composite of the inpatient and outpatient core measures for Influenza Immunization (IMM-2), Early Elective Delivery (PC-01) and Hospital Acquired Potentially Preventable Venous Thromboembolism (VTE-6) as developed by  The Joint Commission and CMS and set forth in the Specifications Manual for National Hospital Inpatient Quality Measures.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Patient Experience: For inpatients, measured by the CMS HCAHPS overall rating top box score (defined as response of nine or  ten on the CMS HCAHPS survey). For emergency room patients, measured by the Press Ganey Emergency Room overall rating top box score (defined as response of Very Good on the Patient Experience Emergency Room survey).  
[END TABLE]
The 2018 PEP was designed to provide 100% of the quality weighted portion of the target award applicable to each quality of care metric for performance at or above the target level of performance for such metric and 0% of the quality weighted portion of the target award applicable to each quality of care metric for performance at or below the threshold level of performance for such metric; provided, that, (i) if the Company exceeded the target level of EBITDA adopted by the Committee with respect to the EBITDA weighted portion of the 2018 PEP, the quality weighted portion of the target award would be multiplied by the EBITDA payout percentage and (ii) in the event the Company's actual EBITDA was less than 90% of such target level of EBITDA, there would be no payment with respect to the quality weighted portion of the 2018 PEP. The Committee set challenging performance targets for the 2018 PEP quality metrics to encourage continuous improvement. 
PEP – 2018 Performance and Payout 
Upon review of the Company's 2018 financial performance, the Committee determined that Company EBITDA performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 for purposes of the 2018 PEP was 104.00% of target performance levels as set by the Committee, as adjusted, resulting in a 180.02% of target payout for the Company EBITDA portion of the 2018 PEP. The EBITDA performance of the National Group was 103.82% of the performance target, as adjusted, resulting in a 176.41% of target payout for the National Group for the group-based EBITDA portion of 2018 PEP. The EBITDA performance of the American Group was 104.37% of the performance target, as adjusted, resulting in a 187.42% of target payout for the American Group for the group-based EBITDA portion of 2018 PEP. 
In 2018, EBITDA performance for purposes of the 2018 PEP was adjusted to exclude unbudgeted acquisitions. The Committee also adjusted 2018 EBITDA performance for purposes of the 2018 PEP to exclude the impact on the Company's EBITDA performance resulting from Hurricane Michael's impact on our Florida panhandle facilities in October 2018 and an insurance recovery during 2018 related to Hurricane Harvey business interruption losses incurred during 2017. This was consistent with the Committee's view that in general, management's performance for such purposes should be measured against operational results, subject to adjustment in appropriate circumstances for unusual or extraordinary events or performance and the terms of the 2018 PEP which permit adjustment for significant, unusual and/or nonrecurring events that are described in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the Company's annual report for the fiscal year. For purposes of the 2018 PEP, the adjustment for the effects of Hurricane Michael increased 2018 Company EBITDA performance by approximately $31 million and 2018 National   Group EBITDA performance by approximately $30 million. The adjustment for the insurance recovery related to Hurricane Harvey business interruption losses decreased 2018 Company EBITDA performance by approximately $49 million.

[END TABLE]
These EBITDA targets should not be considered as management's predictions of future performance or other guidance and investors should not apply these in any other context. 
Upon review of the Company's 2018 quality measures performance, the Committee determined that Company quality measures for Healthcare-Associated Infections for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded the target level for the CLASBI, CAUTI, SSI, MRSA and C. diff. In addition, the Committee determined that the Company quality measures for Core Measures performance for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 exceeded the target level for IMM-2, PC-01 and VTE-6. The HCAHPS Overall Rating for inpatient experience and the Press Ganey Emergency Room Patient Overall Rating for emergency room patients exceeded the threshold level but did not reach the target level for Patient Experience measures, resulting in 63.07% and 67.60%, respectively, of target payout for the Patient Experience weighted portion of 2018 PEP. The Company's performance on the quality measures was determined based upon the most current data available to the Committee from applicable sources at the time of 2018 PEP certification. In the event the Company acquires or opens new facilities during the measurement period, the newly opened or acquired facilities will be excluded for purposes of calculating the Company's performance on the quality weighted measures.

Elements of Compensation – Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards  
Equity grants made under our long-term incentive compensation programs are intended to align the interests of executives and stockholders by rewarding executives for long-term growth in stockholder value. These programs also serve as a key component of the executives' compensation packages in attracting and retaining top talent. Lastly, these programs encourage share ownership. Grants are made under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan for Key Employees of HCA Holdings, Inc. and its Affiliates, as Amended and Restated ("Stock Incentive Plan"). 
Since 2015, the annual long-term equity incentive awards awarded to the Company's executive officers have included PSUs, which vest upon achievement of a three-year cumulative EPS goal, in addition to time vesting stock settled SAR awards. Specifically, the named executive officers' 2018 annual equity awards were structured with 1/2 of the target award value granted in the form of time-based SARs, and the other 1/2 of the target award value granted in the form of PSUs which vest based on achievement of a cumulative three-year EPS goal.  The Committee determined the number of shares underlying the equity grants awarded to the named executive officers in 2018 based on a combination of the following considerations: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Market practices;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Historical performance and any recent adjustment in job scope; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Future projected contributions of the named executive officers.  
[END TABLE]
Stock Appreciation Rights 
The Committee determined that SARs are an effective long-term incentive vehicle for this population because: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SARs only reward executives for stock price appreciation;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• SARs are more efficient than stock options in terms of utilizing the stockholder approved management equity pool; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In conjunction with the vesting requirements, the grants encourage both short-term and long-term Company performance.   
[END TABLE]
The SARs granted in 2018 have a ten-year term and were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common shares on the date of grant (January 31, 2018) (the "2018 SARs"). The 2018 SARs are structured such that 25% of the SARs will vest on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date. The Committee used the Company's six-month average stock price as of December 31, 2018 and a valuation model estimation to determine the number of SARs granted.

For additional information concerning the 2018 SARs, see the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End Table.  Performance Share Units 
The Committee determined that PSUs are consistent with market best practices for executive pay and appropriately reward our executives for long-term Company performance. PSUs vest based on achievement of a cumulative three-year EPS (as defined in the respective PSU award agreement) goal ("Target EPS") as set forth in the schedule below, with vesting related to performance between 80% and 120% of Target EPS determined by straight line interpolation. The Committee sets challenging Target EPS goals to link the awards to the Company's long-term business objectives and provide meaningful incentives for achieving or exceeding the Company's performance growth objectives. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Cumulative EPS for Applicable Three-Year Performance Period     Percentage of Target PSUs Earned

 80% of Target EPS      25% 
 Less than 80% of Target EPS        0% 
[END TABLE]
Cumulative EPS is defined for purposes of the PSUs as the sum of the Company's "diluted earnings per share" of each of the three fiscal years of the Company within the performance period as reported in the Company's audited financial statements for each such year, adjusted to exclude the effects of: (a) gains or losses on sales of facilities, (b) gains or losses on extinguishment of debt, (c) asset or investment impairment charges, (d) legal claim costs or benefits (disclosed as separate line item in consolidated income statement), (e) expenses, or adjustments to expenses, for share-based compensation recognized under FASB ASC 718 related to the PSUs that result from EPS performance above or below the Target EPS during the performance period, (f) gains or losses on acquisition or disposition of controlling interests in equity investments or consolidated entities, and (g) any other gains, expenses or losses resulting from significant, unusual and/or nonrecurring events, as described in management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations appearing in the Company's annual report for the applicable fiscal year, as determined in good faith by the Board or the Committee. 
Performance Share Units – 2018 Awards 
The PSUs granted in 2018 (the "2018 PSUs") vest based on achievement of a cumulative Target EPS for fiscal years 2018 — 2020, subject to the vesting schedule set forth above. The Committee used the Company's six-month average stock price as of December 31, 2017 to determine the number of PSUs granted. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
For additional information concerning the 2018 PSUs, see the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End Table.  Performance Share Units – 2016 Awards 
The PSUs granted in 2016 (the "2016 PSUs") vested based on achievement of a cumulative Target EPS for fiscal years 2016 – 2018, subject to the vesting schedule set forth above. The cumulative Target EPS for the 2016 PSUs was $20.00, and the actual cumulative EPS achieved for the 2016 – 2018 fiscal year period for purposes of the 2016 PSUs was $20.89, which included adjustments for the impact of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Michael; the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Accounting and the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Therefore, based upon achievement of a cumulative adjusted EPS of 104.5% of the Target EPS for the 2016 PSUs, the named executive officers vested in 122.25% of the Target 2016 PSUs.

Ownership Guidelines. Our ownership guidelines provide that our Chief Executive Officer should hold Company equity valued at least five times his base salary, and our other named executive officers should hold equity valued at least three times their respective base salaries. When calculating equity holdings, we include shares beneficially owned by the executive as well as the "in-the-money" value of vested stock options and SARs. The guidelines provide that 75% of vested restricted shares net of taxes and exercised options and SARs must be retained by the executive until minimum ownership levels are met. If our market share price declines to the extent that an executive's ownership falls below the guidelines, these holding requirements are reinstated. In general, named executive officers will be expected to meet the ownership guidelines within five years of appointment to their position. As of December 31, 2018, each named executive officer's equity holdings exceeded the minimum ownership guidelines. The following table shows the ownership of the named executive officers as of December 31, 2018:

Personal Benefits.  Our executive officers receive limited, if any, benefits outside of those offered to our other employees. Generally, we provide these benefits to increase travel and work efficiencies and allow for more productive use of the executive's time. Our CEO and President are permitted to use the Company aircraft for personal trips, subject to the aircraft's availability. The named executive officers may also have their spouses accompany them on business trips taken on the Company aircraft, subject to seat availability, a benefit which has minimal incremental costs to the Company. In addition, there are times when it is appropriate for an executive's spouse to attend events related to our business. On those   occasions, we will pay for the travel expenses of the executive's spouse. The value of these personal benefits, if any, is included in the executive officer's income for tax purposes. 
The Company does not provide any gross-up payments to our named executive officers to cover the taxes due on perquisite related income. 
Except as otherwise discussed herein, other welfare and employee-benefit programs are the same for all of our eligible employees, including our named executive officers. 
Retirement Plans and Benefits.  We currently maintain one tax-qualified retirement plan in which the named executive officers are eligible to participate, the HCA 401(k) Plan. The purpose of the HCA 401(k) Plan is to aid in recruitment and retention and to assist employees in providing for retirement. Generally all employees who have completed the plan's service requirements are eligible to participate in the HCA 401(k) Plan. Each of our named executive officers participates in the plan. For additional information on the HCA 401(k) Plan, including amounts contributed by HCA in 2018 to the named executive officers, see the 2018 Summary Compensation Table and related footnotes and narratives and "2018 Pension Benefits." 
Our key executives, including the named executive officers, also participate in two supplemental retirement programs as described below (with the exception of Mr. Rutherford who only participates in the HCA Restoration Plan). The Committee and the Board initially approved these supplemental programs to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Recognize significant long-term contributions and commitments by executives to the Company and to performance over an  extended period of time;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Induce our executives to continue employment through a specified normal retirement age; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Provide a competitive benefit to aid in attracting and retaining key executive talent.  
[END TABLE]
The HCA Restoration Plan, a non-qualified retirement plan, provides a benefit to replace a portion of the contributions lost in the HCA 401(k) Plan due to certain Internal Revenue Service limitations. Effective January 1, 2008, participants in the SERP (described below) are no longer eligible for HCA Restoration Plan contributions. However, the hypothetical accounts maintained for each such named executive officer under this plan as of January 1, 2008 continue to be maintained but will not be increased or decreased with hypothetical investment returns. For additional information concerning the HCA Restoration Plan, see "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation." 
Key executives may also participate in the HCA Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the "SERP"), adopted in 2001. All the named executive officers, with the exception of Mr. Rutherford, participate in the SERP. The SERP benefit brings the total value of annual retirement income to a specific income replacement level. For named executive officers with 25 years or more of service, this income replacement level is 60% of final average pay (base salary and PEP payouts) at normal retirement, a competitive level of benefit at the time the plan was implemented. All participants are fully vested in their SERP benefits, and the plan is frozen to new entrants. For additional information concerning the SERP, see "2018 Pension Benefits." 
In the event a participant renders service to another health care organization within five years following retirement or termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any further payment, and must repay any payments already made under the SERP and HCA Restoration Plan. This non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee with respect to the named executive officers.  Equity Award Retirement Provisions 
Pursuant to agreements governing the stock options awarded to the named executive officers prior to the Company's IPO in 2011, the vested portions of such awards will remain exercisable for 180 days following the termination of such executive's employment by reason of "retirement" (defined under such agreements as resignation from service after (i) attaining 65 years of age or (ii) after attaining 60 years of age and completing 36 months of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries following the Merger). 
Pursuant to the agreements governing the SARs granted to the named executive officers in 2011 – 2013, the vested portions of such awards will remain exercisable for 180 days following the termination of such executive's employment by reason of "retirement" (defined under such agreements as resignation from service (i) after attaining 65 years of age or (ii) after attaining 55 years of age and completing 10 years of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries). With respect to the SARs granted to the named executive officers in 2014 – 2018, the governing agreements provide that the vested portions of such awards will remain exercisable for three years following termination of the executive's employment by reason of "retirement" (as defined immediately above). 
Pursuant to the agreements governing the SAR awards granted to the named executive officers in 2019, in the event of the executive's termination on account of death, disability, or "retirement" (defined under such agreements as resignation from service (i) after attaining 65 years of age or (ii) after attaining 60 years of age and completing 20 years of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries), without a change in control, (i) the awards will be forfeited if the executive terminates employment less than one year after the grant date, (ii) the awards immediately vest and remain exercisable for four years following termination of the executive's employment on account of death or disability occurring one year or more after the grant date, and (iii) the awards will continue to vest annually as scheduled and remain exercisable for four years following termination of the executive's employment by reason of "retirement" as defined in the 2019 SAR grant agreements. 
Pursuant to the agreements governing the PSU awards granted to the named executive officers in 2016 – 2019, in the event of the executive's termination on account of death, disability, or retirement (defined under such agreements as resignation from service (i) after attaining 65 years of age or (ii) (a) for agreements granted in 2016 – 2018, after attaining 55 years of age and completing 10 years of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries or (b) for agreements granted in 2019, after attaining 60 years of age and completing 20 years of service with the Company of any of its subsidiaries), without a change in control, (i) the awards will be forfeited if the executive terminates employment less than one year after the grant date and (ii) the awards will be eligible to vest on a prorated basis (based on the number of days employed during the performance period) if the executive's employment is terminated one year or more after the grant date. 
Pursuant to the restricted share unit ("RSU") agreements governing the RSUs granted to the named executive officers under the 2015 PEP plan, (1) in the event the executive officer's employment terminates by reason of "retirement" (defined under such agreements as resignation from service (i) after attaining 65 years of age or (ii) after attaining 55 years of age and completing 10 years of service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries), the executive shall become vested in any unvested RSUs, and such RSUs shall continue to be payable on each applicable vesting date that occurs following their retirement, and (2) in the event of the executive's death or disability (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), all unvested RSUs shall immediately vest.

In light of his long-term service to the Company and his retirement from the position of Chief Executive Officer, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Amended Employment Agreement") with Mr. Johnson, effective December 31, 2018. Pursuant to the Amended Employment Agreement, effective as of the expiration of the employment term (December 31, 2019) or Mr. Johnson's sooner voluntary termination for any reason (including by reason of death or disability, but other than for "good reason" (as defined in the agreement)), Mr. Johnson would be entitled to receive (i) any Base Salary that is earned and unpaid through the date of termination; (ii) any annual bonus earned, but unpaid, for the year ended December 31, 2018 under the PEP as of the date of termination; (iii) a pro rata portion of any 2019 annual bonus that Mr. Johnson would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the agreement based upon the Company's actual results for 2019   (with such proration based on the percentage of the fiscal year that shall have elapsed through the date of termination of employment, payable to Mr. Johnson when the 2019 annual bonus would have been otherwise payable); (iv) vesting of a pro rata portion of Mr. Johnson's 2019 RSU award (with such proration based on the percentage of the fiscal year that shall have elapsed through the date of termination of employment); (v) reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred; and (vi) such employee benefits, if any, as to which Mr. Johnson may be entitled under the Company's employee benefit plans. 
If Mr. Johnson's employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by Mr. Johnson for "good reason" (each as defined in the agreement), Mr. Johnson would be entitled to receive the benefits described above and, subject to the delivery of a customary release and continued compliance with the noncompetition, nonsolicitation and confidentiality restrictions in the Amended Employment Agreement, an amount (if any) equal to Mr. Johnson's Base Salary that would have been otherwise payable through the end of the Employment Term and 100% vesting of Mr. Johnson's 2019 RSU award. 
If Mr. Johnson's employment is terminated by the Company for "cause," Mr. Johnson would be entitled to receive the amounts and benefits described in the first paragraph of this section, except that Mr. Johnson would not be entitled to receive a prorated bonus under the 2019 PEP or pro rata vesting of his 2019 RSU award. 
"Good Reason" is defined as (i) (I) a reduction in Mr. Johnson's base salary or bonus opportunities (taking into consideration equity grants) or (II) the reduction of benefits payable to Mr. Johnson under any deferred compensation plan, in each case other than any reduction due to investment performance or as a result of normal changes in interest rates used for determining benefits (although not including any change in methodology for determining such interest rates) or any isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure by the Company that is not in bad faith and is cured within 10 business days after Mr. Johnson gives the Company written notice of such event; or (ii) a substantial diminution in Mr. Johnson's title, duties and responsibilities, other than any isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure by the Company that is not in bad faith and is cured within 10 business days after Mr. Johnson gives the Company written notice of such event; or (iii) a transfer of Mr. Johnson's primary workplace to a location that is more than 20 miles from his workplace as of the date of the agreement. 
"Cause" is defined as Mr. Johnson's (i) willful and continued failure to perform his material duties with respect to the Company or its subsidiaries which continues beyond ten (10) business days after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered by the Company (the "Cure Period"); or (ii) willful or intentional engaging by Mr. Johnson in material misconduct that causes material and demonstrable injury, monetarily or otherwise, to the Company or its affiliates which continues beyond the Cure Period (to the extent that, in the Board's reasonable judgment, such misconduct or injury can be cured); or (iii) conviction of, or a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime constituting (x) a felony under the laws of the United States or any state thereof or (y) a misdemeanor for which a sentence of more than six months' imprisonment is imposed; or (iv) willful and material breach of Mr. Johnson's equity agreements with the Company, or Mr. Johnson's engaging in any action in breach of the covenants of his Amended Employment Agreement, which continues beyond the Cure Period (to the extent that, in the Board's reasonable judgment, such breach can be cured).  Severance Benefits Specific to Messrs. Hazen and Hall 
Under the Company's employment agreements with Messrs. Hazen and Hall, if employment is terminated by the Company without "cause" or by the executive for "good reason" (whether or not the termination was in connection with a change in control), the executive would be entitled to receive: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• any base salary and any bonus that is earned and unpaid through the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reimbursement of any unreimbursed business expenses properly incurred by the executive; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• such employee benefits, if any, to which the executive may be entitled under our employee benefit plans   
[END TABLE]
(the payments and benefits described above being "Accrued Rights") 
plus: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Subject to restrictive covenants and the signing of a general release of claims, an amount equal to two times the sum of  base salary plus the annual PEP incentive paid or payable in respect of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which termination occurs, payable over a two-year period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pro rata portion of any annual bonus that the executive would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the employment  agreement based upon our actual results for the year of termination (with such proration based on the percentage of the fiscal year that shall have elapsed through the date of termination of employment), payable to the executive when the annual  bonus would have been otherwise payable (the "Pro Rata Bonus"); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continued coverage under our group health plans during the period over which the cash severance is paid.   
[END TABLE]
"Cause" is defined in each employment agreement as an executive's (i) willful and continued failure to perform his material duties to the Company which continues beyond 10 business days after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered; (ii) willful or intentional engagement in material misconduct that causes material and demonstrable injury, monetarily or otherwise, to the Company or the Sponsors; (iii) conviction of, or a plea of nolo contendere to, a crime constituting a felony, or a misdemeanor for which a sentence of more than six months' imprisonment is imposed; or (iv) willful and material breach of his covenants under the employment agreement which continues beyond the designated cure period or of the agreements relating to the new equity. 
"Good Reason" is defined as (i) a reduction in the executive's base salary (other than a general reduction that affects all similarly situated employees in substantially the same proportions which is implemented by the Board in good faith after consultation with the chief executive officer and chief operating officer), a reduction in the executive's annual incentive compensation opportunity, or the reduction of benefits payable to the executive under the SERP; (ii) a substantial diminution in the executive's title, duties and responsibilities; or (iii) a transfer of the executive's primary workplace to a location that is more than 20 miles from his or her current workplace (other than, in the case of (i) and (ii), any isolated, insubstantial and inadvertent failure that is not in bad faith and is cured within 10 business days after the executive's written notice to the Company).  However, the executive may elect to have his covenants not to compete waived by us and forgo all payments and benefits described above other than the Accrued Rights. 
Pursuant to each employment agreement, in the event of an executive's termination of employment that is not a qualifying termination or a termination due to death or disability, he will only be entitled to Accrued Rights. 
Additionally, the executive's stock options granted while the Company was privately held will remain exercisable until the first anniversary of the termination of the executive's employment. The same severance applies regardless of whether the termination was in connection with a change in control of the Company. 
Severance Benefits Specific to Messrs. Rutherford and Foster 
Under the Company's Executive Severance Policy applicable to Messrs. Rutherford and Foster, if employment is terminated involuntarily by the Company (other than for a reason that would result in him not being eligible for rehire), by Messrs. Rutherford or Foster for "good reason" (as defined below), or as a result of, and after, a change in control (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code), each of Messrs. Rutherford and Foster would be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Subject to the signing of a separation agreement and general release (which is required unless his termination is part of a  planned reduction involving a group or class of employees), an amount equal to 24 months of his base salary in a lump sum payment at his current base salary rate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pro rata PEP bonus; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lump sum payment equal to the amount needed in order to continue his existing medical coverage under the Consolidated  Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") for 18 months.  
[END TABLE]
"Good Reason" under the Executive Severance Policy is defined as actions taken by the Company that result in a materially negative change to the executive, such as the duties to be performed, the conditions under which duties are performed, or the compensation received. Isolated or inadvertent failure by the Company that is not in bad faith and is remedied within 10 business days of written notice from an executive does not constitute good reason. 
Because we believe a termination by the executive for good reason (a constructive termination) is conceptually the same as an actual termination by the Company without cause, we believe it is appropriate to provide severance benefits following such a constructive termination of the named executive officer's employment. All of our severance provisions are believed to be within the realm of competitive practice and are intended to provide fair and reasonable compensation to the executive upon a termination event. 
Severance Benefits Applicable to All Named Executive Officers' Equity Awards 
Pursuant to the terms of the agreements governing stock option and SARs, vested stock options and SARs will remain exercisable for 180 days following a termination of the executive's employment by the Company without cause or by the executive for good reason (as each is defined in the award agreement). 
Pursuant to the agreements governing the PSU awards, in the event of a termination without a change in control, (i) the awards will be forfeited if the executive terminates employment less than one year into the performance period and (ii) the awards will be eligible to vest on a prorated basis (based on the number of days employed during the performance   period and the Company's actual performance during the performance period) if the executive's employment is terminated more than one year into the performance period on account of death, disability, retirement, or involuntary termination without cause or by the executive for good reason (as each is defined in the applicable award agreement). 
Additional information regarding applicable payments under such agreements and policies for the named executive officers is provided under "Narrative Disclosure to 2018 Summary Compensation Table and 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Change in Control Benefits.  The Committee believes that the potential acceleration of vesting described below is appropriate in order to provide security that equity-related consideration will be earned in the event the Company is sold or the subject of a "hostile" takeover. The absence of such an agreement could impact an employee's willingness to work through a merger transaction which could be beneficial to our stockholders. 
Beginning in 2015, SAR and PSU awards granted to the named executive officers under the Stock Incentive Plan are subject to a "double-trigger" for accelerated vesting under certain change in control scenarios; further, the change in control definition applicable to such awards was refined to reflect the reduced ownership of the Company's Sponsors. 
Pursuant to the award agreements governing the outstanding equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan in 2014, upon a Change in Control of the Company (as defined below), all unvested time vesting awards (that have not otherwise terminated or become exercisable) shall become immediately exercisable, and all unvested EBITDA vesting awards (that have not otherwise terminated or become exercisable) shall also become immediately exercisable. 
For purposes of the 2014 SARs, "Change in Control" shall mean, in lieu of any definition contained in the Stock Incentive Plan: (i) the sale or disposition, in one or a series of related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person or group other than, as of the date of determination, (A) any and all of an employee benefit plan (or trust forming a part thereof) maintained by (1) the Company or (2) any corporation or other person of which a majority of its voting power of its voting equity securities or equity interest is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company; (B) Hercules Holding, but only for so long as Hercules Holding continues to hold at least 30% of the voting power of the Company's voting equity securities, or (C) any Equity Sponsor (as defined in the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation dated as of March 8, 2011), but only for so long as the Equity Sponsors, in the aggregate, continue to hold at least 30% of the voting power of the Company's voting equity securities (any of the foregoing, "Permitted Holders"); or (ii) any person or group, other than the Permitted Holders, becomes the beneficial owner (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule thereto)) (except that a person shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all shares that any such person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the voting stock of the Company (or any entity which controls the Company), including by way of merger, consolidation, tender or exchange offer or otherwise; or (iii) a reorganization, recapitalization, merger or consolidation (a "Corporate Transaction") involving the Company, unless securities representing more than 50% of the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company or the corporation resulting from such Corporate Transaction (or the parent of such corporation) are beneficially owned subsequent to such transaction by the person or persons   who were the beneficial owners of the outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of directors of the Company immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction, in substantially the same proportions as their ownership immediately prior to such Corporate Transaction; or (iv) during any period of 12 months, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the Board (together with any new directors whose election by such Board or whose nomination for election by the stockholders of the Company was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of the Company, then still in office, who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the Board then in office. 
Pursuant to the RSU agreements governing the outstanding RSUs granted to the named executive officers under the 2015 PEP, upon a Change in Control (as defined immediately above and refined in 2015 to reflect the reduced ownership of the Company's Sponsors), all unvested RSUs shall immediately vest. 
Additional information regarding applicable payments under such agreements for the named executive officers is provided under "Narrative Disclosure to 2018 Summary Compensation Table and 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment Agreements" and "Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control." 
Recoupment of Compensation.  The Company can recoup (or "clawback") incentive compensation pursuant to our PEP that was based on (i) achievement of financial results that are subsequently the subject of a restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under either generally accepted accounting principles or federal securities laws, other than as a result of changes to accounting rules and regulations, or (ii) a subsequent finding that the financial information or performance metrics used by the Committee to determine the amount of the incentive compensations are materially inaccurate, in each case regardless of individual fault. In addition, the Company may recover any incentive compensation awarded or paid pursuant to this policy based on the participant's conduct which is not in good faith and which materially disrupts, damages, impairs or interferes with the business of the Company and its affiliates. The Committee may also provide for incremental additional payments to then-current executives in the event any restatement or error indicates that such executives should have received higher performance-based payments. This policy is administered by the Committee in the exercise of its discretion and business judgment based on the relevant facts and circumstances. 
Tax and Accounting Implications.  The Committee has historically considered the impact of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code in the design of its compensation strategies. Under Section 162(m), compensation paid to executive officers in excess of $1,000,000 in any year cannot be taken by us as a tax deduction unless the compensation constitutes "qualified performance-based compensation" within the meaning of Section 162(m). The design of the Company's PEP and other incentive compensation has historically been intended to constitute "qualified performance-based compensation" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined, however, that we will not necessarily seek to limit executive compensation to amounts deductible under Section 162(m) if we believe such limitation is not in the best interests of our stockholders. Moreover, this exception allowing the full deductibility of "qualified performance-based compensation" does not apply to compensation paid after January 1, 2018 unless paid pursuant to a written binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017. While considering the tax implications of its compensation decisions, the Committee believes its primary focus should be to attract, retain and motivate executives and to align the executives' interests with those of our stakeholders.  The Committee operates its compensation programs with the good faith intention of complying with Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We account for stock based payments with respect to our long-term equity incentive award programs in accordance with the requirements of FASB ASC 718. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management. Based on our review and discussion with management, we have recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Effective December 31, 2018, Mr. Johnson retired as Chief Executive Officer but retained the role of Chairman,  and effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Hazen was appointed to serve as Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  All amounts for 2018 are attributable to PSU awards. PSU awards for 2018 include the aggregate grant date fair value of  the PSUs granted during fiscal year 2018 in accordance with FASB ASC 718 as awarded to the named executive officers under the Stock Incentive Plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(3)  SAR awards for 2018 include the aggregate grant date fair value of the SARs granted during fiscal year 2018 in accordance  with FASB ASC 718 as awarded to the named executive officers under the Stock Incentive Plan. Assumptions used in the calculations of these amounts are set forth in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual  Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(4)  Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation for 2018 reflects amounts earned for the  year ended December 31, 2018 under the 2018 PEP, which amounts were paid in cash in the first quarter of 2019. With respect to the EBITDA weighted portion of the 2018 PEP, the Company exceeded its target performance level, as adjusted, but did  not reach the maximum performance level, as adjusted, resulting in a 180.02% of target payout for the named executive officers, with the exception of Mr. Foster, whose EBITDA weighted portion was paid out at 183.72% of his target amount, due to  the 50% of his PEP based on the EBITDA of the American Group, which exceeded the target performance level, as adjusted, but did not reach the maximum performance level and Mr. Hall, whose EBITDA weighted portion was paid out at 178.22% of his  target amount, due to the 50% of his PEP based on the EBITDA of the National Group, which exceeded the target  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(5)  All amounts for 2018 are attributable to changes in value of the SERP benefits. Assumptions used to calculate these  figures are provided under the table titled "2018 Pension Benefits." The changes in the SERP benefit value during 2018 were impacted mainly by: (i) the passage of time which reflects another year of pay and service plus actual  investment return; (ii) the discount rate changing from 3.28% to 3.97%, which resulted in a decline in the value; (iii) the use of the actual 2018 lump sum rate of 2.60% for Mr. Johnson, who retired in 2018; and (iv) the  mortality table used for calculating lump sums was updated from the 2017 applicable mortality table to the 2018 applicable mortality table under Internal Revenue Code section 417(e)(3), which resulted in an increased value. The impact of these  events on the SERP benefit values was:

Narrative Disclosure to 2018 Summary Compensation Table and 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table 
Total Compensation. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, total direct compensation, as described in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table, consisted primarily of base salary, annual PEP awards payable in cash and long-term equity incentive awards. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the long-term equity incentive awards granted to the named executive officers were structured such that 1/2 of the target award was granted in the form of time-based SARs, and the other 1/2 of the target award was granted in the form of PSUs which vest based on achievement of a three-year cumulative EPS goal. 
This mix was intended to reflect our philosophy that a significant portion of an executive's compensation should be equity-linked and/or tied to our operating performance. In addition, we provide an opportunity for executives to participate in two supplemental retirement plans (with the exception of Mr. Rutherford, who does not participate in the SERP); however, effective January 1, 2008, participants in the SERP are no longer eligible for HCA Restoration Plan contributions, although HCA Restoration Plan accounts will continue to be maintained for such participants (for additional information concerning the HCA Restoration Plan, see "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation"). 
Annual PEP Awards. With respect to the 2018, 2017 and 2016 fiscal years, each named executive officer was eligible to earn under the 2018 PEP, 2017 PEP and 2016 PEP, respectively, (i) a target bonus, if performance targets were met; (ii) a specified percentage of the target bonus, if "threshold" levels of performance were achieved but performance targets were not met; or (iii) two times the target bonus if "maximum" performance goals were achieved, with the annual bonus amount being interpolated, in the sole discretion of the Committee, for performance results that exceed "threshold" levels but do not meet or exceed "maximum" levels. The annual bonus opportunities for 2018 for the named executive officers were set forth   in the 2018 PEP, as described in more detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Compensation – Annual Incentive Compensation: PEP." 
Stock Appreciation Rights and Performance Share Units. In January 2018, February 2017 and January 2016, time-based SAR awards and EPS performance-based PSU awards were granted to the named executive officers under the Stock Incentive Plan. These SARs and PSUs were designed to be long-term equity incentive awards. The terms of the SAR and PSU awards are described in detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Elements of Compensation — Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards." 
All stock option, SAR, PSU and RSU awards held by the named executive officers are described in the Outstanding Equity Awards at 2018 Fiscal Year-End Table. 
Employment Agreements and other Compensation Arrangements. In connection with the Merger, on November 16, 2006, Hercules Holding entered into substantially similar employment agreements with Messrs. Johnson, Hazen, Hall and certain other executives, which agreements were shortly thereafter assumed by HCA Inc., and then in November 2010, to the extent applicable, by HCA Healthcare, Inc. (f/k/a HCA Holdings, Inc.), and which agreements govern the terms of each executive's employment. In light of his long-term service to the Company and his retirement from the position of Chief Executive Officer, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Mr. Johnson, effective December 31, 2018. Mr. Hazen's employment agreement was amended, effective as of February 9, 2011, January 29, 2015, November 14, 2016, and January 1, 2019 to reflect his appointment to the positions of President – Operations, then Chief Operating Officer, then President and Chief Operating Officer, and then Chief Executive Officer, respectively. The employment agreements with Messrs. Hazen and Hall were also amended effective January 27, 2016 to remove legacy language in such agreements providing that the Company and the executive would work together in good faith to try to address any issues posed by Section 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code that could arise as a result of a change in control of the Company (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code). Messrs. Rutherford and Foster do not have employment agreements with the Company. 
Employment Agreement – Mr. Johnson 
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Johnson's agreement effective December 31, 2018 in connection with his retirement as Chief Executive Officer, he will serve as Chairman of the Company through the Company's 2019 annual meeting of stockholders and as Executive Advisor through December 31, 2019 (the "Employment Term"). 
Mr. Johnson shall receive a base salary at the monthly rate of $125,000 during the Employment Term. For calendar year 2019, Mr. Johnson shall be eligible to earn a bonus with a "target" payout of $750,000 based upon the achievement of certain objectives to be determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company or subcommittee thereof. In addition, Mr. Johnson shall receive a grant of the Company's restricted share units with a grant date value of $750,000 on or about the date the Company grants annual equity awards to its executive officers for calendar year 2019, which shall vest 100% upon the expiration of the Employment Term. 
Mr. Johnson's agreement provides that it is the intent of the parties that Mr. Johnson's retirement as Chief Executive Officer shall cause a "separation from service" with the Company, within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as of December 31, 2018.  The agreement further provides that, for the avoidance of doubt, Mr. Johnson shall continue to vest with respect to any outstanding equity grants to Mr. Johnson under any equity incentive plan maintained by the Company through continued service during the Employment Term. 
The benefits Mr. Johnson will be entitled to receive pursuant to his Amended Employment Agreement upon the expiration of the Employment Term or Mr. Johnson's sooner termination of his employment are described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Severance Benefits — Severance Benefits Specific to Mr. Johnson". 
Employment Agreements – Messrs. Hazen and Hall 
The term of employment under Messrs. Hazen and Hall's agreements is indefinite, and they are terminable by either party at any time; provided that the executive must give no less than 90 days' notice prior to a resignation. Each employment agreement sets forth the executive's annual base salary, which will be subject to discretionary annual increases upon review by the Board of Directors, and states that the executive will be eligible to earn an annual bonus as a percentage of salary with respect to each fiscal year, based upon the extent to which annual performance targets established by the Board of Directors are achieved. 
Additionally, pursuant to the employment agreements, we agree to indemnify each executive against any adverse tax consequences (including, without limitation, under Section 409A and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code), if any, that result from the adjustment by us of stock options held by the executive in connection with the Merger or the future payment of any extraordinary cash dividends. 
The benefits Messrs. Hazen and Hall will be entitled to receive pursuant to their respective employment agreements upon termination of their employment are described in "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Severance Benefits — Severance Benefits Specific to Messrs. Hazen and Hall". 
Executive Severance Policy 
The Company's Executive Severance Policy applies to Messrs. Rutherford and Foster if their employment is terminated involuntarily by the Company (other than for a reason that would result in them not being eligible for rehire), by Messrs. Rutherford or Foster for "good reason" (as defined in the policy), or as a result of, and after, a change in control (as defined under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code). The severance benefits applicable to Messrs. Rutherford and Foster under this policy are described in more detail under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Severance Benefits — Severance Benefits Specific to Messrs. Rutherford and Foster."

 2018 Pension Benefits 
Our SERP is intended to qualify as a "top-hat" plan designed to benefit a select group of management or highly compensated employees. There are no other defined benefit plans that provide for payments or benefits to any of the named executive officers. Information about benefits provided by the SERP is as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Name      Plan Name      Number of Years Credited Service      Present Value of Accumulated Benefit      Payments During Last Fiscal Year 
[END TABLE]
Pursuant to his Amended and Restated Employment Agreement, Mr. Johnson retired for purposes of the SERP on December 31, 2018. Mr. Hall is eligible for normal retirement. Mr. Hazen is eligible for early retirement. Mr. Foster has not satisfied the eligibility requirements for normal or early retirement. Messrs. Johnson, Hazen, Foster and Hall are 100% vested in their accrued SERP benefit. 
Plan Provisions 
In the event the employee's "accrued benefits under the Company's Plans" (computed using "actuarial factors") are insufficient to provide the "life annuity amount," (as such terms are defined below) the SERP will provide a benefit equal to the amount of the shortfall. Benefits can be paid in the form of an annuity or a lump sum. The lump sum is calculated by converting the annuity benefit using the "actuarial factors." All benefits with a present value not exceeding one million dollars are paid as a lump sum regardless of the election made. 
Normal retirement eligibility requires attainment of age 60 for employees who were SERP participants at the time of the change in control which occurred as a result of the Merger, including all of the named executive officers set forth in the table above. Early retirement eligibility requires age 55 with 20 or more years of service. The service requirement for early retirement is waived for employees participating in the SERP at the time of its inception in 2001, including all of the named executive officers set forth in the table above except for Mr. Foster. The "life annuity amount" payable to a participant who takes early retirement is reduced by three percent for each full year or portion thereof that the participant retires prior to normal retirement age. 
The "life annuity amount" is the annual benefit payable as a life annuity to a participant upon normal retirement. It is equal to the participant's "accrual rate" multiplied by the product of the participant's "years of service" times the participant's "pay average." The SERP benefit for each year equals the life annuity amount less the annual life annuity amount produced by the employee's "accrued benefit under the Company's Plans." 
The "accrual rate" is a percentage assigned to each participant, and is either 2.2% or 2.4%. All of the named executive officers set forth in the table above are assigned a percentage of 2.4%. 
A participant is credited with a "year of service" for each calendar year that the participant performs 1,000 hours of service for HCA Inc. or one of its subsidiaries, or for each year the participant is otherwise credited by us, subject to a maximum credit of 25 years of service.  A participant's "pay average" is an amount equal to one-fifth of the sum of the compensation during the period of 60 consecutive months for which total compensation is greatest within the 120 consecutive month period immediately preceding the participant's retirement. For purposes of this calculation, the participant's compensation includes base compensation, payments under the PEP, and bonuses paid prior to the establishment of the PEP. 
The "accrued benefits under the Company's Plans" for an employee equals the sum of the employer-funded benefits accrued under the former HCA Retirement Plan (which was merged into the HCA 401(k) Plan in 2008), the HCA 401(k) Plan and any other tax-qualified plan maintained by HCA Inc. or one of its subsidiaries, the income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the participant under any of these plans, the account credit and the income/loss adjusted amount distributed to the participant under the HCA Restoration Plan and any other nonqualified retirement plans sponsored by HCA Inc. or one of its subsidiaries. 
The "actuarial factors" include (a) interest at the long-term Applicable Federal Rate under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code or any successor thereto as of the first day of November preceding the plan year in which the participant's retirement, death, disability, or termination with benefit rights under Section 5.3 or 6.2 of the SERP occurs, and (b) mortality being the applicable Section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code mortality table, as specified and changed by the U.S. Treasury Department. 
Credited service does not include any amount other than service with HCA Inc. or one of its subsidiaries. 
Assumptions 
The Present Value of Accumulated Benefit is based on a measurement date of December 31, 2018. The measurement date for valuing plan liabilities on the Company's balance sheet is December 31, 2018. 
The assumption is made that there is no probability of pre-retirement death or termination. Retirement age is assumed to be the Normal Retirement Age as defined in the SERP for all named executive officers set forth in the table above, as adjusted by the provisions relating to change in control, or age 60. Age 60 also represents the earliest date the named executive officers set forth in the table above are eligible to receive an unreduced benefit. 
All other assumptions used in the calculations are the same as those used for the valuation of the plan liabilities in the plan's most recent annual valuation. 
Supplemental Information 
In the event a participant renders service to another health care organization within five years following retirement or termination of employment, he or she forfeits the right to any further payment and must repay any benefits already paid. This non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee with respect to the named executive officers set forth in the table above.  2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation 
Amounts shown in the table are attributable to the HCA Restoration Plan, an unfunded, nonqualified defined contribution plan designed to restore benefits under the HCA 401(k) Plan based on compensation in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit.

Plan Provisions 
Until 2008, hypothetical accounts for each HCA Restoration Plan participant were credited each year with a contribution designed to restore benefits forgone under the HCA 401(k) Plan due to the participants' compensation being in excess of the Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(17) compensation limit, based on years of service. Effective January 1, 2008, participants in the SERP are no longer eligible for HCA Restoration Plan contributions. However, the hypothetical accounts for such participants as of January 1, 2008 continue to be maintained and were increased or decreased with hypothetical investment returns based on the actual investment return of the Mix B fund of the HCA 401(k) Plan through December 31, 2010. Effective January 1, 2011, the hypothetical HCA Restoration Plan accounts were frozen, and no investment earnings were reflected after this date. 
Executive officers are not allowed to defer compensation under this or any other nonqualified deferred compensation plan. 
Prior to April 30, 2009, eligible employees made a one-time election prior to participation (or prior to December 31, 2006, if earlier) regarding the form of distribution of the HCA Restoration Plan benefit. Participants chose between a lump sum and five or ten-year installments. All distributions are paid in the form of a lump-sum distribution unless the participant submitted an installment payment election prior to April 30, 2009. Distributions are   paid (or begin) during the July following the year of termination of employment or retirement. All balances not exceeding $500,000 are automatically paid as a lump sum, regardless of election. 
Supplemental Information 
In the event a named executive officer renders service to another health care organization within five years following retirement or termination of employment, he or she forfeits the rights to any further payment, and must repay any payments already made. This non-competition provision is subject to waiver by the Committee with respect to the named executive officers. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The following tables show the estimated amount of potential severance payable to each of the named executive officers (based upon their respective 2018 base salary and PEP payment received in 2018 for 2017 performance, for Messrs. Hazen and Hall; based upon their respective 2018 base salary, for Messrs. Rutherford and Foster; and based upon his base salary for his Employment Term for Mr. Johnson) as well as the estimated value of continuing benefits, based on compensation and benefit levels in effect on December 31, 2018), assuming the executive's employment terminates or the Company undergoes a Change in Control (as defined in the Stock Incentive Plan and set forth above under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis — Change in Control Benefits") effective December 31, 2018. Due to the numerous factors involved in estimating these amounts, the actual value of benefits and amounts to be paid can only be determined upon an executive's termination of employment. As noted above, in the event a named executive officer breaches or violates those certain confidentiality, non-competition and/or non-solicitation covenants contained in his employment agreement or separation agreement, the SERP or the HCA Restoration Plan, certain of the payments described below may be subject to forfeiture and/or repayment. See "Narrative Disclosure to 2018 Summary Compensation Table and 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table — Employment Agreements and Other Compensation Arrangements," "2018 Pension Benefits — Supplemental Information," and "2018 Nonqualified Deferred Compensation — Supplemental Information."

 2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of Mr. R. Milton Johnson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at December 31, 2018. 
We determined that the median of the annual total compensation of all our employees who were employed as of December 31, 2018, excluding Mr. Johnson, was $55,977, Mr. Johnson's 2018 annual total compensation was $21,419,906, and the ratio of these amounts was 383:1. 
To determine the annual total compensation of the "median employee", the following methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that were used were as follows: 
As of December 31, 2018, our total population consisted of 261,979 employees. To identify the median compensated employee, we used a Consistently Applied Compensation Measure (CACM) which included total gross payroll wages received in 2018. Pay was annualized for permanent employees not employed for a full year in 2018. 
This pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules based on our payroll and employment records and the methodology described above. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios. 
After taking the 5% "De Minimis Exemption" adjustment as permitted under SEC rules, we excluded our United Kingdom employees which accounted for 5,083 individuals. Furthermore, we also excluded employees added as a result of acquisitions in 2018, which accounted for 3,942 individuals, as permitted by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act. In total we excluded less than 5% of our total population. Our total population minus these excluded employees is 252,954.

 AUDIT AND COMPLIANCE COMMITTEE REPORT 
The following Report of the Audit and Compliance Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other Company filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent the Company specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein. 
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit and Compliance Committee has reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Audit and Compliance Committee has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 1301 (Communications with Audit Committee), as amended. In addition, the Audit and Compliance Committee has received from the independent registered public accounting firm the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent registered public accounting firm's communications with the Audit and Compliance Committee concerning independence, and discussed with it the firm's independence from the Company and its management. The Audit and Compliance Committee has considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm's provision of nonaudit services to us is compatible with its independence. 
The Audit and Compliance Committee discussed with our internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope and plans for their respective audits. The Audit and Compliance Committee meets with the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm, with and without management present, to discuss the results of the audits of the financial statements, the audit of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our progress in assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and the overall quality of our financial reporting, and reports to the Board of Directors on its findings. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Audit and Compliance Committee recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, the inclusion of the audited financial statements in our filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.
