Dear Fellow Stockholders:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Over the past year we again executed well across our key strategic and operational objectives. We are proud of the progress that we have made in transforming our business and we are excited about the company's future. In 2018, we continued to focus on increasing shareholder value through our three key strategic initiatives: revenue growth, transition to a subscription licensing model and margin improvement.             
[END TABLE]
2018 Strategic Initiatives
We also made important strides in extending our market reach and further differentiating our technology with strategic relationships we entered in 2018, including those with Rockwell Automation, Microsoft and ANSYS.
Given our pay for performance philosophy, approximately 50% of our executives' target compensation for the year was tied to performance measures designed to advance our strategic initiatives. We believe this performance-based compensation orientation contributed to our operating success for the year.
You can find additional information about our business performance for the year in the proxy statement summary and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which accompanies this proxy statement.
We thank you for your continued support of PTC.
 Sincerely,
ROBERT SCHECHTER Chairman of the Board www.ptc.com     3

Proposal 1 Election of Directors
The Board is elected by the stockholders to represent and protect their interest in PTC. The Board selects and oversees the members of senior management, who are responsible for conducting the business of PTC.
Election Process and Voting Standard
All directors stand for election each year. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes received. However, we maintain a Majority Voting Policy for uncontested director elections that requires a director who does not receive a majority of the votes cast for his or her proposed election to promptly tender his or her resignation from the Board. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept the resignation. The Board will use its best efforts to act on the resignation and publicly disclose its decision and its rationale within 90 days following certification of the election results. The director who tenders his or her resignation may not participate in the decisions of the Corporate Governance Committee or the Board that concern the resignation.
Director Nominations
The Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for identifying and evaluating nominees for director and for recommending to the Board a slate of nominees for election at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Candidates may be suggested by directors, management, stockholders or a search firm retained by the Committee. Stockholders that wish to nominate a candidate may do so in accordance with the procedures described in STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS AND NOMINATIONS. Candidates properly nominated by stockholders will be given the same consideration as other proposed candidates.
Director Qualifications
The Corporate Governance Committee's mandate is to create and maintain a Board with a diversity of skills and attributes that is aligned with PTC's current and anticipated future strategic needs. Beyond a few general requirements, the Corporate Governance Committee does not rely on a fixed set of qualifications for director nominees but considers the composition of the Board as a whole and the experience and skills each director nominee brings to the Board.
PTC values diversity and believes that diversity among the directors as to personal and professional experiences, opinions, perspectives and backgrounds, as well as diversity with respect to race, ethnicity, gender, age and cultural backgrounds, is desirable. The Committee does not maintain a diversity policy but seeks to achieve diversity through its thoughtful selection of qualified candidates.
Qualifications Required of All Directors
The Corporate Governance Committee considers each candidate's character and professional ethics, judgment, leadership experience, business experience and acumen, familiarity with relevant industry issues, national and international experience and such other relevant skills and experience as may contribute to the Board's effectiveness and PTC's success. In addition, all candidates must be able to dedicate sufficient time and resources for the diligent performance of the duties required of a member of the Board of Directors and must not hold positions or interests that conflict with their responsibilities to PTC. Candidates must also comply with any other minimum qualifications for either individual directors or the Board as a whole mandated by applicable laws or regulations. The Committee will also consider whether the candidate is independent of PTC as at least a majority of members of the Board of Directors must qualify as independent in accordance with Nasdaq independence rules.

Board Leadership Structure
Our Board is led by an independent Chairman, Mr. Schechter. We believe this Board leadership structure serves the company and our stockholders well by providing independent leadership of the Board. If we were to decide that combining the Chairman and CEO positions would better serve the company and our stockholders, our policy is to have a Lead Independent Director.
Board Meetings and Attendance at the Annual Meeting
The PTC Board holds regularly scheduled meetings over the course of the year and holds additional meetings as necessary. The Board met ten times in 2018. All directors attended all meetings held during their tenure in 2018, except for Mr. Fernandez, who was unable to attend one meeting.
We expect that each director will attend the Annual Meeting of Stockholders each year, barring other significant commitments or special circumstances. All directors attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.
The Committees of the Board
The Board has four standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Corporate Governance and, added in 2018, the Strategic Partnerships Oversight Committee. Each of the committees acts under a written charter, all of which are available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ptc.com. Mr. Heppelmann, our CEO, does not serve on any committee.

Director Compensation Process and Decisions
Annual Compensation
The Board establishes the annual compensation for the directors at the meeting of the Board of Directors held directly after the Annual Meeting of Stockholders. In setting such compensation, the Board considers the recommendation of the Corporate Governance Committee. In making its recommendation for 2018, the Corporate Governance Committee considered a competitive assessment of the directors' compensation with that of our compensation peer group (described in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS) and reviewed each element of compensation to determine whether the compensation is competitive and reasonable for the services provided by the directors. Based on that review, the annual cash compensation for all directors, other than the Chairman, was increased by $10,000. For 2018, after inclusion of the cash compensation adjustment, the directors' compensation was positioned at approximately the 50th percentile of the compensation peer group.
We provide a higher annual retainer for service as the Chairman of the Board given the additional work required by that position, but do not pay a committee chair retainer to the Chairman of the Board for service as the Chair of any committee. We provide different retainers for the Chairs and members of the various committees based on the anticipated level of work required with respect to the position and the committee.
We also believe that providing a majority of our directors' annual retainer compensation in the form of equity rather than cash serves to further align the interests of our directors with our stockholders as they become stockholders themselves.
New Director Compensation
The Board establishes the compensation for a new director at the time of election. For the annual cash and equity compensation, that compensation is pro-rated based on the annual compensation amounts established for the other directors. We also make a one-time equity grant that vests over two years in an amount determined in accordance with the company's prior practice and a competitive assessment of director compensation practices. The award is meant to increase the director's stock ownership over time to further align the director's interests with those of PTC stockholders and to compensate the director for the investment of time the director will make in understanding our business.

Proposal 2 Approve an Increase in the Number of Shares Available for Issuance under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan
We are seeking stockholder approval of an amendment to our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (2000 EIP) to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by 6,000,000 shares. Of the shares previously authorized, only 1,702,188 remained available for grant as of January 7, 2019. If approved, we expect to use the additional shares for continued periodic equity grants to employees (including executive officers), directors and consultants.
Why the 2000 EIP is Important
Our ability to attract, motivate and retain high-performing employees is vital to our ability to compete successfully in the market and to increase stockholder value. We believe our ability to grant equity incentives as an element of employee compensation is essential for us to remain competitive in attracting and retaining such employees. We believe equity incentives motivate high levels of performance and provide an effective means of recognizing employee contributions to the success of PTC. Moreover, equity incentives align the interests of the employees with the interests of our stockholders. Because the 2000 EIP is the only plan under which we can grant equity incentives, maintaining its viability by increasing the number of shares available for grant is essential for us to be able to continue to use equity incentives to attract, motivate and retain the employees necessary for our future success.
Summaries of the 2000 EIP terms and the U.S. federal income tax consequences for awards under the 2000 EIP are provided below.
Potential Effects of the Amendment
The proposed amendment would make an additional 6,000,000 shares available for issuance under the 2000 EIP, which would enable us to continue to offer equity incentives to our employees (including executive officers), directors and consultants. With the additional shares, our fully-diluted share overhang would be 8.2%. Because future grants and share prices are unknown, the economic dilution associated with the additional shares cannot be calculated. We are mindful of the dilution associated with equity awards and we repurchase outstanding shares in the open market, which helps to offset the dilution associated with equity awards.
Grant Practices; Program Dilution and Expense
We use restricted stock units as our principal equity award because they enable us to issue fewer shares than stock options to deliver comparable value, which reduces overhang and potential stockholder dilution. They also have a better potential retention effect because they retain value even if the stock price declines.
We also emphasize performance-based awards when making equity awards to our executive officers and other senior executives. These awards are structured so that the value delivered is conditioned on achievement of PTC's important business objectives. If the performance targets are not achieved, the awards are forfeited. At least 50% of our annual equity incentive awards issued to executive officers are performance-based awards. As we discuss in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, approximately 50% of our executives' target compensation for 2018 was performance-based, with the equity component comprising a significant portion of their performance-based compensation. Our use of equity as part of our performance-based compensation program challenges our executives to increase stockholder value and compensates them only to the extent that result is achieved. The value of the compensation ultimately earned is dependent on the value of the equity on the vest date, which further aligns our executives' interests with those of stockholders.

Table of Contents
Proposal 2
We are committed to maintaining an equity incentive program that accomplishes our incentive and retention goals while being sensitive to our stockholders' concerns about dilution and expense. As part of our efforts to ensure that our program does not unduly dilute stockholders or incur undue expense, we benchmark the program's annual expense and share dilution (burn rate) against those of the companies we use to benchmark our executive compensation.
Benchmark of Equity Program Share Dilution / Burn Rate
For 2018, the share dilution (burn rate) associated with PTC's equity program (calculated under the methodology in the first table below) was below the 25th percentile relative to peer companies.
The table below shows our net burn rate for the past three completed fiscal years calculated by including all awards (service-based and performance-based) in the year granted and subtracting awards that were forfeited or not earned.
Burn Rate for the Three Most Recent Completed Fiscal Years (All Awards Counted in Year Granted or Forfeited)
The table below shows our burn rate for the past three completed fiscal years calculated by including service-based awards in the year granted and performance-based awards to the extent earned in the year earned.
Burn Rate for the Three Most Recent Completed Fiscal Years (Performance-Based Awards Counted in Year Earned)
Benchmark of Equity Program Expense
For 2018, the expense (recorded expense as a percentage of market capitalization) associated with PTC's equity program was below the 25th percentile relative to peer companies.

Outstanding Equity Awards and Shares Available to Grant
The table below shows the number of shares under outstanding awards and the number of shares available for future grants under our 2000 Equity Incentive Plan, which is our only equity incentive plan, as of January 7, 2019.
2000 Equity Incentive Plan (as of January 7, 2019)
Determination of the Amount of the Share Request
We use an intended dollar value to be delivered to determine the number of shares to be awarded to a program participant, rather than a fixed number of shares. Accordingly, the number of shares we use under the plan varies based on our stock price. We modeled our anticipated equity program needs for 2019, 2020 and 2021 (assuming a consistent program) and determined that we would need to grant equity with an aggregate value of approximately $110 million for each of those years. We modeled the effect the proposed number of shares would have on our share overhang and burn rate. This model yielded a fully-diluted share overhang of 8.2% and an average burn rate below 1.5% for those years. We believe these measures indicate that our equity incentive program is appropriate and fair to stockholders while enabling us to provide the equity compensation incentives necessary to obtain, retain and incent the personnel necessary to increase stockholder value.
Board Recommendation
The amendment to the 2000 EIP will provide PTC with the shares necessary to offer effective equity incentives, which are essential for PTC to attract, motivate and retain employees and to align PTC's compensation needs with our stockholders' interests. PTC has evidenced its ability and commitment to use equity wisely through its burn rate and expense experience. The Board of Directors believes that the amendment to the 2000 EIP promotes important corporate goals, balances those goals with the interests of stockholders, and is therefore in the best interests of PTC's stockholders.
Summary of the Terms of the 2000 EIP
The material terms of the 2000 EIP are described below. A copy of the 2000 EIP (reflecting the proposed increase) is included as Appendix B to this proxy statement.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Administration        The plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The Committee is composed of at least two members of our Board who meet certain tests  under the U.S. tax and securities laws for independence from PTC management. If there are not at least two such members, then the entire Board serves as the Committee for purposes of the plan. 
Types of Awards   The Committee may award restricted and unrestricted shares of common stock, restricted stock units, stock options and stock appreciation rights. 
Eligibility   The Committee may make awards to     employees, directors and consultants of PTC and its subsidiaries based upon their past or anticipated contributions to the     achievement of our objectives and other relevant matters. As of January 7, 2019, eight non-employee directors and     approximately 6,100 employees were eligible for awards under the plan. 
Restricted Stock Units   The Committee may grant restricted stock units, which are rights to receive shares of common stock in the future. The Committee determines the period during which, and the conditions under which, the  award may be forfeited and the other terms and conditions of such awards. Restricted stock units may be settled in shares of common stock or cash, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant or thereafter. Restricted stock units represent  unfunded and unsecured obligations of PTC.

Restricted and Unrestricted Stock        The Committee may make awards of common stock subject to forfeiture. The participant generally will forfeit the shares if specified conditions, such as the participant's continued service with  PTC or achievement of certain company performance goals, are not met. The participant is entitled to vote the shares during the restricted period. The Committee may also award common stock without restrictions. The Committee determines what, if anything,  the participant must pay to receive a stock award. 
Stock Options   The Committee may award incentive stock options and nonstatutory stock options. The Committee determines the terms of the option awards, including the amount, exercise price, vesting schedule and  term, which may not exceed ten years for incentive stock options. The exercise price of an option may not be less than the fair market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. A participant may pay the exercise price of an option in cash  or, if permitted by the Committee, other consideration, including by surrender of common stock the participant holds. 
Stock Appreciation Rights   The Committee may grant stock appreciation rights, which are rights to receive any excess in value of shares of common stock over the exercise price. The exercise price may not be less than the fair  market value of a share of common stock on the date of grant. The Committee determines at or after the time of grant whether stock appreciation rights are settled in cash, common stock or other securities of PTC, awards or other property and may define  the manner of determining the excess in value of the shares of common stock. 
Limitations on Individual Grants   In any fiscal year, the Committee may not grant to any person options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units or restricted stock with respect to which performance goals apply for more  than 800,000 shares of common stock. This limit is subject to adjustment for changes in our structure or capitalization that affect the number of shares of common stock outstanding. 
No Repricing of Outstanding Awards   The Committee may not, without stockholder approval, amend any outstanding option to reduce the exercise price or replace it with an option at a lower exercise price or exchange it for  cash. 
No Payment or Accumulation of Dividends on Unvested Awards or Outstanding Options   No dividends or dividend equivalents may accumulate or be paid with respect to any unvested portion of an Award or with respect to any Option, whether vested or unvested. This plan provision may be  amended only with the approval of the stockholders of the Company. 
Amendment of Outstanding Awards   The Committee may otherwise amend, modify or terminate any outstanding     award, provided that the participant's consent to such action is required if such action (1) would     terminate or reduce the number of shares issuable under an option and the participant does not have the opportunity to     exercise the option or be compensated for the lost shares, or (2) taking     into account any related action, would materially and adversely affect the participant. 
Transferability   Participants may not transfer unvested awards and may not transfer stock options, whether vested or unvested. 
Performance Goals   The Committee may grant awards subject to achievement of previously established performance goals. The performance goals may be particular to a participant or may be based, in whole or in part, on  the performance of the business unit in which the participant works or on the performance of PTC as a whole. The performance goals the Committee may use may be based on one or more of the performance measures described in the plan. 
Number of Shares Issuable; Change in Capitalization   As of January 7, 2019, 1,702,188 shares of common stock were available for issuance under the plan. If there is a change in our equity structure that affects the  outstanding common stock, the aggregate number of shares that are reserved for issuance under the plan, as well as the number of shares subject to outstanding awards, together with exercise prices with respect to any of the foregoing, will be adjusted by  the Committee to preserve the benefits intended to be provided under the plan. 
Change in Control   The Committee may act to preserve a participant's rights under an award in the event of a change in control of PTC by, among other things, accelerating any time period relating to the exercise  or payment of the award, causing the award to be assumed by another entity, or providing for compensating payments to the participant. 
Amendments   The Board of Directors may amend, suspend or terminate the plan, subject to any stockholder approval it deems necessary or appropriate. Under current NASDAQ Stock Market rules, the Board may not  increase the number of shares of common stock issuable under the plan (except in the case of a recapitalization, stock split or similar event) without stockholder approval.

Potential U.S. Federal Tax Consequences of Awards
Below is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences for participants and PTC with respect to awards under the 2000 Equity Incentive Plan.
Restricted Stock Units. A participant will generally realize ordinary income in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares (or the amount of cash) distributed to settle the restricted stock units at the time of settlement, which is generally upon vesting of the restricted stock units. In certain limited circumstances, a settlement date may be later than the vesting date, in which case the settlement would be made in a manner intended to comply with the rules governing non-qualified deferred compensation arrangements. In either case, we would receive a corresponding tax deduction at the time of settlement. If the restricted stock units are settled in shares, then upon sale of those shares, any subsequent appreciation or depreciation would be treated as short-term or long-term capital gain or loss to the participant and would not result in any further tax deduction by us.
Restricted Stock. Generally, a participant will be taxed at the time the restrictions on the shares lapse. The excess of the fair market value of the shares at that time over the amount paid, if any, by the participant for the shares will be treated as ordinary income. The participant may instead elect at the time of grant to be taxed (as ordinary income) on the excess of the then fair market value of the shares over the amount paid, if any, for the shares. In either case, we would receive a tax deduction for the amount reported as ordinary income to the participant. Upon the participant's disposition of the shares, any subsequent appreciation or depreciation is treated as a short or long-term capital gain or loss and will not result in any further tax deduction by us.
Incentive Stock Options. A participant does not realize taxable income upon the grant or exercise of an ISO under the 2000 EIP. If a participant does not dispose of shares received upon exercise of an ISO for at least two years from the date of grant and one year from the date of exercise, then (1) upon sale of the shares, any amount realized in excess of the exercise price is taxed to the participant as long-term capital gain and any loss sustained will be a long-term capital loss and (2) we may not take a deduction for Federal income tax purposes. The exercise of ISOs gives rise to an adjustment in computing alternative minimum taxable income that may result in alternative minimum tax liability for the participant.
If shares of common stock acquired upon the exercise of an ISO are disposed of before the end of the one and two-year periods described above (a "disqualifying disposition"), the participant would recognize ordinary income in the year of disposition in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the shares at exercise (or, if less, the amount realized on a sale of such shares) over the exercise price. We would be entitled to a tax deduction for the same amount. Any further gain realized by the participant would be taxed as a short-term or long-term capital gain and would not result in any deduction for us. A disqualifying disposition in the year of exercise will generally avoid the alternative minimum tax consequences of the exercise of an ISO.
Nonstatutory Stock Options. No income is realized by the participant at the time a nonstatutory option is granted. Upon exercise, the participant will recognize ordinary income in an amount equal to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of the shares on the date of exercise. We would receive a tax deduction for the same amount. Upon disposition of the shares, appreciation or depreciation after the date of exercise is treated as a short-term or long-term capital gain or loss to the participant and will not result in any further tax deduction by us.
Excess Parachute Payments. A participant who receives any accelerated vesting or exercise of options or stock appreciation rights or accelerated lapse of restrictions on restricted stock or restricted stock units in connection with a change in control might be deemed to have received an "excess parachute payment" under federal tax law. In such cases, the participant may be subject to an excise tax and we may be denied a tax deduction.

Proposal 3 Advisory Vote on the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers
Why You Should Approve the Compensation of our Named Executive Officers
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our compensation programs are designed to pay for performance. A significant portion of the compensation of our named executive officers is comprised of performance-based pay. For 2018, 51% of our CEO's target compensation was performance-based and 49% of our other named executive officers' target compensation was performance-based. The executives may also earn amounts above their target compensation, up to a cap, for performance above target performance. Conversely, if the performance measures are not achieved, those performance-based amounts are not earned or paid.        2018 Target Compensation  
[END TABLE]
Our compensation programs provide a strong correlation between pay and performance as demonstrated by our performance against our strategic goals and achievement against our short-term and long-term incentive plan targets in 2018. The alignment of pay and performance is further demonstrated in the realizable pay to performance alignment charts in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Executive Summary of Our Compensation Practices – We Pay for Performance, which show strong alignment between realizable pay and actual performance over the past three-year period.

Our compensation programs are designed to align our executives' interests with our stockholders' interests. In addition to weighting our executives' compensation to performance-based pay, a substantial portion of their compensation is in the form of equity (RSUs) that vests over three years. Moreover, our executives are subject to substantial stock ownership requirements and to clawback of incentive compensation in certain circumstances. These elements serve to align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders in the long-term value of PTC.

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors determines the compensation for our executives. We discuss below our executive compensation program and the compensation decisions made for 2018 for our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and the other executive officers and former executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table.
Executive Summary of Our Compensation Practices
We Pay for Performance
Our results for 2018 reflect the continuing successful execution of our business transformation to a subscription company with expanding margins. Our Internet of Things business, which we view as a significant growth opportunity, continued to grow as we added new customers and existing customers expanded their implementations over the year. Our performance over the year and the past three years reflects the success and efficacy of aligning executive compensation with our strategic plan. This pay-for-performance approach has resulted in exceptional pay and performance alignment and will continue to be the centerpiece of our executive compensation programs.
We are Responsive to Stockholders
[BEGIN TABLE]
 We received strong stockholder support for our executives' compensation for 2017.    Approval of over 90% of shares voted       Over recent years we have made significant changes to our executive compensation programs in response to say-on-pay votes, comments from stockholders and changes to perceived best practices. These changes include:● Adopting separate performance measures for our annual cash bonus and our long-term performance-based equity;● Introducing multiple performance periods for our long-term performance-based equity;● Adopting a clawback policy; and● Eliminating all single-trigger vesting in connection with a change in control.
[END TABLE]
We considered that vote when making executive compensation decisions for 2018. Based on the strong support we received, we believe stockholders support how we have structured our executives' compensation overall, and we did not make any changes to the structure of our executives' target compensation for 2018.

Compensation Philosophy & Objectives
Our executive compensation programs are designed to attract, motivate and retain our executives. We have a pay-for-performance philosophy for executive compensation and emphasize performance-based compensation tied to strategic initiatives designed to create long-term stockholder value. We believe that equity incentives that vest over multiple years provide an important motivational and retentive aspect to the executives' overall compensation and align our executives' interest in the long-term performance of PTC with that of our stockholders. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our executives' compensation consists of performance-based and service-based RSUs that vest over multiple years, with an emphasis on performance-based RSUs.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Compensation Committee Process
The Compensation Committee, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, establishes and reviews the compensation for our executive officers annually.
Independent Compensation Consultant
The Committee engaged Pearl Meyer & Partners, LLC as its independent compensation consultant for 2018. The Committee assessed the independence of Pearl Meyer and determined that Pearl Meyer is independent of PTC and has no relationships that could create a conflict of interest with PTC. As part of its assessment, the Committee considered the fact that Pearl Meyer provides no other services to PTC and consults with PTC's management only as necessary to provide the services described below.
Pearl Meyer provides a range of services to the Committee to support the Committee in fulfilling its responsibilities, including providing legislative and regulatory updates, peer group compensation data, advice on the structure and competitiveness of our compensation programs, and advice on the consistency of our programs with our executive compensation philosophy. Pearl Meyer attends Committee meetings, reviews compensation data with the Committee, and participates in discussions regarding executive compensation issues. The Committee meets with Pearl Meyer with and without PTC management present.
Consultation with Management
Members of management, including our Chief Executive Officer, participate in Committee meetings as requested by the Committee to discuss the materials provided, including recommendations on executive pay, competitive market practices and performance measures. Although the members of management provide their views, decisions on executive compensation are made solely by the Committee and, in the case of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, without the presence of the Chief Executive Officer.
How We Determine the Total Amount of Compensation
We make decisions regarding the amount and mix of compensation awarded to each of these executives based on:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Objective data provided by Pearl Meyer & Partners (we refer to this as the "competitive analysis"); 
[END TABLE]
We use the competitive analysis to assess our executives' compensation against the compensation paid to executives in similar positions in the peer group to ensure that the compensation we pay is competitive and fair to our executives and to our stockholders. We generally target compensation opportunities for our executives at the median of the market as an initial benchmark. While we use the competitive analysis as a starting point, we also consider the qualitative dimensions of an executive's role, internal pay equity among our executives and tenure in the position when setting our executives' compensation as we do not believe an external benchmark should be the only determinant of compensation.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Benchmarking and Survey Data
Benchmarking
The peer group used for the competitive analysis consists of publicly-traded U.S. companies in the software industry, most of which are in the enterprise software space, that have revenues and market capitalizations in a range we believe is appropriate. We target companies with revenue within an approximately 0.5x to 2x multiple of PTC's revenue and an approximately 0.3x to 3x multiple of PTC's market capitalization. However, we may include companies with revenue and/or market capitalizations outside these parameters if there is strong product and/or service similarity. We believe this group represents the competition for executive talent in our industry. We review the peer group on an annual basis to ensure that the companies in the peer group remain relevant and provide meaningful compensation comparisons.
The 2018 peer group consisted of the companies listed below. The 2018 peer group differed from the 2017 peer group due to the removal of Rackspace Hosting, Inc. and Mentor Graphics Corporation following their respective acquisitions and the addition of Splunk Inc. to balance those removals.
2018 Peer Group
Survey Data
We also use survey data for additional perspective. For 2018, we used the Radford Global Technology survey. PTC participates in this survey and believes that it represents a good cross-section of the software industry and that the data is appropriate to PTC. The survey represented 46 software companies with median revenue of $1.7 billion.

2018 Compensation Design and Decisions
Our executives' compensation consisted of a mix of base salary, annual incentive cash bonus, and performance-based and service-based equity. We believe these components provide an appropriate mix of fixed compensation and at-risk compensation that promotes short-term and long-term performance and rewards our executives appropriately for their performance. With this mix, we provide a competitive base salary and service-based equity that vests over multiple years while providing our executives the opportunity to earn additional compensation through short-term and long-term performance-based incentives designed to drive company performance and create long-term stockholder value. This mix is weighted toward at-risk pay (an annual performance-based bonus and performance-based RSUs that vest over multiple years).

Considerations for Tony Dibona, Former Executive Vice President, Focused Solutions
Mr. DiBona also had a unique position for which there was no appropriate match in the peer group or survey data. Accordingly, when setting target compensation amounts for Mr. DiBona for 2018, we considered his performance and his compensation as compared to our other executives, including consideration of the scope of his responsibilities compared to our other executives. As we believed his compensation remained appropriate, we made no changes to his compensation for 2018. In connection with Mr. DiBona's decision to retire in March 2019, in light of his long service tenure and performance, we modified his outstanding RSUs to provide that such RSUs would continue to vest over time after his retirement, with all performance-based RSUs remaining subject to the performance measures and forfeiture.
Considerations for Craig Hayman, Former Chief Operating Officer
We evaluated Mr. Hayman's performance and his 2017 compensation against our compensation peer group as to individual elements and as to total target compensation to determine whether any changes should be made to his 2018 compensation. Because Mr. Hayman had joined PTC in 2016 and we provided an attractive and competitive compensation package for him at that time, his compensation remained competitive relative to our compensation peer group and we made no changes to his compensation for 2018. Mr. Hayman left PTC in February 2018 to pursue another opportunity and all unvested equity was forfeited.

Long-Term Performance-Based Grant for CEO and CFO
During the course of the year, based on the success of our business transformation that put us ahead of our long-term plan targets for 2021, in June 2018 we announced new long-term financial targets for 2021 and 2023. The targets, if achieved, represent significant growth and profitability of our business that we expect will benefit our stockholders. Our performance and the 2023 long-range targets we announced demonstrate that we are committed to outstanding results.
Given the significant contributions of Mr. Heppelmann and Mr. Miller in driving our current performance and achievements to date, we  believed it was important to motivate both executives to drive achievement of the new long-term targets. In accordance with our pay for performance philosophy and preference to weight compensation toward equity incentives to further align our  executives' interests with those of our stockholders, we made a long-term performance-based RSU grant to each of them tied to achievement of the announced 2021 and 2023 adjusted cash flow targets, valued at $40 million on the date of grant for Mr. Heppelmann and $10 million for Mr. Miller. We selected  the adjusted free cash flow targets as the performance measures under the grants as they align to the long-range plan and given the importance of this performance measure to our stockholders and the expected increase in the valuation of the company  achievement of those measures would drive.
[BEGIN TABLE]
Adjusted Free Cash Flow Targets under the Equity Grants*    
*  In October 2018, we reduced the long-term plan FY2021 adjusted free cash flow target to $585 million to reflect the anticipated effect of a higher  subscription mix than we anticipated when we announced the original targets in June 2018. We did not, however, modify the equity grants to reflect this reduced target as the FY2023 adjusted cash flow target did not change and we wanted to ensure we drove  performance through FY2023. Our adjusted free cash flow measure is described on page A-2. 
[END TABLE]
The RSUs become eligible to vest in three equal tranches for 2021, 2022 and 2023 if and to the extent the performance measure for the period is met. The value of the awards made is equal to approximately 5x the value of the executives' respective 2018 annual long-term equity awards. Using a multiple of 5x their respective annual awards was consistent with external compensation data we reviewed, including case studies of companies that have provided similar awards to their executives, and aligns with the five-year performance period under the awards. We believe that these performance awards provide a compelling incentive to the executives to drive achievement of our long-range plan and drive outstanding results for our shareholders.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
2018 Performance-Based Compensation
The performance measures we develop and use for our performance-based compensation are designed to drive and measure our performance against our short-term and long-term business plans and objectives and create value for our stockholders.
For 2018, we continued to use separate performance measures for the annual cash incentive plan and the long-term performance-based RSUs, and multiple performance measures in the annual cash incentive plan. As our business model transformation had matured, we returned to using a strategic performance measure for our long-term performance-based RSUs. We had used relative TSR as our long-term performance measure in 2015 – 2017 during our business model transformation due to the challenge in setting appropriate performance targets during such a transformation. We decided to use a strategic performance measure for 2018 as we believed it would better serve to motivate our executives and drive our long-term business objectives.
We continued to incentivize significant performance beyond our financial plan and performance compensation targets with annual upside performance-based RSUs. We selected New IoT and Connected Applications Bookings as the performance measure for the annual upside RSUs given the importance of increasing these bookings to our longer-term revenue growth and margin expansion. This performance target was a significant stretch target that, if achieved, would represent over 50% growth in new IoT and Connected Applications bookings over 2017. We first implemented an annual upside equity opportunity in 2016 because we provide limited upside opportunity in our annual cash bonus plan relative to our peers. We elected to use equity for the annual upside opportunity to further align our executives' interests with those of our stockholders and motivate executives to focus on important transformative aspects of our business, including our Internet of Things business.

2018 Performance–Based Compensation and Achievement
The performance targets for the 2018 performance-based compensation and achievement under those plans are set forth below.
The annual cash bonus plan had three equally-weighted components, with 63.3% of the target bonus eligible to be earned upon achievement of threshold under all the performance measures and 100% at achievement of target under all the performance measures. Upside amounts could be earned but were capped at 125% of the target bonus, which is generally lower the than the upside opportunity provided by our peers.
The long-term performance-based equity is eligible to vest in three substantially equal tranches in 2018, 2019 and 2020 if and to the extent the performance measure for the applicable year is achieved. The performance measures for all three years are set upon grant and all are tied to increasing New Subscription ACV over the three-year period. The performance target for 2018

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis is set forth below, with 50% of the RSUs eligible to be earned for the period vesting on achievement of the threshold and the full 100% eligible for the period vesting on achievement of the target. Additional RSUs could be earned up to 200% of the target RSUs eligible to vest in the period for performance above the target (so, if 3,000 RSUs were granted, 1,000 could be earned for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, and up to an additional 1,000 RSUs could be earned for each period). RSUs not earned for 2018 or 2019 can be earned for 2020 as the intended long-term increase in new subscription ACV would be achieved, but in no event can the aggregate number of RSUs earned for all three periods exceed the total number of RSUs eligible to be earned multiplied by the 2020 achievement level.
The annual upside equity has a one-year performance measure and RSUs earned would vest in three substantially equal tranches in 2018, 2019 and 2020. RSUs not earned would be, and all were, forfeited. No additional RSUs could be earned for performance above the target.
Severance and Change in Control Arrangements
Agreements and Conditions
We maintain severance and change in control arrangements with our executives. The agreements require the executive to execute a non-compete agreement with PTC and to execute a general release of claims as a condition to receiving severance benefits. Each of the agreements has a one-year term and renews automatically for successive one-year terms if the Compensation Committee does not terminate the agreement. The agreements are described in more detail under Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control.
Annual Review
The Compensation Committee reviews these agreements each year to determine if these agreements should be maintained, modified or terminated. For 2018, the Committee reviewed current market practices and the terms of the agreements with the Committee's compensation consultant. Based on this review, the Committee decided that it was appropriate to maintain the agreements.
Rationale
The Committee believes that these agreements are important motivational and retention tools because, in a time of increased consolidation in our industry and increased competition for executive talent, they provide a measure of earnings security by offering income protection in the form of severance and continued benefits if the executive's employment is terminated without cause, economic protection for the executive's family if the executive becomes disabled or dies, and additional protections in connection with a change in control of PTC.
42     PTC Inc.     2019 Proxy Statement
Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Committee believes that providing severance to PTC employees, including executives, is an appropriate bridge to subsequent employment if the person's employment is terminated without cause. This is particularly so for executive-level positions for which the opportunities are typically more limited and the job search lead time is longer. The agreements also benefit PTC by enabling executives to remain focused on PTC's business in uncertain times without the distraction of potential job loss.
Importance in Connection with a Potential Change in Control
The Committee believes these agreements are even more important in the context of a change in control as it believes they will motivate and encourage the executives to be receptive to potential strategic transactions that are in the best interest of stockholders, even if the executive faces potential job loss. The agreements for our executives have "double triggers" before vesting of any equity is accelerated, so that no equity is accelerated upon a change in control but is accelerated only if the executive is terminated in connection with a change in control. The Committee believes this benefits PTC and any potential acquirer because it enables PTC to retain and motivate the executive while a potential change in control is pending, provides an acquirer with the ability to retain desired executives using existing equity incentives, and does not provide a one-time benefit to the executive that could undermine those efforts.
Equity Ownership
Each year we examine the total equity ownership of our executive officers. Because we believe that the interests of our executives are more aligned with stockholders' interests if they are stockholders themselves, we maintain a stock ownership policy for our executives. The policy requires the CEO and each of the other executives to attain and maintain an ownership level of PTC's common stock equal to 5x and 1x, respectively, their individual annual salary through retention of vested equity (other than options). The Executive Stock Ownership Policy is available in the Corporate Governance section of the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ptc.com.

Compensation Clawback Policy
We maintain an executive compensation recoupment policy that is intended to enable us to recover incentive compensation paid to an executive officer if such compensation is subsequently determined to have been unearned due to a restatement of our financial results for the performance period as a result of the misconduct of the executive officer. The Executive Compensation Recoupment Policy is available in the Corporate Governance section of the Investor Relations page of our website at www.ptc.com.
Timing of Equity Grants
We do not time grants either to take advantage of a depressed stock price or an anticipated increase in stock price and have limited the amount of discretion that can be exercised in connection with the timing of awards. We generally make awards only on pre-determined dates to ensure that awards cannot be timed to take advantage of material non-public information. Typically, our annual executive awards are made in November after public release of the previous fiscal year's financial results, annual awards to our Board of Directors are made on the day of the annual stockholders' meeting, and awards to our employees are made in November and July.

Table of Contents
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Awards to executive officers may be made only by the Compensation Committee. Other employee awards may be made by either the Compensation Committee or by our Chief Executive Officer pursuant to delegated authority. The Compensation Committee generally makes awards only at Committee meetings and generally does not make awards in trading blackout periods (the prophylactic period encompassing the last three weeks of each fiscal quarter through 24 hours after the earnings for that quarter are announced) unless special circumstances exist, such as a new hire or a contractual commitment. Our Chief Executive Officer may make awards only on the 15th of the month (or the next succeeding business day if the 15th is not a business day), other than in the months of January, April, July and October because the 15th of each of those months falls in a blackout period after the end of the quarter before results are announced, and only up to established values set by the Compensation Committee.
Tax and Accounting Considerations
Tax Considerations
The Compensation Committee considers the tax consequences of our executive compensation plans when designing the plans. Through 2017, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code limited deduction of compensation paid to the chief executive officer and three other most highly compensated executive officers of PTC (other than the chief financial officer) to $1,000,000 unless the compensation was performance-based. Through 2017, our executives' annual incentive bonuses and performance-based equity awards were provided under stockholder approved plans and were designed to enable deductibility under Section 162(m) as performance-based compensation. With the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, compensation, including performance-based compensation, paid to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and each of our three highest paid executive officers in excess of $1 million, will not be tax deductible, with the exception of the FY18 cash bonus, performance-based RSUs granted to the chief executive officer and the named executive officers prior to November 2, 2017 and service-based RSUs granted to the chief financial officer prior to November 2, 2017, which qualify for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of November 2, 2017. Given our preference for performance-based compensation, we have not altered our executives' compensation in response to the law.
Accounting Considerations
We consider the stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards to executives as part of the expense associated with our overall equity compensation program. The expense associated with the equity awards is equal to the fair value of the equity issued and is amortized over the vesting period of the award. We monitor this expense as we develop our plans and strive to maintain a program that balances the goals of our equity program with the associated expense of the program. For 2018, stock-based compensation expense as a percentage of our market capitalization was below the 25th percentile relative to our peer group.
Assessment of Risks Associated with our Compensation Programs
We assess our compensation plans and programs for employees, including our executives, annually to ensure alignment of the various plans and programs with our business plan and to evaluate the potential risks associated with those plans and programs. We have concluded that, although we maintain performance-based incentive plans, our compensation plans and programs do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on PTC.
For 2018, we reviewed our compensation plans and programs for any changes from 2017 and assessed the risks associated with those changes. We then reviewed performance against the plans to determine whether the performance was achieved and whether any unexpected risks had materialized for those plans. Our assessment concluded that our plans and programs do not create material risks and are appropriate. The results of this assessment were shared with the Compensation Committee, which concurred with the conclusions reached. As stated above, we did not identify any policies or practices that create risks reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on PTC.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The Compensation Committee regularly considers the risks associated with executive compensation and corporate incentive plans when designing such plans. The elements described below with respect to such plans and programs have generally been implemented by or at the direction of the Compensation Committee and were considered by the assessment team and the Committee when assessing the risk associated with our compensation programs:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● A detailed planning process with Compensation Committee or executive oversight exists for all compensation programs; 
● The proportion of an employee's performance-based pay increases as the responsibility and potential impact of the employee's position increases, which structure is in  line with market practices; 
● All short-term incentive plans and commission plans are cash-based plans, which results in less total compensation being tied solely to stock performance; 
● We set performance goals that we believe are reasonable in light of past performance and market conditions; 
● We use performance measures that are designed to support our long-term financial goals, rather than changing measures to take advantage of changing market  conditions; 
● We use different performance measures for our annual incentive plans and our long-term incentive plans; 
● Our long-term performance-based equity contains performance measures for each of the three years of the term of the award; 
● Our long-term performance-based equity contains a catch-up provision which discourages short-term risk taking based on the duration of the performance measurement  period; 
● We use restricted stock units rather than stock options for equity awards because restricted stock units retain value even if the stock price declines so that employees are less  likely to take unreasonable risks to get, or keep, options "in-the-money"; 
● We use service-based vesting over three years for our long-term equity awards to ensure our employees' interests are aligned with those of our stockholders for the long-term  performance of PTC; 
● Assuming achievement of at least a minimum level of performance, payouts under our performance-based plans result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, rather  than an "all-or-nothing" approach; 
● Upside earning opportunity in our annual cash compensation plans is limited to 25%. In addition, our performance-based equity plans are capped at a level commensurate with the  industry. 
● All organizations have a component of their leadership incentive plans tied to overall PTC performance to ensure cross-functional alignment with PTC's business  plan; 
● Our executive stock ownership policy requires our executives to hold certain levels of stock (not options, restricted stock units or restricted stock), which aligns an appropriate  portion of their personal wealth to the long-term performance of PTC; 
● Our compensation clawback policy enables us to recover incentive compensation paid to an executive officer for 2014 and thereafter if it is subsequently determined not to have been  earned due to restatement of prior period financial results due to misconduct of the executive officer, thus reducing any incentive to engage in misconduct to meet financial targets. 
● We maintain effective controls and procedures to ensure that amounts are earned and paid in accordance with our plans and programs.

Executive Compensation
The discussion, table and footnotes below describe the total compensation for 2018 for our named executive officers (our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, our three other most highly compensated executive officers, and two former executive officers).
As described in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS above and reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below, we pay these executive officers a mix of cash and equity compensation. Cash compensation consists of a base salary and an incentive plan bonus (Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation). We do not generally pay discretionary cash bonuses to these executives. Annual equity compensation (Stock Awards) consists of restricted stock units (RSUs) (50% of which are performance based and 50% of which are service based) that are eligible to vest over three years from the date of grant. Additional equity compensation (Stock Awards) may also include special purpose grants.
We do not provide these executives with pensions or the ability to defer compensation or any perquisites. Amounts shown in the All Other Compensation column reflect the matching cash contribution under our 401(k) Savings Plan for those participating in the plan. Those amounts for Mr. Miller and Mr. Hayman also include relocation payments and relocation tax preparation payments, as applicable.
Summary Compensation Table
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   Aggregate grant date fair value of awards plus, for 2016, the value of award modifications made for the year. Assumptions made in the valuation of these awards are described in Note K to our financial statements  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. For service-based RSUs, the grant date fair value is equal to the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of our stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on  the grant date. For the 2018 performance based RSUs, the grant date fair value is equal to the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of our stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the given date, assuming achievement at 100%; the maximum  potential value of these RSUs is 200% of the target RSUs granted. For the performance-based TSR RSUs granted for 2016 and 2017, the value was determined using a Monte Carlo methodology that takes into account the probability of achievement of the  performance measures at the time of grant. For the 2018 Annual Upside RSUs (described in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS and listed in the GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS TABLE), the value included in the Stock Awards column for each Named Executive  Officer is $0 because achievement of the performance goal on the date of grant was not probable. The Annual Upside RSUs were tied to achieving a challenging performance measure for 2018, that, if achieved, represented significant performance above our  financial plan and that we believed would result in significant stockholder value creation. The maximum potential value of the Annual Upside RSUs was 100%

Executive Compensation of the Annual Upside RSUs granted. Assuming that achievement of the performance measures for the 2018 Performance Based RSUs and the Annual Upside RSUs had been probable on the grant date, the grant date fair value of the 2018 Performance Based RSUs and the Annual Upside RSUs would have been as set forth below. For 2018, 93.34% of the target Performance-Based RSUs that could be earned for 2018 were earned. No portion of the Annual Upside RSUs were earned and all such Annual Upside RSUs were forfeited.
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)   Amounts shown are matching contributions under PTC's 401(k) Savings Plan. For 2018 and 2017, amounts for Mr. Hayman also include relocation benefits of $107,801 and $56,4320, respectively. For 2016, amounts  for Mr. Miller and Mr. Hayman include relocation benefits of $136,633 and $73,210, respectively, and, for Mr. Hayman, relocation tax preparation payments of $1,520. 
(3)   Includes grant date value of long-term performance-based equity award with performance     measures for 2021, 2022 and 2023 tied to our long-term financial plan targets in the amount of $40 million     for Mr. Heppelmann and $10 million for Mr. Miller. 
(4)   Sign-on bonus paid upon hire to compensate him for unvested cash compensation left behind at his prior employer to join PTC and subject to pro-rata forfeiture if he voluntarily terminated his employment in the  first year. 
(5)   Includes a sign-on equity grant valued at approximately $4,000,000 upon hire to compensate him for unvested equity left behind at his prior employer, half of which vested in November 2016 and the remaining half of  which vested in November 2017. 
(6)   Includes $4,205,723 related to modifications made to his outstanding equity awards in connection with his retirement. 
[END TABLE]
Grants of Plan-Based Awards
As discussed in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS above, we tie a substantial portion of our executives' compensation to PTC's performance through plan-based awards. For 2018, these awards consisted of:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● An annual cash bonus plan (Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards), 
● Performance-based RSUs that vest to the extent earned in each of the three performance periods over three years (Equity Incentive Plan  Awards), 
● Performance-based RSUs that vest over three years to the extent earned for the 2018 performance period (Equity Incentive Plan  Awards), and 
● Service-based RSUs that vest over three years (Other Stock Awards). 
[END TABLE]
Equity Incentive Plan Awards for 2018 for Mr. Heppelmann and Mr. Miller also include a long-term performance-based RSU award with performance measures for 2021, 2022 and 2023 tied to our long-term financial plan targets as described above.
We describe our compensation decisions for 2018, including the rationale for these awards and the performance measures, in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS above.

2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)   The grant date fair value was calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs granted by the closing price of a share of our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the grant date and applying the likelihood of  any performance measures being achieved (100% for all performance-based awards other than the annual upside performance-based RSUs, which was assumed at 0%). The closing price on November 15, 2017 was $63.92, on March 7, 2018 was $79.63, and on June 20,  2018 was $99.99. 
(2)   Awards under our annual cash incentive plan. The performance measures were met at the 96.1% level and 96.1% of the target bonus was earned and paid. 
(3)   Performance-based RSUs eligible to vest over three years to the extent the performance measures are met for each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, with any RSUs not earned in 2018 and 2019 eligible to be earned in 2020.  Only one-third of the RSUs granted are eligible to be earned for each of 2018 and 2019. The performance measure for 2018 was met at the 93.34% level and 93.34% of the RSUs for 2018 were earned and vested. 
(4)   Annual upside performance-based RSUs eligible to vest over three years to the extent the performance measure for 2018 was achieved. Amounts could be earned on a linear basis to the maximum after crossing the  target, with no amount earned upon achievement of target. The performance measure was not met and all the RSUs were forfeited. 
(5)   Service-based RSUs. One third of these RSUs vested on November 15, 2018 and the remaining two-thirds will vest in substantially equal installments on November 15, 2019 and November 15, 2020. 
(6)   Long-term performance-based incentive award eligible to vest in November 2021, November 2022, and November 2023 to the extent that the performance measure for the applicable year is met. RSUs not earned for 2021  and 2022 may be earned for 2023. 
(7)   Service-based promotion Award that vests in three substantially equal installments in March 2019, March 2020 and March 2021. 
(8)   Common stock issued based on achievement of performance measures for 2017.

CEO Pay Ratio
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires us to disclose the annual total compensation of our median paid employee, the annual total compensation of our CEO and the ratio between the two. We identified our median employee using a consistently applied compensation measure (CACM) approximating total direct compensation (base salary + short-term incentive target + long-term incentive target + 401(k) Plan Match) for 2018 for each of our worldwide employees as of September 27, 2018 (the final month in our 2018 fiscal year), excluding our CEO. We did not exclude any portion of our total worldwide employee population from this analysis. We applied the CACM in accordance with the applicable rules governing inclusion of part-time and temporary employees and prohibiting annualization of seasonal or temporary contracts. All employee compensation was converted to the U.S. dollar equivalent based on applicable exchange rates for the period, based on the September 27, 2018 date on which the worldwide employee data was collected. After identifying the median employee using this methodology, we calculated the annual total compensation for this employee using the same methodology we used for our CEO set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table in this proxy statement.
We determined that the total annual compensation for our CEO for 2018 (including the special performance-based equity grant described below) was $49,969,162.88 and the total annual compensation of our median employee for 2018 was $77,180.84, resulting in a ratio of 647:1. Our CEO's compensation for 2018 included a long-term performance-based equity grant that covers a five-year performance period tied to achievement of FY2021, FY2022 and FY2023 adjusted free cash flow targets. This grant is not considered part of his annual compensation or his target total annual compensation. (This equity grant is described in COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS – Long-Term Performance-Based Equity Grant to CEO and CFO.) If that equity grant is excluded from our CEO's total annual compensation for 2018, his total annual compensation for 2018 would have been $9,969,163.28, resulting in a ratio of 129:1.
To put these ratios into context, we note that we have a worldwide employee population, with approximately 65% of our employees located outside the U.S. where the competitive amounts we pay differ by country and region. The competitive compensation rates we pay in those countries significantly impact the pay ratio.
We also note that the SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee's annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have a different geographic distribution of employees, different employment and compensation practices and may use different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their pay ratios.

Proposal 4Advisory Vote to Confirm the Selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2019
We are asking stockholders to confirm the Audit Committee's selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a registered public accounting firm, as PTC's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.
Engagement of Independent Auditor and Approval of Professional Services and Fees
The Audit Committee is responsible for the engagement of our independent auditor and for approving, in advance, all audit services and permitted non-audit services to be provided by the independent auditor. The Audit Committee has adopted a policy for the engagement of the independent auditor that is intended to maintain the independent auditor's independence from PTC. In adopting the policy, the Audit Committee considered the various services that the independent auditor has historically performed or may be asked to perform in the future.
The policy, which is reviewed and re-adopted at least annually by the Audit Committee:
Any approval required under the policy must be given by the Audit Committee, by the Chairman of the Committee in office at the time, or by any other Committee member to whom the Committee has delegated that authority. The Audit Committee does not delegate its responsibilities to approve services performed by the independent auditor to any member of management.
The standard applied by the Audit Committee in determining whether to grant approval of any engagement of the independent auditor is whether the services to be performed, the compensation to be paid therefor and other related factors are consistent with the independent auditor's independence under guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and applicable professional standards.

Additional Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting
Proposals to Be Voted on at the Meeting
Effect of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes
If you abstain from voting on any of the proposals, or if your broker or bank does not vote on any proposal because it has not received instructions from you and is not permitted to vote in its discretion (a broker non-vote), it will not count as a vote for or against any proposal.
Voting by Proxy
You may vote by proxy using the Internet by following the instructions on your notice or proxy card. If you requested a printed set of materials, you may also vote by telephone or by mail by following the instructions on the proxy card.
Voting methods differ depending on whether you are a registered stockholder (that is, you hold your stock in your own name) or you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, in the name of a brokerage firm or bank that holds your securities account). In either case, you must follow the procedures described on your notice or proxy card.
When you vote, you are giving your "proxy" to the individuals we have designated to vote your shares at the meeting as you direct. If you do not make specific choices, they will vote your shares in accordance with the Board's recommendations as set forth above. If any matter not listed in the Notice of Meeting is properly presented at the Annual Meeting, they will vote your shares in accordance with their best judgment. As of the date hereof, we knew of no matters that needed to be acted on at the meeting other than as discussed in this proxy statement.
Whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting or not, we encourage you to vote promptly. Voting promptly will not affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting. If you wish to vote at the Annual Meeting despite having voted previously, you may do so by following the procedure described below under Revoking Your Proxy and How You May Vote in Person.

Additional Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting
Revoking Your Proxy
You may change your vote after you have voted as described below.
If you hold your shares in "street name" (that is, you hold your shares through a bank or a brokerage account, as most people do), you must follow the procedures required by the brokerage firm or bank through which you hold your shares to revoke your proxy. You should contact that firm or bank directly for more information on those procedures.
If you are a registered stockholder (that is, you hold your shares directly and not through a bank or brokerage account), you may revoke your proxy by following any of these procedures:
Confidentiality of Voting and Tabulation of the Votes
We keep all the proxies, ballots and voting tabulations confidential. Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. acts as tabulator and will forward to management any written comments that you make on the proxy card without providing your name.
Announcement of Voting Results
We will provide the voting results in a Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission within four business days after the Annual Meeting.
Costs of Soliciting Proxies
PTC will pay all the costs of soliciting proxies. In addition to mailing the notices and providing these proxy materials, our directors and employees may solicit proxies by telephone, fax or other electronic means of communication, or in person. We will reimburse banks, brokers, nominees and other fiduciaries for the expenses they incur in forwarding the proxy materials to you.

Operating Measures
Annualized Recurring Revenue
Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) for a given period is calculated by dividing the non-GAAP subscription and support software revenue for the period by the number of days in the period and multiplying by 365. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is an operating measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and does not include perpetual license or professional services revenues.
Subscription Bookings
We offer both perpetual and subscription licensing options to our customers, as well as monthly software rentals for certain products. Given the difference in revenue recognition between the sale of a perpetual software license (revenue is recognized at the time of sale) and a subscription (revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription term), we use bookings for internal planning, forecasting and reporting of new license and cloud services transactions. In order to normalize between perpetual and subscription licenses, we define subscription bookings as the subscription annualized contract value (subscription ACV) of new subscription bookings multiplied by a conversion factor of 2. We arrived at the conversion factor of 2 by considering several variables including pricing, support, length of term, and renewal rates. We define subscription ACV as the total value of a new subscription booking divided by the term of the contract (in days) multiplied by 365. If the term of the subscription contract is less than a year, the ACV is equal to the total contract value. In 2018, the weighted average contract length of our subscription bookings was approximately 2 years.
Subscription ACV
Equals subscription ACV (as described above) plus the annualized value of incremental monthly software rental bookings during the period.
Because subscription bookings is a metric we use to approximate the value of subscription sales if sold as perpetual licenses, it does not represent the actual revenue that will be recognized with respect to subscription sales or that would be recognized if the sales were perpetual licenses, nor does the annualized value of monthly software rental bookings represent the value of any such booking.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures and excludes restructuring payments and other amounts we do not regard as being indicative of our operating results, which amounts will be included in our GAAP Cash Flow results but are not known or predictable for future periods. Adjusted free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures.
Non-GAAP Operating Expense, Non-GAAP Operating Margins and Non-GAAP EPS
Non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP EPS exclude the effect of the fair value of acquired deferred revenue and deferred costs, stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related charges included in general and administrative costs, pension plan termination costs, a legal accrual, restructuring charges, and non-operating credit facility refinancing costs, identified discrete charges included in non-operating other expense, net and the related tax effects of the preceding items, and any other identified tax items.
We use non-GAAP operating expense, non-GAAP operating margins and non-GAAP EPS as performance measures because these measures exclude items that are not, in our view, indicative of our core operating results or that are not easily predictable for future periods. Additional information about the items we exclude from these non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons for such exclusion is provided in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which accompanies this proxy statement.

2000 Equity Incentive Plan
PTC INC. 2000 EQUITY INCENTIVE PLAN 
1. Purpose.
The purpose of the PTC Inc. 2000 Equity Incentive Plan (the "Plan") is to attract and retain directors and key employees and consultants of the Company and its Affiliates, to provide an incentive for them to achieve performance goals, and to enable them to participate in the growth of the Company by granting Awards with respect to the Company's Common Stock. Certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in Section 9 below.
2. Administration.
The Plan shall be administered by the Committee; provided, that the Board may in any instance perform any of the functions of the Committee hereunder. The Committee shall select the Participants to receive Awards and shall determine the terms and conditions of the Awards. The Committee shall have authority to adopt, alter and repeal such administrative rules, guidelines and practices governing the operation of the Plan as it shall from time to time consider advisable, and to interpret the provisions of the Plan. The Committee's decisions shall be final and binding. To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Committee may delegate to one or more executive officers of the Company the power to make Awards to Participants who are not Reporting Persons or Covered Employees and all determinations under the Plan with respect thereto, provided that the Committee shall fix the maximum amount of such Awards for all such Participants and a maximum for any one Participant.
3. Eligibility.
All directors and all employees and consultants of the Company or any Affiliate capable of contributing to the successful performance of the Company are eligible to be Participants in the Plan. Incentive Stock Options may be granted only to persons eligible to receive such Options under the Code.
4. Stock Available for Awards.
(a) Amount. Up to an aggregate of 44,300,000 shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment under subsection (b), may be issued pursuant to Awards, including Incentive Stock Options, under the Plan. If any Award expires or is terminated unexercised or is forfeited, the shares subject to such Award, to the extent of such expiration, termination, or forfeiture, shall again be available for award under the Plan. Common Stock issued through the assumption or substitution of outstanding grants from an acquired company shall not reduce the shares available for Awards under the Plan. Shares issued under the Plan may consist of authorized but unissued shares or treasury shares.
(b) Adjustment. In the event of any equity restructuring, whether a stock dividend, recapitalization, split-up or combination of shares, or otherwise, affects the Common Stock such that an adjustment is required in order to preserve the benefits intended to be provided by the Plan, the Committee (subject in the case of Incentive Stock Options to any limitation required under the Code) shall equitably adjust any or all of (i) the number and kind of shares in respect of which Awards may be made under the Plan, (ii) the number and kind of shares subject to outstanding Awards and (iii) the exercise price with respect to any of the foregoing, provided that the number of shares subject to any Award shall always be a whole number.
(c) Limit on Individual Grants. Subject to adjustment under subsection (b) above, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that are either subject to Options and Stock Appreciation Rights or are granted as Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock or unrestricted stock Awards with respect to which Performance Goals apply under Section 7 below that may be granted to any Participant in the aggregate in any fiscal year shall not exceed 800,000.
5. Stock Options.
(a) Grant of Options. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant options ("Options") to purchase shares of Common Stock (i) complying with the requirements of Section 422 of the Code or any successor provision and any regulations thereunder ("Incentive Stock Options") and (ii) not intended to comply with such requirements ("Nonstatutory Stock Options"). The Committee shall determine the number of shares subject to each Option and the exercise price therefor, which shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of grant. No Incentive Stock Option may be granted hereunder more than ten years after the effective date of the Plan.
www.ptc.com     B-1
Table of Contents
2000 Equity Incentive Plan
(b) Terms and Conditions. Each Option shall be exercisable at such times and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee may specify in the applicable grant or thereafter. The Committee may impose such conditions with respect to the exercise of Options, including conditions relating to applicable federal or state laws, as it considers necessary or advisable.
(c) Payment. No shares shall be delivered pursuant to any exercise of an Option until payment in full of the exercise price therefor is received by the Company. Such payment may be made in whole or in part in cash or, to the extent permitted by the Committee at or after the grant of the Option, by delivery of shares of Common Stock owned by the optionee valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of delivery, or such other lawful consideration, including a payment commitment of a financial or brokerage institution, as the Committee may determine.
6. Stock Appreciation Rights.
(a) Grant of SARs. Subject to the provisions of the Plan, the Committee may grant rights to receive any excess in value of shares of Common Stock over the exercise price ("Stock Appreciation Rights" or "SARs"). The Committee shall determine at the time of grant or thereafter whether SARs are settled in cash, Common Stock or other securities of the Company, Awards or other property, and may define the manner of determining the excess in value of the shares of Common Stock.
(b) Exercise Price. The Committee shall fix the exercise price of each SAR or specify the manner in which the price shall be determined. A SAR may not have an exercise price less than 100% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant.
7. Stock and Stock Unit Awards.
(a) Grant of Restricted or Unrestricted Stock Awards. The Committee may grant shares of Common Stock subject to forfeiture ("Restricted Stock") and determine the duration of the period (the "Restricted Period") during which, and the conditions under which, the shares may be forfeited to the Company and the other terms and conditions of such Awards. Shares of Restricted Stock may not be sold, assigned, transferred, pledged or otherwise encumbered, except as permitted by the Committee, during the Restricted Period. Shares of Restricted Stock shall be evidenced in such manner as the Committee may determine. Any certificates issued in respect of shares of Restricted Stock shall be registered in the name of the Participant and unless otherwise determined by the Committee, deposited by the Participant, together with a stock power endorsed in blank, with the Company. At the expiration of the Restricted Period, the Company shall deliver such certificates to the Participant or if the Participant has died, to the Participant's Designated Beneficiary. The Committee also may make Awards of shares of Common Stock that are not subject to restrictions or forfeiture, on such terms and conditions as the Committee may determine from time to time.
(b) Grant of Restricted Stock Units. The Committee may grant the right to receive in the future shares of Common Stock subject to forfeiture ("Restricted Stock Units") and determine the duration of the Restricted Period during which, and the conditions under which, the Award may be forfeited to the Company and the other terms and conditions of such Awards. Restricted Stock Unit Awards shall constitute an unfunded and unsecured obligation of the Company, and shall be settled in shares of Common Stock or cash, as determined by the Committee at the time of grant or thereafter. Such Awards shall be made in the form of "units" with each unit representing the equivalent of one share of Common Stock.
(c) Performance Goals; Consideration. The Committee may establish Performance Goals for the granting of Restricted Stock, unrestricted stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units or the lapse of risk of forfeiture of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. Shares of Restricted Stock or unrestricted stock or Restricted Stock Units may be issued for no cash consideration, such minimum consideration as may be required by applicable law or such other consideration as the Committee may determine.
8. General Provisions Applicable to Awards.
(a) Documentation. Each Award under the Plan shall be evidenced by a writing delivered to the Participant or agreement executed by the Participant specifying the terms and conditions thereof and containing such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan as the Committee considers necessary or advisable to achieve the purposes of the Plan or to comply with applicable tax and regulatory laws and accounting principles. No Award to any Participant subject to United States income taxation shall provide for the deferral of compensation that does not comply with Section 409A of the Code.

Table of Contents
2000 Equity Incentive Plan
(b) Committee Discretion. Each type of Award may be made alone, in addition to or in relation to any other Award. The terms of each type of Award need not be identical, and the Committee need not treat Participants uniformly. Except as otherwise provided by the Plan or a particular Award, any determination with respect to an Award may be made by the Committee at the time of grant or at any time thereafter.
(c) Dividends. In no event shall dividends or dividend equivalents accumulate or be paid with respect to any unvested portion of an Award or with respect to any Option, whether vested or unvested. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, this Section 8(c) may be amended only with the approval of the stockholders of the Company.
(d) Termination of Service. The Committee shall determine the effect on an Award of the disability, death, retirement or other termination of service of a Participant and the extent to which, and the period during which, the Participant's legal representative, guardian or Designated Beneficiary may receive payment of an Award or exercise rights thereunder.
(e) Change in Control. In order to preserve a Participant's rights under an Award in the event of a change in control of the Company (as defined by the Committee), the Committee in its discretion may, at the time an Award is made or at any time thereafter, take such actions, including without limitation one or more of the following: (i) providing for the acceleration of any time period relating to the exercise or payment of the Award, (ii) providing for payment to the Participant of cash or other property with a Fair Market Value equal to the amount that would have been received upon the exercise or payment of the Award had the Award been exercised or paid upon the change in control, whereupon the Award shall terminate, (iii) adjusting the terms of the Award in a manner determined by the Committee to reflect the change in control, or (iv) causing the Award to be assumed, or new rights substituted therefor, by another entity, as the Committee may consider equitable to Participants and in the best interests of the Company.
(f) Transferability. The Committee shall not make or allow any Award to be transferable by the Participant, provided that nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right of a Participant to transfer shares of stock upon which the restrictions have lapsed or shares issued upon the vesting or exercise, as applicable, of an Award.
(g) Withholding Taxes. The Participant shall pay to the Company, or make provision satisfactory to the Committee for payment of, any taxes required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards under the Plan no later than the date of the event creating the tax liability. The Company and its Affiliates may, to the extent permitted by law, deduct any such tax obligations from any payment of any kind due to the Participant hereunder or otherwise. In the Committee's discretion, the minimum tax obligations required by law to be withheld in respect of Awards may be paid in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock, including shares retained from the Award creating the tax obligation, valued at their Fair Market Value on the date of retention or delivery.
(h) Foreign Nationals. Awards may be made to Participants who are foreign nationals or employed outside the United States on such terms and conditions different from those specified in the Plan as the Committee considers necessary or advisable to achieve the purposes of the Plan or to comply with applicable laws.
(i) Amendment of Award. The Committee may amend, modify or terminate any outstanding Award, including without limitation changing the date of exercise or realization, causing the Award to be assumed by another entity, and converting an Incentive Stock Option to a Nonstatutory Stock Option, provided that the Participant's consent to such action shall be required (a) if such action would terminate, or reduce the number of shares issuable under, an Option, unless any time period relating to the exercise of such Option or the eliminated portion, as the case may be, is accelerated before such termination or reduction, in which case the Committee may provide for the Participant to receive cash or other property equal to the net value that would be received upon exercise of the terminated Option or the eliminated portion, as the case may be, and (b) in any other case, unless the Committee determines that the action, taking into account any related action, would not materially and adversely affect the Participant. The Committee shall not, without further approval of the stockholders of the Company, authorize the amendment of any outstanding Option to reduce the exercise price. Furthermore, no Option shall be canceled in exchange for cash or replaced with Options having a lower exercise price without approval of the stockholders of the Company.

Electronic Delivery of Proxy Materials
We began providing proxy materials electronically to our stockholders in connection with our 2008 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and provide printed proxy materials only to stockholders that request them. This has reduced the number of proxy statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are printed and mailed each year from 43,000 copies of each document in 2007 to approximately 2,000 copies of each document each year.
If you currently receive printed copies of our proxy materials and you would like to reduce the environmental impact associated with printing and mailing future proxy materials to you, you can consent to receiving all future proxy statements, proxy cards and annual reports electronically via e-mail or the Internet. To sign up for electronic delivery, please follow the Internet voting instructions on your notice or proxy card and, when prompted, indicate that you agree to receive or access proxy materials electronically in future years.
Materials Sent to Stockholders Sharing the Same Surname and Address
Stockholders holding their shares in a brokerage account or bank account that share the same surname and address generally receive only one copy of the notice or materials. This practice conserves natural resources and reduces duplicate mailings and associated printing and postage costs. If you would like to receive a separate copy of the notice, our annual report and/or proxy statement, as applicable, or to receive separate copies of future mailings, please submit your request to the address or phone number that appears on your notice or proxy card. We will deliver such additional copies promptly upon receipt of such request. Stockholders receiving multiple copies at the same address may request that they receive only one.
