CORPORATE GOVERNANCE HIGHLIGHTS

A STRONG LINK BETWEEN PAY AND PERFORMANCE
2018 Performance
During 2018, the Company experienced significant financial challenges as a result of regulatory and economic headwinds. As a result of these unexpected changes in the global economy, the Company reduced its guidance to the financial community in September 2018 (the "Revised Guidance"). However, the 2018 total Company economic value ("EV") target goal under our annual incentive plan, the Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), was calculated based upon the Company achieving performance levels above the high end of the following guidance ranges (the "Original Guidance"):
Company performance relative to the Original Guidance did not reach the target level and resulted in an MIP payout at 92.5% of target. Details of this calculation are provided on page 37.
Notwithstanding the economic headwinds and the Revised Guidance, revenue was at a record level and the growth experienced in 2018 helped drive an annualized revenue growth rate of 7.1%, excluding the impact of currency and M&A, for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. This growth exceeded the weighted average growth in the vehicle markets served by the Company by 5.8%. This outstanding revenue growth resulted in a payout at 190% of target for the 2016-2018 relative revenue growth ("RRG") performance shares.
The Company's three-year stock performance was below the threshold required when compared to the peer group, and this resulted in no payout for the 2016-2018 relative total stockholder return ("TSR") performance shares.
2018 operational highlights versus the Original and Revised Guidance include:

[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
What Changed in 2018?
In 2018, to better align executive compensation to stockholder interest, we established EV performance targets under the MIP to provide maximum payout only if the Company performed in excess of the top of the range of the Original Guidance provided for those same measures. The maximum EV performance level for 2018 was set 12% higher than the target level, requiring significant outperformance beyond the Original Guidance to achieve a maximum payout. In addition, the Compensation Committee meaningfully increased the performance level required for a threshold payout and reduced the payout for threshold performance from 50% to 25% of the target award.
Stockholder Engagement
In 2018, management and our Board continued to conduct extensive outreach with our stockholders. We conducted outreach meetings primarily in December 2018. In total, we reached out to stockholders representing 53% of our outstanding shares (as of December 11, 2018) and held in-person meetings or calls with holders of 10% (as of December 11, 2018) and with proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Stockholder feedback was shared and discussed with the full Board. Topics discussed with investors included diversity, separation of the CEO and Chair positions, Board composition and refreshment, business strategy, and sustainability.
Our objective is to maintain an executive compensation program that:

We will also take action upon any other business as may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting and any adjournments or postponements of that meeting.

Proxy Statement
March 15, 2019
This proxy statement is furnished in connection with the solicitation of proxies by the Board of Directors (our "Board") of BorgWarner Inc. ("BorgWarner" or the "Company") for the Company's 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at our headquarters located at 3850 Hamlin Road, Auburn Hills, Michigan 48326 on Wednesday, April 24, 2019 at 9:00 a.m., local time, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.
As permitted by rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are providing our proxy statement, the form of proxy and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 to stockholders electronically via the internet. (Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, which includes our audited financial statements, is not to be regarded as proxy solicitation material.) Our proxy statement and our 2018 annual report to stockholders are available at http://www.proxyvote.com.
On or about March 15, 2019, we will initiate delivery of proxy materials to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 1, 2019 via (1) a notice containing instructions on how to access materials online, (2) a paper copy mailing or (3) e-mail distribution. If you received a notice containing access instructions by mail, you will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials in the mail. Instead, the notice we sent provides instructions on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the proxy materials. The notice also provides instructions on how you can submit your proxy over the internet or by telephone. If you received a notice containing access instructions by mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials or elect to receive the materials via e-mail in the future, please follow the instructions included in the notice. If you received a printed copy of proxy materials by mail and would instead like to register to receive a notice of internet availability of proxy materials in the future, you can do so by any of the methods that follow:
Table of Contents
Only stockholders of record at the close of business on March 1, 2019 are entitled to vote at the meeting. As of such date, there were 207,609,482 outstanding shares of common stock. A list of all record holders of our stock will be available for examination by stockholders during normal business hours at 3850 Hamlin Road, Auburn Hills, Michigan 48326 at least ten days prior to the Annual Meeting and will also be available for examination at the Annual Meeting. On each matter considered at our Annual Meeting, you are entitled to one vote for each of your shares of common stock.
You have a choice of voting over the internet, by telephone, in person, or by using a traditional proxy card.
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  To vote by internet, go to www.proxyvote.com and follow the instructions there. You will need the number included on your proxy card, voter instruction form, or notice containing access instructions. 
■  To vote by telephone, stockholders of record should dial 1-800-690-6903 and follow the instructions. Beneficial holders should dial the phone number listed on your voter instruction form. You will need the number included on your proxy card, voter instruction form or notice. 
■  To vote in person, you can attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. 
■  If you received a paper copy of a proxy card or voter instruction form, you can mark, sign, and date the proxy card and return it in the envelope that was provided to you. 
[END TABLE]
The deadline for voting by telephone or internet is 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on April 23, 2019.
If you properly sign and return your signed proxy card or vote by telephone or by the internet before the Annual Meeting, we will vote your shares as you direct. Any proxy returned without specification as to any matter will be voted as to each proposal in accordance with the recommendation of our Board.
If you hold your stock in "street name", you may change or revoke your voting instructions by following the specific directions provided to you by your bank or broker. If you are a stockholder of record, you may change or revoke your vote at any time before the vote is taken by delivering a written notice of revocation to the Secretary of the Company or by submitting another vote on or before April 23, 2019 (including a vote in person at the Annual Meeting). For all methods of voting, your last vote cast will supersede all of your previous votes.
The election inspectors will tabulate the votes cast prior to the meeting and at the meeting to determine whether a quorum is present. The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of common stock will constitute a quorum. A quorum is necessary to transact business at the Annual Meeting. Shares of common stock represented by proxies that reflect abstentions or "broker non-votes" (i.e., shares held by a broker or nominee that are represented at the Annual Meeting, but with respect to which such broker or nominee is not empowered to vote on a particular proposal) will be counted as present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum.
With respect to Proposal 1, our Amended and Restated By-laws ("By-laws") require that a director nominee will be elected in an uncontested election only if he or she receives a majority of the votes cast with respect to his or her election (that is, the number of shares voted "for" a director nominee must exceed the number of votes cast "against" that nominee). Each of our director nominees is currently serving on our Board. If a nominee who is currently serving as a Director is not re-elected, Delaware law provides that the Director would continue to serve on the board as a "holdover director." Under our By-laws and Corporate Governance Guidelines, each Director submits an advance, contingent, irrevocable resignation that our Board may accept if stockholders do not re-elect the Director. In that situation, our Corporate Governance Committee would make a recommendation to our Board about whether to accept or reject the resignation or whether to take other action. Our Board would act on the Corporate Governance Committee's recommendation and publicly disclose its decision and the rationale behind it within 90 days from the date that the election results were certified.
Table of Contents
If you hold your stock in street name, your brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to the election of directors without specific instructions from you as to how to vote with respect to the election of each of the nine nominees for director. These are called broker non-votes. Abstentions and broker non-votes represented by submitted proxies will not be taken into account in determining the outcome of the election of directors.
Each of Proposal 2 (the advisory vote on executive compensation), Proposal 3 (stockholder ratification of the selection of our auditors), and Proposal 4 (a stockholder proposal) requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast to be approved. Accordingly, an abstention or a broker non-vote will have no effect on the outcome of any of those proposals.
Proposal 2 is an advisory vote. Even though your vote with respect to Proposal 2 is advisory and therefore will not be binding on the Company, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held in 2017, stockholders selected annual frequency for stockholder consideration of executive compensation on an advisory basis. Stockholders must reconsider the desired frequency of such consideration in 2023.
We expect that only Proposal 3 will be considered "routine" under NYSE rules. Therefore, your brokerage firm or other nominee may not vote your shares with respect to Proposals 1, 2, or 4 without specific instructions from you as to how to vote.
We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which has been approved by the SEC. Under this procedure, a single copy of our annual report to stockholders, our proxy statement or our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, will be sent to any household at which two or more stockholders reside, unless one of the stockholders at that address notifies us that they wish to receive individual copies. This procedure reduces our printing costs and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards. Householding will not affect dividend check mailings, if any, in any way.
We will deliver promptly upon written or oral request a separate copy of our annual report to stockholders, our proxy statement or our Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, as applicable, to any stockholder at a shared address to which a single copy of those documents was delivered. If you share an address with another stockholder and you wish to receive a separate copy of any of those documents, you may inform us of your wish by contacting Investor Relations, 3850 Hamlin Road, Auburn Hills, Michigan 48326 (tel: +1-248-754-9200). Similarly, if you share an address with another stockholder that is receiving multiple copies and wish to request that the number of copies of those documents being delivered to that address be reduced to a single copy, you may inform us of your wish by contacting Investor Relations at the above address and telephone number.

Proposal 1 Election of Directors
At this meeting, stockholders will elect nine directors to a one-year term that will expire at our 2020 Annual Meeting and until their respective successors have been duly elected and qualified. After 13 years of service, Thomas T. Stallkamp will complete his service on our Board at the Annual Meeting due to meeting the retirement age for directors. After two years of service, Roger A. Krone chose not to stand for re-election at the Annual Meeting. The Company thanks Messrs. Stallkamp and Krone for their guidance and years of service.
Our Board takes a thoughtful approach to its composition and refreshment, with focus on creating a balanced Board that, as a whole, has the expertise, knowledge, and qualifications needed to guide the Company in execution of its business strategy. The Corporate Governance Committee seeks to establish and maintain a Board that is strong in its collective knowledge and that possesses a diversity of skills, background, and experience with respect to vision, strategy, and executive leadership, business judgment and knowledge, corporate governance, accounting and finance, global markets, clean technology, government experience, and automotive industry knowledge. The Committee understands the value of cognitive diversity in decision making and has sought and will continue to seek qualified women and members of minority groups as Board candidates.
The current slate of director nominees blends fresh perspectives of newer directors with the continuity and institutional knowledge of longer-tenured directors for an average tenure of less than seven years. After a third-party assisted search and qualification process, our Board was pleased to welcome Deborah D. McWhinney and Paul A. Mascarenas as new directors in 2018.
See page 23 for information on our process for director nominations and candidate requirements.
Following the election of directors at this Annual Meeting, our Board will have nine members and no vacancies. Each of the nominees for election has agreed to serve if elected. All of the nominees are currently directors of the Company. In the event that any nominee should become unavailable for election, our Board may designate a substitute nominee, in which event the shares represented by proxies at the meeting will be voted for such substitute nominee unless an instruction to the contrary is indicated on the proxy card.
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election of each of the nominees for director: Jan Carlson; Dennis C. Cuneo; Michael S. Hanley; Frédéric B. Lissalde; Paul A. Mascarenas; John R. McKernan, Jr.; Deborah D. McWhinney; Alexis P. Michas; and Vicki L. Sato.

The Non-Executive Chairman focuses on:
Director Michas, previously Lead Director, became Non-Executive Chairman in April 2013 upon the retirement of the previous Executive Chairman.

RISK OVERSIGHT
Our Board regularly and continually receives information intended to apprise it of the strategic, operational, commercial, financial, legal, and compliance risks the Company faces. Oversight of risk is an evolving process in which management assesses the degree to which risk management is integrated and continually seeks opportunities to further engrain enterprise risk management, into business processes throughout the organization. Our Board actively encourages management to continue to drive this evolution. In 2018, our Board endorsed the Company's continued enhancement of its enterprise risk management governance infrastructure, processes, integration, communications, and sustainability.
While our Board has responsibility for oversight of the Company's risk management practices, the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board contribute to the risk management oversight function. In particular, the Audit Committee focuses on financial and compliance risk, including internal controls and cyber-security risk management practices, and receives risk assessment and management reports from the Company's internal Enterprise Risk Management Committee and from the Company's information technology and internal audit functions. The members of the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the Company's Controller, Treasurer, Vice President of Internal Audit, Vice President of Strategic Risk Management, Director of Strategic Risk Management, Vice President and Chief Compliance Officer, Vice President, and Chief Information Officer and business operations leaders) have direct access to the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance Committees and our Board. The Audit Committee receives, reviews, and discusses regular reports from them concerning risk identification and assessment, risk management policies, and practices and mitigation initiatives, to assure that the risk management processes designed and implemented by the Company are adapted to the Company's strategy and are functioning as expected. In addition, as part of its compensation philosophy, the Compensation Committee strives to adopt compensation incentives that encourage appropriate risk-taking behavior that is consistent with the Company's long-term business strategy and objectives. The Corporate Governance Committee oversees risk management practices in its domain, including director candidate selection, governance, and succession matters.

Proposal 2Approval, by Advisory Vote, of the Compensation of Our Named Executive Officers
Our stockholders may approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed in accordance with the executive compensation disclosure rules contained in Item 402 of the SEC's Regulation S-K. Accordingly, we are seeking input from stockholders with this advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. The vote on this proposal is not intended to address any specific element of compensation; but rather, the overall compensation of our NEOs and the philosophy, policies and practices described in this proxy statement.
While this vote is advisory, and not binding on our Company, it provides valuable information to our Compensation Committee. Our Board and the Committee value the opinions of our stockholders.
Over the last several years, the Compensation Committee made several enhancements to the executive compensation program to address key concerns raised by stockholders during our extensive outreach and to better align with the Company's evolving strategy. The redesigned program has worked – effectively motivating our employees to deliver organic growth and take actions that resulted in an improvement in our stockholder returns in 2017, its first year of operation.
2018 follows a successful period when our Board and management redefined the Company's strategy to become a propulsion leader. In the second half of 2018, the U.S. government enacted tariffs directed at China (the largest growth market for the auto industry) that resulted in, among other things, rapid industry volume declines in China. As a result of these headwinds, the Company achieved mixed results for the year:
We recognize that our performance in 2018 did not meet all of our expectations for the year. However, we believe that our compensation program, as designed to address the underperformance in prior years and in response to stockholder feedback, has resulted in appropriate compensation for our executives in 2018 and will continue to incentivize our employees to deliver growth and stockholder return in the future.
Table of Contents
HIGHLIGHTS OF THE 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM
Table of Contents
We maintain the highest level of oversight of our executive compensation program. Our Board, our Chairman, CEO, and our Chief Human Resources Officer engage in a rigorous talent review process annually to address succession and executive development for our CEO and other key executives. We closely monitor the compensation programs and pay levels of executives from other companies that we believe to be similar to the Company in business characteristics and economics.
Accordingly, for the reasons we discuss above, our Board recommends that stockholders vote in favor of the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, compensation tables and narrative discussion.
The votes cast "for" this proposal must exceed the votes cast "against" this proposal for approval of the compensation of our named executive officers, assuming that a quorum is present. For purposes of determining the advisory vote regarding this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes do not constitute a vote "for" or "against" the proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of "votes cast." Proxies solicited by our Board will be voted "FOR" approval of the compensation unless a stockholder specifies otherwise.

Attracting and retaining a highly-talented workforce – at all levels within our organization – is a top priority at BorgWarner. We are committed to providing competitive compensation opportunities designed to deliver equal pay for equal work regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender.
As part of our regular compensation process, our Board and senior management team, with input from outside, independent compensation consultants, conduct comprehensive analyses to ensure that our compensation programs continue to support our business strategy, pay-for-performance philosophy, and competitive pay practices. Through this work, we can make informed decisions about each employee's compensation in the context of their role at the Company, experience, geography, and performance to determine if any adjustments are needed to align pay with external market practices or internal comparable positions.
We also strive to ensure pay equity among comparable jobs across the Company. To this end, we conduct a deeper evaluation that looks closely at pay among our employees performing comparable work to understand where pay disparities might exist, taking into account responsibility level, performance and experience. Where areas for improvement are found, we take corrective action — reinforcing our commitment to a diverse and inclusive culture where all our employees are paid in an equitable manner and have equal opportunities for success.
Management regularly reports to our Board on each of these efforts, consistent with our Board's commitment to the same goals.
In addition to these priorities, our Compensation Committee has identified the following key components of our executive compensation philosophy.
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Align the interests of our executives with the long-term interests of the business, our stockholders, and employees 
■  Motivate exceptional performance through measurable metrics that support our long-term strategy of growth and value creation 
■  Attract, develop, motivate, and retain top global talent 
■  Pay competitively across salary grades in all regions of the world 
■  Apply compensation program design in a consistent manner across the organization 
■  Mitigate excessive risk taking 
■  Reflect the input of our stockholders

BorgWarner is a leading producer of highly-engineered components and systems for vehicle propulsion worldwide. During 2018, the Company experienced significant financial challenges as a result of the rapid industry volume declines in Europe and China in the second half of 2018 and regulatory and economic headwinds. As a result of these unexpected changes in the global economy, the Company reduced its guidance, or Revised Guidance, to the financial community in September 2018. The Compensation Committee set the 2018 total Company EV target under the MIP above the high end of the Original Guidance (please see page 6), but performance did not reach the target level and resulted in a MIP payout at 92.5% of target. Details of this calculation are provided on page 40.
Despite the economic headwinds and the Revised Guidance, revenue was at a record level and the revenue growth we experienced in 2018 helped drive an annualized growth rate of 7.1%, excluding the impact of currency and M&A, for the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. This growth exceeded the weighted average growth in the vehicle markets that the Company serves by 5.8%.
2018 operational highlights versus the Original and Revised Guidance include:
In support of our compensation philosophy, our annual and long-term incentive plans are based on measurable and objective performance metrics, with outcomes strongly linked to our short-term operational performance and long-term market performance. For 2018, the impact of Company performance over the past one- and three-year performance cycles translated into a mix of long-term incentive outcomes:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Three-year relative total stockholder return, or TSR, was below threshold ➔ no performance shares earned 
■  Three-year relative revenue growth, or RRG, was above target ➔ performance shares earned at 190% of target 
■  Economic value, or EV, in line with expectations, slightly below target ➔ cash incentive earned at 92.5% of target

Effective August 1, 2018, we named Frédéric B. Lissalde President and CEO, replacing James R. Verrier. Approximately 86% of target compensation established when we promoted Mr. Lissalde to CEO is tied to performance, with the majority tied to long-term growth and stockholder returns. A significant portion of compensation is at-risk and dependent upon the achievement of rigorous and objective performance requirements.
2018 CEO Compensation
Table of Contents
Realized compensation for the CEO position over the last three years is 20% below the values reported in the summary compensation table, primarily because we have not made payouts under our relative TSR performance share awards for any of the last three 3-year periods. We believe this demonstrates strong-pay-for-performance alignment.
Three-Year CEO Compensation (in 000s)
The Compensation Committee and our Board were pleased that our stockholders continued to support our executive compensation program which was enhanced in part as a result of our outreach efforts in 2016 and 2017. Our say-on-pay proposal received support from 94% of votes cast at our 2018 Annual Meeting. We engaged with stockholders during the fall of 2018 and continued to receive positive feedback on the program and changes that we have made to our executive compensation disclosures.
The Company is committed to continuing this dialog with stockholders, as this feedback helps inform the Board and is a factor in making executive compensation decisions.

Executive Compensation Program Elements
Our Compensation Committee performs a strategic review of our executive officers' compensation at least annually, in addition to discussions at Compensation Committee meetings held throughout the year. During this review, the Compensation Committee evaluates our compensation philosophy and objectives to ensure that they continue to reflect our intention to pay for performance, our business strategies, competitive realities, and our Board's determination of what is in the best interests of stockholders. The Committee also considers feedback from our stockholders. Our Compensation Committee then determines whether our compensation program meets these objectives, provides adequate incentives and motivation to our executive officers, and adequately compensates our executive officers relative to comparable officers at other companies with which we compete for executive talent. As part of this strategic review for 2018, our Compensation Committee determined the compensation of our Senior Executive Team including our CEO, former CEO, former CFO, former Chief Legal Officer and the three other officers whose compensation is detailed in the Summary Compensation Table on page 45. For compensation decisions relating to executive officers other than our CEO, our Compensation Committee considers recommendations from our CEO.
The key elements of our executive compensation program are base salary, short-term incentives through our Management Incentive Plan ("MIP"), and long-term incentives in the form of performance shares and restricted stock. We strive to have each compensation element complement the others and reward the achievement of short-term and long-term business objectives.
The MIP is our cash-based, annual incentive plan for executives. We have designed it to focus key managers on creating EV for the Company and reinforce teamwork and collaboration by measuring the management team at each business as well as the results for the combined business. EV is the concept that capital has a cost and that earning more than the cost of capital creates value for our stockholders. It is true economic profit. EV is the foundation on which we operate and a very dynamic measure of how well we turn investments into increased stockholder value. It is based on our belief that a business can be financially strong in the long run only if it consistently earns enough to cover its operating cost and, at the same time, produces enough additional earnings to cover its cost of capital. We calculate EV for purposes of the MIP as follows:

MIP TARGETS AND AWARDS
The following describes the MIP structure, goal-setting process, and resulting payouts:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Beginning in 2017, the Compensation Committee establishes threshold, target, and maximum performance goals for the Company and business segments at the beginning of the fiscal year considering the broader economic  environment, industry conditions and the Company's current guidance and past performance with respect to operating earnings and cash flow generation. 
■  In 2018, to further increase the rigor of the MIP, and to drive enhanced performance and stockholder value, the Compensation Committee set the target performance level above the high end of the Original Guidance  range. It set the maximum EV performance level for 2018 12% higher than the target level, requiring significant outperformance beyond guidance to achieve a maximum payout. 
■  The Compensation Committee also meaningfully increased the performance required for a threshold award over the 2017 level while decreasing the payout for threshold performance from 50% of target to 25%. The  Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust EV results for non-comparable items such as restructuring, M&A costs, and significant unusual business conditions and is authorized to reduce actual payouts at its discretion. 
■  Based upon the above criteria, the Compensation Committee established 2018 threshold, target, and maximum performance levels for the total Company as follows: 
[END TABLE]
2018 EV Performance Target
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  The target bonus opportunity for our NEOs for 2018 ranged from 75% to 150% of base salary in accordance with the annual cash incentives market review described on page 33. 
■  Actual performance is measured at the close of the fiscal year, with any earned bonuses paid in the first quarter of the following year. 
■  NEOs receive 25% of the target opportunity for achieving threshold performance and 200% of the target opportunity for achieving maximum performance or above, with results in between these levels  interpolated. 
■  NEO bonus opportunities are weighted based upon the EV performance at the total Company, segment or business unit levels, depending on each NEO's responsibilities. For 2018, the weightings were as  follows: 
[END TABLE]
Table of Contents
We determined the 2018 actual EV as follows using amounts from the Company's reported financial results which were adjusted for non-comparable items as reported in the Company's financial statements, including restructuring, and were also adjusted due to unusual significant business conditions.
(in millions)
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Based on this EV achievement, executives earned actual bonuses related to the total Company performance at 92.5% of target. For our CEO, Frédéric Lissalde, this provided the following bonus payout:

2019 MIP
The Compensation Committee again established the 2019 target, threshold, and maximum EV achievement levels to directly link executive compensation to executives' ability to drive results and create stockholder value. While the Compensation Committee set the 2019 target below 2018 actual for EV, the Compensation Committee considered the following in setting the performance levels: expectations for the broader economic environment, regulatory and economic headwinds impacting conditions in our industry, and alignment with the Company's current guidance and past performance with respect to operating earnings and cash flow generation. The Compensation Committee has discretion to adjust EV results for non-comparable items such as M&A costs and is authorized to reduce actual payments at its discretion.
In 2019, the Compensation Committee set the maximum performance level 12% higher than the target level requiring significant outperformance beyond guidance to achieve a maximum payout. To improve the Company's cash position, management recommended and the Compensation Committee approved the addition of a cash flow metric to the MIP with 20% of the overall payout tied to this measure. The 2019 EV and cash flow performance targets are as follows:
We believe that long-term performance is driven through an ownership culture that rewards our executives for maximizing long-term stockholder value. Our long-term incentive plans provide participants with appropriate incentives to acquire equity interests in our Company and align their interests with the interests of our stockholders.
We deliver two-thirds of the total value of the target long-term incentive opportunity through performance shares and one-third through restricted stock. Our Compensation Committee has determined to place greater emphasis on performance shares due to the significant challenges in the automotive industry, providing a more direct comparison of our longer-term performance to that of our industry peers, and firmly aligning our executives' interests with the interests of our stockholders.
PERFORMANCE SHARES
The Compensation Committee designed the performance share awards for a select group of senior executives to provide a competitive payout at the end of a three-year performance period, with goals set at the beginning of each performance period. A new performance period begins each January 1 and ends three years later on December 31.
Beginning with 2016 grants, performance shares may be earned based on achievement of two equally-weighted metrics: relative TSR and RRG. The combination of TSR and RRG provides the appropriate balance in the long-term incentive plan – TSR goals focus management on increasing stockholder value, and RRG focuses management on the long-term growth and success of our business under the current strategy.
We expressed both the TSR and RRG target awards in terms of a number of performance shares. We use a consistent methodology for converting the target dollar amount to a specific number of shares: the average closing price of the Company's common stock for the last five trading days of the year preceding the date of grant, which coincides with the end of the prior performance period. We determine payouts at the end of the three-year performance period based on the rank of the Company's TSR compared to those of a peer group of companies ("Peer Group Companies") and RRG compared to the weighted average growth in vehicle production.
Table of Contents
Performance Share Award Payout Schedule
In 2017, the Committee began to align target award levels under the long-term incentive program to the median of the market and as a result adopted a new relative TSR payout schedule which aligned a target award payout to performance at the median of the peer group. The relative TSR payout schedule is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Level       Percentile Rank – TSR        Award Payout as Percent of Target* 
[END TABLE]
The RRG payout schedule is as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
Level       Revenue Growth above Vehicle Production Growth        Award Payout as Percent of Target* 
[END TABLE]
Relative TSR Peer Group
To improve the clarity in the Company's approach to executive compensation, the Compensation Committee determined to use a single peer group beginning in 2018 for purposes of determining relative TSR under its performance share program and for establishing market compensation levels. The single peer group includes companies of similar size, industry and global presence, and with which the Company competes for talent. Beginning with performance shares granted in 2018, the Compensation Committee approved a new peer group which includes the following companies:
Table of Contents
The prior peer group continues to be used for performance periods prior to 2018. The prior peer group included the publicly-traded companies in the automotive supplier industry with at least $1 billion in annual sales listed below. We had selected this group because we competed with these companies for stockholder investment dollars.
No Relative TSR Payout for 2016-2018. For the 2016-2018 performance period, the Company's TSR was below the 25th percentile of the peer group resulting in no payout of performance shares for that performance period.
RRG Payout for 2016-2018. For the 2016-2018 performance period, the Company's revenue growth, excluding the impact of changes in currency values and merger, acquisition and divestiture activity, was 7.1% while the weighted average vehicle production increase was 1.3%. The 5.8% outperformance resulted in a 2016-2018 RRG performance share payout of 190% of target. We detail below the shares earned by our NEOs, and we reflect them in the Options Exercised and Stock Vested table on page 51.
[BEGIN TABLE]
NEO        Relative Revenue Shares at Target       Shares Earned 
[END TABLE]
RESTRICTED STOCK
Restricted stock awards incent and reward executives for improving long-term stock value and serve as a retention tool. Generally, we grant restricted stock in February and one-half of the shares granted will vest on the second anniversary of the grant and the remainder of the shares granted will vest on the third anniversary of the grant, in each instance provided that the recipient is still employed by the Company.
In response to stockholder feedback, all restricted stock grants in 2017 and later are subject to a double-trigger change of control provision, meaning shares of restricted stock will automatically accelerate and become fully vested only if the Company terminates an NEO's employment other than for cause, or the NEO elects to terminate employment for good reason, during the restriction period following a Change of Control.
BASE SALARY
We establish executives' base salaries in accordance with the scope of the executive's responsibilities, time in position and potential, the competitive market and internal equity. When considering market competitive base salaries, we target the median level among our peer group companies, which we determine annually. We review base salaries annually and adjust as appropriate to realign salaries with market levels after taking into account changes in individual responsibilities, individual and business performance, and experience. We increased the base salary for each of our NEOs during 2018. We increased the annual base salary for Mr. Lissalde from $850,000 to $1,100,000 when he was promoted to President and CEO, effective August 1, 2018.
Table of Contents
EXECUTIVE BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES
NEOs are eligible to participate in employee benefit plans on the same basis as other employees (such as medical, dental, and vision care plans; health care flexible spending accounts; life, accidental death and dismemberment, and disability insurance; employee assistance programs; and a defined contribution retirement plan including a 401(k) feature). The retirement plans described on page 52 are provided to all employees to permit them to accumulate funds for retirement and to provide a competitive retirement package.
Our U.S.-based executives who exceed the limits under the qualified BorgWarner Inc. Retirement Savings Plan ("RSP") participate in the BorgWarner Inc. Retirement Savings Excess Benefit Plan ("Excess Plan"). All of our NEOs received Company contributions under the Excess Plan in 2018. For further detail, see page 52 under the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation section.
The benefits and perquisites we provide to executives are currently at or below median competitive levels for comparable companies. Executive perquisites for the U.S.-based NEOs are limited to a taxable annual perquisite allowance in lieu of awarding individual perquisites. We do not provide tax gross-ups on benefits or perquisites. On certain occasions, an NEO's spouse or other family member may accompany the NEO on a business trip in which a company aircraft is utilized. No additional direct operating cost is incurred in such situations because there is no incremental cost associated with the additional traveler.
Except as described in the Pension Benefits table on page 51, none of our NEOs participate in or have account balances in any of the Company-sponsored qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plans.
We entered into Change of Control Employment Agreements, or COC Agreements, with each of our NEOs and certain other executives. In establishing the COC Agreements, our Board determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to (i) maintain NEOs' continued dedication in the event of either a contemplated or actual change of control, and (ii) provide two to three years of compensation to NEOs terminated in connection with a change of control so as to focus their attention on executing the transaction rather than the personal uncertainties and risks associated with such change of control.
COC Agreements: (i) do not provide for excise tax gross-up provisions, (ii) condition the receipt of certain benefits on the execution of a non-compete agreement and (iii) incorporate a clause that allows an executive to forego certain benefits in the event that receipt would trigger the excise tax. See pages 53 and 54 for further details.
Each of our NEOs is eligible for severance benefits under the BorgWarner Inc. Transitional Income Plan, or TIP. The TIP was established to provide some financial protection to all U.S. salaried employees in the event that their employment is terminated for reasons beyond their control. The TIP benefit includes a lump sum payment that is based on salary level and length of service (with a maximum benefit of 26 weeks of base salary, adjusted for unemployment benefits) and medical coverage. In no event would a NEO receive a payment under both the COC Agreement and the TIP.

Executive Compensation Process and Practices
In evaluating and setting compensation, our Compensation Committee considers a number of factors including individual and business performance, internal equity, retention, the degree of alignment between the incumbent's job duties and the benchmarked job description, as well as an assessment of market practices. The Compensation Committee believes that benchmarking is a useful tool because it reflects the market in which we compete for talent and provides credibility for our compensation programs with our employees and stockholders.
During 2017, our Compensation Committee approved a new peer group to be used for establishing market compensation for 2018 and later as well as for determining relative stockholder performance under the Company's performance share program. Due to differences in size among our peer group companies, we use a regression analysis to normalize the survey results to better reflect the size of our Company relative to that of our peer group companies.
The peer group used for 2018 compensation decisions is the same as the Relative TSR Peer Group listed on page 39.
Our Compensation Committee retained Pearl Meyer as its independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee annually reviews its relationship with Pearl Meyer to ensure continued independence. The review process includes consideration of the factors impacting independence set forth in New York Stock Exchange rules. Pearl Meyer reports directly to the Compensation Committee and does not perform any other services for the Company or management.
Pearl Meyer regularly participates in Compensation Committee meetings, and in collaboration with the Compensation Committee, aids in determining the appropriate compensation program, design, levels, and peer groups for the Company.
Each year, the Compensation Committee oversees a risk assessment of the Company's executive compensation program. Based on its most recent review, the Compensation Committee concluded that our compensation program and practices do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. Our executive compensation program includes a number of features that mitigate unnecessary risk taking, including a balance of short- and long-term incentives, with long-term incentives comprising the majority of our executives' compensation; a mix of performance metrics on our short- and long-term incentive programs; clawback provisions; and stock ownership guidelines.
Table of Contents
STOCK OWNERSHIP GUIDELINES
To promote equity ownership and align the interests of management and our stockholders, we have established stock ownership guidelines that outline our expectations for our executives to hold a significant and sustained long-term personal financial interest in the Company. During 2017, the Compensation Committee approved the following new guidelines:
Executives are expected to meet the guidelines within five years after appointment as an officer. Shares counted to meet the ownership guidelines include vested and non-vested restricted shares, vested performance share awards and shares held by the executive under the RSP, and the Excess Plan. The Committee also approved a holding requirement for officers who do not meet their ownership guideline; officers must hold at least 50% of any performance share awards or restricted shares that become vested until their ownership guideline is met. Our Compensation Committee reviews the ownership level for our CEO and all other persons covered under this guideline each year.
SHORT SALES; PLEDGING
Generally, our Insider Trading and Confidentiality Policy prohibits our directors and employees from engaging in any transaction involving a put, call, or other option on BorgWarner securities, from selling any BorgWarner securities he or she does not own (i.e., "selling short"), and from pledging any BorgWarner securities as collateral to secure personal loans or other obligations.
CLAWBACK POLICY
Our Board adopted a policy setting forth procedures to recover payment in the event that an executive engages in any fraud or intentional illegal conduct that materially contributed to the need for a restatement of the Company's publicly filed financial results.Performance-based compensation received by the executive during the three-year period preceding the restatement will be subject to reduction or reimbursement to the Company at the Compensation Committee's discretion.
Code Section 162(m) generally provides that a public corporation may not deduct for tax purposes compensation in excess of $1 million that it paid for any fiscal year to certain covered employees. Starting with the 2018 fiscal year, as a result of the changes that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made to Code Section 162(m), the covered employees for any fiscal year will include any person who served as our CEO or CFO at any point during the fiscal year, any other person whose compensation was otherwise required to be included in our proxy statement by reason of being among the three highest compensated officers for the fiscal year and any other person who was a covered employee for any preceding fiscal year beginning after December 31, 2016. Prior to the changes that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made to Code Section 162(m), qualifying performance-based compensation was exempt from the $1 million limit on deductibility. Starting with the 2018 fiscal year, only qualifying performance-based compensation that we pay pursuant to a binding contract that was in effect on November 2, 2017 and was not materially modified after that date will continue to be exempt from the deduction limit. Accordingly, any compensation paid pursuant to compensation arrangements entered into or materially modified after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will be subject to the $1 million fiscal year deduction limit if paid to a covered employee. In determining our executive compensation for 2018, we considered the tax deductibility of compensation as well as the goals of our compensation program, and we retained the flexibility to provide compensation that is consistent with our goals, even if such compensation would not be fully tax-deductible. Because many different factors influence a well-rounded, comprehensive executive compensation program, some of the compensation we provide to our executive officers is likely to be not fully deductible due to Code Section 162(m).

Executive Compensation Tables
The following table sets forth information regarding compensation for our NEOs for the last three fiscal years:
Table of Contents
Effective August 1, 2018, Frédéric B. Lissalde replaced James R. Verrier as President & CEO and was appointed to our Board. Mr. Lissalde has been with the Company for 19 years and has served in roles of increasing responsibility, including COO and President & General Manager of Turbo Systems. To support a successful transition, Mr. Verrier served in a non-executive advisory role to our Board and Mr. Lissalde through February 28, 2019. This transition reflects our Board's rigorous and ongoing talent review process, which includes consideration of backgrounds, capabilities, and development opportunities for potential internal successors. Our Board, which works closely with our President & CEO and other members of the management team to address succession, fostered a successful CEO transition that was effective in helping the Company deliver strong execution in 2018 despite industry volatility.
For 2018, the ratio of our CEO's compensation to our median employee was 110 to 1. This ratio is significantly lower than in 2017 because our current CEO did not serve in the role for all of 2018.
The median employee was identified by ranking the total cash compensation of our worldwide employees, excluding employees from India (626 employees), Portugal (696 employees), and Thailand (67 employees), who in aggregate represented less than 5% of the Company's total employees. As a result of these exclusions, which are permitted under SEC regulations, the number of non-U.S. employees included in the median employee determination decreased from 22,928 to 21,539. The number of U.S. employees in the determination was 6,044. Total cash compensation included base wages, overtime pay, target annual bonuses, and any cash allowances paid to employees.
The median employee for 2018 is from Sweden, and their 2018 compensation was $45,547. The median employee's 2018 compensation was calculated, under the methodology employed for the Summary Compensation Table, and compared to our CEO's 2018 compensation to determine the ratio. Our CEOs total annual compensation, calculated on the same basis, was $5,008,443, producing a pay ratio of 110:1. Given the different methodologies that various public companies use to determine an estimate of their pay ratio, as well as differences in business models and workforce strategies, the estimated ratio reported above should not be used as a basis for comparison between companies.
On June 5, 2018, the Company entered into a Transition and Retirement Agreement with Mr. Verrier. The agreement provided for the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Continued service as an employee advisor to our Board and to Mr. Lissalde, as successor CEO, effective August 1, 2018 and ending with retirement on February 28, 2019. He received a monthly salary of $71,429 for this advisory role. 
■  Participation in the 2018 MIP prorated to reflect only the time he served as CEO during 2018.

■  Continued coverage for Mr. Gasparovic and his dependents for group health, dental, and vision benefits (but no other benefits) from May 18, 2018 through the earlier of November 18, 2019 or the date on which Mr. Gasparovic becomes eligible for group health insurance under another employer's group health plan. 
■  75% participation in under the Company's bonus plan for 2018. 
■  Treatment of outstanding performance shares in a manner consistent with other executive retirements as follows:

Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the RSP. This plan, which is available to all U.S. salaried and hourly employees, allows our NEOs to take advantage of current tax-advantaged opportunities for accumulating future retirement income. The RSP is comprised of two primary components: a Company Retirement Account and a Savings Account with a match feature. In the Company Retirement Account, the Company makes a contribution to the employee's account each pay period based on years of service and eligible pay. For the majority of employees, including our NEOs, this ranges from 4% to 6% of compensation up to the Social Security wage base and from 8% to 11.5% of compensation above the Social Security wage base. In the Savings Account, participants may make contributions to the plan of 1% to 70% of their eligible earnings on a before-tax and/ or after-tax basis (up to the statutorily prescribed annual limit on pre-tax contributions under the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"). The Company matches 100% of the first 3% of the employee's pre-tax contributions. Participant contributions are held in trust as required by law. All employee contributions are 100% vested when contributed. The first 3% of compensation contributed to the Company Retirement Account vests immediately and any other employer contributions vest 100% after three years of service.
Mr. Verrier participated in the BorgWarner Pension Plan while working for the Company in the United Kingdom from 1989 to 1996. The plan, which was frozen to additional benefit accruals as of April 1, 2007, was a contributory defined benefit pension plan with a normal retirement age of 65. Participants earned 1/60th of the average of their highest three consecutive years of gross earnings out of their last ten years of gross earnings for each year of credited service under the plan. Deferred pensions are increased annually for inflation up to a maximum of 5% per year. A similar inflation adjustment is applied once pension payments begin.
The present value of Accumulated Pension Benefits as of December 31, 2018 for Mr. Verrier is calculated using the following assumptions:
The following table shows the non-qualified deferred compensation activity for our NEOs during 2018.
The Excess Plan is an unfunded, non-qualified retirement plan, which keeps certain highly compensated U.S. employees whole with regard to Company contributions that are otherwise limited under the RSP by IRC provisions. Participation is automatic once these limits are reached in a plan year. The contributions vest in the same manner as under the RSP. Distributions are made following a participant's separation from service, with distributions attributable to amounts earned or vested before January 1, 2005 distributed within 30 days of participant's separation from service and amounts earned or vested after December 31, 2004 distributed in the seventh month following the month in which the participant's separation from service occurs. No in-service withdrawals or loans are available.
Excess Plan balances are invested in the same investment choices that are selected by the participants under the RSP. As these plans are unfunded, no money is actually invested. Rather, a notional account is maintained which mirrors the returns of these investments.
Table of Contents
The following table shows the post-employment payments that would be paid to each of our NEOs under certain COC related events. The calculations assume each NEO's employment is terminated on December 31, 2018. For purposes of the calculations, the closing stock price on the last business day of 2018 ($34.74) was used to determine the vested market value of restricted stock.
CHANGE OF CONTROL EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS
New COC Agreements were implemented beginning in 2009 for new and future officers of the Company. The new COC Agreements eliminate excise tax gross-up provisions, allow a portion of the benefit to be attributable to a non-compete agreement in order to reduce the potential for the excise tax, and allow executives to forego a portion of benefits if the benefit triggers the excise tax.
Below is a general description of the material terms and conditions of our existing COC Agreements.
In the event that a NEO terminates employment for Good Reason or the Company terminates a NEO's employment with the Company without Cause within two to three years of a COC or in anticipation of a COC, the NEO is entitled to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  a lump sum cash amount equal to two to three times his or her annual base salary and average annual bonus for the most recent three years 
[END TABLE]
"Change of Control" generally means (a) the acquisition by any party of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of either (i) the then outstanding shares of our common stock or (ii) the combined voting power of our then outstanding voting securities entitled to vote generally in the election of our directors, (b) a change in the majority of our Board of Directors, (c) a major corporate transaction, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, which results in a change in the majority of our Board of Directors or a majority of stockholders or (d) a complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company.

"Cause" generally means the willful and continued failure of the executive to perform substantially the executive's duties or the willful engaging by the executive in illegal conduct or gross misconduct materially injurious to us.
"Good Reason" generally means the diminution of responsibilities, authority or duties, our failure to comply with compensation or benefit provisions, transfer to a new work location more than 35 miles from the executive's previous work location, a purported termination of the COC Agreement by us other than in accordance with the COC Agreement, or our failure to require any successor to us to comply with the COC Agreement.
TERMINATIONS NOT RELATED TO A COC
In the event of an involuntary or voluntary termination with or without Cause not in connection with a COC, no additional payments are made to NEOs.
In the event of termination of employment by retirement not in connection with a COC, no additional payments are made to NEOs.
The stated amounts do not include life or disability insurance benefits or vested benefits under the qualified RSP or under the TIP, as these benefit plans are available to all U.S.-based salaried employees. The provisions of each plan would determine the timing and method of payments made under the above scenarios.
The following table details the compensation earned by each non-employee director who served on the Board of Directors in 2018. Directors who are employees of BorgWarner are not compensated for their service on the Board:
Table of Contents
Annual compensation for our non-employee directors for 2018 was comprised of the following components: annual cash retainer, and equity compensation consisting of restricted stock for board service, and retainers for committee service. Our non-employee directors were not granted any Stock Option Awards and did not receive any Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation for 2018.
In 2018, non-employee directors' annual cash retainer for board service was $97,500 and annual equity compensation was $130,000 worth of restricted stock. Committee members received annual retainers as follows for each committee on which they served: $6,000 for the Corporate Governance Committee; $9,000 for the Compensation Committee, and $7,500 for the Audit Committee. Chairs of the committees received the following additional annual retainers for their service to the committees: $6,000 for Corporate Governance, $9,000 for Compensation and $17,500 for Audit in view of their commitment of additional time to their oversight of the committees. The Non-Executive Chair's compensation was $410,900 consisting of an annual cash retainer of $280,900 and an equity retainer of $130,000 granted in restricted stock. Board and standing committee meeting attendance fees are not paid. Non-employee directors are paid up to $1,000 per day for their attendance requested by the Company at meetings or events not associated with board or committee meetings. Additional compensation arrangements may be made if special committees are convened, though none are planned at this time.
Effective January 1, 2019, following a market analysis of director compensation, Pearl Meyer recommended an increase in director compensation as follows: (i) non-employee director compensation was increased to $110,000 annual cash retainer; and, (ii) annual equity compensation of $130,000 worth of restricted stock. Compensation for the Non-Executive Chairman, retainers for service on committees, as committee chairs, and for requested meetings not associated with board or committee meetings will remain unchanged from 2018.
The stock ownership expectation of non-employee directors is an amount equivalent to five times the amount of the annual cash retainer for board service within five years of January 1, 2016 or within five years of joining the Board of Directors thereafter. All of our directors met the stock ownership guidelines in 2018 or were appropriately progressing toward meeting them.

Proposal 3 Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, its member firms, and their respective affiliates (collectively, "PwC") an independent registered public accounting firm, performed an audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee has selected PwC to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2019 fiscal year, and the Audit Committee is presenting this selection to stockholders for ratification. Representatives of PwC will be present at the Annual Meeting to respond to stockholders' questions, and will have an opportunity, if they desire, to make a statement.
If the stockholders do not ratify the engagement of PwC at the Annual Meeting, the adverse vote will be considered a direction to the Audit Committee to consider other auditors for next year. However, because of the difficulty in making any substitution of auditors so long after the beginning of the current year, the selection for 2019 will stand unless the Audit Committee finds other good reason for making a change.
To ratify the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, the votes cast "for" this proposal must exceed the votes cast "against" it. For purposes of determining the vote regarding this proposal, abstentions and broker non-votes (if any) do not constitute a vote "for" or "against" the proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of "votes cast." Unless you specify otherwise in your proxy, the persons you have appointed will vote your shares "FOR" ratification of the selection of PwC as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.
The aggregate fees billed to us for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 by PwC for professional services were as follows:

Your Audit Committee has adopted procedures for pre-approving all audit and audit-related services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm, including the fees and terms of such services. These procedures include reviewing detailed back-up documentation for audit and permitted audit-related services. The documentation includes a description of, and a budgeted amount for, particular categories of audit-related and tax services that are recurring in nature and therefore anticipated at the time that the budget is submitted. Audit Committee approval is required to exceed the pre-approved amount for a particular category of audit services, audit-related services or tax-services, and to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for any non-audit services not included in those pre-approved amounts. For these types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee considers whether such services are consistent with the rules on auditor independence promulgated by the SEC and the PCAOB. The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, based on such reasons as the auditor's familiarity with the Company's business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile, and whether the services enhance the Company's ability to manage or control risks and improve audit quality. The Audit Committee may form, and delegate pre-approval authority to, subcommittees consisting of one or more members of the Audit Committee, and such subcommittees must report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. All services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm were pre-approved by your Audit Committee.
In September 2018, the Company restated its audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 to correct an error related to the Company's accounting for its asbestos-related claims that had not yet been asserted.
The Audit Committee concluded on June 12, 2018, after careful consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, including discussions with the SEC and following consultation with the Company's management and PwC, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, that the Company's consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 should be restated due to the Company's re-evaluation of its accounting for liabilities relating to the estimated value of incurred but not reported asbestos-related claims ("IBNR Claims") and their associated defense costs.
The principal effects of the restatement were:
The restatement did not affect the Company's previously reported results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 or the consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2016, which were not restated. It also did not impact the net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities, and/or net cash from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in any period.

Affirmative steps to enhance our internal control over financial reporting
During 2016, the Company made enhancements to its analytical and review controls for the estimation of probable losses for asbestos claims designed to ensure the financial statements and related disclosures are in accordance with US GAAP. These enhancements included the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
■  Additional procedures for the preparation and review of detailed quantitative analysis of trends in the Company's claims data for recent years that supplemented the largely-qualitative analysis that had been performed by the Company in prior periods. 
■  Establishing new procedures to compare the Company's claims experience to external data points. 
■  Retaining an actuarial consultant to prepare an estimate of the Company's asbestos-related liabilities for consideration by management and operating existing Company controls over the supervision and review of the actuary's work. 
[END TABLE]
The control deficiencies resulting in the material weakness were remediated as of December 31, 2018
Management has evaluated the effect of the restatement on the Company's internal control over financial reporting and has determined that the identified material weakness no longer existed subsequent to December 31, 2016 as a result of the enhancements made to the Company's controls in 2016 and the subsequent changes in the nature and volume of amounts exposed to the deficiency. These enhancements resulted in additional information being made available to management, including improving its ability to assess whether a new estimate represents a change in estimate or correction of error.
Internal controls are designed and operating effectively
As disclosed in Section 9A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2018, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company's internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).
Management has not identified any other material weaknesses in prior periods or any unremediated material weaknesses. Management continues to consider opportunities to further enhance existing controls, including to respond to evolving facts and circumstances.

Report of the BorgWarner Inc. Audit Committee
Management of your Company is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of your Company's consolidated financial statements and for the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management and the Company's internal auditing department are responsible for maintaining its accounting and financial reporting principles and internal controls and procedures designed to maintain compliance with accounting standards and applicable laws and regulations. PwC was the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company in 2018 and was responsible for performing independent audits of your Company's consolidated financial statements and of the design and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, and expressing an opinion on (1) the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and (2) the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Audit Committee is directly responsible for the selection, appointment, compensation, retention, and oversight of the independent registered public accounting firm.
In the performance of its oversight function, the Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with management and PwC the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Audit Committee also has discussed with PwC the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 16 "Communications with Audit Committees." The Audit Committee received from PwC the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed with PwC their independence. The Audit Committee has concluded that PwC's provision of audit and non-audit services to the Company is compatible with their independence.
The Audit Committee discussed with PwC the overall scope and plans for their audit. The Audit Committee met with PwC, with and without management present, to discuss the results of their audits, the evaluations of the Company's internal controls, and the overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. In addition, the Audit Committee provided guidance and oversight to the internal audit function, including the audit plan, and results of internal audit activity. The Vice President of Internal Audit has direct access to the Audit Committee to discuss any matters desired, and the Vice President of Internal Audit presented an update of internal audit activity at each regularly scheduled Audit Committee meeting.
The members of the Audit Committee are not full-time employees of your Company and are not performing the functions of auditors or accountants. It is not the duty or responsibility of the Audit Committee or its members to conduct "field work" or other types of auditing or accounting reviews or procedures or to set auditor independence standards. Members of the Audit Committee necessarily rely on the information provided to them by management and the independent registered public accounting firm. Accordingly, the Audit Committee's considerations and discussions referred to above do not assure that the audit of the Company's financial statements has been carried out in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, that the financial statements are presented in accordance with GAAP, or that the Company's independent registered public accounting firm is "independent." 
Based upon the reports and discussions described in this report, and subject to the limitations on the role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee that are described above and in the Audit Committee's charter, the Audit Committee recommended to our Board that the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for filing with the SEC. PwC has been retained as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm continuously since their initial engagement in December 2008 for the audit of the 2009 financial statements. The members of the Audit Committee and our Board recommend the continued retention of PwC to serve as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.
The Audit Committee Report does not constitute soliciting material. It is not considered filed by the Company and shall not be incorporated by reference into any of its other filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act unless we state otherwise.

Proposal 4 Vote on Stockholder Proposal to Require Independent Board Chairman
We have been advised that a stockholder, John Chevedden, intends to present the following stockholder proposal at our Annual Meeting. We will furnish the address and share ownership of the proponent promptly upon written or oral request. The proposal will be voted on at the Annual Meeting if the proponent or a qualified representative is present at the meeting and submits the proposal for a vote. The text of the proposal and the supporting statement appear below exactly as received by us. The proposal may contain assertions about the Company or other matters that the Company believes are incorrect, but the Company has not attempted to refute all of those assertions. The Company disclaims responsibility for the accuracy and content of the proposal and supporting statement. Following the proposal are the Company's reasons for opposing the proposal.
Proposal [4] – Independent Board Chairman
Shareholders request our Board of Directors to adopt as policy, and amend our governing documents as necessary, to require henceforth that the Chair of the Board of Directors, whenever possible, to be an independent member of the Board. The Board would have the discretion to phase in this policy for the next Chief Executive Officer transition, implemented so it does not violate any existing agreement.
If the Board determines that a Chairman who was independent when selected is no longer independent, the Board shall select a new Chairman who satisfies the requirements of the policy within a reasonable amount of time. Compliance with this policy is waived if no independent director is available and willing to serve as Chairman. This proposal requests that all the necessary steps be taken to accomplish the above.
Under our current guidelines our CEO can also be our chairman. Our 2018 chairman, Alexis Michas, had 25-years tenure as a director which would make it difficult for him to be truly independent. Long-tenure is the opposite of director independence.
Caterpillar and Wells Fargo are examples of companies changing course and naming an independent board chairman. Caterpillar had even opposed a shareholder proposal like this proposal for an independent board chairman at its annual meeting.
In the year leading up to the submittal of this proposal our stock fell from $51 to $39. Adoption of this proposal will cost our company virtually nothing - yet it can improve board independence and company performance.
Please vote yes:
Independent Board Chairman – Proposal [4]
Our Recommendation and Response
Our Board recommends that stockholders vote against this stockholder proposal for the following reasons:
BorgWarner's Current Board Leadership Structure, Which Includes an Independent Chairman, Best Serves BorgWarner and Its Stockholders.
Since April 2013, our Board has separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We have had an independent Board Chair since that time, and our Board has reconfirmed that having an independent Non-Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in separate roles continues to be the most appropriate leadership structure for the Company at this time.
Our Board believes that a one-size-fits-all policy mandating an independent Chairman is not in the best interest of stockholders. Our Board periodically evaluates BorgWarner's board leadership structure to ensure that there is strong, independent leadership in place to provide effective oversight of management, and to ensure it aligns with and supports the evolving needs and circumstances of the Company and its stockholders.
Our Independent Non-Executive Chairman Provides Strong, Independent Leadership.
Alexis Michas, an independent director, serves as our Non-Executive Chairman, and our Board believes his exceptional leadership is essential to the management of our Board. Mr. Michas' extensive knowledge of the automotive industry and his knowledge of the Company through his service on our Board, combined with his prior board experience, uniquely qualifies him to provide strong, independent leadership. In appointing Mr. Michas as Non-Executive Chairman, our Board considered the benefits that the Company derives from his many years of private equity experience across a wide range of industries and his successful record of managing investments in public companies. Further, Mr. Michas brings extensive transactional expertise, including mergers and acquisitions, IPOs, debt and equity offerings, and bank financing. This expertise allows Mr. Michas to provide our Board with valuable insight on trends in global debt and equity markets, and the impact of such trends on the capital structure of the Company. We also benefit from the corporate governance knowledge developed by Mr. Michas in his board roles with other public companies, including his service as
Table of Contents a lead director and a member of the compensation, governance, audit, finance and executive committees of such companies. Mr. Michas' 25-year tenure is an asset, not a detriment, to the Company. Mr. Michas has guided the Company through multiple CEO transitions and has provided stability to our Board, which has experienced significant turnover in the last five years, in part as a result of our mandatory retirement age.
The Non-Executive Chairman position has clearly-defined responsibilities designed to provide strong, independent leadership. These responsibilities include:
Flexibility in Board Leadership Structure is More Suitable for BorgWarner than a Rigid and Prescriptive Approach.
Directors have a fiduciary duty to routinely evaluate and determine the most appropriate board leadership structure for BorgWarner and its stockholders in light of BorgWarner's unique characteristics, strategies or circumstances at any given time. Accordingly, as discussed on page 20 under "Board Leadership Structure," BorgWarner's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide our Board with the flexibility to determine the optimal leadership structure for the Company, including when appropriate, separating the positions of Chairman of our Board and CEO.
We believe that the Company and its stockholders benefit from this flexibility, and that our Board is best positioned to lead this evaluation given our directors' robust knowledge of the Company's leadership team, strategic goals, opportunities, challenges and response to substantial industry-wide changes. We believe that it is important for our Board to continue to determine on a case-by-case basis the most effective leadership structure for BorgWarner, rather than taking a rigid approach to board leadership, as called for by the stockholder proposal.
No single, fixed leadership model is appropriate in all circumstances. In deciding which leadership structure is appropriate at a particular time, the choice should be contextual, rather than mechanical, and should be tailored to the then-present needs and opportunities of the Company. Our Board should have the flexibility to select the individual it believes is most qualified and best-positioned to act as Chairman. This proposal would inhibit our Board's ability to utilize its collective experience, knowledge, and insight to make well-informed decisions regarding our Board's leadership structure from time to time in a dynamic industry.
Strong Corporate Governance Practices Provide Effective, Independent Board Oversight.
BorgWarner's Board is committed to good corporate governance and engaging with stockholders on an ongoing basis to gather feedback on our leadership structure, corporate governance profile and executive compensation program. We discussed our board leadership structure with investors during engagement in late 2018 as described more fully on page 7. Based on our engagement meetings, most stockholders expressed support for our current structure and the continued flexibility for our Board to determine its leadership structure based on the Company's needs and circumstances at any given time.
Our leadership structure is one of many practices that provide effective, independent oversight of management. We have adopted practices and procedures that promote board independence and effective oversight of management, and provide stockholders with meaningful rights as described on pages 23 and 24.

 Our Board recommends a vote "AGAINST" the stockholder proposal to require an Independent Board Chairman.
