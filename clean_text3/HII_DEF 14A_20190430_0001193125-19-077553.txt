     Stockholder  Engagement 
[END TABLE]
We believe that stockholder outreach and engagement is an essential element of strong corporate governance. Accordingly, we actively engage with our investors so that management and the Board can better understand stockholder perspectives on matters that are important to them, and to assess emerging issues that may help shape our practices and enhance our corporate disclosures. We strive for a collaborative approach to stockholder engagement and value the variety of stockholder perspectives we receive. Management and, in some cases, members of the Board actively engage with our investors through telephonic meetings, in-person meetings and email to understand their perspectives on our company, including our strategy, performance, corporate governance matters and executive compensation. During 2018, management contacted the corporate governance teams of our largest stockholders, collectively representing approximately 42% of our outstanding shares, and met with those stockholders that accepted our meeting invitations. We are committed to understanding the perspectives of our stockholders and responding as appropriate.

Executive Compensation 
We have designed our executive compensation program to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives, incentivize our executives to achieve business objectives, reward performance and align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders and customers. The fundamental philosophy of our executive compensation program, set by the Compensation Committee of the Board, is pay-for-performance. We describe below our financial performance and stockholder returns in 2018. 
2018 Financial Performance 
Solid operating performance in 2018 delivered solid financial performance. The following table includes several of our 2018 financial highlights: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

New contract awards in 2018 totaled $9.8 billion, resulting in a backlog of $23.0 billion at the end of the year.

[END TABLE]
Our compensation program for our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer and our three other most highly-compensated executive officers in 2018 (collectively, our "NEOs") consisted primarily of the following direct compensation elements in 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salary, to provide a minimum fixed level of compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentive awards, generally paid in cash, under our Annual Incentive Plan ("AIP"), to motivate our  executives to achieve pre-determined annual financial and operational targets that are aligned with our strategic goals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term equity-based incentive awards, paid under our Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), to promote achievement  of pre-determined three-year performance goals aligned with long-term stockholder interests.  
[END TABLE]
Our executive compensation program is rounded out with certain perquisites and other executive benefits. 
A significant portion of the potential compensation of our executives is at risk, and that risk increases with each executive's level of responsibility. We have designed our compensation program to balance performance-based compensation over the short- and long-term to incentivize decisions and actions that promote stockholder value and focus our executives on performance that benefits our stockholders and customers, while discouraging inappropriate risk-taking behaviors.

2019 Proxy Statement Summary 
2018 Total Direct Compensation Mix 
The pay-for-performance philosophy of our executive compensation program is demonstrated by the compensation mix of our NEOs. Of the three primary elements of total direct compensation, our executive compensation is heavily weighted toward the variable, performance-based elements and toward the long-term and equity-based elements, as reflected in the following charts, which set forth the percentage of total compensation corresponding to each compensation element received by our CEO and by our other NEOs collectively in 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 CEO Compensation Mix1      Other NEOs Compensation Mix2   
 CEO Compensation Mix1      Other NEOs Compensation Mix2   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Our CEO elected to receive a base salary of $1; his fixed (cash) compensation therefore represented 0% of his total direct  compensation. Total direct compensation does not include perquisites and other benefits.  
[END TABLE]

(2)  Average allocation for the NEOs other than the CEO. Total direct compensation does not include perquisites and other  benefits.  
[END TABLE]
Compensation Best Practices 
We believe our compensation practices are aligned with and reinforce our pay-for-performance philosophy and our related executive compensation principles. 
What We Do 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

APPOINTMENT OF PROXY HOLDERS 
The Board asks you to appoint Kellye L. Walker and Charles R. Monroe, Jr. as your proxy holders to vote your shares at the annual meeting. You make this appointment by submitting your proxy using one of the voting methods described below. 
If appointed by you, the proxy holders will vote your shares as you direct on the matters described in this proxy statement. If you received a proxy card and you complete and return the proxy card but do not provide voting directions, they will vote your shares as recommended by the Board on all of the matters described in this proxy statement that are brought before the annual meeting. 
The Board is not aware of any business that may properly be brought before the annual meeting other than those matters described in this proxy statement. If any other matters are properly brought before the annual meeting, your proxy gives discretionary authority to the proxy holders to vote the shares in their best judgment. 
NOTICE OF INTERNET AVAILABILITY OF PROXY MATERIALS 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), we are permitted to furnish our proxy materials to our stockholders over the Internet by delivering a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials instructs you on how to access and review the proxy statement and 2018 Annual Report over the Internet. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials also instructs you on how you may submit your proxy over the Internet. We believe this e-proxy process expedites receipt of proxy materials by stockholders, while also lowering our costs and reducing the environmental impact of our annual meeting. We have used this e-proxy process to furnish proxy materials to certain of our stockholders over the Internet. 
If you received a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials in the mail and would like to receive a printed copy of our proxy materials, you should follow the instructions for requesting these materials provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. 
RECORD DATE AND VOTING 
Stockholders owning our common stock at the close of business on March 6, 2019, the record date, or their legal proxy holders, are entitled to vote at the annual meeting. The Board strongly encourages 
10    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
General Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting you to vote. Your vote is important. Voting early helps ensure we receive a quorum of shares necessary to hold the annual meeting. Many stockholders do not vote, meaning the stockholders who do vote influence the outcome of the matters on which they vote in greater proportion than their percentage ownership of HII shares. 
We have two types of stockholders: stockholders of record and "street name" stockholders. Stockholders of record are stockholders who own their shares in their own names on the company's books. Street name stockholders are stockholders who own their shares through a bank, broker or other holder of record. 
Voting by Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record, you have four voting options. You may vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• over the Internet at www.envisionreports.com/HII, the web address included in the Notice of Internet Availability of  Proxy Materials and in the proxy card (if you received a proxy card);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by telephone through the number included in the proxy card (if you received a proxy card);  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by signing and dating your proxy card (if you received a proxy card) and mailing it in the prepaid and addressed envelope;  or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by attending the annual meeting and voting in person.  
[END TABLE]
If you have Internet access, we encourage you to vote over the Internet. It is convenient, and it saves us significant postage and processing costs. In addition, when you vote by proxy over the Internet or by telephone prior to the meeting date, your proxy vote is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will cause your proxy vote to arrive late and therefore not be counted. 
Internet and telephone voting facilities for stockholders of record are available 24 hours a day and will close at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Monday, April 29, 2019. The Internet and telephone voting procedures verify you are a stockholder of record by use of a control number and enable you to confirm your voting instructions have been properly recorded. If you vote by Internet or telephone, you do not need to return your proxy card (if you received a proxy card). 
Whether or not you plan to attend the annual meeting and vote in person, we urge you to have your proxy vote recorded in advance of the meeting. If you attend the annual meeting and vote at the annual meeting, any prior proxy votes you submitted, whether by Internet, telephone or mail, will be superseded by the vote you cast at the annual meeting. Because it is not practical for most stockholders to attend the annual meeting, the Board recommends you vote using one of the other voting methods. In any event, the method by which you vote your proxy will not limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you decide to attend in person. 
Revoking Your Proxy for Stockholders of Record. If you are a stockholder of record and you vote by proxy using any method, you may later revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the polls close at the annual meeting. You may do this by: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• sending a written statement to that effect to Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc., Attn: Corporate Secretary, 4101  Washington Avenue, Newport News, Virginia 23607, provided we receive your written statement before the annual meeting date; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting again over the Internet or by telephone prior to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on Monday, April 29, 2019; or   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• signing and returning another proxy card with a later date, provided we receive the later proxy card before the annual  meeting date; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• voting in person at the annual meeting.  
[END TABLE]
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    11 
General Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting 
Only the most recent proxy vote will be counted, and all others will be discarded regardless of the method of voting. 
Voting by Street Name Stockholders. If your shares are held in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee, please refer to the instructions they provide regarding how to vote your shares or to revoke your voting instructions. The availability of telephone and Internet voting depends upon the voting processes of the broker, bank or other nominee. If you are a street name stockholder and would like to vote in person at the annual meeting, you must obtain a proxy, executed in your favor, from the bank, broker or other holder of record through which you hold your shares. Because it is not practical for most stockholders to attend the annual meeting, the Board recommends you vote using one of the other voting methods. In any event, the method by which you vote your proxy will not limit your right to vote at the annual meeting if you decide to attend in person. 
Confidential Voting. We treat your vote as confidential to protect the privacy of our stockholders' votes. Proxies and voting instructions provided to banks, brokers and other holders of record are kept confidential. Only the proxy solicitor, the proxy tabulator and the inspector of elections have access to the proxies and voting instructions. 
QUORUM, VOTE REQUIRED AND METHOD OF COUNTING 
At the close of business on the record date, 41,656,877 shares of our common stock were outstanding and entitled to vote at the annual meeting. Each outstanding share is entitled to one vote. 
A quorum must be present to transact business at the annual meeting. A quorum will be present if a majority of the outstanding shares entitled to vote as of the record date are present, in person or by proxy. If you indicate an abstention as your voting preference on all matters, your shares will be counted toward a quorum but will not be voted on any matter. If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record may vote your shares on the proposal to ratify the appointment of our independent auditors, which is known as a routine matter. Votes by a bank, broker or other holder of record on any routine matter will count for purposes of determining a quorum. In the absence of a quorum, the chairperson of the meeting may adjourn the meeting, and, at any reconvened meeting following such an adjournment at which a quorum is present, any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting may be transacted. 
If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record can vote your shares in its discretion only on Item 3 described in this proxy statement. If you do not give your bank, broker or other holder of record instructions on how to vote your shares on Items 1, 2 and 4 described in this proxy statement, your shares will not be voted on those matters. 
If you have shares in an employee benefit plan and do not vote those shares, your trustee will vote your shares in accordance with the terms of the relevant plan. Accordingly, your trustee may vote your shares in the same proportion as shares held by the plan for which voting instructions have been received, unless contrary to ERISA. 
The required vote and method of calculation for the matters to be considered at the annual meeting are as follows: 
Item 1—Proposal to Elect Directors 
Directors will be elected by a plurality of the shares present in person or by proxy at the annual meeting or any adjournment thereof and entitled to vote on the election of directors. Plurality voting means the 11 director nominees receiving the most votes will be elected to the Board. If you do not want your shares to be voted with respect to a particular director nominee, you may "withhold" your vote with respect to that nominee. If a director nominee receives a greater number of votes "withheld" 
12    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
General Information About the Annual Meeting and Voting for his or her election than votes cast "for" his or her election, such nominee will be required under the majority vote director resignation policy included in our Corporate Governance Guidelines to submit an offer of resignation to the Board for its consideration. If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record cannot vote your shares on this item, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
Item 2—Proposal to Approve Executive Compensation on an Advisory Basis 
The executive compensation of our NEOs will be approved as an advisory recommendation to the Board if the number of shares voted in favor exceeds the number of shares voted against. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of the vote. If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record cannot vote your shares on this item, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. Although the vote on this item is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will review the results of the vote and consider it in making future decisions concerning executive compensation. 
Item 3—Proposal to Ratify Appointment of Our Independent Auditors 
Ratification of appointment of our independent auditors will be approved if the number of shares voted in favor exceeds the number of shares voted against. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of the vote. If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record can vote your shares at its discretion on this item. 
Item 4—Stockholder Proposal to Permit an Unlimited Number of Stockholders to Aggregate Their Ownership of HII Common Stock to Satisfy the Ownership Requirement Under Our Proxy Access Bylaw 
The stockholder proposal to permit an unlimited number of stockholders to aggregate their ownership of HII common stock to satisfy the ownership requirement under our proxy access bylaw will be approved if the number of shares voted in favor exceeds the number of shares voted against the proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the results of the vote. If you are a street name stockholder and do not vote your shares, your bank, broker or other holder of record cannot vote your shares on this item, and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the vote. 
IMPORTANT REMINDER OF EFFECT OF NOT CASTING YOUR VOTE IF YOU ARE A STREET NAME STOCKHOLDER 
If you are a street name stockholder, it is critical you vote your shares if you want your vote to count on Items 1, 2 and 4. Your bank, broker or other holder of record is not permitted to vote your shares on Items 1, 2 or 4, unless you instruct them how you wish to vote. Such "broker non-votes" will have no impact on the results of the vote on Items 1, 2 or 4. 
SOLICITING AND TABULATING VOTES 
The Board has made these materials available to you in connection with its solicitation of proxies for use at our annual meeting. We will bear the costs of soliciting and tabulating your votes. Our employees, personally, by telephone, by email or otherwise, may solicit your votes without additional compensation. In addition, we have retained MacKenzie Partners, Inc. to assist in the solicitation of proxies for the 2019 annual meeting for a fee of $15,000, plus associated costs and expenses. 
We will reimburse banks, brokers and other holders of record for reasonable, out-of-pocket expenses for forwarding these proxy materials to you, according to certain regulatory fee schedules. See "Electronic Access to Proxy Statement and Annual Report" below for information on how you can help reduce printing and mailing costs.

ELECTRONIC ACCESS TO PROXY STATEMENT AND ANNUAL REPORT 
You can elect in advance to receive future proxy materials by email. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email with instructions containing a link to the website where those materials are available, as well as a link to the proxy voting website. 
If you are a stockholder of record, you may enroll in the electronic delivery service by going directly to www.envisionreports.com/HII. You may revoke your electronic delivery election at this site at any time and request a paper copy of the proxy statement and annual report. 
If you are a street name stockholder, you may also have the opportunity to receive copies of the proxy statement and annual report electronically. Please check the information provided in the proxy materials you received from your bank, broker or other holder of record concerning the availability of this service. 
HOUSEHOLDING INFORMATION 
We have adopted a procedure called "householding." Under this procedure, stockholders of record who have the same address and last name and do not participate in electronic delivery of proxy materials will receive only one copy of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the printed proxy materials, unless we have received contrary instructions from one or both such stockholders. This procedure reduces our printing costs and postage fees and is environmentally friendly. 
If you and another stockholder of record with whom you share an address are receiving multiple copies of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the printed proxy materials, you can request to receive a single copy of the printed proxy materials in the future by calling our transfer agent, Computershare, at 1-888-665-9610, or writing to us at Investor Relations, 4101 Washington Avenue, Newport News, VA 23607. If you and another stockholder of record with whom you share an address wish to receive a separate Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or separate printed proxy materials, we will promptly deliver them to you if you request them by contacting Computershare by phone or Investor Relations in writing in the same manner described above. 
Stockholders who participate in householding and who receive printed proxy materials will continue to receive separate proxy cards. If you are a street name stockholder, you can request householding by contacting your bank, broker or other holder of record through which you hold your shares.

Governance of the Company 
OVERVIEW OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate governance addresses the relationships among the Board, company management and the company's stockholders, with the objectives of promoting the company's long-term success, improving corporate performance, strengthening Board and management accountability and promoting the long-term interests of our stockholders. The Board and senior management are committed to high standards of corporate governance. We believe those high standards are important not only to our stockholders, but also to our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. 
The following sections provide an overview of our corporate governance model and practices. Among other topics, we describe the responsibilities of the Board, how directors are selected and certain key aspects of Board operations. 
RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
We believe the foundation for good corporate governance starts with a board of directors whose independence, skills, experience and judgment will enable the board to effectively oversee management of the company and to provide constructive advice and counsel to management. The Board and its committees perform a number of important functions for the company and its stockholders, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing and providing advice on the company's strategic plan developed by management;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• assessing the significant enterprise risks to which the company is subject and overseeing management of those enterprise  risks;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• selecting our chief executive officer and evaluating the performance of the chief executive officer and other executive  officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing development and succession plans for our executive officers;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• monitoring the company's financial performance and evaluating and approving significant corporate actions;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• overseeing processes that protect the integrity of the company, including the integrity of the company's financial  statements and compliance with legal requirements and the company's ethics and business conduct standards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• evaluating the effectiveness of the Board and its committees.  
[END TABLE]
The Board's oversight role is also effected through the Board's four standing committees—the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Governance and Policy Committee and the Finance Committee. Each of these committees operates under a separate written charter to promote clarity in their responsibilities and to ensure the committees function in coordination with each other and with the full Board. Our committees are discussed in greater detail beginning on page 21 of this proxy statement. 
CRITERIA FOR BOARD MEMBERSHIP 
The Board believes all director candidates must possess certain fundamental qualifications and that specialized skills and experiences should be contributed to the Board by individual directors. The 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    15 
Governance of the Company 
 Board and the Governance and Policy Committee consider the qualifications of directors and director candidates individually and in the broader context of the Board's collective skills and experiences measured against the current and future needs of the Board. 
Qualifications for All Directors. The Board believes all its members must possess the following fundamental qualifications: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• high personal and professional integrity and ethical standards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• substantial educational, business, military or professional accomplishments in leading organizations;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ability to represent the best interests of all stockholders; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• demonstrated leadership ability and sound judgment.  
[END TABLE]
Prospective directors must also be willing to submit to a background check necessary for obtaining a security clearance. 
Selection of Individual Candidates. In addition to the qualifications applicable to all director candidates, the Board and the Governance and Policy Committee consider, among other matters, a candidate's knowledge of and experience in such areas as: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• senior leadership  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• finance, accounting and capital markets  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the industries in which the company competes  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• manufacturing and operations  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• human resources  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• military and government  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• government relations and regulatory  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• legal, regulatory and compliance matters  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• public company boards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• technology  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• risk management  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• corporate development and strategy  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• global operations  
[END TABLE]
We also consider whether a candidate can commit sufficient time and attention to Board activities and any potential conflicts with the company's interests. Our objective is to have the collective skills, experiences and perspectives that create an outstanding, dynamic and effective Board and strengthen the Board's ability to oversee the company's business, enhance its performance and represent the long-term interests of stockholders. All of our non-employee directors are expected to serve on Board committees, supporting the Board's mission by providing expertise to those committees, and the needs of those committees are considered when evaluating director candidates. The Board and the Governance and Policy Committee also consider diversity factors when selecting director nominees, seeking representation of a range of experiences, backgrounds and perspectives. 
16    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Governance of the Company 
Service on Other Boards. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board considers the number of boards of other public companies and audit committees of those boards on which a director candidate serves. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors should not serve on more than four boards of publicly-traded companies in addition to our Board, and our directors who also serve as chief executive officers or in equivalent positions of other companies should not serve on more than two other boards of publicly-traded companies, in each case without the approval of the chairman of our Governance and Policy Committee. A director who is a full-time employee of our company may not serve on the board of directors of more than two other publicly-traded companies, unless approved by the Board. No member of our Audit Committee may serve on the audit committees of more than three publicly-traded companies (including our company) without the approval of the Board, which must determine annually that such simultaneous service would not impair the ability of the member to effectively serve on our Audit Committee. 
Retirement Policy. Under the retirement policy of our Corporate Governance Guidelines, a director will not be re-nominated at the annual meeting following the earlier of his or her 76th birthday or 15 years of service on the Board. Upon the recommendation of the Governance and Policy Committee, the Board may waive either of these requirements as to any director, if the Board deems waiver to be in the best interests of the company. In addition to our retirement policy, when a director's principal occupation or business association changes substantially during his or her tenure as a director, the Board expects the affected director to tender his or her resignation for consideration by the Governance and Policy Committee and the Board, as provided in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
Conclusion. Satisfaction of the foregoing criteria for Board membership is implemented and assessed through continuous consideration of director succession by the Governance and Policy Committee and the Board, as well as through the Board's self-evaluation process. The Board and the Governance and Policy Committee believe that, individually and collectively, the company's current directors possess the necessary qualifications to provide effective oversight of the company's business and contribute constructive advice and counsel to the company's management. 
DIRECTOR NOMINATION PROCESS 
The Governance and Policy Committee is responsible under its charter for recommending to the full Board director nominees for election by our stockholders and for identifying and recommending candidates to fill any vacancies that may occur on the Board. The Governance and Policy Committee may use a variety of sources to identify candidates. Candidates may be identified through recommendations from independent directors or members of management, search firms, discussions with other persons who may know of suitable candidates to serve on the Board and stockholder recommendations. 
Evaluations of director candidates who would be new to the Board (other than nominees recommended by our stockholders, as described below) include consideration of the candidate's background and qualifications by the Governance and Policy Committee, interviews with the Chairman of the Board, members of the Governance and Policy Committee and one or more other Board members who desire to interview a candidate, and deliberations of the Governance and Policy Committee and the full Board. The Governance and Policy Committee then recommends the candidate(s) to the full Board, with the full Board selecting the candidate(s) to be nominated for election by our stockholders or to be elected by the Board to fill a vacancy. 
In connection with its recommendations to the Board of director nominees for election at each annual meeting, the Governance and Policy Committee considers the size of the Board and the criteria set forth above to recommend nominees who, individually and as a group and collectively with directors who will continue to serve on the Board, the Governance and Policy Committee believes satisfy the 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    17 
Governance of the Company qualifications the Board needs. Accordingly, the Governance and Policy Committee annually reviews the composition of the Board as a whole and makes recommendations, if necessary, to improve the Board to achieve what it believes is the optimal mix of experience, expertise, skills, specialized knowledge, diversity and other factors. 
Stockholders who wish to recommend director candidates for consideration by the Governance and Policy Committee must submit the name and relevant information about the candidate in writing to the Corporate Secretary. All director candidates recommended by stockholders are required to meet the criteria for directors described above, and candidates who meet the criteria described above will be evaluated by the Governance and Policy Committee. In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Governance and Policy Committee will evaluate director candidates recommended by stockholders in the same manner as candidates identified through other means. 
Stockholders who wish to nominate a person for election as a director at an annual meeting must follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws and described beginning on page 27 of this proxy statement. Additionally, our bylaws include a proxy access right, which enables a stockholder or a group of up to 20 stockholders owning continuously for at least three years an amount of shares that constitutes 3% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the date of nomination to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to the greater of 25% of the number of directors then in office or two directors, subject to the requirements specified in our bylaws. Stockholders who wish to nominate director candidates for inclusion in our proxy materials under our proxy access bylaw provisions must satisfy the requirements in our bylaws, as described under the heading "Communications and Company Documents—Future Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors" of this proxy statement. The Board expects to evaluate any director candidates nominated through the proxy access process in a manner similar to that for other director candidates. 
MAJORITY VOTE DIRECTOR RESIGNATION POLICY 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include a majority vote director resignation policy. Under such policy, any nominee for director who receives a greater number of votes "withheld" from his or her election than votes "for" such election (a "Majority Withhold Vote") in an uncontested election of directors must tender to the Board his or her offer of resignation within five days following certification of the stockholder vote. The Governance and Policy Committee will promptly consider the resignation offer and make a recommendation to the Board to accept or reject the tendered offer of resignation. The Board will act on the Governance and Policy Committee's recommendation within 90 days following certification of the stockholder vote. The Board will then promptly disclose its decision to accept or reject the director's resignation offer, including its rationale, in a report furnished to or filed with the SEC. 
The Governance and Policy Committee in making its recommendation, and the Board in making its decision, will consider the best interests of the company and our stockholders and may consider any other factors or other information that it considers appropriate and relevant, including but not limited to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the stated reasons, if any, why stockholders withheld their votes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• possible alternatives for curing the underlying cause of the withheld votes;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director's tenure;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director's qualifications;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the director's past and expected future contributions to the company; and  
[END TABLE]
18    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Governance of the Company 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the overall composition of the Board and its committees, including whether, if the offer of resignation is accepted, the  company will no longer be in compliance with any applicable law, rule, regulation or governing document.  
[END TABLE]
Any director who tenders his or her offer of resignation under our majority vote director resignation policy will not participate in the Governance and Policy Committee deliberation or recommendation or Board deliberation or action to accept or reject the resignation offer. If a majority of the Governance and Policy Committee received a Majority Withhold Vote at the same election, then the independent directors (other than those who received a Majority Withhold Vote in that election) will instead appoint a committee among themselves to consider the resignation offers and recommend to the Board whether to accept them. If, however, the independent directors who did not receive a Majority Withhold Vote constitute two or fewer directors, all independent directors may participate in the action to accept or reject the resignation offers, except that each director who has tendered his or her offer of resignation will recuse himself or herself from the deliberations and voting with respect to his or her individual offer to resign. 
If a director's resignation offer is not accepted by the Board, that director will continue to serve for the term for which he or she was elected and until his or her successor is duly elected, or his or her earlier resignation or removal. If a director's resignation offer is accepted by the Board, then the Board, in its sole discretion in accordance with our bylaws, may fill any resulting vacancy or may decrease the size of the Board. 
STOCKHOLDERS RIGHT TO NOMINATE PROXY ACCESS NOMINEES 
Our bylaws provide our stockholders proxy access rights. Under Section 2.15 of our bylaws, we are required to include in our proxy materials for an annual meeting any stockholder nominee who is nominated by an "Eligible Stockholder." An "Eligible Stockholder" is any stockholder or group of up to 20 stockholders that has beneficially owned continuously for at least three years an amount of shares that constitutes 3% or more of our outstanding common stock as of the date of nomination. Eligible Stockholders must provide proof of ownership of the requisite amount of stock for the three-year time period and represent that the shares were acquired in the ordinary course of business and not to change or influence control of the company. Eligible Stockholders must also provide certain other written representations, warranties and agreements to the company, including an agreement to assume liability from any legal or regulatory violation arising out of the Eligible Stockholder's communication with our stockholders and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, as described in more detail in Section 2.15 of the bylaws. 
The maximum number of directors who can be nominated by Eligible Stockholders, referred to as "Stockholder Nominees," at any annual meeting is the greater of 25% of the number of directors then in office or two directors. Section 2.15 of our bylaws includes procedures to prioritize nominations if the number of Stockholder Nominees exceeds the maximum number of Stockholder Nominees we are required to include in our proxy materials for any annual meeting. Stockholder Nominees must provide written notice to the company, which must include specific information, including information similar to the information required from stockholders to propose business and director nominations through the advance notice provisions included in Section 2.08 of our bylaws. As described in Section 2.15 of our bylaws, this notice must include an express consent to be named as a director nominee in our proxy materials and to serve as a director if elected, as well as required disclosures and information about, and representations, undertakings and consents by, the Stockholder Nominee to enable the Board to determine whether the Stockholder Nominee meets the independence and other general requirements for directors set forth in our bylaws and our Corporate Governance Guidelines. 
Stockholders who would like to nominate candidates using proxy access should refer to Section 2.15 of our bylaws, which sets forth all the requirements for proxy access nominations. The Board may

Governance of the Company exclude any Stockholder Nominee from our proxy materials if the Stockholder Nominee or Eligible Stockholder(s) fail to meet the requirements or provide the undertakings set forth in our bylaws or Corporate Governance Guidelines and for other reasons set forth in our bylaws. See "Communications and Company Documents—Future Stockholder Proposals and Nominations of Directors." 
DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
The Board makes determinations regarding the independence of our directors on an annual basis, based upon the Governance and Policy Committee's evaluation of director independence and related recommendations to the Board. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, to be considered independent: (i) a director must be independent as determined under Section 303(A).02(b) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual and (ii) in the Board's judgment, the director must not have a material relationship with the company (either directly or as a partner, shareholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the company). 
The Board has considered relevant relationships between the company and each non-employee director to determine compliance with NYSE independence requirements. Based upon its review, the Board has determined that Mr. Bilden, General Collins, Admiral Donald, Admiral Fargo, Ms. Harker, Ms. Kelly, Ms. McKibben, Mr. Schievelbein, Mr. Welch and Mr. Wilson, who comprise the Board's non-employee directors, are independent. The Board has also determined that each current member of the Audit Committee satisfies the additional independence requirements of the SEC and that each current member of the Compensation Committee satisfies the enhanced independence requirements of the NYSE listing standards. 
BOARD LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE 
The Board understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to evaluate and determine the optimal leadership structure for the Board from time to time to facilitate effective oversight of the company. Our bylaws establish the position of Chairman, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines state that the Board believes it is in the best interests of the company and its stockholders for the Board to have the flexibility to determine the best director to serve as Chairman. The independent directors consider this matter on at least an annual basis. This consideration includes the advantages and disadvantages of a combined chairman and chief executive officer role and separate chairman and chief executive officer roles in the context of our operating and governance environment over time, with the goal of achieving the optimal model for the Board's effective oversight of the company's affairs. 
Non-Executive Chairman. The Board has considered the Board leadership matter and determined an independent, non-executive chairman is the optimal model for the company at this time. This structure provides the Board with independent leadership and allows the chief executive officer to focus on the company's business operations. The independent directors appointed Admiral Fargo as our non-executive Chairman of the Board at the time the company began operating as an independent stand-alone company in 2011, and he has served as Chairman since that time. 
Our non-executive Chairman has the following responsibilities under our Corporate Governance Guidelines: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• chair all Board and stockholder meetings, including executive sessions of the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• serve as a liaison between the chief executive officer and the independent directors;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• ensure the quality, quantity and timeliness of the flow of information from management to the Board; although management is  responsible for the preparation of materials for the Board, the non-executive Chairman may specifically request the inclusion of certain materials;  
[END TABLE]

Governance of the Company 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• prepare the agendas of the Board meetings and assist the chairman of each standing committee with preparation of agendas  for the respective committee meetings, taking into account the requests of other Board and committee members;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• set an appropriate schedule for Board meetings to assure there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• along with the chairman of the Governance and Policy Committee, interview all Board candidates and make recommendations to  the Governance and Policy Committee and the Board;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• have the authority to call meetings of the Board and meetings of the independent directors; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if requested by the chief executive officer, be available for consultation and direct communication with stockholders.   
[END TABLE]
Conclusion. All of our directors play an active role in overseeing the company's business at both the Board and committee levels. The Board is currently comprised of one non-independent director who serves as our Chief Executive Officer and ten independent directors. Our independent directors are skilled and experienced leaders in industry and the military. Our independent directors are effective in collaborating with management and thoroughly considering proposals made by management, and an independent Board leader facilitates this relationship. We therefore believe a non-executive Chairman of the Board, along with nine other strong independent directors, is an appropriate and effective structure at this time to oversee the company's affairs and to provide advice and counsel to the Chief Executive Officer and other executive management of the company. 
BOARD COMMITTEE FUNCTIONS AND MEMBERSHIP 
The Board has four standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Governance and Policy and Finance. Each of the Audit, Compensation and Governance and Policy Committees is constituted and operated in accordance with SEC requirements and the NYSE's corporate governance listing standards; the Finance Committee is not subject to any such requirements or standards. Each Board committee is governed by a written charter, which sets forth the responsibilities of the committee, including the responsibilities described in this section. Each charter can be viewed on our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and is available in print to any stockholder requesting a copy. All members of each Board committee are independent, as determined under the corporate governance listing standards of the NYSE.

None of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee.

BOARD STRUCTURE 
We phased out the classification of the Board, beginning with our annual meeting held in 2016 and ending with our annual meeting held in 2018. Accordingly, all 11 of our directors will be voted upon at our 2019 annual meeting to serve one-year terms. 
EXECUTIVE SESSIONS OF NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our directors, with no members of management present (including directors who are also officers of the company), have the opportunity to meet in executive session at each regularly scheduled Board meeting. In addition, our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that at least one executive session of independent directors will be held each year. In 2018, all of our directors, other than our Chief Executive Officer, were independent under NYSE corporate governance listing standards. The independent directors met in executive session at five of the six regular Board meetings during the year. The non-executive Chairman presides over the executive sessions. 
The Audit Committee routinely meets in separate executive sessions with management, our independent auditor, our Vice President of Internal Audit and committee members only. The Compensation Committee, the Governance and Policy Committee and the Finance Committee also meet in executive session on a routine basis, with only members of the committee present. 
THE BOARD'S ROLE IN RISK OVERSIGHT 
The Board's responsibilities include oversight of risk management, which includes overseeing our system of financial and operational internal controls, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, data and cyber security risks and our processes for identifying, assessing and mitigating 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    23 
Governance of the Company other significant risks that may affect the company. The full Board oversees our enterprise risk associated with data and cyber security, and the Governance and Policy Committee oversees the internal governance of data and cyber security. Management periodically conducts table top exercises on hypothetical cyber security scenarios, and an ad hoc cyber security committee of the Board participates in those exercises. 
To discharge its risk oversight responsibilities, the Board must understand the significant risks to which the company is subject. Risks are inherent in virtually every business decision, and our business strategy creates risks. The Board understands it is neither possible nor prudent to eliminate all risk. Indeed, purposeful, appropriate and managed risk-taking is essential for the company to be competitive and profitable and successfully execute its business strategy. The Board's objective in overseeing risk management is to satisfy itself that management is identifying and appropriately assessing and mitigating our significant risks. 
Management has implemented a robust enterprise risk management ("ERM") program, which includes annual risk assessments, risk analyses, development of risk plans for enterprise risks, which include risk mitigation activities, monitoring of enterprise risks and periodic reports on enterprise risks and ERM program activities to executive management and the Board. Our ERM process is managed by an Enterprise Risk Committee, comprised of management from across business units and programmatic and functional disciplines within the company. The Enterprise Risk Committee is responsible for developing enterprise risk assessments, developing and monitoring risk mitigation plans for our enterprise risks, monitoring emerging and evolving risks and generating data and reports to facilitate management decision making and the Board's risk oversight function. While the Board and its committees oversee risk management, management is responsible for identifying, assessing and mitigating risks. 
The Board and its committees are responsible for understanding and evaluating the company's ERM processes and determining whether they are achieving their objectives. Management briefs the Board on an annual basis on the company's overall ERM program, which includes a report on the company's annual enterprise risk assessment process, a review of the company's latest roster of enterprise risks, assessments of the probabilities of such risks occurring and their potential severity and assessments of management's capability of mitigating individual enterprise risks. Management also briefs the Board or a Board committee on a periodic basis on significant individual risks, which includes a report on the risk by management's risk owner and the related risk mitigation plan. The Board is updated on an interim basis on any changes to the company's enterprise risk roster and any other material developments affecting the company's ERM program. 
The Governance and Policy Committee is responsible under its charter for developing and recommending to the full Board a methodology for the Board's oversight of risk management and for monitoring the Board's oversight of risk management. In connection with this responsibility, the Governance and Policy Committee evaluates the enterprise risk roster generated from the company's enterprise risk assessment, allocates oversight responsibilities among the full Board and individual standing Board committees and develops a risk briefing schedule, based upon management's relative prioritization of enterprise risks. 
Oversight of risk management is a continuous process and inherent in the company's strategic decisions. The Board and its committees facilitate open communication between management and the directors and foster an appropriate culture of integrity and risk awareness. The Board and its committees engage in communications throughout the year with management regarding risk assessment and risk management, and directors are encouraged to and do communicate directly with senior management. 
While the full Board has ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management, Board committees oversee certain individual enterprise risks relating to matters within the scopes of their responsibilities

Governance of the Company and report to the full Board with respect to this oversight. All standing Board committees play significant roles in the risk management oversight function.

BOARD AND COMMITTEE EVALUATIONS 
In accordance with our Corporate Governance Guidelines, the Board (under the oversight of the Governance and Policy Committee) conducts annual evaluations of the performance of the full Board and individual committees. The Board utilizes a mix of self-evaluation processes from year to year, ranging from written narrative responses to written questions regarding Board and committee matters to individual interviews with directors conducted by the Chairman of the Board. Following the collection of information from individual directors, the Board evaluation results are reviewed by the Board and the respective committee evaluation results are reviewed by the related committee. 
DIRECTOR EDUCATION 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines provide that all directors are encouraged to periodically attend director continuing education programs, and the Board has adopted an informal policy encouraging each director to attend at least one external director education program every other year. We maintain a roster of continuing director education programs offered by leading director education organizations, facilitate registrations for directors to attend such programs and reimburse directors for expenses incurred to attend such programs. 
In addition to encouraging director attendance at external programs, the Board periodically provides training on select topics to its members at Board meetings. We track the education programs, both

Governance of the Company external and internal, that individual directors attend, and the Governance and Policy Committee reviews those reports on at least an annual basis. 
POLICY AGAINST HEDGING AND PLEDGING COMPANY SECURITIES 
Our insider trading policy prohibits officers, directors and certain employees from engaging in any of the following transactions for their own account: speculative transactions in company securities, pledges of company securities as collateral for a loan or other transaction or hedging transactions involving company securities, including zero cost collar transactions and forward sale contracts. 
CODE OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 
Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, which applies to our directors, officers and employees. This code identifies core values, standards and behaviors that guide our officers, directors and employees in the exercise of their duties and responsibilities on behalf of HII. The code also includes the commitments the company has made to its employees, customers, stockholders, communities and suppliers. The code addresses, among other matters, conflicts of interest, corporate opportunities, trading in company securities, political contributions and confidential information. Employees are required to report any conduct they believe in good faith is an actual or apparent violation of the code. The Code of Ethics and Business Conduct includes provisions applicable to our senior financial officers, as required by SEC rules. 
Our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct is available on our website at www.huntingtoningalls.com and available in print to any stockholder requesting a copy. We will post any amendments to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct on our website. If we waive a provision of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct with respect to our chief executive officer, chief financial officer or principal accounting officer, we will post information about the waiver at the same location on our website. 
COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION 
None of our executive officers served as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving as a member of our Board or our Compensation Committee. Accordingly, no interlocks with other companies, within the meaning of the SEC's proxy rules, existed during 2018. 
MEETINGS AND ATTENDANCE 
The Board held six meetings in 2018, and all but one meeting included an executive session of independent directors. In addition, the Board held 21 committee meetings, comprised of six Audit Committee, five Compensation Committee, five Governance and Policy Committee and five Finance Committee meetings. Each director attended 75% or more of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which he or she served during 2018. 
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines include an expectation that all directors will attend our annual meetings of stockholders. All of our directors who were directors or nominees at the time of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders attended the annual meeting, except for Mr. Schievelbein, who had a scheduling conflict. 
INDEMNIFICATION 
We indemnify our directors and our elected officers to the fullest extent permitted by law, so they can be free from undue concern about personal liability in connection with their service to HII. Our bylaws require this indemnification, and we have also entered into agreements with each director and elected officer contractually obligating us to provide this indemnification to him or her.

The Board of Directors 
We believe the qualifications, skills and experiences of our directors are consistent with our criteria for the selection of directors and that, collectively, our directors have functioned effectively overseeing the business of the company over the last year. 
Ms. McKibben was elected by the Board on December 13, 2018, to fill a vacancy created when the Board increased its size to 11 directors. She was recommended as a candidate for director by a non-management director. The remaining ten directors have served on the Board since our last annual meeting. 
We phased out the classification of the Board beginning at our annual meeting held in 2016 and ending at our annual meeting held in 2018. Accordingly, all 11 of our directors will be voted upon at our 2019 annual meeting, and all directors elected at our 2019 annual meeting will serve one-year terms.

Non-employee director compensation is evaluated annually by the Compensation Committee, which makes recommendations to the full Board for consideration and approval. In 2018, the Compensation Committee's independent compensation consultant, Exequity LLP ("Exequity") conducted an assessment of the competitive market with respect to outside director compensation. Exequity's assessment considered the following director compensation elements: board-related pay, committee-related pay, equity pay, total director compensation and chairman of the board compensation. Based upon an analysis of the 15 companies that comprise the peer group for our 2018 NEO compensation analysis, as well as supplemental general industry data gathered from Fortune 500 companies, Exequity concluded that HII's outside director total compensation is competitive within its market. Our CEO is not paid additional compensation for his service on our Board. 
DIRECTOR COMPENSATION PROGRAM 
Our director compensation program for non-employee directors is comprised of both cash retainers and equity awards in the form of either restricted stock units or shares of our common stock, in each case granted under our 2012 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan. 
Non-employee directors receive an annual cash retainer of $100,000. Our non-executive Chairman of the Board receives an additional annual cash retainer of $250,000. The additional annual cash retainers for serving as chairs of our standing Board committees are: $25,000 for Audit; $20,000 for Compensation; $20,000 for Governance and Policy; and $20,000 for Finance. The additional annual cash retainers for serving as members (but not as chairs) of the Board committees are: $17,500 for Audit; $7,500 for Compensation; $7,500 for Governance and Policy; and $7,500 for Finance. Cash retainers are paid on a quarterly basis at the end of each quarter in arrears. 
Non-employee directors receive an annual equity award of restricted stock units or shares of our common stock, valued at $130,000. On the first trading day of each quarter, each non-employee director is granted a number of restricted stock units or shares determined by dividing $32,500 by the per share closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the date of grant, rounded down to the nearest whole unit or share. 
Non-employee directors may elect to receive their annual cash retainers in the form of stock units payable upon termination of the director's board service. Non-employee directors who elect to receive their annual cash retainers in the form of stock units and own shares of our common stock having a value at least five times the director's annual cash retainer may elect to receive stock units for the following calendar year that are payable in the fifth calendar year after the year in which the stock units are earned (or, if earlier, upon termination of the director's board service). The stock units are fully vested on the date of grant. 
Restricted stock unit awards are fully vested at date of grant but do not generally become payable until 30 days following the date a non-employee director ceases to serve on the Board. Non-employee
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    39 
Director Compensation directors receive dividend equivalents on their outstanding and unpaid restricted stock units. Dividend equivalents are paid in the form of a credit of additional restricted stock units and are subject to the same vesting, payment and other provisions as the underlying restricted stock units. 
If a non-employee director owns shares of our common stock having a value at least five times the director's annual cash retainer, the director may elect to receive his or her annual equity award in the form of either shares of our common stock or stock units that are payable in the fifth calendar year after the year in which the annual equity award is earned (or, if earlier, upon termination of the director's board service). The common stock or stock units are fully vested on the date of grant.

Our 2018 Named Executive Officers ("NEOs") are: 
Executive Summary 
Our executive compensation program and practices are described in detail over the following pages. We have designed our executive compensation program to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified executives, incentivize our executives to achieve business objectives, reward performance and align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders and customers. The fundamental philosophy of our executive compensation program, set by the Compensation Committee of the Board, is pay for performance. We have also designed our compensation program to balance performance-based compensation over the short- and long-term to incentivize decisions and actions that promote stockholder value and focus our executives on performance that benefits our stockholders and customers, while discouraging inappropriate risk-taking behaviors.

Executive Compensation 
The pay-for-performance philosophy of our executive compensation program is demonstrated by the compensation mix of our NEOs. Of the three primary elements of total direct compensation, our executive compensation is heavily weighted toward the variable, performance-based elements, and toward the long-term and equity-based elements, as reflected in the following charts, which set forth the percentage of total compensation corresponding to each compensation element received by our CEO and by our other NEOs collectively in 2018.

100% of Mr. Petters' total direct compensation in 2018 was directly linked to our performance through his annual and long-term incentive awards. Approximately 82% of the total direct compensation of our other NEOs was comprised of performance-based incentive awards. 
Our underlying philosophy of pay for performance focuses us consistently on achieving our financial and operational goals. Above all, these goals are customer-focused, rewarding safety, quality, cost and schedule performance, and stockholder-friendly, rewarding consistent achievement of strong financial results and increasing stockholder value.

Commitment to Compensation Best Practices 
We highlight below certain executive compensation practices we have implemented to drive performance, as well as certain practices we have avoided, in the belief they would not serve our customers' or stockholders' long-term interests. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT WE DO 
 Consideration of Annual "Say-on-Pay" Advisory Vote    The Compensation Committee considers the results of the annual stockholder  "Say-on-Pay" advisory vote on executive compensation. 
 Pay for Performance    Our executive compensation program is heavily weighted toward variable, performance-based elements, and toward long-term and equity-based  elements. Variable compensation is tied to the achievement of performance goals and includes annual incentive awards and restricted performance stock rights, which are described in detail in this CD&A. 
 Compensation Risk  Assessment    We assess the risk of our compensation programs on an annual basis both internally and with the engagement of the Compensation  Committee's independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee agreed with the consultant's conclusion that there was no undue risk associated with the design or delivery of the programs in  2018. 
[END TABLE]
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    45 
Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT WE DO 
 Executive Compensation Recoupment  (Clawback) Policy    Our executive compensation recoupment, or clawback, policy allows us to seek reimbursement in certain circumstances of all or a portion of  any performance-based short- or long-term cash or equity incentive compensation paid or awarded to executive officers. 
 Targeted Compensation  Benchmarking    HII is a unique business with few direct competitors. The Compensation Committee therefore strikes a balance between internal equity and  external benchmarking when setting executive pay levels. 
 Independent Compensation  Consultant    The Compensation Committee engages an independent compensation consultant to assess the market for the determination of our executive  compensation elements and targets on an annual and ongoing basis. 
 Executive Stock Ownership Guidelines  and Holding Requirements    Our stock ownership guidelines provide that each NEO must own a multiple of his or her annual base salary in our common stock, and we have  instituted holding requirements prohibiting our NEOs from selling HII common stock received as compensation until their stock ownership requirements have been met. The holding requirements also require our NEOs to continue to hold one-half of their long-term incentive awards for three additional years after they vest. 
 Director Stock Ownership Guidelines  and Holding Requirements    Although our directors do not have specific stock ownership guidelines, the restricted stock units our  non-employee directors receive do not become payable until a director ceases to serve on the Board. Non-employee directors who own shares of our common stock having a  value at least five times the amount of their annual cash retainer may elect, on an annual basis, to receive their annual equity award directly in shares of our common stock or stock units that are payable in the fifth calendar year after the year  in which the annual equity award is earned (or, if earlier, upon termination of the director's board service). In addition, beginning in 2019, non-employee directors may elect to receive their annual cash  retainers in the form of stock units. 
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT WE DON'T DO 
 No Employment Agreements for  Executives    None of our NEOs have employment agreements, so each NEO is employed by the company "at will." We maintain a severance plan that  provides for the payment of severance benefits in limited termination circumstances. 
 No Change-in-Control  Agreements for Executives    We have no change-in-control agreements or related  executive tax gross-up benefits. The only change-in-control provision in our compensation plans, which applies to all employees  who hold equity awards, is the possible acceleration of equity vesting in certain limited circumstances within the parameters of a change-in-control transaction, as  defined in the related plans. 
[END TABLE]

Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 WHAT WE DON'T DO 
 No Hedging or Pledging by Officers or  Directors    Officers, directors and certain other employees are prohibited from engaging in speculative transactions in our securities, pledging our  securities as collateral for a loan or other transaction or engaging in any hedging transactions involving our securities. 
 No Dividends or Dividend Equivalents  on Unearned RPSRs    No dividends or dividend equivalents are paid out on restricted performance stock rights during the performance period. Dividend  equivalent units are paid only at the time and to the extent that the underlying shares vest and are paid. 
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Principles 
The Compensation Committee of the Board (which we refer to as the "Committee" in this CD&A) is comprised exclusively of independent directors, as determined under NYSE corporate governance listing standards, including the enhanced independence considerations applicable to members of the Committee. The Committee oversees all of our compensation and benefit programs that affect our NEOs, as well as other officers elected by the Board. The Committee also provides strategic direction for our overall compensation and benefits structure and oversees CEO and executive officer succession plans. In conducting oversight of these programs, the Committee is guided by the following compensation principles it has approved: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our compensation programs will be primarily customer-focused, rewarding safety, quality, cost and schedule performance, and  stockholder friendly, rewarding consistent achievement of strong financial results and increasing stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation programs will be designed to influence outcomes and will provide a balance between short- and long-term  performances.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation programs will be based on achievement of clear and measurable financial results and accountabilities, with an  emphasis on performance-based compensation, and will be formula-based with appropriate levels of discretion for adjustments.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation and benefits will be competitive within the market. Alignment with peer companies will be considered when  developing programs and goals, but measures oriented to promoting strong improvements in our own business results will be the predominant factor.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Compensation will be disclosed and explained in a transparent and understandable manner. Clear and concise goals will be  established to enable the assessment of performance by the Committee and by stockholders through the CD&A.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Achievement of business goals through both annual operating performance and increased stockholder value will produce  significant individual rewards; failure to achieve business goals will negatively affect the pay of our executives.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To promote alignment of management and stockholder interests, elected officers will meet stock ownership guidelines in the  following multiples of base salary: CEO and President, seven times; all other elected officers reporting to the CEO, three times. The Committee will monitor attainment of the ownership guidelines on an annual basis. The restricted stock units our non-employee directors receive do not become payable until a director ceases to serve on the Board. Non-employee directors who own shares of our common stock having a value at  least five times the amount of their annual cash retainer may elect, on an annual basis, to receive their annual equity award directly in shares of our common stock or stock units that are payable in the fifth calendar year after the year in

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The mix of long-term awards, selection of performance criteria and oversight of compensation programs, together with other  features, such as our stock ownership guidelines and holding requirements, will be designed to discourage excessive risk taking by emphasizing a long-term focus on compensation and financial performance.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our NEO compensation strategy will be consistently applied for all incentive plan participants to promote proper alignment,  accountability and line-of-sight regarding commitments and priorities.  
[END TABLE]
Pay for Performance 
The fundamental philosophy of our executive compensation program is pay for performance. Our pay-for-performance philosophy and compensation principles are designed to attract, motivate and retain highly-qualified executives, incentivize our executives to achieve business objectives, reward performance and align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders and customers. As such, we provide significant reward opportunities to our NEOs linked to achievement of our financial and operational goals. Above all, these goals are customer-focused, rewarding achievement of safety, quality, cost and schedule goals, and stockholder-friendly, rewarding consistent achievement of strong financial results and building or increasing stockholder value. Performance-based compensation is balanced over the short- and long-term to incentivize decisions and actions that promote stockholder value and focus our executives on performance that benefits our stockholders and customers, while discouraging inappropriate risk taking behaviors. 
This focus on performance is demonstrated in the compensation mix of our NEOs. Our executive compensation is heavily weighted toward the variable, performance-based elements, and toward the long-term and equity-based elements, as reflected in the following charts, which set forth the percentage of total target compensation corresponding to each compensation element for our CEO and for our other NEOs collectively for 2018. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
(1)  Our CEO elected to receive a base salary of $1; his fixed (cash) compensation therefore represented 0% of his total direct  compensation. Total target compensation does not include perquisites and other benefits.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
(2)  Average allocation for the NEOs other than the CEO. Total target compensation does not include perquisites and other  benefits.  
[END TABLE]
The design of our incentive compensation plans also supports our pay-for-performance philosophy. A significant portion of the potential compensation of our executives is at risk, and that risk increases with each executive's level of responsibility. Exceeding our financial and operational targets can result in a payout of up to 200% of the original award target, while failure to meet our targets can result in no payouts of incentive compensation to NEOs under our plans.

2018 "Say-on-Pay" Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Consistent with our goal of supporting a pay-for-performance philosophy by implementing compensation programs that reward performance, are market competitive and align the interests of our executives with the interests of our stockholders and customers, we seek the views of our stockholders annually on the design, effectiveness and results of our executive compensation program. 
At our 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved our executive compensation on an advisory basis with 99% of the votes cast. This strong support, among other factors, resulted in the Committee not making significant changes to our executive compensation program. 
Retention of Independent Compensation Consultant 
The Committee continued in 2018 to engage an independent compensation consultant, Exequity LLP ("Exequity"), to assist the Committee in carrying out its responsibilities under its charter. Under the terms of the agreement between the Committee and the consultant, the Committee has the exclusive right to select, retain and terminate Exequity, as well as to approve any fees, terms or other conditions of Exequity's service. Exequity reports directly to the Committee. When directed to do so by the Committee, the consultant also works collaboratively with company management to develop analyses and proposals for presentations to the Committee. The Committee reviews the performance of the independent consultant on an annual basis and determines whether to continue the engagement. 
Exequity attended several Committee meetings during 2018 and presented analyses and key recommendations for Committee consideration, discussed emerging trends and technical issues and reviewed and commented on management proposals, as appropriate. In addition, the consultant responded to miscellaneous Committee requests. 
Compensation Consultant Independence Assessment 
In accordance with SEC rules and NYSE listing standards, the Committee requested and received information from Exequity relating to the consultant's independence and potential conflicts of interest, including information regarding the following: (1) other services provided to us by the consultant; (2) fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm's total revenue; (3) policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm designed to prevent a conflict of interest; (4) any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a member of the Committee; (5) any company stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement; and (6) any business or personal relationships between our executive officers and the consulting firm or the individual consultants involved in the engagement. 
Based upon an assessment of these factors, including information gathered from our directors and executive officers relating to business or personal relationships with the consulting firm or the individual consultants, the Committee concluded that the consultant is independent and that the work of the consultant did not raise any conflict of interest. 
Peer Group Development 
The Committee believes our total compensation program (base salary, target annual cash incentive awards, target long-term incentive awards and benefits) should provide aggregate compensation at approximately the 50th percentile of the relevant market. Based upon an analysis conducted by Exequity and reviewed with the Committee, the Committee determined that our NEO base pay generally falls at or below the median and long-term incentive compensation is generally in the third or fourth quartile among the peer companies. This compensation mix is consistent with both management's and the Committee's philosophy that a significant portion of an executive's overall compensation package should be based on the performance of the company and therefore at risk. 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    49 
Executive Compensation 
HII is a unique business with few directly comparable peer companies. As such, our current peer group is comprised of heavy manufacturing, engineering and defense companies that have annual revenues generally between $1 billion and $20 billion and that most closely match our company in terms of market cap, strategic interest, workforce similarities and/or business type. The median annual revenues for peer group companies was $5.9 billion, compared to our 2018 revenues of $8.2 billion. The targeted peer group for our 2018 NEO compensation analysis consisted of the following 15 companies: 
As a result of ongoing monitoring and analysis of the business landscape, the Committee has decided to modify this peer group for 2019 as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Chicago Bridge & Iron Company was removed as a result of its merger into McDermott International;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Orbital ATK was removed as a result of its acquisition by Northrop Grumman; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Parker-Hannifin Corporation and Curtiss-Wright Corporation were added.  
[END TABLE]
All other peer companies will remain the same. 
Compensation Risk Assessment 
The Board actively oversees our overall risk profile, including the potential risk posed by our compensation programs. During the third quarter of 2018, a risk assessment and analysis of our executive compensation programs was conducted by Exequity. Their findings confirmed that our executive compensation programs are designed to drive a pay-for-performance philosophy and do not create risks that are likely to have a material adverse impact on the company. The Committee reviewed and discussed the risk analysis with Exequity and agreed with the consultant's conclusions. 
The following factors are key components of our executive compensation risk mitigation efforts: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our stock ownership guidelines and additional stock holding requirement of three years from the date of payout, including  any payout that occurs within one year of retirement, provide a strong risk mitigation tool;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our clawback policy applies to all employees at the level of vice president and above, allowing us to recoup incentive  payments in the event of restated financial results;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Our lack of employment agreements discourages management entrenchment and increases our flexibility to make management  changes when appropriate;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation payouts are capped at 200%, preventing possible windfall awards resulting from unforeseen  circumstances; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Long-term incentive compensation awards are earned over a three-year performance period and reduce any incentive to engage  in business tactics that improve short-term performance at the expense of long-term success.

Executive Compensation 
2018 Compensation Elements 
The direct compensation elements for executives under our compensation program consist primarily of base salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards. Annual base salary provides a fixed minimum level of compensation that is competitive within the relevant market and helps us attract and retain highly qualified executives. Annual incentive awards are generally paid in cash and intended to motivate executives to achieve pre-determined financial and operational goals that are aligned with our strategic goals. Long-term incentive awards are generally equity-based and intended to promote achievement of pre-determined three-year performance goals aligned with stockholder interests. 
2018 Key Compensation Decisions 
Key compensation decisions for our NEOs for 2018 included the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Base salaries for Mr. Kastner and Ms. Boykin were increased as a result of market adjustments.   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets as a percentage of base salary for annual incentive awards under our AIP were not increased in 2018. Based on our  performance for 2018, as well as the individual performances of our NEOs, payout awards were approved at levels that ranged from 105% to 176% of targets.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Targets as a percentage of base salary for long-term incentive awards were not increased in 2018. All long-term incentive  awards were in the form of restricted performance stock rights, which vest only upon achievement of performance metrics.  
[END TABLE]
Base Salaries 
The base salaries of Mr. Kastner and Ms. Boykin increased in 2018, and the base salaries for our other NEOs were unchanged, effectively maintaining market competitiveness. Increases for Mr. Kastner and Ms. Boykin were based on management's recommendation and an analysis of market and peer company data conducted by our independent compensation consultant. 
Base salaries for our NEOs for 2018 were as follows:

Creation of Annual Incentive Plan (AIP) and Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan (LTIP) Goals 
The Committee approved financial metric goals under our AIP for the corporate office, as well as a combination of financial and operational metric goals for each of our three operating divisions. The guiding principle behind all of our performance metrics is that they drive the desired outcomes to promote customer satisfaction and increase stockholder value. 
Division operational goals based on clear and measurable results were developed collaboratively between division management and corporate management. Operational goals fall into the categories of safety, quality, cost and schedule, with a fifth category oriented to goals focused on division-specific challenges and opportunities, which may change from year to year. 
The Committee approved goals for the LTIP to reward performance in three-year increments. The performance metrics for all participants under the LTIP for 2018 were pension adjusted return on invested capital ("ROIC") and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and pension ("EBITDAP") over the performance period from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. 
ROIC is a measure of our ability to use cash flows to generate returns. ROIC is calculated as Adjusted Free Cash Flow divided by Invested Capital. Adjusted Free Cash Flow represents cash flow available to HII's equity and debt stakeholders, calculated as Free Cash Flow (cash from operations less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds) plus after-tax interest. Invested Capital is equal to total debt, plus equity, less goodwill and the impact of any Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss. 
EBITDAP is a key indicator of our financial performance. EBITDAP is calculated as Net Earnings, plus interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, less Net Pension/Post Retirement Benefit Expense. 
Annual Incentive Compensation Awards 
The Committee approves annual incentive compensation targets for each NEO position. Targets vary with relevant benchmark market levels, individual job level, job scope and overall influence on our business results. The Committee considers both the recommendations of its compensation consultant and those of management in determining appropriate annual incentive target levels for our NEOs. The target incentive award ("Target Bonus") is based on a percentage of each NEO's base salary and provides a basis upon which a final award amount is determined by the Committee based upon its assessment of performance against pre-determined performance criteria after the year has ended. The annual incentive compensation targets for our NEOs expressed as a percentage of base salary tend to fall into the third quartile of the relevant market data. 
2018 Annual Incentive Plan 
Annual incentive awards for Mr. Petters, Mr. Kastner and Ms. Walker for 2018 were evaluated based upon Operating Margin ("OM") and Free Cash Flow ("FCF") for the entire enterprise and revenue for the Technical Solutions division to arrive at a company performance factor ("CPF"), as well as an individual performance factor ("IPF"). OM is equal to segment operating income as a percentage of total revenues. Segment operating income is equal to operating income before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. FCF represents cash from operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds. 
Achievement of the maximum performance criteria results in a CPF of 2.0. If the CPF is less than 0.5, no annual incentive award is paid. The IPF can range from 0 to 1.5. No annual incentive award can exceed 200% of an individual's Target Bonus. The annual incentive award formula for the corporate office for the 2018 performance period was: 
Base Salary x Target% = Target Bonus 
Target Bonus x CPF x IPF = Final Bonus Award 
52    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Executive Compensation 
The 2018 annual incentive awards for Mr. Cuccias and Ms. Boykin were evaluated based on their respective division performance factors ("DPF"), which include division financial metric goals, consisting of OM and FCF for their respective divisions and their respective division non-financial goals, which include safety, quality, cost and schedule, as well as their individual IPFs. Achievement of the maximum performance criteria results in a factor of 2.0. No annual incentive award is paid if the CPF with reference to the corporate metrics is less than 0.5. The IPF can range from 0 to 1.5. No annual incentive award can exceed 200% of an individual's Target Bonus. The annual incentive award formula for the operating divisions for the 2018 performance period was: 
Base Salary x Target% = Target Bonus 
Target Bonus x DPF x IPF = Final Bonus Award 
At the conclusion of each calendar year, our CEO conducts an annual performance evaluation for each NEO in order to recommend an IPF for each NEO. These evaluations are reviewed with the Committee. Each NEO's individual performance is evaluated based upon consideration of the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial performance of our company as a whole and the division(s) (where applicable);

2018 Annual Incentive Plan Goals and Results 
For Mr. Petters, Mr. Kastner and Ms. Walker, 2018 annual incentive compensation awards were based 80% upon overall company performance and 20% upon the performance of Technical Solutions. For Mr. Cuccias and Ms. Boykin, 2018 annual incentive compensation awards were based upon the performance of the Ingalls division and the Newport News division, respectively. 
The corporate AIP score is based 80% upon our overall financial score and 20% upon Technical Solutions revenue, as described below. 
The respective Ingalls Shipbuilding division and Newport News Shipbuilding division performance scores are based 50% on the respective division operational scores and 50% on the respective division financial scores. In determining the division performance factors for AIP awards for Mr. Cuccias and Ms. Boykin, the performance criteria are weighted as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 50% based on achievement of the respective division operational criteria.

2019 Annual Incentive Plan Performance Metric Changes 
For 2019, the Committee approved a change to the metrics utilized to measure performance for the corporate office and division annual incentive awards. For AIP awards covering the performance period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019, the Free Cash Flow metric will be replaced with Operating Cash Flow ("OCF"). OCF represents cash from operating activities before discretionary pension contributions, capital expenditures and excess cash flow. The Committee believes OCF is better aligned with our focus on working capital management and cash generation. 
Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards 
Our long-term incentive compensation goals are intended to reward three-year performance increments based primarily upon the achievement of financial metrics. Long-term incentive compensation for our NEOs is provided in the form of Restricted Performance Stock Rights ("RPSRs"). Each RPSR represents the right to receive one share of our common stock, or cash of equivalent value, subject to vesting as provided in the award. Vesting occurs once the Committee determines that the applicable performance criteria for the performance period have been satisfied. Earned RPSRs may be paid out in shares of our common stock or, at the discretion of the Committee, cash. RPSRs include dividend equivalent units, or DEUs, that are credited to the RPSRs following payment by the company of a cash dividend on our common stock. These DEUs remain subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying RPSR grants and are paid only to the extent the underlying RPSRs vest upon satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria. 
The Committee determines long-term incentive compensation target values for our NEOs based upon a peer group analysis, applying value-based guidelines that focus on the award value, rather than the number of shares granted (share-based guidelines). The Committee believes value-based guidelines more effectively deliver long-term incentive compensation awards that are consistent with awards given to individuals holding comparable positions at peer companies. 
2018 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Awards 
Long-term incentive compensation awards in 2018 were granted under our stockholder-approved Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 2012 Long Term Incentive Stock Plan (the "2012 Plan"). All long-term incentive compensation awards granted to our NEOs in 2018 were in the form of RPSRs and covered the performance period from 2018 through 2020. The Committee and management review and evaluate RPSR performance goals to ensure they are aligned with our long-term objectives. For the 2018 grants, the Committee and management determined that performance for long-term incentive compensation awards to our NEOs would be measured solely in terms of overall company financial metrics: ROIC and EBITDAP. The number of shares that ultimately vest and are issued to an NEO under an RPSR award can vary from 0% to 200% of the original number of shares granted. 
Long-term incentive compensation targets as a percentage of base salary for our NEOs for 2018 were unchanged from the 2017 targets and were approved by the Committee as follows:

2016-2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan Goals and Results 
During the first quarter of each year, the Committee reviews our financial performance over the prior three years against approved long-term incentive compensation goals to determine payout multiples for RPSRs with a performance period that ended December 31 of the prior year. 
At the February 2019 meeting, the Committee reviewed performance for the January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018 performance period. Payouts for the 2016 LTIP equity grants, based upon actual performance, were approved as follows:

The 2016 LTIP awards were earned at 173% of target value, and the earned RPSRs were issued on February 27, 2019. 
2019 Performance Metric Changes for Long-Term Incentive Awards 
For 2019, the Committee added another metric to measure performance under our long-term incentive plan. For grants made in 2019 for the performance period of January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, performance will be measured using ROIC, EBITDAP and Relative EBITDAP Growth. Relative EBITDAP Growth is defined as our EBITDAP ending balance less our EBITDAP beginning balance, divided by the EBITDAP beginning balance, measured against EBITDAP growth of the S&P Aerospace and Defense Select Index (SPSIAD), consisting of more than 30 companies. The current LTIP metrics of pension adjusted ROIC and EBITDAP will be equally weighted at 40%; Relative EBITDAP Growth will be weighted at 20%. The Committee believes the addition of Relative EBITDAP Growth will supplement our existing metrics and may alleviate inherent forecasting uncertainty associated with pure budget-based, multi-year incentive plans, as well as address shareholder concerns about using purely internal financial performance measures. 
Additional Benefits 
We provide additional benefits to our NEOs through various plans that are also available to some or all of our other employees. Although these plans are not directly overseen by the Committee, the Committee considers benefits under these plans when considering an executive's total annual compensation and determining the annual and long-term compensation components. These benefits are not performance-related and are designed to provide a market competitive package to attract, motivate and retain the executive talent we need to achieve our business objectives. The plans include broad-based retirement plans, as well as additional supplemental executive benefits we provide. These supplemental benefits include supplemental pension plans, enhanced health and welfare benefits (dental, life, AD&D and disability) and the Special Officers Retiree Medical Plan ("SORMP") for our CEO upon retirement. 
Defined Benefit Retirement Plans. We maintain tax-qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover all but one of our NEOs and the majority of our workforce. These plans are structured to retain and 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    57 
Executive Compensation reward employees for long service and to recognize higher performance levels through annual pay increases. Compensation, age and service factor into the amount of the benefits provided under the plans. 
We also maintain non-tax-qualified supplemental defined benefit pension plans that cover all but one of our NEOs. These plans provide benefits that would have been provided under the tax-qualified plans if no limits applied to such plans under the Internal Revenue Code. These types of benefits are common in our industry. 
Defined Contribution Savings Plans. We maintain tax-qualified defined contribution savings plans that cover our NEOs and the majority of our workforce. Participating employees contribute portions of their pay to the plans, and the company generally provides a matching contribution. 
We also maintain two non-tax-qualified supplemental savings plans that cover all eligible employees, including our NEOs. The Savings Excess Plan ("SEP") allows eligible employees to defer compensation beyond the limits of the tax-qualified plans and receive a matching company contribution. Eligibility begins when annual income, including base pay and bonuses, equals or exceeds $275,000, the plan compensation limit under the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may participate in the plan in the calendar year after their total cash income meets or exceeds this limit. 
The Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan ("ORAC") covers the company's elected and appointed officers hired on or after July 1, 2008, who are not eligible for defined benefit pension plans. Enrollment is automatic, and the company contributes an amount equal to 4% of the officer's eligible compensation. 
Because Ms. Walker was hired after June 30, 2008, she is not eligible to participate in the company's qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, but she receives the SEP and ORAC benefits described above. Our other NEOs do not receive ORAC benefits. Additional information about the SEP and the ORAC is provided in the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation table. 
Special Officer Retiree Medical Plan. Our President and Chief Executive Officer is a participant in the SORMP and entitled to retiree medical benefits under the terms of the SORMP. Coverage under the SORMP is essentially a continuation of medical benefits into retirement, plus retiree life insurance. Additional information about the SORMP is provided below in the Retiree Medical Arrangement section of the Potential Payments upon Termination or Change of Control section and related tables. 
Perquisites. Our NEOs are eligible for certain executive perquisites, which include financial planning, dental coverage, physical exams, personal liability insurance and relocation benefits. These perquisites are common within our industry and comprise an important component of our total compensation package. Management and the Committee review perquisites and benefits on an annual basis to ensure they are appropriate. 
Severance Benefits. Management and the Committee believe severance benefits are appropriate for a reasonable amount of time following certain terminations of employment, including a termination without cause. In addition to providing a severance plan for all employees, we maintain The Severance Plan for Elected and Appointed Officers of Huntington Ingalls Industries. Benefits under this plan for our NEOs include the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Lump Sum Cash Severance Payment—A lump sum equal to one and one half (1.5) times the sum of annual base salary  and Target Bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Extension of Medical and Dental Benefits—The employer portion of medical and dental insurance premiums for a period of  18 months following the date of termination (concurrent with COBRA);  
[END TABLE]

Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial Planning Reimbursement—Eligible expenses incurred prior to the date of termination and eligible expenses  incurred in the year in which the date of termination occurs up to a maximum of $15,000 ($30,000 for the CEO), and any fees incurred in the year following the year in which the date of termination occurs up to a maximum of $15,000 ($30,000 for the  CEO); and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Outplacement Services Reimbursement—Fees incurred within one year after the date of termination (limited to 15% of  base salary as of the date of termination).  
[END TABLE]
Additional Compensation Policies 
Total Compensation—Tally Sheet 
Management provides the Committee with a total compensation and benefits perspective for each NEO, which includes a tally sheet that captures each element of total compensation and benefits. In conjunction with the Committee's consideration of NEO compensation compared to the company's peer group, this tally sheet ensures that compensation decisions are made within a total compensation framework. The tally sheet provides a broad perspective that covers basic annual compensation components, as well as an annualized value of the benefits and perquisites each NEO receives. Accordingly, the values of nonqualified deferred compensation, outstanding equity awards, health and welfare benefits, pension benefits and perquisites are included. 
Tax Deductibility of Pay—Section 162(m) 
Prior to January 1, 2018, Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code generally limited the deductibility of non-performance based compensation to $1 million each for a public company's CEO and next three highest-paid executive officers (other than the CFO). Among the provisions included in the Tax Act were changes to Section 162(m). Effective January 1, 2018, the performance-based compensation exception to the $1 million deduction limitation was repealed and the employees subject to the $1 million limitation were revised to include the CEO, CFO and next three highest-paid executive officers. The only exception to this rule is compensation paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that would otherwise have been deductible under prior Section 162(m) rules. Accordingly, any compensation paid pursuant to new compensation arrangements entered into after November 2, 2017, even if performance-based, will count toward the $1 million annual deduction limit if paid to an executive subject to 162(m). 
AIP awards and long-term incentive compensation awards in 2018 were not grandfathered under the Tax Act, and the performance-based compensation exception therefore does not apply to those awards. Accordingly, payouts on 2018 AIP awards and long-term incentive compensation awards to executives subject to Section 162(m) are subject to the $1 million annual deduction limit. Long-term incentive compensation awards granted in 2016 and 2017 were made pursuant to binding contracts in effect on November 2, 2017, and are therefore grandfathered under the Tax Act. Accordingly, payouts on the 2016 and 2017 long-term incentive compensation awards will not be subject to the $1 million annual deduction limit. 
Grant Date for Equity Compensation Awards 
Our annual grant cycle for long-term incentive compensation equity awards occurs simultaneously with salary increases and annual incentive compensation awards. We expect this to occur in the first two and one-half months of each year. This timing allows management and the Committee to make decisions on all three compensation elements at the same time to promote a total compensation review.

Executive Compensation 
Stock Ownership Guidelines 
To promote ownership of our common stock by our executives and alignment of management and stockholder interests, we have adopted stock ownership guidelines that prescribe pre-determined stock ownership levels for certain executives, expressed as a multiple of the executive's base salary. The stock ownership guidelines prescribe the following ownership levels: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• President and CEO—7 times base salary;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Elected officers reporting directly to the President and CEO—3 times base salary; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Other elected, appointed and other officers—1.5 times base salary.  
[END TABLE]
The ownership guidelines may be satisfied in one or more of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Direct ownership of our common stock;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricted Stock Rights ("RSRs") (vested or unvested) granted in the form of restricted stock units and issued as  part of a long-term incentive compensation award; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Equivalent shares held in our savings plan (401(k) plan).  
[END TABLE]
As of February 28, 2019, the percentage of stock ownership target attained by each NEO was as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name    Target% of Target Attained 
 Name    Target% of Target Attained 
 C. Michael Petters     7 x salary     2,196 
 Christopher D. Kastner     3 x salary        609 
 Brian J. Cuccias     3 x salary        746 
 Kellye L. Walker     3 x salary        198 
 Jennifer R. Boykin     3 x salary        104 
[END TABLE]
To supplement our stock ownership guidelines, we adopted stock holding requirements for our NEOs and other officers. Under the holding requirements, our NEOs and other officers must hold at least 50% of the total number of shares of our common stock received as compensation until the earlier of (a) the third anniversary of the date such shares are issued or (b) the date that employment terminates due to death or disability. The holding requirement continues upon termination or retirement for a one-year period after separation from the company and applies to any equity compensation award vesting in that one-year period. Any equity compensation award vesting or stock options exercised after the one-year anniversary of retirement or termination are not subject to the holding requirement. 
Executive Compensation Recoupment 
The Committee has adopted the Policy Regarding the Recoupment of Certain Performance-Based Compensation Payments ("clawback policy"), which requires reimbursement of all or a portion of any performance-based short- or long-term cash or equity incentive compensation payments to an employee at the vice president or more senior position level, when (i) restatement of financial results is necessitated by noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws and (ii) payment of such amounts was received by the employee during the 12-month period following the first public issuance or filing of the financial results that were subsequently restated. The clawback

Executive Compensation policy is in addition to any rights to repayment we may have under Section 304 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act and other applicable laws and does not limit other available remedies, including dismissing an employee or initiating other disciplinary actions. 
Trading Restrictions and Policy Against Hedging and Pledging 
Our insider trading policy prohibits directors, officers and employees from buying or selling securities of any company while aware of material non-public information about that company, subject to certain limited exceptions involving pre-arranged trading plans, and from providing such material non-public information to any person who may trade on the basis of such information. This policy also prohibits officers, directors and certain employees from engaging in speculative transactions in company securities, pledging company securities as collateral for a loan or other transaction or engaging in any hedging transactions involving company securities, including zero cost collar transactions and forward sale contracts. Directors, officers and certain employees may engage in permitted transactions in our securities only during certain specified periods and after receiving authorization from our Office of the Corporate Secretary.

2018 CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the annual total compensation of our employees and the annual total compensation of our CEO. The pay ratio included in this information is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K. Companies may apply a variety of different methodologies, assumptions, adjustments and estimates in compliance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K; as such, the information provided should not be used as a basis for comparison between different companies. 
For 2018, the annual total compensation of the median employee of our company was $69,824, and the annual total compensation of our CEO, as reported in the Summary Compensation Table above, was $5,551,979. Based upon this information, the ratio of the annual total compensation of our CEO, Mr. Petters, to the median of the annual total compensation of all employees was 80 to 1.

Our practice is to conduct the median employee analysis each year. December 31, 2018, was selected as the date upon which we would identify the "median employee," because it allowed us to identify our median employee in a reasonably efficient and economical manner. To identify the median employee, we compared 2018 W-2 taxable Medicare wages (Box 5) as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. This compensation measure was consistently applied to all employees included in the calculation. As a result of our analysis, we identified a new median employee for 2018. 
Once we identified the median employee, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for reporting our NEOs on the 2018 Summary Compensation Table above. With respect to the annual total compensation of our CEO, we used the amount reported in the "Total" column of the table.

(2)  These amounts reflect RPSRs granted in 2018 under the 2012 Plan. Each RPSR represents the right to receive a share of our  common stock upon vesting of the RPSR. These RPSRs and accrued DEUs are earned based upon ROIC and EBITDAP performance over a three-year performance period commencing January 1, 2018 and ending December 31, 2020, with payout occurring in  early 2021, ranging from 0% to 200% of the rights awarded. Accrued DEUs will be paid only to the extent the underlying shares vest based upon achievement of performance goals. Generally, an executive must remain employed through the performance  period to earn an award, although vesting will be prorated if employment terminates earlier due to retirement, death or disability.

(3)  Ms. Walker was hired in January 2015 and was, therefore, not eligible to participate in any historical defined  benefit pension plans, which were closed to new participants in 2008. Ms. Walker does, however, participate in company sponsored defined contribution plans.  
[END TABLE]
The pension values represent the present values of the benefits expected to be paid in the future. They do not represent actual lump sum values that may be paid from a plan. The amount of future payments is based on the current accrued pension benefit as of December 31, 2018. Pursuant to SEC disclosure rules, (i) the actuarial assumptions used to calculate amounts for this table are the same as those used for our financial statements, and (ii) all pension values are determined assuming the NEO works until the specified retirement age, which is the earliest unreduced retirement age (as defined in each plan). 
General Explanation of the Pension Benefits Table 
Individual employees may be covered by several different pension plans as a result of our history as a division of Northrop Grumman. However, an executive's total benefit under the pension plans is 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    67 
Executive Compensation essentially limited to 60% of his or her final average pay. The accrued tax qualified pension benefit cannot be reduced or taken away under applicable law, so all historical pension plans have been maintained. 
Pension plans provide income during retirement, as well as benefits in special circumstances, including death and disability. In general, the plans are structured to reward and retain employees of long service and recognize higher achievement levels through increases in annual pay. The term "qualified plan" generally means a plan that qualifies for favorable tax treatment under Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") Section 401. Savings plans (also known as 401(k) plans) and traditional pension plans are examples of qualified plans. Qualified plans apply to a broad base of employees. The term "nonqualified plan" generally means a plan that is limited to a specified group of management personnel. Our nonqualified plans supplement our qualified plans and (1) provide benefits that would be provided under our qualified plans if there were no limitations imposed by the IRC and (2) provide a minimum level of pension benefits to our executives in recognition of their higher levels of responsibility. 
The amounts in the table are based upon the specific provisions of each plan, which are described in more detail below. Two basic types of pension benefits are reflected in the Pension Benefits table: traditional benefits and cash balance benefits. For purposes of computing amounts in the table, traditional benefits are determined based on the annual pension earned as of December 31, 2018, and include any supplemental payments. Cash balance benefits are based upon the account balance as of December 31, 2018, plus a future interest credit, converted to an annuity using the applicable conversion factors. 
Mr. Kastner participates in the Huntington Ingalls Industries Retirement Plan "B" and the Huntington Ingalls Industries Supplemental Plan 2—ERISA Supplemental Program 2. Mr. Petters and Ms. Boykin participate in the HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan and the HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan. Mr. Cuccias participates in the Huntington Ingalls Industries Retirement Plan "B", the Avondale Industries, Inc. Restated Supplemental Pension Plan and the HII Litton Industries, Inc. Restoration Plan. Ms. Walker participates in the Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan ("ORAC"). Each NEO, except Mr. Petters and Ms. Walker, also participates in the Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program ("OSERP"). Mr. Petters participates in the Special Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. 
Effective December 31, 2014, the following plans in which our NEOs participate were consolidated to form the Huntington Ingalls Industries Omnibus Supplemental Retirement Plan: HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan, Avondale Industries, Inc. Restated Supplemental Pension Plan, HII Litton Industries, Inc. Restoration Plan and Special Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The consolidation does not affect the benefit amounts payable to the participants.

Description of Qualified Plans 
Huntington Ingalls Industries Retirement Plan "B" and HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan. The general benefit structure of these plans is similar except for the historical benefit 
68    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Executive Compensation formulas, the transition benefit formulas and the timing of the transition period, all of which are described below. The plans are qualified under IRC Section 401 and provide up to three component pieces of benefits depending on when a participant is hired and terminates. The following chart illustrates the component pieces (described in more detail after the chart): 
[BEGIN TABLE]
       Part B (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit based on a formula similar to the one under the historical plan formula  during the transition period              
       Part B (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit based on a formula similar to the one under the historical plan formula  during the transition period              
       Part B (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit based on a formula similar to the one under the historical plan formula  during the transition period              
 Part A Benefit under the historical plan formula before the transition period   +   or (if greater)   +    Part D Benefit  under the cash balance formula after the transition period   =    Pension Benefit 
 Part A Benefit under the historical plan formula before the transition period   +   or (if greater)   +    Part D Benefit  under the cash balance formula after the transition period   =    Pension Benefit 
 Part A Benefit under the historical plan formula before the transition period   +   or (if greater)   +    Part D Benefit  under the cash balance formula after the transition period   =    Pension Benefit 
       Part C (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit under the cash balance formula during the transition  period              
       Part C (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit under the cash balance formula during the transition  period              
       Part C (5-Year Transition Benefit) Benefit under the cash balance formula during the transition  period              
[END TABLE]
The components are the historical benefit (the Part A benefit), the transition benefit (the greater of the Part B benefit or the Part C benefit) and the cash balance benefit (the Part D benefit). Eligible employees who joined a plan after the transition date associated with their pension plan accrue only the cash balance benefit (Part D) from their first date of participation. 
The qualified benefit for each NEO is the sum of these three benefits (Part A + Max (Part B or C) + Part D).The transition period for the Huntington Ingalls Industries Retirement Plan "B" was July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2008, while the transition period for the HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan was January 1, 2004 through December 31, 2008. During the transition period, each eligible participant earned the greater of (i) the benefit calculated under a formula similar to his or her historical plan (Part B) or (ii) the cash balance formula benefit (Part C). 
The cash balance formula (Parts C and D benefits) uses a participant's points (age plus years of service) to determine a pay-based credit amount (a percentage of eligible pay) on a monthly basis. Interest is credited monthly on the amount in the participant's hypothetical individual account. At normal retirement age, a participant's balance in the hypothetical account is converted into an annuity payable for life, using specified factors. There are various forms of annuities from which the participant can choose, including a single-life annuity or a joint-and-survivor annuity. 
Specific Elements of the Plans. The following paragraphs describe specific elements of the qualified plans in which our NEOs participate. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Formulas Under Historical Plans:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan—This plan provides a benefit equal to 55% of final average  pay (as limited by IRC Section 401(a)(17)) multiplied by benefit service up to a maximum of 35 years divided by 35. Participants with pre-1997 service also have a frozen accrued benefit with the prior NNS  parent company, Tenneco. Total benefit service is used for the plan benefit, but the frozen accrued benefit with Tenneco is offset from the total benefit. Final average pay is the average of the final 60 months of base pay multiplied by 12 to  determine an annual final average pay. Mr. Petters and Ms. Boykin have historical (Part A) benefits under this formula.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan—This plan is a legacy part of the Huntington Ingalls Industries  Retirement Plan "B" and provides different benefits depending on whether the participant was an employee of Avondale Services Corporation ("Services") or a Shipyard employee ("Shipyard"). The Services benefit is equal  to 1.5% of final average pay (as limited by IRC Section 401(a)(17)) multiplied by benefit service. The Shipyard benefit is equal to the sum of 25% of final average pay (as limited by IRC Section 401(a)(17)) up to $6,600 and 40% of final  average pay (as limited by IRC Section 401(a)(17)) in excess of $6,600 multiplied by the ratio of actual benefit service to projected benefit service at normal retirement age, prorated when   
[END TABLE]
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    69 
Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
     projected benefit service is less than 30 years. In both cases, the benefit is offset by the annuitized value of the participant's HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Savings Plan  ("ESOP") account, unless the participant is eligible and elects to roll over the ESOP account into the plan. The benefit amounts shown for Mr. Cuccias reflect the ESOP offset. Final average pay is the average of the five consecutive  highest paid years during the last ten years of employment. Mr. Cuccias has historical (Part A) benefits under both of these formulas. Since he transferred from Shipyard to Services, his benefit is the greater of (1) the sum of his  Shipyard and Services benefits based on service earned under each respective formula and (2) his Shipyard benefit as if he never transferred. The Part B benefit for Mr. Cuccias is based on the Services formula.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• HII Northrop Grumman Pension Plan—This plan is a legacy part of the Huntington Ingalls Industries Retirement  Plan "B" and provides a benefit equal to 1.6667% of final average pay (as limited by IRC Section 401(a)(17)) multiplied by benefit service up to a maximum of 30 years. Final average pay is the average of the three highest-paid years  during which the participant was an eligible employee of Northrop Grumman after 1996. Mr. Kastner has historical (Part A) benefits under this formula.  
[END TABLE]

• Form of Benefit. The standard form of benefit is an annuity payable for the life of the participant. At normal  retirement, the annuity for the cash balance formula is equal to the accumulated account balance divided by 9. Other annuity options may be elected; however, each option is actuarially equivalent in value to the standard form.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Pay. Pay for purposes of the cash balance, the HII Northrop Grumman Pension Plan formula and the services formula of  the HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan is primarily salary plus the annual cash bonus. Final average pay for the HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan and the Shipyard formula of the HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan is  determined using base salary only.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Normal Retirement. Normal retirement means the benefit is not reduced for early commencement. It is generally  specified in each formula as: age 65 for the HII Northrop Grumman Pension Plan, HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan and HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan formulas and the later of age 65 and three years of vesting service for  the cash balance formula.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Early Retirement. Early retirement eligibility for the historical HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement  Plan, the HII Northrop Grumman Pension Plan, the HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan and the cash balance formulas occurs when the participant both attains age 55 and completes ten years of service. Early retirement benefits under both the  historical and cash balance formulas may be reduced for commencement prior to normal retirement to reflect the longer period of time over which the benefit will be paid.  
[END TABLE]

Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program. The Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program is a nonqualified plan frozen to new entrants on July 1, 2008. Accordingly, officers hired on or after this date and any promoted officers who do not participate in a qualified defined benefit pension plan are not allowed to participate in the program. On December 31, 2018, this program was also closed to those officers whose hire date was prior to July 1, 2008, but promotion date occurred on or after January 1, 2019. Instead, officers who were hired on or after July 1, 2008, or promoted on or after January 1, 2019, participate in the Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Retirement Account Contribution Plan, which is a defined contribution plan arrangement. 
Messrs. Cuccias and Kastner and Ms. Boykin participate in the Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program, which provides a total pension benefit equal to a percentage of final average pay (the average pay without the IRC Section 401(a)(17) limit and including deferred compensation in the three highest-paid plan years during the greater of (i) the last ten consecutive years of participation or (ii) all consecutive years of participation since January 1, 1997) where the percentage is determined by the following formula: 2% for each year of service up to ten years, 1.5% for each subsequent year up to 20 years and 1% for each additional year over 20 and less than 45, less any other HII pension benefits. Under the Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program, all years of service with HII are used to determine the final percentage. 
The Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program benefit, when combined with all HII pension benefits, cannot exceed the general limit of 60% of final average pay (reduced for early retirement, if applicable, according to the rules of the Huntington Ingalls Industries Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program).

Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan, Avondale Industries, Inc. Restated Supplemental Pension Plan, HII Litton Industries, Inc. Restoration Plan and Special Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. The consolidation does not affect the benefit amounts payable to the participants. 
Section 409A Restrictions on Timing and Optional Forms of Payment. Under IRC Section 409A, employees who participate in company-sponsored nonqualified plans, such as the Huntington Ingalls Industries Supplemental Plan 2—ERISA Supplemental Program 2, the HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Benefit Restoration Plan, the HII Litton Industries, Inc. Restoration Plan, the Avondale Industries, Inc. Restated Supplemental Pension Plan, the Special Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan and the Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, are subject to special rules regarding the timing and forms of payment for benefits earned or vested after December 31, 2004 ("post-2004 benefits"). Payment of post-2004 benefits must begin on the first day of the month coincident with or following the later of attainment of age 55 and termination from the company. The optional forms of payment for post-2004 benefits are limited to a single life annuity or a selection of joint and survivor options. 
Specific Assumptions Used to Estimate Present Values. The following assumptions were used to estimate the present values in the Pension Benefits table: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Assumed Retirement Age: For all plans, pension benefits are assumed to begin at the earliest retirement age that the  participant can receive an unreduced benefit payable from the plan. Officers Supplemental Executive Retirement Program and Special Officer Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan benefits are first unreduced once an NEO reaches age 55 and accumulates  85 points or reaches age 65. HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Plan and associated HII Newport News Shipbuilding Inc. Retirement Restoration Plan benefits (Part A and B benefits) are first unreduced at the earlier of age 62 and  completion of ten years of service or age 65. For the HII Avondale Industries, Inc. Pension Plan (Part A and B benefits), the associated HII Litton Industries, Inc. Restoration Plan (Part A and B benefits) and the Avondale Industries, Inc. Restated  Supplemental Pension Plan, benefits are first unreduced for an NEO at age 65. For the HII Northrop Grumman Pension Plan (Part A and B benefits) and the associated Huntington Ingalls Industries Supplemental Plan 2—ERISA Supplemental Program 2  (Part A and B benefits), vested benefits are first unreduced once an NEO reaches age 55 and accumulates 85 points or reaches age 65. Given each NEO's period of service, cash balance benefits (Part C and D benefits) will be converted to an  annuity on an unreduced basis starting at age 55.

The company provides a matching contribution of up to 4%, based upon a participant contribution rate of 8%. Participants are immediately 100% vested in their accounts and are allowed to make elections regarding  how their account balances will be deemed invested for purposes of crediting earnings to the account by selecting investments from a limited list of investment options selected by the administrator.  
[END TABLE]

Executive Compensation 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Based upon an advance election, payment is made in a lump sum or installments over a period of up to 15 years. Neither in-service distributions nor hardship withdrawals are allowed under this plan.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The "ORAC" covers those elected and appointed officers hired on or after July 1, 2008, who are not eligible  for defined benefit retirement plans. Enrollment is automatic, and the company contributes an amount equal to 4% of the officer's eligible compensation.  
[END TABLE]
All deferred compensation that was not earned and vested before January 1, 2005, is subject to the requirements of IRC Section 409A. Those requirements largely restrict an executive's ability to control the form and timing of distributions from nonqualified plans such as those listed in this table. 
Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control 
The tables below provide estimated payments and benefits that we would have provided each NEO if his or her employment had terminated on December 31, 2018, for specified reasons. This information is based upon the assumption that employment terminates on December 31, 2018, and uses the closing price of our common stock of $190.31 on the NYSE as of December 31, 2018. These payments and benefits are provided under the following plans: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Severance Plan for Elected and Appointed Officers  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Stock Plan and terms and conditions of equity awards  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Special Officer Retiree Medical Plan  
[END TABLE]
We summarize below these plans before providing the estimated payment and benefit amounts in the tables. Due to the many factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the termination events discussed below, any actual amounts paid or distributed to our NEOs may be different. Factors that may affect these amounts include timing during the year of the occurrence of the event, our stock price and the NEO's age. 
The amounts described in the tables below are in addition to each NEO's benefits described in the Pension Benefits and Nonqualified Deferred Compensation tables, as well as benefits generally available to our employees such as distributions under our 401(k) plan, disability and life insurance benefits and accrued vacation. 
Severance Plan 
Upon a "qualifying termination" (defined below), we have discretion to provide severance benefits to our NEOs under The Severance Plan for Elected and Appointed Officers of Huntington Ingalls Industries ("Severance Plan"). Provided the NEO signed a release, such executive would have received: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• a lump sum severance benefit equal to 1.5 times base salary and target bonus;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• continued medical and dental premium payments for 18 months following the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• financial planning expense reimbursement for fees incurred in the year in which the date of termination occurs ((limited to  $15,000) ($30,000 for the CEO)) and any fees incurred in the year following the year in which the date of termination occurs ((limited to $15,000) ($30,000 for the CEO)); and

Terms of Equity Awards Under the 2012 Plan 
The terms of equity awards to our NEOs under the 2012 Plan provide for prorated or accelerated vesting if an NEO terminates for certain reasons. For stock options and RPSRs, accelerated vesting of a portion of each award occurs upon a termination due to death, disability or retirement (after age 55 with ten years of service or mandatory retirement at age 65). An extended exercise period is also provided for options under these circumstances. For RSRs, accelerated vesting occurs upon a termination due to death or disability. 
For purposes of estimating the payments due under RPSRs below, our performance is assumed to be at target levels through the close of each three-year performance period, and we include accrued DEUs for awards granted in 2012 and later. 
The terms of equity awards to our NEOs under the 2012 Plan also provide for accelerated vesting of stock options, RPSRs and RSRs in the event that the NEO is terminated in a qualifying termination related to a change in control (see "Change-in-Control Benefits" below). 
Payouts of RPSRs for retirements and terminations is made during the normal process for payouts, which occurs during the first quarter following the end of the performance period. 
Special Officer Retiree Medical Plan 
The Special Officer Retiree Medical Plan ("SORMP") was closed to new participants in 2007. Mr. Petters is the only NEO eligible for SORMP benefits. 
NEOs who are vested participants in the SORMP are entitled to retiree medical benefits pursuant to the terms of the SORMP. The coverage is essentially a continuation of the NEO's executive medical benefits plus retiree life insurance. A participant becomes vested if he or she has either five years of vesting service as an elected officer or 30 years of total service with the company and its affiliates. A vested participant can commence SORMP benefits at retirement before age 65 if he has attained age 55 and ten years of service. The estimated cost of the SORMP benefit reflected in the tables below is the present value of the estimated cost to provide future benefits using actuarial calculations and assumptions.

Audit Committee Matters 
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
As described more fully in its charter, among the purposes for which the Audit Committee was organized are to assist the Board in its general oversight of (a) the integrity of the company's financial statements and the company's accounting and financial reporting processes and financial statement audits and (b) the company's system of internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee serves a Board-level oversight role in which it provides advice, counsel and direction to management, the internal audit department and the independent auditors on the basis of information it receives, discussions with management, the Vice President of Internal Audit and the independent auditors and the experience of the Audit Committee's members in business, financial and accounting matters. 
In discharging its oversight role, the Audit Committee reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements contained in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, with management, the Vice President of Internal Audit and the company's independent auditors. Management is responsible for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The independent auditors are responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of the financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. 
The Audit Committee met privately with the independent auditors and discussed issues deemed significant by the independent auditors, and the Audit Committee has discussed with the independent auditors the matters required to be discussed by the statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (AICPA, Professional Standards, Vol. 1, AU section 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board in Rule 3200T. 
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with the independent auditors their independence from HII and its management; received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent auditors' communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence; and considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent auditors was compatible with maintaining the independent auditors' independence. 
In reliance on the reviews and discussions described above, the Audit Committee has recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, for filing with the SEC.

 Total      7,465        8,513   
[END TABLE]
Audit fees for 2018 and 2017 related to services provided in connection with audits of our annual consolidated financial statements, including audits of internal control over financial reporting, interim reviews of our quarterly consolidated financial statements included in Forms 10-Q, statutory audits of our captive insurance subsidiary and verification of financial statements and other financial data included in securities registration statements and other documents we filed with the SEC. 
Audit-related fees for 2018 and 2017 related to services provided in connection with audits of our employee benefit plans and the adoption of new accounting standards. 
Tax fees were incurred in 2018 and 2017 for services related to nonrecurring and discrete tax projects. 
All other fees for 2018 and 2017 included non-audit-related fees for human resources and technical accounting on-line research tools. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
All 2018 services provided by Deloitte & Touche were approved by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee also reviewed these services to ensure compatibility with maintaining the auditor's independence. 
The Audit Committee has a pre-approval policy and procedures related to the provision of services by our independent auditor. Under the policy and procedures, the Audit Committee pre-approves both the type of services to be provided by our independent auditor and the estimated fees related to those services. During the approval process, the Audit Committee considers the impact of the types of services and the related fees on the independence of the auditor. The services and fees must be deemed compatible with the maintenance of the auditor's independence, including compliance with SEC rules and regulations. 
The Audit Committee must approve any fees for audit and non-audit services that exceed by certain amounts the estimates of fees for such services initially approved. The Audit Committee is advised quarterly in any event on the services performed by and fees paid to the independent auditor year-to-date for the fiscal year.

Item 1—Proposal to Elect Eleven Directors 
As explained above under Governance of the Company—Board Structure, we phased out our classified Board beginning at our annual meeting held in 2016 and ending at our annual meeting held in 2018. As a result, all 11 of our directors will be voted upon at our 2019 annual meeting to serve one-year terms. 
NOMINEES FOR DIRECTOR 
The Board is nominating the 11 individuals named below for election as directors at the annual meeting for one-year terms ending at our annual meeting in 2020 and until their successors are elected. Each of the nominees for director is currently serving on the Board with a term that expires at the 2019 annual meeting. If any nominee is unable to serve as a director, which we do not anticipate, the Board by resolution may reduce the number of directors or choose a substitute nominee.

Item 2—Proposal to Approve Executive Compensation on an Advisory Basis 
Stockholders have the opportunity to approve, on an advisory (non-binding) basis, the compensation of our NEOs. This vote is often referred to as "say-on-pay." You are being asked to vote on the following resolution: 
"RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the NEOs as disclosed in the compensation discussion and analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosure in this proxy statement." 
As described in detail in this proxy statement under "Compensation Discussion and Analysis" beginning on page 43, our compensation programs are designed to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be customer-focused, rewarding achievement of safety, quality, cost and schedule performance, and stockholder friendly,  rewarding consistent achievement of strong financial results and increasing stockholder value;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• influence outcomes and provide a balance between short- and long-term performances;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• incorporate clear and measurable financial results and accountabilities, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation, be  formulaic in nature with appropriate levels of discretion and be market competitive;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be disclosed and explained in a transparent and understandable manner, enabling the assessment of performance by our  Compensation Committee and by our stockholders through the CD&A;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• produce significant individual rewards for achievement of business goals relating to both annual operating performance and  increased stockholder value and reduce compensation for failure to achieve business goals;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• promote alignment of management and stockholder interests by establishing and monitoring stock ownership requirements;   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• mitigate excessive risk by emphasizing a long-term focus on compensation and financial performance; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• be applied consistently for all incentive plan participants to ensure proper alignment, accountability and line-of-sight regarding commitments and priorities.  
[END TABLE]
We believe our compensation program, with its balance of base salary, short-term incentives (annual cash incentive awards) and long-term incentives, rewards sustained performance that is aligned with long-term stockholder interests. We encourage stockholders to read the compensation discussion and analysis, the accompanying compensation tables and the related narrative disclosures contained in this proxy statement. 
The Board values the opportunity to receive input from our stockholders. Although this vote is non-binding, the Compensation Committee will consider the results of the vote when considering future executive compensation decisions. To the extent there is any significant negative vote, we will communicate directly with our stockholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the approval of executive compensation of our NEOs.

Item 3—Proposal to Ratify the Appointment of Independent Auditors 
Deloitte & Touche LLP audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
The Audit Committee has selected Deloitte & Touche as our independent registered public accounting firm to audit the consolidated financial statements of HII and its subsidiaries for the year ending December 31, 2019, and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. The Board has ratified this appointment. 
Although ratification of our selection of Deloitte & Touche is not required by our bylaws, NYSE listing standards or otherwise, we are asking our stockholders to do so as a matter of good corporate governance. The Board values the opportunity to receive input from our stockholders. If the selection of Deloitte & Touche is not ratified, the Audit Committee will consider whether it is appropriate to select another independent registered public accounting firm. Even if the selection is ratified, the Audit Committee in its discretion may select a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year if it determines that such a change would be in the best interests of the company and our stockholders. 
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche will attend the annual meeting, will have an opportunity to make statements if they desire and will be available to respond to questions, as appropriate. 
The Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors.

Item 4—Stockholder Proposal to Permit an Unlimited Number of Stockholders to Aggregate Their Ownership of HII Common Stock to Satisfy the Ownership Requirement Under HII's Proxy Access Bylaw 
John R. Chevedden, 2215 Nelson Avenue, No. 205, Redondo Beach, California 90278, has informed us that he intends to present the following proposal at the annual meeting and that he owns more than $2,000 of our common stock. 
Stockholder Proposal and Supporting Statement 
Proposal 4—Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access 
Shareholders request that our board of directors take the steps necessary to enable as many shareholders as may be needed to aggregate their shares to equal 3% of our stock owned continuously for 3-years in order to make use of our shareholder proxy access provisions. 
Under current provisions, even if the 20 largest public pension funds were able to aggregate their shares, they would not meet the 3% criteria for a continuous 3-years at most companies examined by the Council of Institutional Investors. Additionally many of the largest investors of major companies are routinely passive investors who would be unlikely to be part of the proxy access shareholder aggregation process. Our company has a 20 participant limit for shareholder proxy access. 
Under this proposal it is likely that the number of shareholders who participate in the aggregation process would still be a modest number due to the rigorous rules our company adopted for a shareholder to make an application to qualify as one of the aggregation participants. Plus it is easy for our management to reject potential aggregating shareholders because management simply needs to find lacking one item from a list of requirements. 
Please vote to enhance shareholder value: 
Enhance Shareholder Proxy Access—Proposal 4 
* * * * * * * 
Board Recommendation 
The Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons. 
The Board has carefully considered this proposal and believes it is not in the best interests of the company for the reasons set forth below. 
The changes requested by the stockholder proposal are unnecessary and unwarranted, as the company's proxy access bylaw already provides a meaningful and workable mechanism for stockholders to have their nominees included in the company's proxy materials, without subjecting the company and its other stockholders to unnecessary disruption or administrative burden by stockholders that do not have a significant economic stake in our company. 
HII is committed to, and prides itself on, high standards of corporate governance and responsiveness to our stockholders. Consistent with this commitment, the Board adopted a proxy access bylaw that permits a stockholder, or a group of up to 20 stockholders, owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years, to nominate and include in our proxy materials 
88    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Item 4—Stockholder Proposal to Permit an Unlimited Number of Stockholders to Aggregate Their Ownership of HII Common Stock to Satisfy the Ownership Requirement Under HII's Proxy Access Bylaw director candidates constituting up to 25% of the Board or two directors, whichever is greater, provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in our bylaws. The proxy access bylaw was implemented after careful consideration of current trends in corporate governance and input from stockholders, and we believe it reflects best practices in proxy access bylaws. Further, our proxy access bylaw is consistent with bylaws implemented to date by our peers and other public companies, and, to the extent its key terms deviate from market practice, our bylaw is more permissive than many proxy access bylaws by permitting eligible stockholders to nominate up to 25% of the Board rather than the more common 20% limitation. 
As set out above, the stockholder proposal requests that an unlimited number of stockholders be permitted to aggregate their shares to meet the 3% stockholder ownership threshold. The Board believes such a change would risk significant administrative burden to the company to confirm and monitor stock ownership of the members of a stockholder group, without a commensurate increase in availability of proxy access to our stockholders. The vast majority of companies that have adopted proxy access bylaws have included a limitation of 20 stockholders that may aggregate their shares, and making the requested change would make HII an outlier among public companies that have adopted proxy access. More importantly, we believe the existing limitation of 20 stockholders strikes an appropriate balance between the many considerations at issue in adopting proxy access rights, including that proxy access be appropriately accessible to our stockholders, assuring that such access is administratively workable for both the company and our stockholders and reserving the ability to utilize proxy access to stockholders with a significant economic stake in the company. 
In addition to making a meaningful proxy access right available to our stockholders, we have adopted an array of other strong corporate governance practices, detailed throughout our proxy statement, which assure that our stockholders have a voice in the nomination and election of our Board. All of our Board members are elected annually, and directors for whom more votes are withheld than are cast for election are subject to a director resignation policy. Further, all directors are subject to term limits and a mandatory retirement age. Stockholders may also recommend director nominees directly to the Governance and Policy Committee or may utilize the advance notice provisions of our bylaws to nominate their own candidates outside of our proxy statement. Finally, as described on page 2, we believe that stockholder engagement is an essential element of strong corporate governance and actively engage with our investors through a variety of means to understand their perspectives on our company, including in respect of corporate governance matters. Accordingly, the Board believes the requested change to the company's proxy access bylaw is both unnecessary and unwarranted. 
For these reasons, the Board recommends a vote AGAINST this proposal.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires directors and executive officers to file with the SEC reports of initial ownership and changes in ownership of our equity securities. Based solely upon a review of the reports furnished to us, we believe all of our directors and executive officers timely filed all reports they were required to file under Section 16(a) during 2018, except that one purchase of 460 shares of common stock by a family member of Stephen R. Wilson was subject to a late Form 4 filing due to communication error. 
ATTENDING THE ANNUAL MEETING 
Only stockholders or their legal proxy holders are invited to attend the annual meeting. To be admitted to the annual meeting, you will need a form of government-issued photo identification. In addition, depending upon how you hold your stock, you may need valid proof of ownership of our common stock or a valid legal proxy. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If you are a stockholder of record, we will be able to verify your name in our share register with your government-issued  photo identification. To be admitted to the annual meeting, stockholders of record must present a form of government-issued photo identification, which we will match with our share register.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
It is our policy that all employees and directors must avoid any activity that conflicts with or has the appearance of conflicting with our business interests. This policy is included in our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. In addition, at least annually, each director and executive officer completes a detailed questionnaire specifying any business relationship that may give rise to a conflict of interest with the company. 
Process for Review of Related Person Transactions. The Board has adopted a written policy for the review, approval and ratification of existing or proposed transactions to which the company (or any subsidiary) is a party, when the aggregate amount involved in the transaction exceeds or is expected 
90    Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. 
Other Information for Stockholders to exceed $100,000 and any director, director nominee, executive officer, greater-than-5% beneficial owner or their respective immediate family members had, has or will have a direct or indirect material interest. 
The policy provides that the Governance and Policy Committee will review transactions subject to the policy and determine whether or not to approve or ratify those transactions. In doing so, the Governance and Policy Committee considers whether the transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the company than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the related person's interest in the transaction, the materiality of the proposed related person transaction, the actual or perceived conflict of interest between the company and the related person, the relationship of the proposed transaction to applicable state corporation and fiduciary obligation laws and rules, disclosure standards, our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and the best interests of the company and our stockholders. 
The Governance and Policy Committee has adopted standing pre-approvals under the policy for transactions with related persons. Pre-approved transactions include, but are not limited to: 
(a) compensation arrangements of executive officers where (i) the officer's compensation is reported in the proxy statement or (ii) the executive officer is not an immediate family member of another executive officer, director or nominee for director, the related compensation would have been reported in the proxy statement if the officer was a "named executive officer" and the Compensation Committee approved, or recommended to the Board for approval, such compensation; 
(b) director compensation where such compensation is reported in the proxy statement; 
(c) transactions in which the related persons interest derives solely from (i) his or her service as a director of another corporation or organization that is a party to the transaction, (ii) his or her beneficial ownership (together with all other related persons) of less than 10% of the equity interest of any firm, corporation or other entity (other than a partnership) or (iii) both clauses (i) and (ii); 
(d) transactions in which the related persons interest derives solely from his or her position as a limited partner in a partnership where his or her interest in the partnership (together with all other related persons) is less than 10% and he or she is not a general partner and does not hold any other position with the partnership; 
(e) transactions with another corporation or organization with respect to which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer) if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the greater of $1,000,000 or 2% of that corporation's or organization's total annual revenues; 
(f) charitable contributions, grants and endowments by the company to a charitable organization, foundation or university with respect to which a related person's only relationship is as an employee (other than an executive officer), a director or a trustee, if the aggregate amount involved does not exceed the lesser of $1,000,000 or 2% of the charitable organization's total annual receipts; 
(g) transactions in which the related person's interest derives solely from his or her ownership of our common stock and all stockholders receive proportional benefits; 
(h) transactions involving competitive bids; 
(i) regulated transactions; and 
(j) certain banking-related services. 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    91 
Other Information for Stockholders 
The policy requires each director and executive officer to complete an annual questionnaire to identify his or her related interests and persons, and to notify the Office of the Chief Legal Officer of changes in that information. The Office of the Chief Legal Officer receives such information and maintains a master list of related persons, which is incorporated into an internal control designed to identify related person transactions. 
Transactions with Related Persons 
There have been no related party transactions since the beginning of 2018 that required disclosure under the securities laws or that otherwise required review, approval or ratification by our Governance and Policy Committee under our related person transactions policy.

ANNEX A 
DEFINITIONS OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
We make reference in the proxy statement to "segment operating income," "adjusted diluted earnings per share" and "free cash flow." 
We internally manage our operations by reference to "segment operating income," which is not a recognized measure under GAAP. When analyzing our operating performance, investors should use segment operating income in addition to, and not as alternatives for, operating income or any other performance measure presented in accordance with GAAP. It is a measure we use to evaluate our core operating performance. We believe that segment operating income reflects an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business. We believe this measure is used by investors and is a useful indicator to measure our performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of segment operating income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is not a measure recognized under GAAP. It should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe this measure is useful to investors, because it excludes items that do not reflect our core operating performance. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
Free cash flow is not a measure recognized under GAAP. Free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. We believe free cash flow is an important measure for our investors, because it provides them insight into our current and period-to-period performance and our ability to generate cash from continuing operations. We also use free cash flow as a key operating metric in assessing the performance of our business and as a key performance measure in evaluating management performance and determining incentive compensation. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
Segment operating income is defined as operating income for the relevant segment(s) before the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net earnings divided by the weighted-average diluted common shares outstanding. 
Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures net of related grant proceeds. 
Adjusted net earnings is defined as net earnings adjusted for the after-tax impact of the loss on early extinguishment of debt in fourth quarter 2017 and for tax reform. 
FAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the difference between expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS) and the expenses for these items included in segment operating income in accordance with U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). 
Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment is defined as the difference between the service cost component of our pension and other postretirement expense determined in accordance with GAAP (FAS) and our pension and other postretirement expense under U.S. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). 
2019 Notice and Proxy Statement    93 
ANNEX A 
Non-current state income taxes are defined as deferred state income taxes, which reflect the change in deferred state tax assets and liabilities and the tax expense or benefit associated with changes in state uncertain tax positions in the relevant period. These amounts are recorded within operating income. Current period state income tax expense is charged to contract costs and included in cost of sales and service revenues in segment operating income. 
We present financial measures adjusted for the Operating FAS/CAS Adjustment and non-current state income taxes to reflect the company's performance based upon the pension costs and state tax expense charged to our contracts under CAS. We use these adjusted measures as internal measures of operating performance and for performance-based compensation decisions.
