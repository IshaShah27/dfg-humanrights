[END TABLE]
Only holders of record of Common Stock and Class B Stock on the books of the Company as of 5:00 P.M., December 14, 2018, will be entitled to vote at the meeting and any adjournment thereof. Holders of Class A Common Stock are welcome to attend and participate in this meeting. A complete list of the Company's stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting will be available for examination by any stockholder for ten days prior to the meeting during normal business hours at the Company's principal executive offices at 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut Creek, California. 
Except for those stockholders who have already requested printed copies of the Company's proxy materials, the Company is furnishing proxy materials for this annual meeting to stockholders through the Internet. On or about December 21, 2018, the Company mailed to stockholders on the record date a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice"). Certain stockholders who previously requested email notice in lieu of mail received the Notice by email. If a stockholder received a Notice by mail or email, that stockholder will not receive a printed copy of the proxy materials unless such stockholder specifically requests one. Instead, the Notice instructs stockholders on how to access and review all of the important information contained in the Proxy Statement and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 (which the Company posted on the Internet on December 21, 2018), as well as how to submit proxies over the Internet. The Company believes that mailing or emailing the Notice and posting other materials on the Internet allow it to provide stockholders with the information they need while lowering the costs of delivery and reducing the environmental impact of the Annual Meeting. If a stockholder received the Notice and would still like to receive a printed copy of the proxy materials, such stockholder may request a printed copy of the proxy materials by any of the following methods: through the Internet at www.proxyvote.com; by telephone at 1-800-579-1639; or by sending an email to sendmaterial@proxyvote.com. 
Whether or not you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, please vote as soon as possible in accordance with the instructions provided to you to ensure that your vote is counted at the annual meeting.

CENTRAL GARDEN & PET COMPANY

PROXY STATEMENT 
The Board of Directors of Central Garden & Pet Company (the "Company") is soliciting proxies to be used at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on February 12, 2019 (the "Annual Meeting"), for the purposes set forth in the foregoing notice. This proxy statement and, in the case of holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock, the form of proxy were first sent to stockholders on or about December 21, 2018. Holders of Class A Common Stock will receive this proxy statement but will not be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders or any adjournment thereof. 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), the Company has elected to provide access to proxy materials (consisting of the Notice of Annual Meeting, this Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018) by posting them on the Internet on December 21, 2018. Therefore, the Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Notice") to its stockholders. Starting on the date of distribution of the Notice, all stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Notice or request to receive a printed set of the proxy materials. Instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request printed copies may be found in the Notice. If a Class B or Common stockholder requests printed versions of the proxy materials by mail, the materials will also include a proxy card or other voting instruction form. 
If a Class B or Common stockholder holds shares in its own name as a stockholder of record, such Class B or Common stockholder may vote shares either in person at the meeting or by proxy. To vote in person, Class B or Common stockholders should bring a form of identification, such as a valid driver's license or passport, and proof that they were a stockholder as of December 14, 2018, and the Company will provide a ballot when such stockholders arrive. To vote by proxy, Class B or Common stockholders should vote in one of the following ways: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Via the Internet. Class B or Common stockholders may vote through the Internet at www.proxyvote.com  by following the instructions provided in the Notice.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Telephone. If a Class B or Common stockholder received proxy materials or requested printed copies  by mail, such Class B or Common stockholder located in the United States may vote by calling the toll-free number found on the proxy card.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By Mail. If a Class B or Common stockholder received proxy materials or requested printed copies by  mail, such Class B or Common stockholder may vote by mail by marking, dating, signing and mailing the proxy card in the envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
Voting by proxy will not affect the right of Class B or Common stockholders to vote shares if they attend the Annual Meeting and want to vote in person—by voting in person such Class B or Common stockholders automatically revoke their proxy. Class B or Common stockholders may also revoke a proxy at any time before the applicable voting deadline by giving the Company's Secretary written notice of revocation, by submitting a later-dated proxy card or by voting again using the telephone or Internet (the latest telephone or Internet proxy is the one that will be counted). 
If you vote by proxy, the individuals named as proxyholders will vote the shares as instructed. If a Class B or Common stockholder votes shares over the telephone, such Class B or Common stockholder must select a voting option ("For" or "Withhold" (for directors) and "For," "Against" or "Abstain" (for Proposal Two)) in   order for the proxy to be counted on that matter. If a Class B or Common stockholder validly votes shares over the Internet or by mail but does not provide any voting instructions, the individuals named as proxyholders will vote such shares FOR the election of the nominees for director and FOR the ratification of the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2019. 
If shares are registered in street name, Class B or Common stockholders must vote shares in the manner prescribed by the broker, bank or other nominee. In most instances, a Class B or Common stockholder can do this over the telephone or Internet, or if a Class B or Common stockholder has received or requested a hard copy of the proxy statement and accompanying voting instruction form, the Class B or Common stockholder may mark, sign, date and mail the voting instruction form in the envelope the broker, bank or other nominee provides. The materials that were sent to Class B or Common stockholders have specific instructions for how to submit votes and the deadline for doing so. If a Class B or Common stockholder would like to revoke its proxy, such Class B or Common stockholder must follow the broker, bank or other nominee's instructions on how to do so. If a Class B or Common stockholder wishes to vote in person at the Annual Meeting, such Class B or Common stockholder must obtain a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee holding the shares. 
VOTING SECURITIES 
Only stockholders of record of Common Stock and Class B Stock on the books of the Company as of 5:00 P.M., December 14, 2018, will be entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting. 
As of the close of business on December 14, 2018, there were outstanding 12,145,135 shares of Common Stock of the Company, entitled to one vote per share, and 1,652,262 shares of Class B Stock of the Company, entitled to the lesser of ten votes per share or 49% of the total votes cast. There were also outstanding 44,015,721 shares of Class A Common Stock, which generally have no voting rights unless otherwise required by Delaware law. Holders of Common Stock and Class B Stock will vote together on all matters presented to the stockholders for their vote or approval at the meeting. 
The holders of a majority of the shares of Common Stock and Class B Stock of the Company entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at the Annual Meeting or any adjournment thereof. Votes cast by proxy or in person at the Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the election inspector appointed for the meeting and will determine whether or not a quorum is present. The election inspector will treat abstentions and broker non-votes as shares that are present and entitled to vote for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum but as unvoted for purposes of determining the approval of any matter submitted to the stockholders for a vote. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, stockholders are not entitled to dissenter's rights with respect to any matter to be considered and voted on at the Annual Meeting, and we will not independently provide stockholders with any such right. 
With regard to the election of directors, votes may be cast "For" or "Withhold" for each nominee; votes that are withheld will be excluded entirely from the vote and will have no effect. The directors will be elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors. As a result, if you withhold your authority to vote for any nominee, your vote will not count for or against the nominee, nor will a broker "non-vote" affect the outcome of the election. 
The other matters submitted for stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting will be decided by the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present, in person or by proxy, at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter. Abstentions are included in the determination of shares present for quorum purposes. 
If a stockholder's shares are held in street name and the stockholder does not instruct his or her broker how to vote the shares, the brokerage firm, in its discretion, may either leave the shares unvoted or vote the shares on routine matters. The proposal to ratify the appointment of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the current fiscal year should be treated as a routine matter. To the extent a stockholder's brokerage firm votes shares on the stockholder's behalf on that proposal, the shares also will be counted as present for the purpose of determining a quorum.  In order to reduce printing and postage costs for stockholders who request a printed copy of the proxy materials, only one Annual Report and one Proxy Statement will be mailed to multiple stockholders who request a printed copy of the proxy materials sharing an address unless we receive contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders sharing an address. This practice is commonly referred to as "householding." If your household has received only one Annual Report and one Proxy Statement, we will promptly deliver a separate copy of the Annual Report and the Proxy Statement to any stockholder who sends a written request to Investor Relations at our executive offices, which are located at 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut Creek, California 94597, or calls (925) 948-4000 and requests such a delivery. If your household is receiving multiple copies of our annual reports or proxy statements and you wish to request delivery of a single copy, you may send a written request to our executive offices at 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut Creek, California 94597, or call (925) 948-4000 with such a request.  PROPOSAL ONE 
ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
The persons named below are nominees for director to serve until the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors shall have been elected. The nominees are all members of the present Board of Directors. In the absence of instructions to the contrary, shares represented by proxy will be voted for the election of all such nominees to the Board of Directors. If any nominee is unable or unwilling to be a candidate for the office of director at the date of the Annual Meeting, or any adjournment thereof, the proxies will vote for such substitute nominee as shall be designated by the proxies. Management has no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unable or unwilling to serve if elected. Set forth below is certain information concerning the nominees which is based on data furnished by them.

Recommendation of the Board 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" EACH OF THE DIRECTOR NOMINEES LISTED ABOVE.  FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS 
Board Independence 
Upon consideration of the criteria and requirements regarding director independence set forth in NASDAQ Rule 5605, the Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Balousek, Colligan, Edwards, Hanson and Andrew Woeber and Ms. Springer meet the standards of independence established by the NASDAQ. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Under our current leadership structure, the Company has separated the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Brown served as Chairman from founding the Company in 1980 until February 2018, Mr. Pennington has served as Chairman since that time, and Mr. Roeth has served as Chief Executive Officer since June 2016. The Board determined that separating the roles was appropriate given the differences between the two roles as they are presently defined. The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for setting our operating strategy and for our day-to-day leadership and performance, while the Chairman provides guidance to the Chief Executive Officer and leads the Board. In addition, because neither Mr. Brown nor Mr. Pennington is "independent" within the meaning of the NASDAQ listing standards, the Board has selected a director who is independent to serve as the "lead independent director." 
The Board believes in the importance of independent oversight, which it seeks to ensure through a variety of means, including: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A majority of the Company's directors are independent.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Mr. Balousek acts as the Company's lead independent director. The lead independent director leads each  independent director session of the Board. He also serves as a liaison between the Chairman and the independent directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• During each regularly scheduled Board meeting, all independent directors meet in executive session without the  presence of any management directors.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The charters for the audit and compensation committees require that all of the members of those committees be  independent.  
[END TABLE]
The Board believes that the separated role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, together with the significant responsibilities of the Company's lead independent director and other independent directors described above, provide an appropriate balance between leadership and independent oversight. 
Committees of the Board 
The Company has four standing committees: Audit, Compensation, Investment and Target Setting. The Company has two informal committees: Executive and Digital Technology. The Board does not have a nominating committee or a committee performing the functions of a nominating committee. The entire Board fulfills the function of the nominating committee. 
Audit Committee 
During fiscal 2018, the members of the Audit Committee were Messrs. Colligan (Chairman) and Woeber and Ms. Springer. The Company's Board of Directors has determined that Mr. Colligan qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as set forth in Section 407(d)(5) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC and he is independent as such term is defined in the NASDAQ Rules. The functions performed by the Audit Committee include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]

Investment Committee 
In February 2017, the Board created the Investment Committee and designated Messrs. Brown (Chairman), Woeber, Colligan, Pennington and Ranelli to serve as members. The functions performed by the Investment Committee include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• oversight responsibility for establishing the investment policy of the Company for determining how to deploy  excess available equity and debt capital to maximize shareholder value;

[END TABLE]
The Investment Committee held nine meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Target Setting Committee 
In February 2017, the Board created the Target Setting Committee. Currently, Mr. Pennington and Ms. Springer serve as members. The function performed by the Target Setting Committee is to work with operating management to align to financial targets for them to develop business plans for the next fiscal year, and collaborate and develop with management, the Company's Strategic and 5-Year Operating Plan. 
The Target Setting Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Executive Committee 
In February 2018, the Board reconstituted the Executive Committee. Currently, Messrs. Brown, Pennington and Roeth serve as members. The function performed by the Executive Committee is to provide a vehicle for communication among the Company's senior leadership and discharge such responsibilities as are delegated to it by the Board of Directors. The Executive Committee held three meetings during fiscal 2018. 
Digital Technology Committee 
In August 2018, the Board created the Digital Technology Committee. Currently, Messrs. Edwards and Roeth serve as members. The function performed by the Digital Technology Committee is to bring continuing Board focus to the challenges and opportunities to the Company resulting from the development of e-commerce, digital and other technologies. The Digital Technology Committee held one formal meeting during fiscal 2018. 
Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
Messrs. Balousek and Piergallini and Ms. Springer served as members of the Compensation Committee during fiscal 2018. They have no relationship with the Company other than as directors and stockholders. During fiscal 2018, no executive officer of the Company served as a director, or as a member of any compensation committee, of any other for-profit entity that had an executive officer that served on the Board of Directors or Compensation Committee of the Company. 
Attendance at Meetings 
During fiscal 2018, there were 14 meetings of the Board of Directors. No members of the Board of Directors attended fewer than seventy-five percent of the meetings of the Board of Directors and all committees of the Board on which they served. The Company encourages, but does not require, the members of its Board of Directors to attend its annual meeting of stockholders. All members of the Board, who were members at the time, attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  Stockholder Communications with Directors 
The Board of Directors welcomes communications from the Company's stockholders. Stockholders may send communications to the Board, or to any director in particular, c/o Central Garden & Pet Company, 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut Creek, California 94597. Any correspondence addressed to the Board or to any director in care of the Company's offices is forwarded by the Company to the addressee without review by management. 
The Board's Role in Risk Oversight 
The Company faces a number of risks, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory and competitive. The Company's management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks faced by the Company. While the Board, as a whole, has ultimate responsibility for the oversight of risk management, it administers its risk oversight role in part through the Board committee structure, with the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee responsible for monitoring and reporting on the material risks associated with their subject matter areas. 
The Board's role in the Company's risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of material risk to the Company, including operational, economic, financial, legal, regulatory and competitive risks. The full Board (or the appropriate committee in the case of risks that are reviewed by a particular committee) receives these reports from those responsible for the relevant risk to enable it to understand the Company's risk exposures and the steps that management has taken to monitor and control these exposures. When a committee receives the report, the Chairman of the relevant committee typically provides a summary to the full Board at the next Board meeting. This process helps the Board and its committees to coordinate the risk oversight role. The Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight and monitoring of principal risk exposures related to financial statements, legal, regulatory and other matters, as well as related mitigation efforts. The Compensation Committee assesses, at least annually, the risks associated with the Company's compensation policies. The Board also monitors any specific enterprise risks for which it has chosen to retain oversight rather than delegating oversight to one of its committees, such as risks related to cyber-security. 
Compensation of Directors 
Members of the Board of Directors who are not employees of the Company received directors' fees consisting of $60,000 per year and $1,500 for each Board meeting attended in person. The chairs of the Audit Committee and Compensation Committee each receive additional annual retainer fees of $15,000, the lead independent director receives an additional retainer fee of $35,000 and the Chairman receives an additional retainer fee of $100,000. Directors who are not employees of the Company who attend meetings of any of the Company's standing committees receive an additional $1,500 for each meeting not held on the same day as a Board meeting. 
Each non-employee director also receives $500 for participation in each telephonic meeting of the Board of Directors or any committee of less than three hours and $1,000 for participation in meetings of three hours or more. The Company pays non-employee directors $1,500 for each day spent traveling to board and committee meetings, attending subsidiary and division management meetings and conducting plant and facility visits. Mr. Pennington receives similar annual, per meeting and travel fees for his Board service. 
Under the Nonemployee Director Equity Incentive Plan, on the date of each Annual Meeting of Stockholders, each non-employee director will be granted a number of (i) options to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock determined by dividing $200,000 by the closing price of a share of Class A Common Stock on the date of such meeting and (ii) shares of restricted stock determined by dividing $20,000 by the closing price of a share of Class A Common Stock on the date of such meeting. Mr. Pennington receives similar awards under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan.  Set forth below is a summary of the compensation earned during fiscal 2018 by the Company's directors, except Mr. Roeth, whose compensation is reported below under Executive Compensation – Compensation of Executive Officers.

Director Nominations 
Due to the fact that all directors generally participate in interviewing potential Board members, the Board has determined that it is not necessary at this time to establish a separate nominating committee. As such, the entire Board fulfills the function of nominating additional directors. A majority of the members of the Board have been determined by the Board to be independent under the standards established by NASDAQ. Our screening process generally involves successful completion of interviews with each Board member prior to any candidate being considered for nomination to the Board of Directors. Once potential candidates have successfully progressed through the interview stage, the independent directors will meet in executive session to consider the screened candidates. All director nominees must be selected, or recommended for the Board's selection, by a majority of the independent directors. Mr. Hanson, who was appointed a director in November 2018, was recommended for consideration as a director by Mr. Brown. 
A majority of the members of the Board must be independent directors as defined in NASDAQ Rule 5605(a)(2). When considering potential director candidates, the Board also considers the candidate's knowledge, experience, integrity, leadership, reputation and ability to understand the Company's business. In addition, all director nominees must possess certain core competencies, which may include experience in consumer products, logistics, product design, merchandising, marketing, general operations, strategy, human resources, technology, media or public relations, finance or accounting, or experience as a Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. While we do not have a formal diversity policy for Board membership, we look for potential candidates that help ensure that the Board has the benefit of a wide range of attributes. 
The Board will consider any director candidate recommended by stockholders, provided that the candidate satisfies the minimum qualifications for directors as described above. Stockholders must submit recommendations to the Company's Secretary for consideration by the Board no later than 120 days before the annual meeting of stockholders. To date, the Board has not received any recommendations for nominees to be considered at the Annual Meeting from any non-management stockholder or group of stockholders that beneficially own five percent or more of the Company's voting stock.  PROPOSAL TWO 
RATIFY THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has selected Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2019. If stockholders fail to ratify the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Audit Committee will reconsider the selection. If the selection of Deloitte & Touche LLP is approved, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may still direct the appointment of a different independent auditing firm at any time and without stockholder approval if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. 
Recommendation of the Board 
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS THAT STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE SELECTION OF DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AS THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM. 
Representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP will be present at the Annual Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so and will be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
The following table lists the aggregate fees billed for professional services rendered by Deloitte & Touche LLP for all "Audit Fees," "Audit-Related Fees," "Tax Fees," and "All Other Fees" for the last two fiscal years.

Audit Fees 
The Audit fees for the fiscal years ended on September 30, 2017 and September 29, 2018 were for professional services rendered for the audits of the Company's consolidated financial statements, issuance of consents and other assistance in connection with regulatory filings with the SEC. 
Audit-Related Fees 
The audit-related fees for the fiscal year ended on September 30, 2017 were primarily related to assurance services supporting the Company's adoption of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and a statutory audit. The audit-related fees for the fiscal year ended on September 29, 2018 were primarily related to comfort letters related to the Company's debt and stock offerings and assurance services supporting the Company's adoption of ASC 606. 
Audit Committee Authorization of Audit and Non-Audit Services 
The Audit Committee has the sole authority to authorize all audit and non-audit services to be provided by the independent registered public accounting firm engaged to conduct the annual audit of the Company's consolidated financial statements. In addition, the Audit Committee has adopted pre-approval policies and procedures which are detailed as to each particular service, the Audit Committee is informed of each service, and such policies and procedures do not include delegation of the Audit Committee's responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to management. The Audit Committee pre-approved fees for all audit and non-audit related services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm in fiscal years 2017 and 2018.  AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
ON AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any of the Company's previous or future filings under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that might incorporate this Proxy Statement or future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in whole or in part, the following report shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any such filing. 
The Audit Committee of the Board consists of the directors whose signatures appear below. Each member of the Audit Committee is "independent" as defined in the NASDAQ Rules and Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
The Audit Committee's general function is to oversee the Company's accounting and financial reporting and internal control processes and the audits of the Company's financial statements, including monitoring the integrity of the Company's financial statements, the independent registered public accounting firm's qualifications and independence, and the performance of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm. Its specific responsibilities are set forth in its charter. The charter is available on the Company's website at www.central.com. 
As required by the charter, the Audit Committee reviewed the Company's audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018 and met with management, as well as with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, to discuss the financial statements. The Audit Committee also discussed with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP the matters required to be discussed by Auditing Standards No. 1301, Communications With Audit Committees. 
In addition, the Audit Committee discussed with representatives of Deloitte & Touche LLP their independence from management and the Company and received the written disclosures and letter required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding the independent accountant's communications with the audit committee concerning independence. 
Based on these discussions, the financial statement review and other matters it deemed relevant, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board of Directors that the audited financial statements be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended on September 29, 2018.

• Alignment with Stockholders. A significant portion (ranging from approximately 42% to 72% in fiscal 2018)  of the executive officers' total potential compensation is paid in the form of bonuses or long-term equity awards rather than base salary in order to tie the executives' compensation to both annual financial performance and long-term stock  price performance and to align their interests with the interests of the Company's stockholders.  
[END TABLE]
The Committee discharges the Board's responsibilities related to executive compensation and continuously strives to align the Company's compensation policies for executive officers with the Company's performance and stockholders' interests. The Committee will continue to analyze the Company's executive compensation policies and practices and adjust them as appropriate to reflect the Company's performance and competitive needs. 
Impact of Say-On-Pay Vote on Compensation Decisions 
At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in February 2017, 63% of the shares voting recommended holding a say-on-pay-vote every three years. As a result, the Board determined to continue to hold a vote every three years. Also, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders in February 2017, approximately 99% of the shares voting approved the compensation paid to our named executives. Given the overwhelming stockholder support, the Committee determined to continue to approach compensation decisions in substantially the same way as in recent years.  Compensation Objectives 
The objectives of the Company's compensation program are to recruit and retain high-caliber executives, and to incentivize those executives to achieve superior financial results for the Company and its stockholders. The Company uses three primary tools to compensate executive officers: base salary, annual bonus and long-term equity compensation. Together they combine to provide an executive's total compensation package. The Company views base salary as a primary indicator of the market value needed to attract and retain executives with the skills and expertise to perform the duties and discharge the responsibilities of their positions. The Committee considers annual bonus as a means of rewarding job performance and utilizes restricted stock and stock options as a means of linking executives' long-term compensation to the Company's long-term performance and as retention devices. 
The Company's compensation program rewards executive officers for progress against corporate operating goals and for their individual contributions. A substantial portion of each executive's total compensation opportunity is weighted toward incentive compensation. When the Company does not achieve satisfactory financial results and/or its stock price does not appreciate, the compensation that can be realized by the Company's executives may be substantially reduced. When the Company exceeds financial expectations and/or its stock price appreciates, the compensation that can be realized by the Company's executives may be increased. The Committee believes that this is the most effective means of aligning executive incentives with stockholders' interests and our experience to date supports that conviction. 
Process 
As described below, the Committee periodically uses surveys and reports prepared internally and by compensation consulting firms to understand the compensation levels and pay structure at peer group companies. The Company's compensation is generally evaluated against the broad range of compensation paid by the peer group; however, the Committee also uses its judgment to determine specific pay levels necessary to attract, retain, focus and motivate executive talent. In exercising this judgment, the Committee looks beyond the market data to include individual job performance and compensation history, future potential, internal comparisons, retention risk for individual executives, and, in the case of new hires, compensation at former employers. 
With respect to the compensation of Mr. Roeth, the Company's Chief Executive Officer since June 2016, the Committee retained Pay Governance in 2016 as part of its process of finalizing the terms of his employment agreement and determining his initial salary, bonus potential, actual bonus and equity compensation. The Committee also retained Pay Governance in 2017 to advise the Committee with respect to Mr. Roeth's compensation for 2017 and his bonus potential and equity compensation in fiscal 2018. The Committee, with the advice of Pay Governance, made its decisions, with respect to Mr. Roeth's compensation, consistent with his employment agreement. 
With respect to the Company's other executive officers, the Committee receives, evaluates and considers the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer and may consult with the Company's Human Resources managers as part of its process of determining compensation. From time to time, the Chief Executive Officer may attend portions of meetings of the Committee, although he does not vote with the Committee. Other executive officers generally have no role in making decisions regarding compensation of the Company's executive officers. 
The Committee determines base salary and target bonus as of each officer's hire date, and it generally reconsiders both elements on an annual basis. The Committee determines officers' annual bonuses after the Company's financial results for the prior fiscal year are announced. The Committee generally grants each officer stock options and/or shares of restricted stock upon his or her hire date and considers granting additional awards on an annual basis. The Committee generally attempts to grant bonuses or equity compensation to existing officers on a standard schedule.  Compensation Consultants and Benchmarking 
The Committee has the authority to retain the services of compensation consultants and other advisors, as it deems necessary or appropriate, in connection with the administration of the Company's compensation and employee benefit plans, policies and programs. The Committee has periodically retained the services of a compensation consulting firm to assist the Committee in formulating its recommendations regarding executive compensation. 
During fiscal 2016, the Committee engaged Pay Governance to help it evaluate the appropriate mix of compensation for Mr. Roeth and formulate an initial compensation package for Mr. Roeth. The Company's business focus and scope and mix of operations are unique, which limits the usefulness of comparisons using a peer group. Instead, Pay Governance used more generalized reviews of external compensation levels to develop a reference range of compensation. As a result, the information provides less precision than data derived from more closely analogous peer groups. Pay Governance's reference for comparison purposes included a broad range of consumer products companies, some of which have similar annual sales and EBIT to the Company, but most of which lack similar organizational complexity. In its assessment, Pay Governance considered compensation levels for CEOs at companies of comparable sales revenue and EBITDA, in addition to broader survey data. Some of the companies included in its assessment were Diamond Foods, Cal-Maine Foods, The Fresh Market, Core-Mark and Chiquita Brands. 
Pay Governance advised the Committee in 2016 that, based on the above survey, the appropriate range for the CEO salary and bonus cash compensation was roughly $1.2-1.6 million, with an annual long-term incentive award of roughly $1.5 million. With respect to Mr. Roeth's employment agreement, Pay Governance advised the Committee that in its opinion the total compensation package for Mr. Roeth was appropriate, given his experience level and performance and the strong emphasis on performance-based compensation vs. fixed compensation. 
The Committee received similar advice from Pay Governance in 2017 and 2018. 
Allocation and Amount 
The Company compensates its executives through a combination of annual cash compensation (comprised of base salary and annual bonus) and long-term equity incentive compensation (comprised of stock options or restricted stock grants, or both). The Committee views market competitive base salary and the annual bonus targets as essential for attracting, retaining and motivating executive officers. The Committee also believes that equity incentive compensation is an essential factor in recruiting and retaining top executives and in driving performance over the long term. 
The use and relative weights of base salary, annual bonus and long-term equity compensation are based on a subjective determination by the Committee of the effectiveness of each executive in all areas of management, including achievement of the Company's strategic objectives, leadership, operating skills and other attributes. Generally, the Committee views the various elements of compensation as part of one overall package but believes that a majority of the total compensation package should be weighted toward the performance of the Company and stock price appreciation in order to align the interest of management and stockholders. In fiscal 2018, base salary, benefits and perquisites ranged from approximately 28% to 58% of each executive officer's potential compensation, reflecting the importance of performance-based bonuses and stock price appreciation. 
When evaluating corporate performance, the Committee generally considers financial metrics such as net sales, organic sales, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, and net controllable assets and also considers mergers and acquisition performance and performance against long and short-term strategic goals. When evaluating individual performance, the Committee also considers subjective factors such as the individual's overall leadership and management skills, success in attracting, retaining and developing qualified subordinates, success in achieving corporate and strategic objectives, ability to work with peers and supervisors in an effective and collegial manner, as well as numerous other criteria.  When making compensation decisions, the Committee also considers the issue of internal pay equity between the compensation of other Company executive officers and the compensation of the Chief Executive Officer. The Committee also considers issues relating to the corporate tax and accounting treatment of various forms of compensation and the impact of compensation decisions on stockholder dilution. 
The Committee continues to subscribe to the philosophy that the overall performance of the Company and its stock price should be the primary areas of consideration when rewarding the Company's top executives. However, the Committee also seeks to ensure that the Company's executive officers are paid competitively with the market so that they remain motivated to stay with the Company and achieve its business and strategic objectives. 
Salary 
The Committee reviews the base salary of most executive officers each year and generally recommends a modest increase consistent with projected increases for companies nationwide. In some instances, the Committee has adjusted base salaries of individual named executive officers for retention reasons or to maintain internal pay equity and salary integrity among the senior executives. In connection with Mr. Roeth's appointment to Chief Executive Officer in June 2016, the Committee established an initial salary of $775,000 for him, representing a modest increase from the base salary paid to the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, which had been reviewed and benchmarked against peer group companies by the Committee's compensation consultant. In fiscal 2018, Mr. Roeth's base salary was increased to $837,500. This increase reflected the Committee's assessment of Mr. Roeth's performance and took into consideration the fact that he had not received an increase in base salary at the end of either fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017 and the requirement in his employment agreement that by the beginning of fiscal 2019 Mr. Roeth's total cash compensation – including base salary and bonus – would be not less than $1,800,000. The Committee also approved a base salary increase of $10,000 for Mr. Lahanas and base salary increases of $7,100 and $8,400 for Mr. Yuhas and Mr. Lynch, respectively, in fiscal 2018. In connection with a reduction in her total hours commitment in July 2018, Ms. Schwichtenberg's base salary was reduced to $243,600. 
Annual Bonus 
The Committee determines the bonus awarded to each named executive officer after the end of each fiscal year primarily by considering the financial results of the Company for the given year and the officer's individual performance and contribution to the Company. The Committee generally sets target bonuses for each named executive officer at the beginning of each fiscal year as a percentage of his or her base salary. The target bonus percentages are generally set at a level which the Committee believes will assure that the executive's total compensation opportunity is attractive enough to motivate superior performance and that the executive is focused on key objectives, as well as being competitive with amounts paid for similar performance in comparable executive positions by the Company's peer companies. 
The Committee uses a pre-determined formula based on actual performance against target EBIT, adjusted up or down based on average quarterly net controllable assets, to make the initial calculation of an executive officer's actual bonus compensation, but the Committee retains full discretion to determine annual bonuses up to and beyond or below the amount of such executive officer's bonus potential for the year based on individual performance and other factors. The Committee also considers individual performance, including an executive's overall leadership and his or her contribution to the achievement of annual and long-term financial and strategic goals, such as customer relationships, talent development, teamwork among business units, identification and pursuit of strategic initiatives, cost control efforts and innovation and new product development, among others.  Fiscal 2017 Bonuses. Beginning in early 2018, the Committee met to determine bonuses based on the Company's performance in fiscal 2017. The following table sets forth the target bonus and actual bonus paid to the following named executive officers for fiscal 2017: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Executive Officer    Target     Actual   
 George C. Roeth      100%      116%    $ 900,000   
 Nicholas Lahanas      45%      49%    $ 185,000   
 Kay Schwichtenberg      50%      55%    $ 225,000   
 George A. Yuhas      50%      55%    $ 245,000   
[END TABLE]
In determining the amount of bonuses awarded to the named executive officers for fiscal 2017, the Committee considered the Company's financial performance in fiscal 2017, their individual performance, and progress made during fiscal 2017 in implementing the Company's strategic initiatives. Importantly, the Company's actual EBIT exceeded the target EBIT set at the beginning of the fiscal year resulting in actual bonuses exceeding target bonuses. The Committee awarded an annual bonus of $900,000 to Mr. Roeth based on the Company's strong financial performance in fiscal 2017 and its assessment of Mr. Roeth's individual performance. Bonuses were awarded to Messrs. Lahanas and Yuhas and Ms. Schwichtenberg based on the Company's strong financial performance and for their individual efforts during fiscal 2017, including Mr. Yuhas' efforts in managing the Company's legal and regulatory affairs. Mr. Lynch was not an executive officer in fiscal 2017. 
Fiscal 2018 Bonuses. The Committee has not yet determined the amount of bonuses to be paid to the named executive officers with respect to fiscal 2018. The following table sets forth the target bonus percentages for each of the named executive officers with respect to fiscal 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
The Company will report the fiscal 2018 bonus determinations in a Form 8-K once decisions are made. 
The Company does not have a policy regarding the recovery or adjustment of awards based on Company performance if a material financial measure considered by the Committee in any particular year is subsequently restated. 
Stock Options 
The Committee determines the size of executive officers' initial hire option grants with primary consideration towards making the offer of employment market competitive while consistent with awards granted to other executives. The size of annual option grants to officers is determined in the committee's full discretion after giving consideration to the officer's performance over the prior fiscal year, awards previously granted to the officer, such officer's accumulated vested and unvested awards, the current value and potential value over time using stock appreciation assumptions for vested and unvested awards, the vesting schedule of the officer's outstanding awards, comparison of individual awards among executives and in relation to other compensation elements, stockholder dilution and total compensation expense.  In January 2018, the Committee granted Class A common stock options for 75,075 shares to Mr. Roeth, 14,450 shares to Mr. Lahanas, 12,386 shares to Ms. Schwichtenberg, 12,386 shares to Mr. Yuhas and 16,515 shares to Mr. Lynch. Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Roeth was entitled to receive $750,000 in Black Scholes value of stock options with respect to fiscal year 2018 and will be entitled to similar grants in subsequent fiscal years in order to provide a strong linkage to shareholder interests. The vesting period for the stock options is 25% per year for four years. 
The Company does not have a program or practice of timing option grants in connection with the release of material non-public information. 
Restricted Stock 
The Company has historically utilized stock options as the principal means of providing its executive officers with long-term equity incentive compensation. However, the Company has also granted restricted stock to executive officers upon the commencement of employment, for retention purposes and for other extraordinary contributions. Generally, restricted stock vests, and the restrictions on transfer lapse, in accordance with a schedule determined by the Committee. The Committee has the authority to accelerate the time at which restrictions lapse, and/or remove restrictions, on previously granted restricted stock. 
Under the terms of his employment agreement, Mr. Roeth was entitled to receive at least $750,000 of Class A restricted stock for fiscal 2018 and subsequent fiscal years, subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. For fiscal 2018, the Committee decided to use time-based vesting, rather than performance-based vesting, for the restricted stock grant for fiscal 2018 in light of the Company's strong performance in fiscal 2017. 
Stock Ownership Requirements 
The Company does not have any stock ownership requirements or any policy limiting an executive's ability to hedge the risks of stock ownership. 
Post-Employment Arrangements 
Under the terms of the Company's employment agreements and non-compete and post-employment consulting agreements, certain named executive officers are entitled to payments and benefits upon the occurrence of specified events, including termination of employment. The specific terms of these arrangements, as well as an estimate of the compensation that would have been payable had they been triggered as of fiscal year-end, are described below in detail in the section titled "Potential Payments Upon Termination" on page 31. The Company's equity-based compensation plans and employment agreements do not provide for special payments to the named executive officers upon a change-in-control of the Company. 
The terms of these arrangements were set through individual negotiations with each of the named executive officers. As part of these negotiations, the Committee analyzed the terms of the same or similar arrangements for comparable executives employed by some companies in our peer group. This approach was used in setting the amounts payable and the triggering events under the arrangements. These provisions are intended to provide the individuals with a fixed amount of compensation that would offset the potential risk of leaving their prior employer or foregoing other opportunities to join or remain with the Company. The Committee considers the aggregate potential obligations of the Company in the context of the desirability of hiring the individual and the expected compensation upon joining the Company. 
The non-compete and post-termination consulting agreements are intended to protect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company's confidential information, and payments thereunder are conditioned upon the executive not working for one of our principal competitors within a specified period of time following separation from the Company.  Benefits and Perquisites 
The Company provides a 401(k) retirement plan and partial matching contributions but does not provide supplemental employee retirement plans or pensions. The Company also provides its executives with benefits such as medical, dental, life and disability insurance and other benefits that are generally available to full time employees. The Company pays for a leased automobile or car allowance for certain named executive officers. Mr. Roeth is entitled to an allowance to cover medical expenses equal to $15,000 per year in lieu of his participation in the Company's medical plan, and an annual allowance to cover financial planning services equal to $20,000 per year. The Company will also make an annual charitable contribution of $100,000 in the aggregate to the charity or charities of Mr. Roeth's choosing. 
Accounting and Tax Treatment 
In determining executive compensation, the Committee considers, among other factors, the possible tax consequences to the Company and to the executives. However, the Committee believes that it is important to retain flexibility in designing compensation programs that meet the Company's stated objectives. For this reason, the Committee will not necessarily limit compensation to those levels or types of compensation that will be tax deductible. The Committee does consider alternative forms of compensation, consistent with the Company's compensation goals that preserve deductibility. 
Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code places a limit of $1 million on the amount of compensation that we may deduct as a business expense in any year with respect to certain of our most highly paid executive officers. While the Compensation Committee considers the deductibility of compensation as one factor in determining executive compensation, the Compensation Committee believes that it is in the best interests of our stockholders to maintain flexibility in our approach to executive compensation and to structure a program that we consider to be the most effective in attracting, motivating and retaining key executives. 
Compensation Committee Report 
The Compensation Committee has reviewed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and discussed that analysis with management. Based on its review and discussions with management, the Compensation Committee recommended to our Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this proxy statement and incorporated by reference into the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2018.

 Employment Agreement – George C. Roeth 
On May 3, 2016, the Company entered into an employment with Mr. Roeth under which he was entitled to receive an annual salary of $775,000 and a target bonus equal to 100% of his base salary. He also received a signing bonus of $500,000. Beginning in fiscal 2019 and each subsequent year that he serves as Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Roeth will be entitled to a salary plus target bonus for that fiscal year of not less than $1,800,000. The employment agreement also provides for long-term equity compensation. Mr. Roeth is entitled to $750,000 Black Scholes value of stock options and at least $750,000 of Class A Common Stock as a restricted stock grant, subject to the achievement of certain performance goals. The vesting period for both the restricted stock and the stock options is 25% per year and the options expire six years from the date of grant. 
The Company may terminate Mr. Roeth at any time without cause by giving him 90 days' notice. Subject to executing a general release, Mr. Roeth will be entitled to continued vesting of previously granted stock options and restricted stock. Under the terms of a post-employment consulting agreement, Mr. Roeth will provide consulting services for 48 months upon termination of his employment with the Company. For these services, Mr. Roeth will be entitled to receive, on an annual basis, 15% of his base salary at the time of the termination of his employment with the Company, in addition to any compensation he may be entitled to for serving on the Board of Directors of the Company. 
Employment Agreement – Kay M. Schwichtenberg 
On April 1, 2014, the Company entered into a second amended and superseding employment agreement with Ms. Schwichtenberg. This employment agreement provides that Ms. Schwichtenberg will receive an annual minimum salary of $304,000 (subject to adjustment to $380,000 for an increased weekly time commitment). Effective July 1, 2018, Ms. Schwichtenberg's annual salary was reduced to $243,600, commensurate with a reduction in time commitment. She is also eligible for an annual bonus, targeted at 50% of base compensation, subject to her and the Company's performance. The agreement has an indeterminate term, unless terminated for her dismissal with cause, death or disability. The Company may terminate Ms. Schwichtenberg's agreement at any time without cause upon four months' written notice. If the Company terminates Ms. Schwichtenberg without cause, she will continue to receive her base salary and bonus eligibility for four months. Following such four-month period, Ms. Schwichtenberg's salary and bonus target will be reduced to 20% of the salary in effect at the time notice was given and her work commitment will be proportionally reduced during a one year, tail period. The tail period may be renewable for subsequent one-year periods upon mutual agreement. 
Employment Agreement – George Yuhas 
On March 1, 2011, the Company entered into an Employment Agreement with George A. Yuhas. This employment agreement provides that Mr. Yuhas will receive an annual minimum salary of $380,000. He is also eligible for an annual bonus, targeted at 50% of base compensation, subject to his and the Company's performance. The agreement has an indeterminate term, unless terminated for his dismissal with cause, death or disability.

 Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change-In-Control 
Some of our executive officers have employment agreements with us. Such employment agreements are terminable at any time. Under these agreements, if an executive is terminated by us without "cause" the executive is entitled to a lump sum payment plus continuation of all benefits associated with the executive's employment as provided below. The term "cause" is defined in each executive's employment agreement and generally means (a) an act or omission constituting negligence or misconduct which is materially injurious to the Company; (b) failure to comply with the lawful directives of the Board of Directors; (c) a material breach of the employment agreement by the executive officer, which is not cured within 30 days after written notice thereof; (d) failure to perform in a manner acceptable to the Company after written notice and an opportunity to cure; (e) the abuse of alcohol or drugs; (f) fraud, theft or embezzlement of Company assets, criminal conduct or any other act of moral turpitude by which is materially injurious to the Company; (g) a material violation of any securities law, regulation or compliance policy of the Company; (h) death of the executive officer or incapacity of the executive officer exceeding four (4) months. 
SEC regulations require that the Company estimate the value of severance benefits payable to the named executive officers assuming that the triggering event (a termination without cause) occurred on September 29, 2018, the last day of the Company's 2018 fiscal year. 
As a general matter, potential payments upon termination or change in control are not part of the Company's compensation objectives and are not used, except (i) when necessary to recruit new executives and (ii) to secure non-compete and post-termination consulting agreements that are intended to protect the Company's confidential information and are conditioned upon the executive not going to work for one of the Company's principal competitors. Except as described below with respect to Mr. Roeth's agreement, the Company's equity-based compensation plans and employment agreements do not provide for special payments to the Company's named executive officers upon a change-in-control of the Company. As a result, the Compensation Committee's decisions regarding other compensation elements are not impacted by these arrangements.

CEO Pay Ratio 
The annual total compensation of George Roeth, our Chief Executive Officer, was $2,366,754 in fiscal 2018, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table above. Based on reasonable estimates, the median annual total compensation of all employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, excluding its Chief Executive Officer, was $40,814 for fiscal 2018. Accordingly, for fiscal 2018, the ratio of the annual total compensation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer to the median of the annual total compensation of all our other employees (the "Pay Ratio") was 58 to 1. Mr. Roeth's annual total compensation does not include any annual bonus earned for fiscal 2018 as such bonus has not been determined as of the date of this proxy statement. If the target amount of Mr. Roeth's bonus was included in his annual total compensation, then the Pay Ratio would have been 79 to 1. 
To identify the median employee and the annual total compensation of the median employee, the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments and estimates that the Company used were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company selected September 29, 2018, which is within the last three months of fiscal year 2018, to  identify its employee population.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As permitted by SEC rules, in identifying our employee population, the Company excluded a total of 1,089  employees of two companies that it acquired during fiscal 2018, consisting of 772 employees of Bell Nursery, which was acquired in March 2018, and 317 employees of General Pet Supply, which was acquired in April 2018. The Company also excluded a  total of 121 employees located in the following international jurisdictions representing in the aggregate less than 5% of its employee population as a whole: Mexico (60 employees) and the United Kingdom (61 employees).  
[END TABLE]
The employee population, prior to taking into consideration these exclusions, consisted of approximately 5,406 individuals. The employee population, after taking into consideration these exclusions, consisted of approximately 4,196 individuals. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• To identify the median employee from its employee population, the Company selected total taxable cash  compensation as the measure of compensation.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Company then determined its median employee and calculated the annual total compensation of this employee for  fiscal 2018 based on the Summary Compensation Table rules.  
[END TABLE]
Review, Approval or Ratification of Transactions with Related Persons 
The Company's Board of Directors has adopted a written related person transactions policy. The Audit Committee reviews the material facts of all interested transactions that require the Audit Committee's approval   and either approves or disapproves of the entry into any transaction in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) the Company is a participant, and (3) any executive officer, director or greater than five percent beneficial owner of the Company's Common Stock (or an immediate family member of any of the foregoing) has or will have a direct or indirect interest. In determining whether to approve or ratify an interested transaction, the Audit Committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the interested transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. If a director is a related party of an interested transaction he or she does not participate in any discussion or approval of that interested transaction, except that the director is required to provide all material information concerning the interested transaction to the Audit Committee. If an interested transaction will be ongoing, the Audit Committee may establish guidelines for the Company's management to follow in its ongoing dealings with the related party. Thereafter, the Audit Committee, on at least an annual basis, will review and assess ongoing relationships with the related party to confirm that they are in compliance with the Committee's guidelines and that the interested transaction remains appropriate.

SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") requires the Company's executive officers and directors, and persons who own more than ten percent of a registered class of the Company's equity securities, to file reports of ownership and changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than 10% stockholders are required by SEC regulation to furnish the Company with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. 
Based solely on its review of the copies of such forms received by it, or written representations from certain reporting persons that no Forms 5 were required for those persons, the Company believes that, during the period from October 1, 2017 to September 29, 2018 all filing requirements applicable to its executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were complied with; provided, however, that Mr. Yuhas failed to timely file a Form 4 in March 2016 to report a net share settlement in connection with vesting of restricted stock units. The filing has now been made. 
CODE OF ETHICS 
The Company has adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of its directors, officers and employees, including its principal executive officer, principal financial and accounting officer, controller and certain other senior financial personnel. The Code of Ethics, is available at the Company's website at www.central.com/about-us/responsibility#values-and-ethics.  OTHER MATTERS 
The accompanying proxy card grants the proxy holders discretionary authority, to the extent authorized by Rule 14a-4(c) under the Exchange Act, to vote on any matter raised at the Annual Meeting. As of the date of this proxy statement, there are no other matters which management intends to present or has reason to believe others will present at the meeting. If other matters properly come before the meeting, those who act as proxies will vote in accordance with their judgment. 
STOCKHOLDER PROPOSALS 
If any stockholder intends to present a proposal for action at the Company's annual meeting in February 2019 and wishes to have such proposal set forth in management's proxy statement, such stockholder must forward the proposal to the Company so that it is received on or before August 23, 2019. Proposals should be addressed to the Company at 1340 Treat Blvd., Suite 600, Walnut Creek, CA 94597, Attention: Corporate Secretary. 
If a stockholder intends to submit a proposal at the Company's annual meeting in February 2020 which is not intended to be included in the Company's proxy statement and form of proxy relating to that meeting, the stockholder should give appropriate notice no later than November 6, 2019. If the stockholder fails to submit the proposal by such date, the stockholder may still submit a proposal at the meeting but the Company will not be required to provide any information about the nature of the proposal in its proxy statement and the proxy holders will be allowed to use their discretionary voting authority if the proposal is raised at the Company's annual meeting in February 2020.
