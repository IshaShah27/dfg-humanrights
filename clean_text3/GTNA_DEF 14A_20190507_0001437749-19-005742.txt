Only holders of record of our common stock and/or our Class A common stock at the close of business on that date will be entitled to notice of, and to vote at, the 2019 Annual Meeting. As of the record date, 94,076,880 shares of our common stock and 6,881,192 shares of our Class A common stock were outstanding. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote and each share of our Class A common stock is entitled to ten votes for each director nominee and each other matter to be acted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Cumulative voting for director nominees is not allowed.

● 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K; and

[END TABLE]
Quorum
A quorum is necessary to hold a valid 2019 Annual Meeting. A majority of possible votes, or 81,444,401 votes (including abstentions and broker non-votes (described below)), represented in person or by proxy will constitute a quorum. Votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting will be tabulated by the inspector of elections appointed for the meeting, who also will count such votes to determine whether a quorum is present for the transaction of business.
If a quorum is not present at the scheduled time of the 2019 Annual Meeting, the chairman of the meeting may adjourn or postpone the 2019 Annual Meeting until a quorum is present. The time and place of the adjourned or postponed 2019 Annual Meeting will be announced at the time the adjournment is taken and, unless such adjournment or postponement is for more than 30 days, no other notice will be given. An adjournment or postponement will have no effect on the business that may be conducted at the 2019 Annual Meeting.
Shares Held by a Bank, Broker or Other Nominee and Broker Non-Votes
If you are the beneficial owner of shares of common stock or Class A common stock held in "street name" by a bank, broker or other nominee, such other party is the record holder of the shares and is required to vote those shares in accordance with your instructions. If you do not give instructions to the record holder, that party will be prohibited from voting your shares on any matter other than with respect to the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019. If you do not provide instructions to the record holder, your shares will be treated as "broker non-votes" with respect to all other proposals voted on at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Additionally, the record holder may elect not to vote your shares with respect to the ratification of our independent registered public accounting firm, in which case your shares would also be treated as "broker non-votes" with respect to that proposal. All "broker non-votes" will be included for purposes of calculating the presence of a quorum, but otherwise will be treated as shares not voted on a proposal.
Additionally, if you participate in our Capital Accumulation Plan (the "Capital Accumulation Plan") and have contributions invested in the Company's common stock as of the Record Date, your proxy card will also serve as a voting instruction card for the trustee under the Capital Accumulation Plan (the "Capital Accumulation Plan Trustee"). If you do not give instructions to the Capital Accumulation Plan Trustee, the Capital Accumulation Plan Trustee will be prohibited from voting your shares on any matter at the 2019 Annual Meeting and your shares will not be included for purposes of calculating the presence of a quorum.
Required Vote
Director nominees will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting, which means that the nine nominees receiving the most votes will be elected. Votes withheld from any nominee will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as "votes cast" and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of the election of directors.
The ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as Gray's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Abstentions and broker non-votes will not be counted as "votes cast" and, therefore, will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.
With respect to any other matter that may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting for shareholder consideration, a matter generally will be approved by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in person or by proxy at the 2019 Annual Meeting unless the question is one upon which a different vote is required by express provision of the laws of Georgia, federal law, our Restated Articles of Incorporation ( our "Articles") or our Bylaws (our "Bylaws"), or, to the extent permitted by the laws of Georgia, the Board has expressly provided that some other vote shall be required, in which case such express provisions shall govern.
Board Recommendation
The Board recommends that you vote:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● "FOR" the election of the nine nominees to the Board to hold office until the 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders or until their successors are duly elected and qualified; and  
● "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the year ending December 31, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
Unexecuted or Unclear Proxies
If you are a record holder and properly execute and return your proxy but do not indicate any voting instructions with respect to one or more matters to be voted upon at the 2019 Annual Meeting, or if your voting instructions are unclear, your shares will be voted in accordance with the recommendation of the Board as to all such matters.
In such event, your shares will be voted FOR the election of all director nominees, and FOR the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the year ending December 31, 2019, as well as in the discretion of the persons named as proxies on all other matters that may properly come before the 2019 Annual Meeting.
PROPOSAL 1  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Nominees
The terms of office of all current directors will expire at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Elizabeth R. Neuhoff and Hugh E. Norton, both current directors, will be retiring from the Board upon expiration of their current term at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Pursuant to our Bylaws and by resolution of the Board, the size of the Board is currently set at eleven directors, but will be reduced to nine directors as of the 2019 Annual Meeting. Accordingly, at the 2019 Annual Meeting, nine directors are to be elected to hold office until our next annual meeting of shareholders and until their successors have been duly elected and qualified. The director nominees are current directors that have all been nominated for reelection by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
In case any nominee listed in the table below should be unavailable for any reason, which we have no reason to anticipate, your proxy will be voted for any substitute nominee or nominees who may be selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to or at the 2019 Annual Meeting. Alternatively, if no substitute is selected by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee prior to or at the 2019 Annual Meeting, the Board may determine to reduce the membership of the Board to the number of nominees available for election.
Set forth below is information concerning each of the nominees as of March 27, 2019:

PROPOSAL 2  RATIFICATION OF THE APPOINTMENT OF THE COMPANY'S  INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM FOR 2019
Gray's independent registered public accounting firm is appointed annually by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee examines a number of factors when selecting a firm, including the qualifications, staffing considerations, and the independence and quality controls of the firms considered. The Audit Committee has appointed RSM US LLP as Gray's independent registered public accounting firm to audit our financial statements and our internal control over financial reporting for the year ending December 31, 2019. RSM US LLP has served as Gray's independent registered public accounting firm since 2006 and is considered by management to be well-qualified.
Shareholder ratification of the selection of RSM US LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not required but is being presented to our shareholders as a matter of good corporate practice. Notwithstanding shareholder ratification of the appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may direct the appointment of a new independent registered public accounting firm if the Audit Committee believes that such a change would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. Should the shareholders not ratify the selection of RSM US LLP as Gray's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 under this proposal, it is contemplated that the appointment of RSM US LLP for 2019 will nevertheless be permitted to stand unless the Audit Committee, on reconsideration, finds other compelling reasons for making a change.
Representatives of RSM US LLP are expected to be present at the 2019 Annual Meeting and, if present, will be given the opportunity to make a statement, if they desire, and to respond to appropriate questions.
Fees
The fees billed by RSM US LLP for 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

All audit related services, tax services and other non-audit services provided to the Company by RSM US LLP must be, and all such services and the expenses related to such services in 2018 and 2017 were, pre-approved by the Audit Committee, which also concluded that the provision of such services was compatible with the maintenance of RSM US LLP's independence in the conduct of its auditing functions.
In accordance with its written charter, the Audit Committee reviews and discusses with RSM US LLP, on a periodic basis, any disclosed relationships or services that may impact the objectivity and independence of the independent registered public accounting firm and pre-approves all audit and permitted non-audit services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm.
The Board recommends a vote FOR the ratification of the appointment of RSM US LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019.

After considering all applicable regulatory requirements and assessing the materiality of each director's relationship with us, our Board has affirmatively determined that the following directors are independent in accordance with Sections 303A.02(a) and (b) of the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") listing standards and the standards set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "IRC") and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"): Messrs. Boger, Elder, Garcia, Hare, McTear, Newton and Norton. In making its independence determinations, the Board considered the following relationships between the Company and its directors, entities associated with directors, or members of their immediate families:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● Mr. Howell's status as an executive officer and his family relationships with Mrs. Howell and Mrs. Robinson, a director emeritus of the Company who is Mr. Howell's mother-in-law and Mrs. Howell's mother, and who, together with Mr. and Mrs. Howell, beneficially owns in excess of 37.1% of the outstanding combined voting power of common stock and Class A common stock;  
● Mr. LaPlatney's status as an executive officer of the Company;  
● Mrs. Howell's family relationships with Mr. Howell and Mrs. Robinson; and  
● Ms. Neuhoff's status as an executive officer of, and certain of the Company's business transactions with an affiliate of, Neuhoff Communications in certain prior years.  
[END TABLE]
Gray encourages interested parties to communicate with its Board. Any interested party who wishes to communicate with the Board or with any particular director, including any independent director, may send a letter to our Corporate Secretary, Gray Television, Inc., 4370 Peachtree Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30319, which communications will be forwarded to the Board by the Company's Corporate Secretary. Any communication should indicate that you are an interested party and clearly specify that such communication is intended to be made to the entire Board or to one or more particular directors.
The Board does not have a formal policy with respect to attendance at annual meetings of shareholders, but the Board has historically held a regularly scheduled meeting in connection with each annual meeting of the shareholders, and directors are expected to attend. All director nominees who were then serving as directors of the Company attended the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in person or by telephone.
In accordance with Section 303A.03 of the NYSE listing standards, the independent non-management directors meet in executive sessions without management or non-independent directors present on a periodic basis. These meetings were held six times during 2018. Mr. Newton, as Lead Independent Director of the Board, presided over these meetings.
Consistent with our belief that our leadership structure should reflect the best interests of the Company and our shareholders, we have not adopted a written policy with regard to whether or not the positions of Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board should be held by separate individuals. Rather, we believe that the Board should remain free to determine the Company's oversight and leadership structure from time to time based upon the availability of qualified and competent candidates. Beginning in April 2016, in light of, among other things, the Company's recent growth and related increase in operational complexity, the desire to ensure effective communication between management and the Board, to provide strong and consistent leadership through a unified voice for the Company, and to help ensure that the Chief Executive Officer understands and can effectively and efficiently oversee the implementation of the recommendations and decisions of the Board, the Board appointed Mr. Howell to the additional role of Chairman of the Board and appointed Mr. Newton, who is an independent director, to serve in the newly created role of Lead Independent Director of the Board. As Lead Independent Director, Mr. Newton, among other things:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● presides over Board meetings in the absence of the Chairman;  
● presides over executive sessions of the independent directors;  
● serves as a liaison between the independent directors and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer;  
● coordinates with the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer in developing and approving agendas, schedules, and materials for Board meetings; and  
● is available for consultation with significant shareholders.  
[END TABLE]
With respect to potential transactions with related parties required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 404(a) of Regulation S-K, the Audit Committee charter provides that the Audit Committee must review and approve such transactions in advance after full disclosure of the nature and extent of the related party's interest in any such transaction. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions" for a description of such related party transactions since the beginning of 2018 or that are currently proposed.
Management of the Company is responsible for the Company's day-to-day risk management, and the Board serves in an oversight role, including with respect to risk management. The Audit Committee assists the Board in fulfilling this risk management oversight function. The Audit Committee and management of the Company periodically review the Company's policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including major financial risk exposures and the internal controls and procedures in place to manage such risks. In addition, the Audit Committee and the Board consider risk-related matters on an on-going basis in connection with deliberations regarding specific transactions and issues.
Board Committees and Membership
The Board held six meetings during 2018. During 2018, each of the directors attended at least 83% of the meetings of the Board and meetings of all committees of the Board on which such director served.
Our Board has the following committees: the Audit Committee, the Executive Committee, the Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The Executive Committee is authorized between meetings of the Board, to manage and direct our affairs, except as otherwise provided by law or as otherwise directed by the Board. All actions by the Executive Committee are subject to revision and alteration by the Board, provided that no rights of third parties shall be affected by any such revision or alteration. The members of the Executive Committee are Messrs. Boger, Howell and Newton.
The purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in its oversight of the integrity of the Company's financial statements; the Company's compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; the independent auditor's qualifications and independence; and the performance of the Company's internal audit function and independent auditor. The Audit Committee held four meetings during 2018. The members of the Audit Committee are Messrs. Boger, Elder, Hare and Newton (as Chairman). The Board has affirmatively determined that each of Mr. Elder and Mr. Hare is an "audit committee financial expert" as that term is defined under applicable SEC rules. The identification of each of Mr. Elder and Mr. Hare as an audit committee financial expert does not impose on him any duties, obligations or liabilities that are greater than the duties, obligations and liabilities imposed on the other members of the Audit Committee. The Board has determined that all members of the Audit Committee are independent in accordance with NYSE and SEC rules governing audit committee member independence. The report of the Audit Committee is set forth in this proxy statement under the heading "Report of Audit Committee."
The purpose of the Compensation Committee is to carry out the overall responsibility of the Board relating to executive officer compensation. In carrying out this purpose, the Compensation Committee has the responsibility to, among other things, establish and review the overall compensation philosophy of the Company; review and approve our goals and objectives relevant to the CEO's and other executive officers' compensation; and evaluate the performance of the CEO and other executive officers in light of established goals and objectives and, based on such evaluation, determine and approve compensation of the CEO and other executive officers. The Compensation Committee also administers the Company's various equity incentive plans. The Compensation Committee held four meetings in 2018. The members of the Compensation Committee are Messrs. Boger (as Chairman), Garcia, Newton and Norton. Mr. Norton will no longer serve on the Compensation Committee effective upon his retirement as a director at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are independent, in accordance with NYSE, SEC and IRC rules governing independence. The report of the Compensation Committee is set forth in this proxy statement under the heading "Report of Compensation Committee."
The purpose of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities to shareholders by identifying individuals qualified to become directors of the Company, recommending candidates to the Board for all directorships, developing and recommending to the Board an applicable set of corporate governance principles, and overseeing the evaluation of the Board and management. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee held two meetings in 2018. The current members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are Messrs. Boger, Hare (as Chairman) and Newton. The Board has determined that all members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are independent in accordance with NYSE and SEC rules governing nominating committee independence. In recommending candidates to the Board for nomination as directors, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee strives to identify individuals who bring a unique perspective to Gray's leadership and contribute to the overall diversity of our Board. Although the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not adopted a specific written diversity policy for nominations, we believe that a diversity of experience, gender, race, ethnicity and age contributes to effective governance for the benefit of our shareholders. In practice, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee considers such characteristics together with the other qualities considered necessary by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, such as requisite judgment, skill, integrity and experience. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not assign a particular weight to these individual factors. Rather, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee looks for a mix of factors that, when considered along with the experience and credentials of the other candidates and existing directors, will provide shareholders with a diverse and experienced Board. Historically, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has not determined a need to use a recruiting firm to assist with this process.
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider recommendations for director nominees submitted by shareholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee's evaluation of candidates recommended by our shareholders does not differ materially from its evaluation of candidates recommended from other sources. Shareholders wishing to recommend director candidates for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may do so by writing to our Corporate Secretary, giving the candidate's name, biographical data, qualifications and all other information that is required to be disclosed under the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The foregoing information should be forwarded to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Corporate Secretary, Gray Television, Inc., 4370 Peachtree Road, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia 30319.

Except as otherwise indicated, the persons named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares shown as beneficially owned by them. The information as to beneficial ownership has been furnished by the respective persons listed in the following table.

Philosophy and Elements of Compensation Program
The goals of our executive compensation program are to attract, retain, motivate and reward our executive officers. We believe that the most appropriate executive compensation program is one that is competitive, yet conservatively designed, and that aligns long-term compensation with the creation of shareholder value and good corporate governance.
Our executive compensation program design reflects the following best practices:

The overall compensation program for our executive officers is designed to provide the Compensation Committee with the flexibility to offer a combination of cash (fixed and incentive-based) and equity-based compensation opportunities in order to retain, motivate and reward our executive officers, as well as to align their interests with those of our shareholders. To accomplish these goals, the Compensation Committee strives to achieve an appropriate level of compensation in order to:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● motivate the executive officers to deliver superior performance in the short-term by providing competitive base salary increases, annual incentive opportunities based upon satisfying specific achievements;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● align the interests of the executive officers with the long-term interests of our shareholders through the grant of equity-based compensation that offers market-competitive, long-term compensation opportunities, with the potential for above-market compensation in extraordinary circumstances;

Overview of 2018 Performance and Compensation
Actual compensation paid in and for 2018 was intended to reward a number of significant achievements during the year that the Committee believes resulted from not only the extraordinary strategic undertakings by senior management, but also their operational successes, all of which continue to contribute to building long-term value for the Company's shareholders, including, but not limited to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● achieving record annual revenue of $1.08 billion, which represented 23% growth over 2017;  
● ranking first among television broadcast affiliate groups in portfolio quality based upon station rankings in audience ratings;  
● ranking first among publicly-traded television broadcast affiliate groups in Adjusted EBITDA margin;  
● pursuing, and subsequently closing, a merger with Raycom Media, Inc. ("Raycom"), completing Gray's transformation from a small, regional broadcaster to a leading media company with nationwide scale based on highly-rated stations with exceptional talent in attractive markets (the "Raycom Merger"); and  
● further strengthening our balance sheet through our financial performance and executing multiple successful financing transactions, including transactions undertaken in anticipation of completing the Raycom Merger, and reducing the Company's total leverage ratio, net of all cash (as defined under the Company's senior credit facility), from 4.16 times at December 31, 2017 to 3.01 times at December 31, 2018.  
[END TABLE]
As a result of these and other accomplishments by management throughout 2018, the annual non-equity incentive compensation program paid out at 149% of target for all NEOs, including the CEO.
A majority of total compensation in 2018 (base salary, non-equity incentive compensation paid and long-term equity incentive awards granted) is considered "at risk", meaning that the compensation is tied to stock price volatility or would only be earned by the Company or the individual meeting annual performance goals. The composition of "at risk" pay in 2018 for the NEOs was as follows:
Compensation Framework: How We Make Decisions
Role of the Compensation Committee
The Compensation Committee of the Board maintains responsibility for establishing, reviewing and implementing our overall executive compensation philosophy. The Compensation Committee also administers our executive compensation programs through the development, evaluation and implementation of director and officer compensation plans, policies and arrangements; the approval of the compensation of each of our named executive officers; and establishing the compensation of our Board. The Compensation Committee consists of four members of our Board, Messrs. Boger (as Chairman), Garcia, Newton and Norton. The Board has affirmatively determined that all members of the Compensation Committee are independent in accordance with applicable NYSE, SEC and IRC rules governing independence.
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant
In evaluating, developing and implementing a compensation framework, policies and awards, the Compensation Committee works closely with an independent compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee directly hires, and has sole authority to terminate, the compensation consultant and to determine the terms and conditions of their engagement. The compensation consultant reports directly to the Compensation Committee.
In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to work with Meridian Compensation Consultants, LLC ("Meridian"), a leading compensation consulting firm, as its compensation consultant to advise the Compensation Committee in connection with the development and ongoing implementation of Gray's compensation philosophy, policies and practices, including through:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● striving to ensure an appropriate benchmarking of compensation for each executive based on his role, as compared to market data for similar roles within the Company's peer group, including an annual review, and updates where appropriate to that peer group, described below;  
● establishing goals under the Company's annual non-equity incentive compensation program based on achievement of defined quantitative financial metrics, as well as qualitative goals and objectives established in the first quarter of the fiscal year;  
● evaluating developments at the Company, in the television broadcast industry and the economy to ensure the Company's incentive compensation program operates effectively and provides appropriate compensation and retention incentives to the executives; and  
● applying appropriately updated methodologies and market data in making incentive compensation decisions, all as described below.  
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee takes steps to monitor and manage the independence of its compensation consultant, and as part of that process annually reviews the role and responsibilities of the compensation consultant and considers the six independence factors established by the SEC related to conflicts of interest. As a result of the policies and procedures in place with respect to the compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee believes that the compensation consultant is able to provide candid, direct and objective advice to the Compensation Committee that is not influenced by management. Meridian does not have a relationship with, nor in 2018 did it provide any services to, the Company or the Compensation Committee other than in connection with the engagement as described above. As a result, the Compensation Committee believes that Meridian is fully independent for purposes of serving as the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant.
Role of Executive Officers
At the request of the Compensation Committee, Mr. Howell, the Company's current Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, often participates in meetings of the Compensation Committee to provide input and answer questions related to management, business objectives and the performance of Gray and its executive officers. Mr. Howell presents individual pay recommendations for each of the NEOs, other than himself, and provides updates to the Committee on individual and Company performance as it relates to incentive plan progress. Neither Mr. Howell nor any other employee of the Company is present when the Compensation Committee meets in executive session to make executive officer compensation decisions.
Mr. Latek and Mr. Ryan may also participate in Compensation Committee meetings at the request of the Committee from time to time to provide input and recommendations for consideration of elements of program design and factors to be considered in establishing incentive compensation objectives.
Consideration of Say-On-Pay Vote and Related Matters
Since the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act, Gray's shareholders have been given the right to vote to approve, on an advisory, non-binding basis, the compensation of Gray's NEOs at specified intervals. At Gray's 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, the shareholders approved a proposal providing that the shareholders would continue to vote on such compensation every three years. Consequently, Gray's shareholders will next be provided the opportunity to vote to approve, on a non-binding advisory basis, the compensation of Gray's NEOs at Gray's 2020 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.
At our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, approximately 60% of the votes cast on our advisory say-on-pay proposal were voted to approve the compensation paid to our NEOs, which, while a favorable vote, nevertheless represented a significant reduction in the level of support from the prior shareholder vote in 2014. In response to that vote in 2017, the Compensation Committee sought a fresh perspective and in 2017 engaged Meridian to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our executive compensation program structure and governance processes. The results of this review, in combination with shareholder concerns, resulted in the following changes:

[END TABLE]
We value our shareholders' input, and our goal is to continue to enjoy strong shareholder support for our compensation programs by designing our compensation programs to support our overall compensation philosophy and to align with the creation of shareholder value. The Compensation Committee is committed to continuing to seek investor feedback on executive compensation issues and to design and implement compensation programs that not only serve to attract, incent and retain its key executive officers but also serve the long-term interests of our shareholders.
Determining Competitive Practices
The Compensation Committee, with the assistance of Meridian, has established, and evaluates the compensation policies and practices of a peer group for purposes of determining appropriate compensation types and amounts for our executive officers. Specifically, in 2018, the Compensation Committee used the peer group for relevant executive compensation comparisons such as market valuations of similar positions, and benchmarked certain compensation amounts and opportunities for each executive officer to market data for executives performing similar roles at peer group companies.
Following an analysis by the Compensation Committee, with the assistance of its compensation consultant and executive officers, the Committee used the following compensation peer group to develop benchmarking data for each of the executive officers:

The Compensation Committee believes that the use of peer group benchmarking for executive compensation determination is appropriate and provides data relevant in helping the Compensation Committee execute on its philosophy. There were no changes in the composition of the peer group for 2018.
Process for Establishing Executive Officer Total Compensation
Peer group data is one of many inputs used by the Compensation Committee when establishing pay levels for the Company's NEOs. In establishing NEO compensation levels for 2018, the Compensation Committee with input from the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer (with respect to the other executive officers) and its independent compensation consultant, considered and evaluated historical and expected executive performance, peer group compensation metrics, internal pay equity considerations and a competitive market study prepared by the compensation consultant.
Compensation Decisions Made for 2018
Base Salary
The base salary element of our executive compensation program provides each NEO with a fixed amount of annual cash compensation, intended to ensure an appropriate amount of financial certainty. Salaries for the NEOs are generally subject to annual review and adjustment by the Compensation Committee based on the size and complexity of the Company and its operations, the scope of each individual executive's role, the knowledge and experience of the individual executive, the competitiveness of the executive's total compensation as compared to the peer group, the performance of the incumbent and other factors.
Consistent with its practice of making initial compensation decisions for a fiscal year in the first quarter of each year, the Compensation Committee approved our NEOs' base salaries for 2018 at its meeting in February 2018. At that time, and after consideration of the factors described above, the Compensation Committee approved the following base salary increases for the NEOs to more closely align with the competitive market and desired pay positioning, and to reward for individual performance contributions from the prior year:
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Kevin N. Waller      575,000       609,500       6.0%   
[END TABLE]
The Compensation Committee expects to continue to monitor the named executive officers' base salaries, and make adjustments from time to time as appropriate.
Annual Non-Equity Incentive Compensation Program
The objective of our annual non-equity incentive compensation program is to focus executive officers on attaining specific short-term financial and operational goals that contribute to the long-term success of our business. The annual non-equity incentive compensation program is designed to reward achievement of both Company performance as well as individual performance, when warranted.
In 2018, the Compensation Committee continued to enhance the design of the program by aligning the financial metrics with those that are most critical to the business, and by adding the ability to modify the payout of the award +/- 25% based upon individual performance, if warranted, but not to exceed the overall maximum payout amount of 200% of target.
The overall program design was similar to 2017, with 60% of the target opportunity earned based on performance against select quantitative financial metrics and 40% earned based on performance against qualitative goals that focus on operational and strategic metrics. Goals are determined at the Compensation Committee's regularly scheduled meeting in the first quarter of each year after a review of financial and other performance data from the prior year and certain internally forecasted financial information. The quantitative metrics are designed to provide focus and certainty for management in striving to achieve pre-established financial goals that will lead to overall company success. Qualitative performance metrics will generally be chosen from those the Compensation Committee deems appropriate to motivate the Company's executive officers towards the achievement of performance-based objectives that are in the Company's long-term best interests.
Quantitative Performance Metrics (60% weight)
In 2018, the Compensation Committee selected the following three quantitative metrics against which to measure performance – which are considered by management to be critical factors in driving revenue and profitability for the Company:
[BEGIN TABLE]

[END TABLE]
For 2018, the Compensation Committee determined to eliminate net operating profit (which had been included in our 2017 compensation program at 15% weight) and replace it with a quantitative metric based on revenue from acquired stations and political advertising. The Compensation Committee believes that decision was appropriate given the prior metric's similarity to cash flow, and the desire instead to have a metric that aligns with the strategic focus on driving top line growth, both organically and through acquisitions.
For each performance metric, the target performance goal under the Company's annual non-equity incentive compensation program was aligned with the Company's internal business plan and annual budget (except that for Acquired Stations, 80% of the budgeted revenue for the acquired stations was established as target), all as approved by the Compensation Committee. Threshold goals were established at 80% of the applicable target so that a minimum level of performance was required to be achieved before any incentive payment would be awarded, with a significant reduction to the incentive eligible to be earned if results were below target. Maximum award levels were established at achievement of 110% of target levels, as the Compensation Committee believed this represented an appropriate amount of stretch for the goals.
The Compensation Committee sets the threshold, target and maximum criteria at the start of each fiscal year to ensure that an appropriate degree of difficulty is incorporated into the goals. In addition, and in order to minimize the potential for changes in goals throughout the year, performance for determining award eligibility is evaluated excluding the results of any divested operations.
The following goals were established for 2018:

Actual performance levels between threshold and target, or between target and maximum, are used to determine actual incentive awards. For purposes of calculating amounts payable under the annual non-equity incentive compensation program, actual Company performance compared to goal performance for each of the metrics was determined and calculated discretely.
Qualitative Performance Metrics
As described above, the Compensation Committee determined that for 2018, in light of, among other things, the growth in size of the Company through acquisitions, the increasing scope and complexity of the Company's operations and the range of contributions the executive officers make to enhancing the Company's operations and long-term value for shareholders, it was appropriate to include certain non-quantitative Company performance metrics (collectively the "qualitative metrics") for purposes of determining performance under the annual non-equity incentive compensation program. Specifically, the qualitative metrics approved for measurement purposes in 2018 were weighted 40% of the total award opportunity and were comprised of a mix of absolute and relative factors that the Compensation Committee identified as important measures of success in achieving the Company's long-term goals.
The qualitative metrics approved for 2018 consisted of the following four absolute measures of the Company's performance: (1) growth in total revenues (net of agency commissions) of 3% or more; (2) growth in enterprise value (i.e., the sum of the Company's outstanding debt plus equity value) of 5% or more; (3) reduction in the net leverage ratio by more than 10 basis points; and (4) improvement by more than 10 basis points in effective net interest rate measured at the beginning and the end of the calendar year.
In addition, the qualitative metrics included for 2018 consisted of the following relative factors by which the Company's performance would be measured in comparison to the following television station groups: Sinclair; Tribune Media; Nexstar; E. W. Scripps; Meredith; TEGNA; Graham Holdings; Cox Broadcasting; Hearst Corporation and Raycom Media (prior to its ultimate acquisition by the Company):
[BEGIN TABLE]
● average ratings across all primary television channels;  
● the Company's ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") to revenue (net of agency commissions);  
● the number of individual transactions involving the acquisition of local television stations, in each case including stations ranked first or second in the local market, in new markets and additional television stations in existing markets;  
● successful execution of one or more capital markets transactions;  
● the percentage of operating markets with the first and/or second ranked television station (based on BIA/Kelsey revenue estimates);  
● growth in net retransmission revenue relative to the prior year;  
● growth in share of local advertising revenue relative to the prior year;  
● growth in share of national advertising revenue relative to the prior year; and  
● growth in share of political advertising revenue relative to the prior political year.  
[END TABLE]
The weighting of the total incentive opportunity assigned to each of the approved metrics for 2018 was as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● 15% for Revenues (net of acquired stations and political advertising) goals,  
● 15% for Revenues derived from political and acquired stations goals,  
● 30% for Broadcast Cash Flow goals and  
● 40% for the other qualitative performance factors.  
[END TABLE]
Annual Award Opportunities
Annual non-equity incentive compensation program payout opportunity levels were established to provide each NEO with a market-competitive incentive opportunity linked to achievement of the pre-determined financial goals, qualitative metrics and individual performance. Consistent with the Company's overall compensation philosophy, annual non-equity incentive compensation program award opportunity levels (as a percentage of base salary) approved by the Compensation Committee for the NEOs in 2018 were as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
     Annual Incentive Opportunity    
 Name     Threshold       Target       Maximum    
 Hilton H. Howell, Jr.      50%       100%       200%   
 James C. Ryan      35%         70%       140%   
 Kevin P. Latek      35%         70%       140%   
 Robert L. Smith      30%         60%       120%   
 Kevin N. Waller      30%         60%       120%   
[END TABLE]
At the Compensation Committee's regularly scheduled meeting in the first quarter of 2019, the achievement of financial goals for 2018 were certified, with resulting payouts approved following the Compensation Committee's review of the Company's audited financial results for the prior fiscal year. The Committee also reviewed certain publicly available information, data licensed from third parties, and internal proprietary data to assess the Company's performance with respect to the qualitative metrics. Following careful consideration of that material, the Committee concluded that on an overall basis the Company surpassed the goals set for the 2018 qualitative metrics of satisfying essentially all of the thirteen identified metrics. In particular, the Company significantly surpassed each of the four absolute metrics, and it ranked first or second among industry peers in nearly all of the relative metrics included in the qualitative metrics analysis. The Compensation Committee therefore concluded that qualitative metric portions of the annual incentive compensation be scored at maximum, generating a 150% of target payout for that component. Total quantitative and qualitative metric amounts for the annual incentive compensation to each NEO were awarded as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Financial Performance Metrics%   			Weight       Target       Final Results% of Target  Payout  
 Financial Performance Metrics%   			Weight       Target       Final Results% of Target  Payout  
 Revenues (Political + Acquired Stations)      15%       $120,763       $155,074    200% of target  
 Broadcast Cash Flow      30%       $358,615       $334,155    83% of target  
 Qualitative Metrics      40%      Exceeded Expectations     200% of target  
 Total payout (as% of target)                           149% of target  
[END TABLE]
The Committee did not exercise its discretion to further adjust payouts based on individual performance for 2018. Individual incentive payouts are reported in the Summary Compensation Table found on page 28 of the proxy.
Long-Term Equity Incentive Awards
The decision to grant, and the amounts of, equity-based long-term incentive awards, on an annual basis or otherwise, is generally a discretionary process. In undertaking this decision-making process, the Compensation Committee considers a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the amount and value of recent equity-based awards;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● recent historical Company performance, determined by reference to stock price or other appropriate financial metric;  
● expected short and longer-term Company performance in light of internal budgets or forecasts; and  
● the overall competitiveness of current compensation levels when considered against an appropriate peer group.  
[END TABLE]
In the event equity-based long-term incentive awards are granted, it has been the historical practice that award levels are also established at the Compensation Committee's discretion, as opposed to being made with a formulaic approach such as is used to provide annual non-equity incentive compensation opportunities.
In order to be able to provide awards intended to further align the interests of our executive officers, and other key employees, with the interests of our shareholders through stock price appreciation, we have established, and at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders the Company's shareholders approved, the Gray Television, Inc. 2017 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2017 EICP"). The 2017 EICP allows for the grant of various types of equity awards including performance shares, restricted shares and stock options. If stock options are granted, it is our practice to grant options with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the underlying class of our stock on the date of grant.
Beginning in 2018, the Compensation Committee modified the structure of the long-term incentive awards granted to the Chief Executive Officer as follows:
[BEGIN TABLE]
   ■   50% of the equity award was granted in restricted shares of Class A common stock, which vests in increments based on continued employment on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant; and  
   ■   50% of the equity award was granted in shares of performance-based restricted Class A common stock, which can be earned in a range of 0% to 200% of the initial shares awarded, at the end of three years from the grant date, based upon the average percent of target payout earned based on Company performance under the annual non-equity incentive program in 2018, 2019 and 2020. The earned number of shares will vest and be paid out in Class A common stock at the end of the three-year period once performance has been approved by the Compensation Committee.  
[END TABLE]
In February 2018, in order to further incentivize the NEOs toward the creation of long-term value, and considering recent historical Company performance, recent years' equity incentive awards and the overall value of the NEOs' respective target compensation levels, the Compensation Committee approved long-term equity incentive awards with the following values (as a percent of base salary):
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Name     LTI% of Base Salary    
 Name     LTI% of Base Salary    
 James C. Ryan      140%   
 Kevin P. Latek      140%   
 Robert L. Smith      100%   
 Kevin N. Waller      100%   
[END TABLE]
With respect to the restricted shares of stock awarded to Mr. Howell, one half vest in equal annual installments over the period from February 2019 through 2021, and the other half vest, subject to satisfaction of the applicable performance criteria, three years from the date of grant. To provide a balance between retention and performance for the NEOs other than Mr. Howell, the Compensation Committee granted these restricted stock awards with a three-year ratable vesting schedule beginning one year from the date of grant.
See "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018" for additional information, including the amount and grant date fair value of shares awarded.
Special Grants to Certain Named Executive Officers
In February 2018, after having assessed the incentive compensation awards achieved by the executive officers for 2017 and their overall compensation relative to their peers in our marketplace, the Compensation Committee determined to grant an additional one-time special award of restricted shares of common stock to the named executive officers other than the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee made those awards, in part, to assure that these officers' compensation was appropriately aligned with the competitive marketplace and to recognize their specific contributions to the Company's achievements during 2017. As a result, awards of restricted shares of common stock were made as follows: Mr. Ryan (20,208 shares), Mr. Latek (21,263 shares), Mr. Smith (9,992 shares) and Mr. Waller (9,992 shares), all of which vest based on continued employment on the first anniversary of the grant date.
See "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018" for additional information including the grant date fair value of shares awarded.
Retirement Plans and Other Benefits
Capital Accumulation Plan
Our NEOs, and all of our other employees, are eligible to participate in the Gray Television, Inc., Capital Accumulation 401(k) Plan (the "Capital Accumulation Plan"). Under the Capital Accumulation Plan employees are eligible to defer a part of their current income under the provisions of Section 401(k) of the IRC. Participants may elect to make pre-tax deferrals from their compensation each year, subject to annual limits on such deferrals imposed by the IRC. We may also, at our discretion, on an annual basis, make a matching contribution with respect to a participant's elective deferrals and/or may make additional voluntary contributions based on annual Company performance. Discretionary profit sharing contributions, if made, are made to all qualified employees employed on the last day of the plan year, and the amount a qualified employee receives is based on their pay and years of service. In 2018, we intended to make matching contributions sufficient for the Capital Accumulation Plan to meet the safe harbor requirements under Code Section 401(k)(12)(b) and therefore matched employee contributions at a rate of 100% of the first 3% of each employee's salary deferral, and 50% of the next 2% of each employee's salary deferral. In addition, in 2018, we made profit sharing contributions of $4.3 million in the aggregate. Participants are immediately vested in their voluntary contributions plus any earnings thereon. For 2018, employer contributions (plus earnings thereon) were also immediately vested as required under the safe harbor requirements under Code Section 401(k)(12)(b). The Company's profit sharing contributions made for 2018 become 100% vested after a participant completes three years of service. The vested portion of a participant's accrued benefit is payable in a lump sum upon such employee's termination of employment, attainment of age 59 1⁄2, retirement, total and permanent disability, or death. Participants may also make in-service withdrawals from the Capital Accumulation Plan and in certain specified instances of hardship.
Pension Plan
Our NEOs are also eligible to participate in the Gray Television, Inc. Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"). This Retirement Plan benefit, however, was frozen effective July 1, 2015, and no further benefits accrue thereunder.
Under this plan, a participating employee who retires on or after attaining age 65 and who has completed five years of service upon retirement may be eligible to receive during his or her lifetime, in the form of monthly payments, an annual pension equal to (i) 22% of the employee's average earnings for the highest five consecutive years during the employee's final ten years of employment multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the employee's years of service credited under the plan before 1994 and the denominator of which is the greater of 25 or the years of service credited under the plan, plus (ii) 0.9% of the employee's monthly average earnings for the highest five consecutive years in the employee's final ten years of employment added to 0.6% of monthly average earnings in excess of Social Security covered compensation, multiplied by the employee's years of service credited under the plan after 1993, with a maximum of 25 years minus years of service credited under (i) above. For participants as of December 31, 1993, there is a minimum benefit equal to the projected benefit under (i) at that time. The table in the section entitled Pension Benefits herein lists the years of credited service and the present value of each NEO's accumulated pension benefit, assuming payment begins at age 65, under the Retirement Plan.
Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, the accrued benefit is subject to the following distribution terms:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● In the event of death before retirement, 50% of the accrued benefit will become payable to the surviving spouse at the time the deceased participant would have reached age 65;  
   o   if the deceased participant would have been eligible for early retirement at the time of death, the survivor benefit may commence as soon as practicable; and o   any benefits that commence before the deceased participant would have reached age 65 will be reduced the same as early retirement benefits would have been reduced.  
● In the event a disability occurs before retirement, the accrued benefit will become payable at age 65; no break in service will occur and benefits will continue to accrue during disability.  
● In the event of voluntary termination, the vested accrued benefit will become payable at age 65;  
   o   if the participant had completed less than five years of service, the accrued benefit is not vested, and no future benefits would be payable from the Retirement Plan.  
[END TABLE]
Under the terms of the separate pension plan which was merged into the Retirement Plan, as it concerns Mr. Ryan's accrued benefit, similar spousal distribution protections are in place and will be separately applicable. In addition, because such plan had a lump sum payment option, special rules address how this lump sum option works with the annuity forms of payments also available to participants.
Perquisites
Gray also provides its executive officers with limited perquisites and other benefits, including the right to participate in all employee benefit plans generally available to employees, such as medical, dental, life and disability insurance plans. The Compensation Committee also believes it is appropriate for the Company to pay certain insurance premiums on behalf of our NEOs in order to remain market competitive for executive talent.
Change-in-Control Plan
Gray has adopted a Change in Control Plan under which participants are generally selected by the Compensation Committee and currently include our NEOs, and certain other key employees. Under the Change in Control Plan, a participant who, in connection with a change in control of the Company or within 24 months following a change in control, is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily terminates his or her employment for good reason, would receive certain benefits as outlined below in "–Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control– Change in Control Plan."
Other Governance Items
Stock Ownership Guidelines
Based on the view of the Compensation Committee that the ownership of an equity interest in the Company by executives is a component of good corporate governance and aligns executives and shareholder interests, the Compensation Committee adopted stock ownership guidelines that require the NEOs to directly own minimum amounts of the Company's stock. Shares that count towards the satisfaction of the guidelines are those 1) owned directly by the participant, 2) held in a brokerage account or 401(k) account, 3) held in trust or by a wholly-owned family entity and 4) restricted shares. Stock options, performance shares not yet paid out and shares held in a margin account or pledged as collateral for a loan, are excluded from the stock ownership guidelines.
The guidelines require the participants to beneficially own a number of shares of Class A and/or common stock that, when multiplied by relevant stock price on the measurement date, produces an amount equal to or greater than the multiple of salaries noted below:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Individual or Group   Multiple of Base Salary  
 Chief Executive Officer   6X  
 Other NEOs   3X  
[END TABLE]
Executives have five years to comply with these guidelines, with progress to be reviewed by the Compensation Committee annually. The holdings of each NEO currently satisfy the individual's stock ownership guidelines.
Anti-hedging Policy
Gray has adopted a policy that prohibits certain officers and directors of the Company from purchasing any financial instrument that is designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market share of the Company's common stock, including prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds or any other type of financial transaction. Directors, executive officers and other designated employees are also restricted from engaging in short sales related to the Company's common stock.
Clawback Policy
Gray has adopted a policy to ensure that incentive compensation is paid based on accurate financial data. This policy applies to key executive management in the event of any material restatement of the financial statements of the Company or its subsidiaries. In the event of such restatement, the Board (or an appropriate committee of the Board) shall review the facts and circumstances that led to the requirement for the restatement and will determine whether a clawback of certain compensation is appropriate.
Risk Considerations
The Compensation Committee with the assistance of its independent compensation consultant periodically reviews the Company's compensation philosophy, policies and practices to ensure that such philosophy, policies and practices are appropriately structured for the Company and its business objectives and discourages executives from taking excessive risk. In developing Gray's philosophy, and implementing the policies and practices, the Compensation Committee with input from the independent compensation consultant has attempted to mitigate the possibility that excessive short-term risks are being taken at the expense of long-term value. These mitigation strategies include:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the annual review and approval of certain financial performance objectives;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● the use of multiple performance objectives, thus mitigating too heavy a focus on any one in particular;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● caps on annual incentive plan payouts, limiting the upside potential when maximum performance is achieved; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● multi-year vesting of equity-based awards to motivate NEOs to focus on providing consistent results over the longer term.  
[END TABLE]
Starting in 2018, additional risk mitigation policies were added, including the implementation of stock ownership guidelines, an anti-hedging policy and a clawback policy.
Based on its review, and in consultation with and input from the independent compensation consultant, the Compensation Committee concluded that the compensation policies and programs at Gray do not create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.
Compensation Deduction Limitations
Section 162(m) of the IRC generally sets a limit of $1.0 million on the amount of compensation for certain executive officers that we are eligible to deduct for federal income tax purposes in any given year. In general, all compensation (other than certain grandfathered compensation) we pay in excess of $1.0 million to anyone who serves as one of our named executive officers is not deductible. We may from time to time design compensation plans that recognize a full range of performance and other criteria important to our success regardless of the federal tax deductibility of compensation paid under those plans. The Compensation Committee will continue to retain the discretion to pay non-deductible amounts. The Compensation Committee believes that such flexibility best serves the interests of the Company and its shareholders by allowing the Committee to recognize, motivate and retain executive officers as circumstances warrant.

See note 7 to the Company's consolidated financial statements in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 for a description of the assumptions made in the valuation of stock awards under FASB ASC Topic 718. For the year ended December 31, 2018, includes the grant-date fair value of the special one-time equity awards for Messrs. Ryan, Latek, Smith and Waller, which were granted in February 2018 as described above, and are detailed further in "Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2018" below. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, includes the grant date fair value of the additional bonus equity awards for 2016 and 2015 performance, respectively, which awards were granted in January 2017 and 2016, respectively.

[BEGIN TABLE]
   (3)   The change in pension value was calculated as the difference between the present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2018 and the present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2017, adjusted for benefit payments made during the year. The present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2018 was calculated using the assumptions that were used for the December 31, 2018 disclosures, which were the RP-2014 total mortality projected using fully generational improvements based on MP 2018 from 2006 and a 4.16% discount rate. The present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2017 was calculated using the assumptions that were used for the December 31, 2017 disclosures, which were the RP-2014 total mortality projected using fully generational improvements based on MP 2017 from 2006 and a 3.55% discount rate. The present value of accumulated benefits at December 31, 2016 was calculated using the assumptions that were used for the December 31, 2016 disclosures, which were the RP-2014 sex distinct mortality with generational improvements beginning in 2006 based on the Social Security Administration's assumptions included in the 2016 Trustees' Report with a 4.11% discount rate. For 2018, the decrease in the value of the pension benefits from the prior measurement period is primarily due to the increase in the discount rates (from 3.55% to 4.11%). The pension value for each of Messrs. Howell, Ryan, Latek, Smith and Waller in 2018 declined by $29,480, $44,397, $11,450, $29,819 and $11,768, respectively.

Pension Benefits
Messrs. Howell, Ryan, Latek, Smith and Waller participate in the Retirement Plan. The Retirement Plan, which is intended to be tax qualified, is available to certain of our employees and the employees of all of our subsidiaries that have been designated as participating companies under the plan. As described above, the Company froze the Retirement Plan effective July 1, 2015.
A participating employee who retires on or after attaining age 65 and who has completed five years of service upon retirement may be eligible to receive during his or her lifetime, in the form of monthly payments, an annual pension equal to (i) 22% of the employee's average earnings for the highest five consecutive years during the employee's final ten years of employment multiplied by a factor, the numerator of which is the employee's years of service credited under the plan before 1994 and the denominator of which is the greater of 25 or the years of service credited under the plan, plus (ii) 0.9% of the employee's monthly average earnings for the highest five consecutive years in the employee's final ten years of employment added to 0.6% of monthly average earnings in excess of Social Security covered compensation, multiplied by the employee's years of service credited under the plan after 1993, with a maximum of 25 years minus years of service credited under (i) above. For participants as of December 31, 1993, there is a minimum benefit equal to the projected benefit under (i) at that time.
In addition, under the Retirement Plan, Mr. Ryan is eligible to receive retirement benefits that would have been paid by Gray under a pension plan with Mr. Ryan's former employer, which plan was merged into the Retirement Plan. Benefit amounts thereunder have been frozen since September 1997.
Our NEOs did not receive any pension benefit payments in 2018. The following table shows the years of credited service and the present value of accumulated benefits as of December 31, 2018 for the NEOs:

[END TABLE]
The Present Value of Accumulated Benefits at December 31, 2018 was calculated using the assumptions that were used for the December 31, 2018 disclosures, which were the RP-2014 total mortality table projected using fully generational improvements based on MP 2018 from 2006 and a 4.16% discount rate.
The Present Value of Accumulated Benefits at December 31, 2017 was calculated using the assumptions that were used for the December 31, 2017 disclosures, which were the RP-2014 total mortality table projected using fully generational improvements based on MP 2017 from 2006 and a 3.55% discount rate.
[BEGIN TABLE]
   (3)   Effective 12/31/2016 the Busse Pension Plan was merged into the Gray Television, Inc. Retirement Plan. James C. Ryan has benefits in both these plans. For Mr. Ryan, the present value of accumulated benefits for the Gray Television, Inc. Retirement Plan and the former Busse Pension Plan are $526,836 and $126,896, respectively.

Potential Payments upon Termination or Change in Control
The information below describes and quantifies certain compensation that would become payable under existing plans, policies and arrangements if the employment of each NEO had terminated (by virtue of involuntary termination, death, disability, voluntary termination or change of control) on December 31, 2018, given the NEO's compensation and service levels as of such date and, if applicable, based on our closing stock price on December 29, 2018. These benefits include benefits available generally to salaried employees, such as distributions under the Retirement Plan, Capital Accumulation Plan, disability benefits, life insurance and accrued vacation pay.
[BEGIN TABLE]
● For the purposes of this discussion, "disability" generally means total disability, resulting in the individual being unable to perform his job and "change of control" means any of the following, subject to certain exceptions:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● any person becoming the beneficial owner of 50% or more of the combined voting power of our then outstanding shares;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constitute the Board cease for any reason to constitute at least a majority thereof, unless the election of such new directors was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the directors then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the period;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● there is consummated any consolidation or acquisition in which we are not the continuing or surviving corporation or pursuant to which shares of our common stock are converted into cash, securities or other property;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● there is consummated any consolidation or acquisition of us, in which we are the continuing corporation, and the holders of our common stock immediately prior to the acquisition do not own 51% or more of the stock of the surviving corporation immediately after the acquisition or there is consummated a sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of substantially all our assets;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● there is consummated any sale, lease, exchange or other transfer of substantially all our assets; or  
[END TABLE]

● our shareholders approve any plan or proposal for our liquidation or dissolution.  
[END TABLE]
Change in Control Plan
The Company maintains the Gray Television, Inc. Executive and Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan (the "Change in Control Plan"). Participants in the Change in Control Plan are generally selected by the Compensation Committee and currently include our NEOs and certain other key employees.
Under the Change in Control Plan, a participant who, in connection with a change in control of the Company or within 24 months following a change in control, is involuntarily terminated without cause or voluntarily terminates his or her employment for good reason (a "qualifying termination"), would receive:
[BEGIN TABLE]
● any unpaid base salary and payment for unused vacation under the Company's vacation policy through the date of termination;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a payment equal to the participant's target annual cash incentive opportunity for the year in which the termination occurred, pro-rated through the date of termination of such year; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
● a lump sum cash severance payment equal to a multiple (the "severance multiplier") of the sum of the participant's annual base salary on the termination date (or any higher annual base salary that was in effect during the 9-month period immediately prior to the change in control) and the participant's target annual cash incentive opportunity in effect immediately prior to the change in control. The severance multiplier is 3.0 for Mr. Howell and 2.0 for Messrs. Ryan, Latek, Smith and Waller.  
[END TABLE]
In addition to the foregoing, equity awards of a participant will immediately vest and become exercisable upon a qualifying termination, with performance-based equity award generally vesting at the target level, if applicable. If the participant elects to continue group health care coverage under COBRA, the participant will also be reimbursed for the portion of the premiums that the Company would have paid if the participant had continued to be an employee of the Company for a period of years equal to the participant's severance multiplier, or earlier in certain circumstances.
Any payment under the Change in Control Plan will be in lieu of any other severance or termination payment that may be due or become payable to a participant. In addition, the Change in Control Plan provides that in the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in the Change in Control Plan would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, the benefits under the Change in Control Plan will be either delivered in full, or delivered to a lesser extent which would result in no portion of the benefits being subject to such excise tax, whichever is more beneficial to the participant. The Change in Control Plan does not provide excise tax gross-ups on payments to participants. Payments under the Change in Control Plan are contingent upon a participant's execution of a release of claims in favor of the Company and compliance by the terminated participant with the non-solicitation, non-competition and confidentiality covenants in the Change in Control Plan.
Treatment of Equity Under 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan
The 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan provides that if an NEO's termination of employment occurs as a result of death or disability, incentive stock options issued under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan will be exercisable for 12 months after such termination. If the NEO dies within 12 months of termination by reason of disability, then the period of exercise following death will be the remainder of the 12-month period or three months, whichever is longer. If the NEO dies within 3 months after termination for any other reason, the period of exercise is three months. In no event, however, shall the incentive stock option be exercised more than ten years after its grant.
The 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan provides that if an NEO's termination of employment occurs as a result of death, retirement or disability, nonqualified stock options issued under the 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan will terminate 12 months after such termination; provided, however, if the NEO dies within 12 months after termination of employment by retirement or disability, the period of exercise shall be three months after date of death. As with the incentive stock options discussed above, in no event shall the nonqualified option be exercised more than 10 years after its grant.
Due to the number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any benefits provided upon the events discussed, actual amounts paid or distributed may be different than as disclosed. Factors that could affect these amounts include the timing during the year of any such event or our stock price.
The following table sets forth the amounts that would be owed by Gray to our NEOs if they were terminated as a result of involuntary termination, death, disability, voluntary termination, or there was a change of control (followed by an involuntary termination), on December 31, 2018:

CEO Pay Ratio
For the 2018 fiscal year, the ratio of the annual total compensation of Mr. Howell, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO Compensation"), to the median of the annual total compensation of all of our employees other than our Chief Executive Officer ("Median Annual Compensation") was 168 to 1. This ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K using the data and assumptions summarized below. In this summary, we refer to the employee who received such Median Annual Compensation as the "Median Employee." For purposes of this disclosure, the date used to identify the Median Employee was December 31, 2018 (the "Determination Date").
CEO Compensation for purposes of this disclosure represents the total compensation reported for Mr. Howell in the Summary Compensation Table for the 2018 fiscal year. For purposes of this disclosure, Median Annual Compensation was $33,658, and was calculated by totaling for our Median Employee all applicable elements of compensation for the 2018 fiscal year in accordance with Item 402(c)(2)(x) of Regulation S-K.
To identify the Median Employee, we first determined our employee population as of the Determination Date. We had 4,812 employees, representing all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary employees of us and our consolidated subsidiaries as of the Determination Date. This number does not include any independent contractors or "leased" workers, as permitted by the applicable SEC rules. We then measured compensation for the period beginning on January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2018 for these employees. This compensation measurement was calculated by totaling, for each employee, gross taxable earnings, including salary, wages, tips and other compensation as shown in our payroll and human resources records for 2018. A portion of our employee workforce (full-time and part-time) worked for less than the full fiscal year due to commencing employment after the beginning of the fiscal year. In determining the Median Employee, we annualized the compensation for such individuals.
Director Compensation for 2018
The objective of our compensation and benefit program for directors is to appropriately compensate directors for the time and effort required to be an effective director of a company of our size and scope; to align directors' interests with the long-term interests of shareholders; and to be simple, transparent and easy for shareholders to understand. Our directors' compensation for 2018 included the following cash compensation elements:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Description     Amount   			($)    
 Chairman of the Board's annual retainer fee      65,000   
 Lead Independent Director's annual retainer fee      70,000   
 Director annual retainer fee      55,000   
 Chairman of the Board fee per board meeting      4,000   
 Director fee per Board meeting      3,000   
 Committee Chairman fee per committee meeting      4,000   
 Committee member fee per committee meeting      3,500   
[END TABLE]
Directors are generally paid the above fee arrangement for participation in person or by telephone in any meeting of the Board or any committee thereof. In addition, the members of our Board are reimbursed for reasonable travel expenses incurred by them during the execution of their duties as members of our Board and any committees.
In addition, as a component of our compensation program for directors for 2018, each director also received an annual award of $110,000 in shares of restricted common stock, which would vest the following year. The awards are made pursuant to our shareholder-approved equity incentive plan.
The Company has also adopted stock ownership guidelines to align director and shareholder interests, which require directors to directly own minimum amounts of the Company's stock. The guidelines require the directors to beneficially own a number of shares of Gray Television stock that, when multiplied by stock price on the measurement date, produces an amount equal to or greater than three times the annual retainer fee noted above. Directors have five years to comply with these guidelines and the holdings of each director are currently either at the guideline or on track to meet it.
The following table presents the compensation paid to our non-employee directors in 2018. Mr. Howell, who is currently our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, was our only employee director in 2018. For information on the compensation paid to Mr. Howell for his service in all positions with the Company, including as a director, see the Summary Compensation Table.

Director Compensation Beginning in 2019
In March 2019, our Board adopted a revised compensation and benefit program applicable to all of our directors that is retroactively effective as of January 1, 2019. The revised program was adopted after consultation with Meridian and a review of the compensation practices of companies within our peer group. The revised program, which increases the retainer amounts and eliminates per meeting fees, provides that each director will receive the following compensation for service on our Board:
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Description     Amount   			($)    
 Annual Retainers:          
 Lead Independent Director's annual retainer fee      92,500

[END TABLE]
In addition to the retainers paid to our directors, our directors will receive annual grants of restricted stock under our equity incentive plans valued at approximately $130,000. We typically make these annual stock awards at the commencement of each annual term as a director following the annual meeting of shareholders.
The revised compensation and benefit program is intended to improve the Company's alignment with director pay practices at peer institutions while ensuring that our directors are fairly compensated for their significant contributions of knowledge, experience and time to the Board and its committees.

The following Report of the Compensation Committee does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by Gray under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Exchange Act, except to the extent Gray specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein.
The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis contained in this proxy statement with management and, based on such review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included herein and in Gray's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION
Messrs. Boger (Chairman), Garcia, Newton and Norton are the members of the Compensation Committee. Mr. Norton will no longer serve on the Compensation Committee effective upon his retirement as a director at the 2019 Annual Meeting. No member of the Compensation Committee was an employee or officer of Gray or any of its subsidiaries during 2018 or was formerly an officer of Gray or any of its subsidiaries. No compensation committee interlocks existed during 2018.
CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
On January 1, 2015, the Company began leasing space for its principal offices from Delta Life Insurance Co. ("Delta Life"). Delta Life is controlled by Harriett J. Robinson, a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company, the mother-in-law of Mr. Howell and mother of Mrs. Howell. In addition, Mr. and Mrs. Howell are officers, directors and/or shareholders in Delta Life. Under the terms of the lease, the Company pays annual rent of approximately $0.2 million, plus a pro rata share of all real estate taxes, general maintenance and service expenses and insurance costs with respect to the office building and related facilities. The lease does not have a set termination date, but is terminable with 12 month's advance notice by either party. The terms of the lease are believed by management of the Company to be no less favorable than terms that could be obtained by the Company from unrelated parties for comparable rental property.
During 2018, the Company paid Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company ("Bankers") approximately $0.8 million in premiums related to an accident insurance plan available to all Company employees. Bankers is a subsidiary of Atlantic American Corporation, which is a greater than 5% shareholder of the Company. Mrs. Robinson is the majority shareholder of Atlantic American and Mr. Howell is the chairman, president and chief executive officer of Atlantic American.
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the directors, executive officers and persons who own more than 10.0% of a registered class of a company's equity securities to file with the SEC initial reports of ownership (Form 3) and reports of changes in ownership (Forms 4 and 5) of such class of equity securities. Such officers, directors and greater than 10.0% shareholders of a company are required by SEC regulations to furnish the company with copies of all such Section 16(a) reports that they file.
To our knowledge, based solely on our review of the copies of such reports filed with the SEC during the year ended December 31, 2018 all Section 16(a) filing requirements applicable to our officers, directors and 10.0% beneficial owners were met.
REPORT OF AUDIT COMMITTEE
The following Report of the Audit Committee, together with references in this proxy statement to the independence of the Audit Committee members and the Audit Committee charter, does not constitute soliciting material and should not be deemed filed or incorporated by reference into any other filing by Gray under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Exchange Act, except to the extent Gray specifically incorporates this Report by reference therein.
Management has primary responsibility for Gray's financial statements and the overall reporting process, including Gray's system of internal controls. RSM US LLP, the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, audits the annual consolidated financial statements prepared by management and expresses an opinion on whether those statements fairly present, in all material respects, the Company's financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 and discussed them with both management and RSM US LLP.
Management is responsible for establishing, assessing and reporting on Gray's system of internal control over financial reporting. RSM US LLP is responsible for performing an independent audit of Gray's internal control over financial reporting and for issuing a report thereon. The Audit Committee is responsible for the monitoring and oversight of this process. In connection with these responsibilities, the Audit Committee met with management and RSM US LLP to review and discuss the effectiveness of Gray's internal controls over financial reporting.
The Audit Committee has also discussed with RSM US LLP the matters required to be discussed by generally accepted auditing standards, including those described in Auditing Standard No. 16, Communication with Audit Committees, as amended, issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.
The Audit Committee has received and reviewed the written disclosures and the letter from RSM US LLP consistent with the applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence and has discussed and confirmed with RSM US LLP its independence with respect to Gray. In addition, the Audit Committee has considered whether the provision of the non-audit services provided by RSM US LLP is compatible with maintaining that independence.
Based upon this review, the Audit Committee recommended to the full Board that the Company's audited consolidated financial statements be included in Gray's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 and filed with the SEC.
Submitted by the Audit Committee of the Board.
