Dear Shareholder: 
The Adient plc 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will convene on Monday, March 11, 2019, at 1:00 p.m., local time, at Radisson Blu Hotel, Dublin Airport, Dublin, Ireland. Shareholders who did not receive the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will receive a copy of the Proxy Statement and Annual Report for fiscal year 2018 by mail. Please refer to the accompanying Proxy Statement, which details the business we will conduct at the Annual General Meeting. 
We are pleased to take advantage of Securities and Exchange Commission rules that allow companies to furnish their proxy materials over the Internet. We believe this process will expedite the receipt of proxy materials by our shareholders and will lower the costs and reduce the environmental impact of our Annual General Meeting. Accordingly, on or about January 25, 2019, we will mail to our shareholders either a Proxy Statement or a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the accompanying Proxy Statement, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our Irish Statutory Accounts for fiscal year 2018 via the Internet, as well as how to vote online. The Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials and the Proxy Statement will also contain instructions about how you can request a paper copy of the proxy materials. Shareholders should not regard the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains our audited financial statements, or our Irish Statutory Accounts as proxy solicitation materials. Even if you have elected not to receive printed proxy materials, you may access them electronically at https://materials.proxyvote.com/G0084W. 
For information on how to attend the Annual General Meeting, please read the section entitled "Annual General Meeting Attendance" in the accompanying Proxy Statement. 
To ensure that you have a say in the governance of Adient, the compensation of its executive officers and the other matters presented for vote at the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders, it is important that you vote your shares. Please review the proxy materials and follow the instructions on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or the proxy card to vote your shares. We hope you will exercise your rights as a shareholder and participate in the future of Adient. 
Thank you for your continued support of Adient. 
Sincerely, 
ADIENT PLC

PROXY STATEMENT 
The Board of Directors (the "Board") of Adient plc, an Irish public limited company ("Adient"), is soliciting proxies for our 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders ("Annual General Meeting"). You are receiving, or have been given access to, this Proxy Statement because you own Adient ordinary shares that entitle you to vote at the Annual General Meeting. By use of a proxy you can vote, whether or not you attend the Annual General Meeting. The Proxy Statement describes the matters we would like you to vote on and provides information on those matters so you can make an informed decision. 
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") rules permit us to provide access to our proxy materials over the Internet instead of mailing printed copies of the proxy materials to each shareholder. As a result, on or about January 25, 2019, we will mail to our shareholders of record and beneficial owners as of the close of business on the Record Date (as defined below), either a Proxy Statement or a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials containing instructions on how to access the Proxy Statement and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 via the Internet, as well as how to vote online. Shareholders receiving a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials unless requested by following the instructions included on the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials or as provided in "Questions and Answers" below. 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING PURPOSE 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the purpose of the Annual General Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders will act upon or consider the matters outlined in the Notice of the  2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. These include (i) the election of directors, (ii) the ratification of the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Adient's independent auditor for fiscal year 2019, (iii) the approval,  on an advisory basis, of named executive officer compensation, as described in this Proxy Statement, and (iv) the receipt and consideration of Adient's Irish Statutory Accounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 and the  reports of the directors and auditors thereon and to review the affairs of Adient.  
[END TABLE]
VOTING AND PROXY MATERIALS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who can vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you held ordinary shares of Adient as of the close of business on January 11, 2019 (the "Record  Date"), then you are entitled to one vote per share on each proposal at the Annual General Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the quorum requirement of the Annual General Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A majority of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding as of the close of business on the Record Date  constitutes a quorum for voting at the Annual General Meeting. On the Record Date, 93,532,349 ordinary shares were issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting. If you vote (or if a plan trustee votes your shares for  you) or attend the Annual General Meeting in person (even if you do not vote), then your shares will be part of the quorum. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present for purposes of  determining whether there is a quorum in respect of the proposals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are the voting recommendations of the Board and what are the voting standards?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Voting Item   The Board's Voting Recommendations    Voting Standard to Approve Proposal (assuming a quorum is present)   Treatment of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
Voting Item   The Board's Voting Recommendations    Voting Standard to Approve Proposal (assuming a quorum is present)   Treatment of Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes 
[END TABLE]
* Because this shareholder vote is advisory, it will not be binding on the Board or Adient. However, the Compensation Committee will review the voting results and take them into consideration when making future decisions regarding executive compensation. 
There is no requirement under Irish law that Adient's Irish Statutory Accounts for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 or the related directors' and auditors' reports thereon be approved by the shareholders, and no such approval will be sought at the Annual General Meeting. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  There are four ways to vote:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by Internet at http://www.proxyvote.com;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by toll-free telephone at 1-800-690-6903;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by completing and mailing your proxy card if you received a copy by mail; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• by written ballot at the Annual General Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
We encourage you to vote by Internet because it is the most cost-effective voting method. If you vote by Internet or by telephone, your electronic vote authorizes the named proxies in the same manner as if you signed, dated and returned a proxy card by mail. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  When are brokers permitted to vote your shares?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Under New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") rules, if you do not provide voting instructions to  your broker, then your broker is only permitted to vote on your behalf on "routine" matters, such as Proposal Two, the ratification of our independent auditor and approval of the auditors' remuneration. Under these NYSE rules, without  your voting instructions your broker is not permitted to vote your shares on "non-routine" matters, such as director elections, executive compensation matters (including the advisory vote to approve  named executive officer compensation) and corporate governance proposals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What is the effect of not voting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  It depends on how your share ownership is registered. If you:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Own shares in "street name" through a broker, bank or other nominee and you do not vote: For all  proposals that shareholders will consider at the Annual General Meeting, other than Proposal Two, if you own shares in street name and do not direct your broker how to vote your shares on the proposals, the result is a broker non-vote. We believe that Proposal Two — ratification of our independent auditor and authorization of the Board, acting through the Audit Committee, to set the auditors' remuneration — is a  routine matter on which brokers can vote on behalf of their clients if clients do not furnish voting instructions. However, we believe the remaining proposals are non-routine matters and your broker cannot  vote your shares for which you have not provided voting instructions. Broker non-votes will not impact Proposals One and Three.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Own shares that are directly registered in your name and you do not vote: In this case, your unvoted  shares will not be represented at the Annual General Meeting and will not count toward the quorum requirement. Your unvoted shares will not impact any of the proposals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Own shares through one of our retirement or employee savings and investment plans (such as a 401(k) plan) for  which you do not direct the trustee to vote your shares: In this case, the trustee will vote the shares credited to your account on all of the proposals in the same proportion as the voting of shares for which the trustee receives direction from  other participants. The trustee will vote the shares in this manner if the trustee does not receive your voting directions by March 6, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Sign and return a proxy card for your shares, but you do not indicate a voting direction: In this case,  the shares you hold will be voted "for" each of the director nominees listed in Proposal One, "for" Proposals Two and Three and at the discretion of the persons named as proxies upon such other matters that may properly come  before the Annual General Meeting or any adjournments thereof.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Can I change my vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Yes. You can change your vote or revoke your proxy any time before the Annual General Meeting by:   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• entering a new vote by Internet or phone;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• returning a later-dated proxy card;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• giving written notice of revocation to the at Adient plc, Attn: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary,  49200 Halyard Drive, Plymouth, Michigan 48170; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• completing a written ballot at the Annual General Meeting.  
[END TABLE]
Street name holders who wish to change their proxy prior to the voting thereof should contact the broker, bank or other holder of record to determine whether, and if so how, such proxy can be revoked. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Who will count the votes?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We have retained Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. ("Broadridge") to tabulate the votes and  act as Inspector of Election. Information about Broadridge is available at http://www.broadridge.com. Broadridge will use an automated system to tabulate the votes.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  Why did I receive a notice regarding the Internet availability of the proxy materials instead of a paper  copy of the proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  SEC rules allow us to make our proxy materials available to shareholders via the Internet. As a result, and as  part of our sustainability efforts, we are mailing a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials, rather than a full paper set of the proxy materials, to many of our shareholders. This Notice includes instructions on how to access our proxy  materials by the Internet, as well as instructions on  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can shareholders request paper copies of the proxy materials?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Shareholders may request that paper copies of the proxy materials, including an annual report, Proxy Statement  and proxy card, be sent to them without charge by:  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• visiting http://www.proxyvote.com;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• e-mailing sendmaterial@proxyvote.com with your personal 16-digit control number in the subject line; or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• calling  1-800-579-1639.  
[END TABLE]
When making a request, please have your personal 16-digit control number available; that control number was included in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. To ensure timely delivery of the proxy materials before the Annual General Meeting, any request should be made no later than February 25, 2019. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I access the proxy materials over the Internet?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  In addition to being posted at https://materials.proxyvote.com/G0084W, you can access the Proxy  Statement and the Annual Report to Shareholders in the "Investors Relations" section of our website at http://investors.adient.com/financial-information/sec-filings. We do not use software  that identifies visitors accessing our proxy materials on our website.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I elect to receive proxy materials for future Annual General Meetings electronically?   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you wish to contribute to our sustainability efforts by electing to receive proxy materials for future  Annual General Meetings electronically, please visit http://www.proxyvote.com and follow the enrollment instructions. You will need the 16-digit control number printed in the box marked by the arrow  located on the proxy card or as provided in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials. Your election to access proxy materials electronically will remain in effect until you revoke it.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What does it mean if I get more than one request to vote?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  It means your shares are held in more than one account, such as two brokerage accounts, or you hold both  registered and "street name" shares. You should vote the shares on all of your proxy cards or voting instructions provided to you in the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials using one of the four ways to vote. We encourage  you to have all of your shares registered in the same name and address. Registered shareholders may do this by contacting our transfer agent, Equiniti Trust Company, toll-free at 1-866-927-3880, while shareholders who own their shares in "street name" (through a broker, bank or nominee) should contact their broker.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  If more than one shareholder lives in my household and I receive a paper copy of this Proxy Statement, how  can I obtain an extra copy of the Proxy Statement?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  If you own your shares in "street name" (through a broker, bank or nominee), your broker, bank or  nominee may deliver a single set of proxy materials to any household at which two or more shareholders reside unless we have received prior instructions to the contrary. This procedure, referred to as householding, reduces the volume of duplicate  materials shareholders receive and reduces mailing expenses. Upon written or oral request, shareholders may revoke their consent to future householding mailings, or enroll in householding, by contacting their broker, bank or nominee. Alternatively,  you may

[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• if a broker or other nominee holds your shares, bring proof of your ownership of our ordinary shares through such  broker or nominee and a form of identification.  
[END TABLE]
PROXY SOLICITATION COST 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How much did this proxy solicitation cost?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  We will primarily solicit proxies by mail, and we will cover the expense of such solicitation. Georgeson LLC  will help us solicit proxies from all brokers and nominees at a cost to us of $12,000 plus expenses. Our officers and employees may also solicit proxies for no additional compensation. We may reimburse brokers or other nominees for reasonable  expenses that they incur in sending these proxy materials to you if a broker or other nominee holds your shares.  
[END TABLE]
2019 SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How do I recommend or nominate someone to be considered as a director for the 2020 Annual General Meeting of  Shareholders?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  You may recommend any person as a candidate for director for the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  (the "2020 Annual General Meeting") by writing to the Office of the Secretary at Adient plc, 49200 Halyard Drive, Plymouth, Michigan 48170. The Corporate Governance Committee reviews all submissions of recommendations from  shareholders. The Corporate Governance Committee will determine whether the candidate is qualified to serve on our Board by evaluating the candidate using the criteria contained under the "Director Criteria and Qualifications" section of  our Corporate Governance Guidelines, which is discussed in the "Corporate Governance — Director Nominee Selection and Evaluation" section of this Proxy Statement. If the Corporate Governance Committee believes that a  recommended candidate is qualified to serve on our Board, then the Corporate Governance Committee may either recommend the candidate to the Board for nomination by the Board for election by the shareholders at the 2020 Annual General Meeting or  recommend the candidate to the Board for appointment to fill a vacancy on the Board.  
[END TABLE]
A shareholder who intends to nominate any person for director must comply with the requirements set forth in our Articles of Association and applicable law. Among other things, a shareholder must give us timely written notice of the intent to nominate. To be considered timely for the 2020 Annual General Meeting, the notice must be received between November 12, 2019 and December 12, 2019. The notice must include all of the information required by our Articles of Association and applicable law including, but not limited to, a shareholder's intention to nominate a person as a director and the candidate's name, biographical data, and qualifications, as well as the written consent of the person to be named in our Proxy Statement as a director nominee and to serve as a director. Under our Articles of Association, the nominee must also timely deliver to our Secretary a written questionnaire with respect to the   background and qualification of such individual and a written representation and agreement (in the form provided by the Secretary), as well as submit to a formal background check. Our Articles of Association also provide proxy access rights that permit eligible shareholders to nominate candidates for election to the Board in our Proxy Statement. Eligible shareholders who wish to nominate a proxy access candidate must follow the procedures described in our Articles of Association. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  How can I submit a Rule 14a-8 shareholder proposal to be included in  Adient's proxy materials for the 2020 Annual General Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  Pursuant to Rule 14a-8 ("Rule  14a-8") of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we must receive shareholder proposals that are intended to be included in our proxy materials for the  2020 Annual General Meeting by September 27, 2019 to consider them for inclusion in our proxy materials for the 2020 Annual General Meeting. A shareholder submitting a proposal under Rule 14a-8 should  send it to us addressed to Adient plc, Attn: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 49200 Halyard Drive, Plymouth, Michigan 48170. A Rule 14a-8 proposal must meet the applicable SEC rules and  regulations governing such proposals.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
Q:  What are the requirements for proposing business other than by a Rule  14a-8 shareholder proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting?  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
A:  A shareholder who intends to propose business at the 2020 Annual General Meeting (other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8) must comply with the requirements set forth in our Articles of Association. Adient's Secretary must receive written notice of a shareholder's intent to propose business to be brought before the 2020  Annual General Meeting (other than pursuant to Rule 14a-8) no sooner than November 12, 2019 and no later than December 12, 2019.  
[END TABLE]
If we receive the notice after December 12, 2019, then we will consider the notice untimely and we will not be obligated to present the proposal at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. If the Board chooses to present a proposal that a shareholder submits (other than under Rule 14a-8) at the 2020 Annual General Meeting, then the persons named in the proxies that the Board requests for the 2020 Annual General Meeting may exercise discretionary voting power with respect to the proposal.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
The Board has adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that provide a framework for the effective governance of Adient. These guidelines address matters such as the Board's duties and responsibilities, director independence, Board structure and operation, director criteria and qualifications, Board succession planning, Board compensation, management evaluation and succession, Board orientation and training, and the ethical conduct of Adient's directors, officers and employees. The Corporate Governance Committee regularly reviews developments in corporate governance and updates the Corporate Governance Guidelines and other governance materials as it deems necessary and appropriate. 
Board Leadership Structure 
Adient's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide the Board with the flexibility to determine whether the Chair and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") roles should be separate or combined based upon Adient's needs and the Board's assessment of Adient's leadership. The Board periodically evaluates whether the best interests of Adient's shareholders are served if roles of the Chair and CEO are separate or combined. 
In connection with the retirement of our former Chair and CEO in June 2018, the Board evaluated its leadership structure and separated the roles of Chair and CEO at that time. John M. Barth, who previously served as our independent Lead Director, served as our interim Chair from June until October 2018 when Frederick A. Henderson was appointed as our independent Chair. The Board believes that having an independent director serve as Chair is the appropriate leadership structure for Adient at this time because it allows our recently appointed CEO to focus on executing our strategic plan and managing our operations and performance, while allowing the Chair to focus on the effectiveness of the Board. The Board recognizes that no single leadership model is right for all companies at all times and, as noted above, may re-evaluate its leadership structure in the future. 
Executive Sessions 
The Board requires executive sessions of the independent directors at least twice annually. During these executive sessions, the independent Chair has the responsibility, among other things, to lead and facilitate the meeting and discussion of matters on the agenda. The Board held an executive session during each in-person Board meeting in fiscal year 2018 with Mr. Barth, the Lead Director at the time, chairing these sessions until June 2018, when the Board appointed Mr. Barth as interim Chair, as discussed above.  Board Oversight of Risk 
Adient's Board, as a whole or through its committees, oversees an enterprise-wide approach to risk management that is intended to achieve Adient's long-term strategic and organizational objectives and enhance shareholder value. Management is responsible for the day-to-day management of the risks that Adient will face, while the Board, as a whole and through its committees, will have the responsibility for the oversight of risk management. In this risk oversight role, the Board is responsible for ensuring that the risk management framework, and any supporting processes implemented by management, are adequate and functioning as designed. 
Although the Board has the ultimate oversight responsibility for the risk management process, various committees of the Board also have responsibility for risk management. The Board and its committees exercise their risk oversight function by carefully evaluating the reports they receive from management and by engaging in discussions with management regarding areas of particular interest or significance. Each of the Board committees is responsible for oversight of risk management practices for categories of top risks relevant to committee functions, which are set forth below. The Board also considers the significant risks to Adient during its reviews of corporate strategy and business plans. 
The following table summarizes the primary areas of risk oversight of the Board and its committees: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Board/Committee      Primary Areas of Risk Oversight 
   Board/Committee      Primary Areas of Risk Oversight 
 Full Board   The Board oversees matters that may present a material risk to Adient's operations, plans, prospects or reputation, including the risks and exposures associated with  significant capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestitures, management succession planning, major litigation and regulatory exposures, as well as the strategic, financial and execution risks and exposures associated with the annual operating  plan. 
 Audit Committee   The Audit Committee Charter provides that the Audit Committee will review major risk exposures  relating to financial reporting, tax, treasury, internal controls, information technology security, and legal and regulatory matters, and the steps Adient takes and will have taken to detect, monitor and actively manage such exposures. The Audit  Committee will also conduct a review with Adient's General Counsel of any material legal, compliance, and regulatory matters that could have a material impact on Adient's financial statements or Adient's business, including material  notices to or inquiries received from governmental agencies. 
 Corporate Governance Committee   The Corporate Governance Committee reviews the risks and exposures relating to Adient's corporate governance, director independence, conflicts of interest, ethics and  compliance, and director candidate and succession planning programs and policies.

[END TABLE]
Management's Role in Risk Oversight. Adient's management supports the Board and its committees in Adient's enterprise-wide approach to risk management. Adient has embedded an enterprise risk management, or ERM, program across its core business, which is aligned with initiatives that involve the Audit Committee, executive management and other personnel. The ERM framework has been designed to identify, assess, prioritize, and manage major risk exposures that could affect Adient's ability to execute on its corporate strategy and fulfill its business objectives. The ERM program has been designed to enable the Audit Committee and management to collectively review the effectiveness of Adient's risk management practices and capabilities and Adient's risk exposure and risk tolerance and to elevate key risks to the Board.  Adient's Vice President of Internal Audit is responsible for Adient's internal audit function and supports Adient's enterprise-wide risk management framework through risk assessment, monitoring, and reporting. The Vice President of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit Committee, and the Audit Committee reviews and evaluates the Vice President of Internal Audit's appointment, compensation, and performance. The Vice President of Internal Audit facilitates the Audit Committee's review and approval of the internal audit plan and provides regular reporting on audit activities. In addition, through consultation with management, the Vice President of Internal Audit periodically assesses the major risks facing Adient and coordinates with the members of management responsible for such risks. 
The executive responsible for managing a particular risk may also be required to report to the Audit Committee on how the risk is being managed and the progress towards any agreed-upon risk mitigation goals. 
Board Independence 
The Board annually determines the independence of each director and nominee for election as a director based on a review of the information provided by the directors and nominees as well as a survey by Adient's legal and finance departments. The Board makes these determinations under the NYSE Listed Company Manual's independence standards and Adient's Corporate Governance Guidelines. No director qualifies as independent unless the Board determines that the director has no direct or indirect material relationship with Adient. 
Following such evaluation, the Board affirmatively determined by resolution that the following directors are independent: John M. Barth, Julie L. Bushman, Peter H. Carlin, Raymond L. Conner, Richard Goodman, Frederick A. Henderson and Barb J. Samardzich. 
When making the Board's director independence determinations, the Board was aware of, and specifically considered, the business relationship listed below. The relationship listed below was entered into on standard pricing and terms as arose in the ordinary course of Adient's business. The amount involved in the relationship did not exceed the greater of $1 million or 2% of either company's consolidated gross revenues. As a result, it qualified under a categorical standard of independence that the Board previously approved; therefore, the relationship was not deemed to be a material relationship that impaired the director's independence.

Board Succession Plan 
The Board succession plan is generally outlined in the Corporate Governance Committee Charter and Corporate Governance Guidelines to maintain effective shareholder representation. As part of the Board's succession planning, the Board will regularly review the composition of the Board and assesses the balance of knowledge, experience, skills, expertise, tenure and diversity that is appropriate for the Board as a whole. 
Board, Committee and Director Evaluations 
Each year, the Board conducts an evaluation of itself, the Board committees, and, as discussed below, each director to determine their respective effectiveness. The Corporate Governance Committee determines annually the manner of these evaluations to ensure that the Board and its committees receive accurate and insightful information.  Attendance at Annual General Meetings 
The Board expects all directors to attend the annual general meetings of shareholders. Directors may attend the meeting by any means permitted under applicable law. All directors serving at the time attended the 2018 Annual General Meeting. 
Shareholder / Other Interested Party Communication with the Board 
Adient encourages shareholders and other interested parties to communicate with its directors. Adient's Corporate Governance Guidelines provide for general communications to the Board or any individual Board member to be sent to c/o Adient plc, Attn: Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, 49200 Halyard Drive, Plymouth, Michigan 48170. Adient's Office of the Secretary will open and screen these communications for security purposes and for relevance in the directors' capacities as directors. 
Director Nominee Selection and Evaluation 
The Corporate Governance Committee develops criteria and qualifications for directors and director candidates that the Board will review and approve annually. The Corporate Governance Committee has a process under which it identifies and evaluates all director candidates properly nominated as required by Adient's Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Corporate Governance Committee will consider nominee recommendations from a variety of sources, including nominees recommended by shareholders. The Corporate Governance Committee might, from time to time, retain an executive search firm for a fee to help facilitate the identification, screening and interview process of director nominees. The Corporate Governance Committee expects that qualified candidates will have high-level managerial experience in a relatively complex organization or be accustomed to dealing with complex problems, and will be able to represent the interests of the shareholders as a whole rather than special interest groups or constituencies. 
The Corporate Governance Committee uses the following criteria and qualifications, among others, to evaluate any director candidate's capabilities to serve as a member of the Board:

CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS 
Procedures for Approval of Related Person Transactions 
The Board has adopted a written policy for the review of related person transactions. For purposes of the policy, a related person transaction includes transactions in which (1) the amount involved is more than $120,000, (2) Adient is a participant, and (3) any related person has a direct or indirect material interest. The policy defines a "related person" to include directors, nominees for director, executive officers, and their respective immediate family members. Pursuant to the policy, all related person transactions must be approved by the Audit Committee or, in the event of an inadvertent failure to bring the transaction to the Audit Committee for pre-approval, ratified by the Audit Committee. In the event that a member of the Audit Committee has an interest in a related person transaction, the transaction must be approved or ratified by the disinterested members of the Audit Committee. In deciding whether to approve or ratify a related person transaction, the Audit Committee considers the following factors: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the terms of the transaction are (1) fair to Adient and (2) at least as favorable to Adient as  would apply if the transaction did not involve a related person;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether there are demonstrable business reasons for Adient to enter into the transaction;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would impair the independence of an outside director under Adient's director  independence standards; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• whether the transaction would present an improper conflict of interest for any director or executive officer,  taking into account the size of the transaction, the overall financial position of the related person, the direct or indirect nature of the related person's interest in the transaction and the ongoing nature of any proposed relationship, and  any other factors the committee deems relevant.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation 
There are no interlocks among the Committee members and Adient.  PROPOSAL TWO: 
RATIFICATION, BY NON-BINDING ADVISORY VOTE, OF THE APPOINTMENT OF ADIENT'S 
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR FOR FISCAL YEAR 2019 AND AUTHORIZATION, BY BINDING VOTE, 
OF THE BOARD, ACTING THROUGH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE, TO SET THE AUDITORS' 
REMUNERATION 
The Audit Committee appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for fiscal year 2019. We ask that you ratify the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as our independent auditor for fiscal year 2019 and that you authorize the Board, acting through the Audit Committee, to set the auditors' remuneration. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has audited our financial statements for fiscal year 2018. 
We expect representatives of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP to be present at the Annual General Meeting with the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and to be available to respond to appropriate questions. If shareholders do not ratify the appointment, the adverse vote will be considered as an indication to the Audit Committee that it should consider selecting another independent auditor for the following fiscal year. Even if shareholders ratify the selection, the Audit Committee, in its discretion, may select a new independent auditor at any time during the year if it believes that such a change would be in our best interest. Authorization of the Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, to set the independent auditors' remuneration requires the affirmative vote of a majority of votes cast by the holders of ordinary shares represented at the Annual General Meeting in person or by proxy. 
Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted to our shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent auditor of Adient plc is hereby ratified and that the Board of Directors, acting through the Audit Committee, is hereby authorized to set the auditors' remuneration.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT 
The Audit Committee is comprised of Mr. Goodman (Chairman), Ms. Bushman, Mr. Carlin and Ms. Samardzich, all independent, non-employee directors, and operates pursuant to a written charter adopted by the Board. The charter is available on our website at http://investors.adient.com/corporate-governance/governance-documents. 
The Board has the ultimate authority for effective corporate governance, including the role of oversight of the management of our company. The Audit Committee's purpose is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities by overseeing our accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of our consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting, the qualifications and performance of the independent registered public accounting firm engaged as our independent auditor, and the performance of our internal auditors. The Audit Committee relies on the expertise and knowledge of management, the internal auditors and the independent auditor in carrying out its oversight responsibilities. Management is responsible for the preparation, presentation, and integrity of our consolidated financial statements, accounting and financial reporting principles, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls, and procedures designed to ensure compliance with accounting standards, applicable laws, and regulations. In addition, management is responsible for objectively reviewing and evaluating the adequacy, effectiveness, and quality of our system of internal control. 
The Audit Committee selects our independent registered public accounting firm for each fiscal year. Our independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, is responsible for performing an independent audit of the consolidated financial statements and for expressing an opinion on the conformity of   those financial statements with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also responsible for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee monitors the independence of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which includes a review of the relationships between the independent registered public accounting firm and Adient. After reviewing the relationships and discussing them with management, the Audit Committee assesses PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's overall relationship with Adient, as well as their objectivity and independence. Based on its review, the Audit Committee is satisfied with the auditors' independence. 
The Audit Committee fulfills its duties and responsibilities as outlined in its charter, by specifically, among other actions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing and discussing with management and the independent auditor our consolidated financial statements and  related periodic reports filed with the SEC;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing with management, the independent auditor and the internal auditor, management's assessment of the  effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• reviewing with the independent auditor, management and the internal auditor, as appropriate, the audit scope, and  plans of both the independent auditor and internal auditor;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• meeting in executive sessions with each of the independent auditor, management, and the internal auditor; and   
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• discussing with the PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP those matters that are required to be discussed by the Public  Company Accounting Oversight Board's ("PCAOB") Auditing Standard No. 1301, Communication with Audit Committees; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• receiving the annual letter from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP provided to use pursuant to PCAOB Ethics and  Independence Rule 3526, Communication with Audit Committees Concerning Independence, confirming their independence.  
[END TABLE]
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed with our management and independent auditor our audited consolidated financial statements and related footnotes for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, and the independent auditor's report on those financial statements. Management represented to the Audit Committee that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP presented the matters required to be discussed with the Audit Committee by PCAOB Standards and SEC Regulations. This review included a discussion with management and the independent auditor about the quality (not merely the acceptability) of our accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant estimates and judgments, and the disclosures in our financial statements, including the disclosures relating to critical accounting policies. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP also has confirmed to the Committee in writing, as required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountant's communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, that, in its professional judgment, it is independent of Adient under all relevant professional and regulatory standards.  Relationship with Independent Auditors 
The following table presents fees for professional services rendered to Adient by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 30, 2017. 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Audit-Related Fees2      225         546    
 Tax Fees3      939         780    
 All Other  Fees4      629         199    
 Total      $13,506         $12,635    
[END TABLE]
1 In 2018 and 2017, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP billed Adient for professional services rendered for the audit of Adient's annual financial statements, the audits of Adient's internal control over financial reporting, statutory and subsidiary audits, the review of documents filed with the SEC, and certain accounting consultations in connection with the audits. 
2 Audit related fees include: accounting consultations in connection with new accounting standards and proposed acquisitions and divestitures. 
3 Tax fees consist principally of professional services rendered by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for tax compliance and tax planning and advice including assistance with tax audits and appeals, and tax advice related to mergers and acquisitions. 
4 All other fees primarily represent fees associated with advocacy services, training seminars related to accounting, finance and tax matters, and information technology consulting. 
The Audit Committee has adopted procedures for pre-approving all audit and non-audit services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm. These procedures include reviewing a budget for audit and permitted non-audit services. The budget includes a description of and a budgeted amount for particular categories of non-audit services that are recurring in nature and, therefore, anticipated at the time the budget is submitted. Audit Committee approval is required to exceed the budget amount for a particular category of non-audit services and to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for any non-audit services not included in the budget. For both types of pre-approval, the Audit Committee considers whether such services are consistent with the SEC's rules on registered public accounting firm independence and whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm is compatible with the firm's independence. 
The Audit Committee also considers whether the independent registered public accounting firm is best positioned to provide the most effective and efficient service, for reasons such as its familiarity with our business, people, culture, accounting systems, risk profile, and whether the services enhance Adient's ability to manage or control risks and improve audit quality. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more members of the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee periodically monitors the services rendered and actual fees paid to the independent registered public accounting firm to ensure that such services are within the parameters approved by the Audit Committee. 
Based on its review of the discussion referred to above, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER COMPENSATION 
SEC rules require us to seek your approval on an advisory basis of our named executive compensation program, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, related compensation tables and narrative discussion of this Proxy Statement. This vote is not intended to address any specific items of compensation, but rather the overall compensation of our named executive officers and the philosophy, policies, and procedures described in this Proxy Statement. This vote is advisory and not binding on Adient, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, as the vote is an expression of our shareholders' views on a significant matter, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote when making future executive compensation decisions. 
As described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section, decisions regarding executive compensation are guided by our philosophy, which is built on the following principles: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

• Reflect business conditions and compensation practices unique to the automotive industry to ensure our executive  compensation practices are appropriately competitive  
[END TABLE]
We encourage shareholders to read the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, which describes our fiscal year 2018 business results, compensation program decisions, shareholder outreach process and pay for performance alignment. We believe that the information we have provided in this Proxy Statement demonstrates that we designed our executive compensation program appropriately and that it is working to build long-term shareholder value, deliver sustained, strong business and financial results and attract, motivate and retain a highly qualified and effective executive team. We currently hold advisory votes on the compensation of our named executive officers on an annual basis and intend to hold the next such vote at the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. 
Accordingly, the following resolution will be submitted to our shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting: 
RESOLVED, that the compensation paid to Adient's named executive officers, as disclosed in the Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section and the accompanying compensation tables and narrative discussion, is hereby approved on an advisory basis.

Fiscal Year 2018 Executive Summary 
Effective with the start of fiscal year 2018, the Committee made a number of changes to executive compensation to continue to drive a strong pay for performance orientation while reflecting Adient's continued evolution since the separation from Johnson Controls International plc; these included: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increased weight on performance share units ("PSUs") to 60% from 50% of total target long-term  incentive award value  
• Introduced earnings per share ("EPS") and relative total shareholder return  ("TSR") metrics to PSUs  
• Added a "circuit breaker" to PSU program whereby any earned awards would be capped at 100% of target if  the TSR is negative for that fiscal year  
• Increased share ownership requirements from 7x to 10x base salary for the CEO and 4x to 5x base salary for EVPs   
• Amended our Insider Trading Policy's prohibition on pledging Adient securities to remove certain remaining  limited pledging exceptions  
[END TABLE]
 Fiscal year 2018 was a challenging year for Adient. The Committee recognized that additional changes were required to our compensation program to drive focus and actions towards mitigation of the internal and external factors which have significantly impacted our financial results. These factors include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Earnings and operating margins declined significantly as benefits related to increased revenue were more than  offset by business performance issues in all segments  
• Macro factors, including increased commodity costs (escalating steel and chemical prices), combined with the  impact of tariffs (associated with trade disputes) also placed downward pressure on earnings  
• The lower level of earnings had a direct impact on Adient's cash generation and balance sheet   
[END TABLE]
During the course of the year, Adient's Board of Directors appointed a new President and CEO, Mr. Del Grosso, effective October 1, 2018, to lead Adient's turnaround plan. 
In line with our pay for performance philosophy and corresponding compensation plan design, Adient's fiscal year 2018 results had a direct and immediate impact on compensation for our NEOs: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Annual incentive awards were zero  
• Fiscal year 2018 PSU performance achievement for the fiscal year 2018 awards was 25% of target   
• Overall value of vested and unvested shares decreased significantly in line with share price   
• Suspended the calendar year 2018 non-elective employer allocation to the  Retirement Restoration Plan, which provides executives with additional contributions (over the retirement income contributions to the 401(k) Plan) up to 12% of pay  
• Discontinued the use of Adient's corporate aircraft for personal travel effective in the 2nd quarter of fiscal 2018 and subsequently sold the aircraft  
[END TABLE]
Fiscal Year 2019 
The Board of Directors, working with Adient's new senior leadership, refocused Adient's strategy by narrowing product and market focus and placing a greater emphasis on actions designed to deliver enhanced profitability, cash generation, and debt reduction. 
Based on this strategy and feedback solicited from shareholders we redesigned the executive compensation programs for fiscal year 2019 to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Tie NEO incentives to improved profitability, cash flow, debt management and shareholder value creation   
• Increase the portion of long-term incentive awards that require meeting specific performance conditions to vest   
[END TABLE]
Specific compensation design changes for fiscal year 2019 include: 
Annual Incentive Plan 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• 40% weight on achieving adjusted EBITDA target  
• 40% weight on achieving free cash flow target  
• 20% weight on achieving three strategic objectives intended to enhance Adient's operations and profitability  each with a pre-defined and measurable target  
[END TABLE]
Total maximum award has been reduced from 200% of target historically used in Adient's AIPP to 180% to ensure appropriate sharing of incremental performance results between shareholders and AIPP participants, with performance on strategic objectives capped at target. 
Long-term Incentive Plan 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Setting NEO long-term incentive PSU metrics exclusively on improved profitability, cash flow, debt management and  shareholder value creation  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Increasing the weight of PSUs to 70% of target value  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Discontinue the use of annual measurement periods for PSUs and instead tie vesting to achievement of three-year  goals, or goals set in the final year of the three-year period  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Continue the use of relative TSR as a PSU metric, but as a modifier of financial metrics, to reinforce the  importance of improved profitability, debt reduction and cash flow generation  
[END TABLE]
 Peer Group 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Benchmarking compensation levels to a revised peer group ("Compensation Peer Group") that places  greater focus on automobile equipment manufacturers and eliminates companies that had significantly greater revenue than Adient  
[END TABLE]
Our new Compensation Peer Group for fiscal year 2019 has a median revenue of $13B, down from a median of $15.3B in our Compensation Peer Group used to set compensation for fiscal year 2018.

Benefits 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Eliminating the leased vehicle benefit for newly hired executives in the United States effective October 1,  2018  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Restricting investment options for all long-term incentive ("LTI") deferral elections; once a  deferred restricted share unit ("RSU") or PSU award vests, those RSUs or PSUs will become Deferred Share Units and will remain linked to Adient shares until distribution  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Limiting cash severance benefit for the CEO under a "non-change of  control scenario" to 1.5x base salary  
[END TABLE]
In addition, NEOs did not receive increases in salary, target bonus percentage or in target LTI for fiscal year 2019, leaving their entire compensation package unchanged. The Committee believes these changes continue the tradition of paying for performance while reflecting the urgency of the business transformation that is required as well as investor input into key metrics for Adient in 2019. 
Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation Discussion 
In determining our executive compensation programs and policies, the Committee considers shareholder interests, market best practice and market norms. We target compensation generally at market medians based on our Compensation Peer Group, while also considering that certain Adient leaders are responsible for the oversight and leadership of our joint ventures, which account for an additional $18.2 billion of non-consolidated revenue. We let performance against established goals dictate where actual compensation falls versus the market. At times, to reflect skills, experience and market conditions, total compensation for an individual may deviate from market median. 
The following factors guided the Committee's executive compensation decisions in fiscal year 2018:

 Aligning Pay and Performance         
 Aligning Pay and Performance         
 Pay for performance is key to our executive compensation philosophy. To ensure that we adhere to this principle, we consider the degree of  alignment of total incentive compensation to business results, including the level of net debt/adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBIT, ROS, EPS growth, TSR, and sales backlog growth.   In fiscal year 2018, we used a mix of short- and long-term incentives as well as cash and non-cash compensation to meet  our executive compensation program's objectives. Incentive compensation programs for executives are designed to link compensation performance with the full spectrum of business goals, some of which are short-term, while others take several  years or more to achieve:               We consider  shareholder feedback and input in the development of our executive compensation practices.   At the 2018 annual general meeting of shareholders, 88% of the shareholder votes cast supported the executive compensation program in an advisory "say-on-pay" vote.

 Determining Fiscal Year 2018 Compensation 
Adient's business is closely tied to the automotive industry which is highly cyclical and subject to volatile results. NEO pay mix and levels for fiscal year 2018 were aligned with market practice; however, given the nature of our industry, we will continue to evaluate appropriate positioning to market going forward to ensure we are able to engage, motivate and retain key talent, while balancing shareholder interests. The following highlights important compensation practices and decisions made for fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]

 Role of the Committee 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Committee is comprised of four independent directors who amend and approve the executive compensation program. Each year, the Committee  determines the appropriate level of compensation for executives, including the NEOs. As an initial guideline, the Committee sets the total direct compensation opportunity (base salary, annual incentive target, and long-term incentive target) for  each executive to approximately the 50th percentile of the Compensation Peer Group.   The Committee generally determines an executives compensation based upon a desire to link compensation to the objectives of our executive compensation  programs. In addition, when determining the overall compensation of NEOs, including base salaries and annual and LTI amounts, the Committee considers, in a subjective manner, a number of factors it deems important, as outlined above.   The Committee makes the compensation decisions for the CEO and the other NEOs after  careful review and analysis of appropriate performance information, market compensation data and shareholder input. While the CEO makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the compensation of the other NEOs, the Committee alone determines the  compensation for the CEO.   Beyond determining specific compensation for NEOs, the  Committee works with executive management to review and adjust compensation policies and practices to remain consistent with Adients values and philosophy, support the recruitment and retention of executive talent, and help Adient achieve its  business objectives.         Our Approach to Rewarding Performance   Annual Incentive Plan     Reward achievement of short-term individual and corporate performance goals   Restricted Stock Units     Align executives  long-term financial interests with those of our shareholders   Reinforce ownership in Adient   Support retention of executives   Performance Share Units     Align executives  long-term financial interests with those of our shareholders   Link compensation to building  long-term shareholder value and the achievement of key financial targets   Reinforce ownership  in Adient   Support retention of executives

The Committee makes the compensation decisions for the CEO and the other NEOs after  careful review and analysis of appropriate performance information, market compensation data and shareholder input. While the CEO makes recommendations to the Committee regarding the compensation of the other NEOs, the Committee alone determines the  compensation for the CEO.   Beyond determining specific compensation for NEOs, the  Committee works with executive management to review and adjust compensation policies and practices to remain consistent with Adients values and philosophy, support the recruitment and retention of executive talent, and help Adient achieve its  business objectives.

Role of the CEO 
The CEO provides recommendations to the Committee on the total direct compensation for executives other than himself. The CEO does not make recommendations with respect to his own compensation. 
The CEO's recommendations for the other NEOs are based on his personal review of their performance, job responsibilities, importance to our overall business strategy, and our compensation philosophy. Although the CEO's recommendations are given significant weight, the Committee retains full discretion when determining compensation. 
Role of the Compensation Peer Group 
To gauge marketplace compensation levels and practices, the Committee approved for fiscal year 2018 a Compensation Peer Group consisting of a group of companies that: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Adient competes against for talent  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Are in the same or a similar industry  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Have broadly similar revenues that range from $3.1B to $40.5B, with a median of $15.3B  
[END TABLE]
 For fiscal year 2018, the following companies comprised our Compensation Peer Group:

In establishing fiscal year 2018 total direct compensation levels (base pay, annual incentive targets and long-term incentive targets), the Committee reviewed market data from the Compensation Peer Group against the current compensation levels for executives. 
Role of the Independent Compensation Consultant 
To add rigor in the review process and to inform the Committee of market trends, the Committee engaged the services of Willis Towers Watson to analyze its executive compensation structure and plan designs. Willis Towers Watson also provided Compensation Peer Group and other market data, which the Committee referenced when determining compensation for NEOs. The Committee annually reviews the services Willis Towers Watson provides, the quality of those services, the fees associated with the services as well as the factors impacting independence that NYSE rules require. 
The Committee has considered and assessed relevant factors that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest with respect to the work performed by Willis Towers Watson. Based on this review, the Committee did not identify any conflicts of interest and has determined that Willis Towers Watson is independent of Adient and its management. 
2018 Shareholder Outreach 
Adient is committed to the interests of our shareholders and the delivery of shareholder value through sustainable growth strategies. We believe that, as part of this commitment, it is important to maintain ongoing dialogue with shareholders to solicit and respond to feedback about the executive compensation program. 
At the annual general meeting of shareholders held in March 2018, 88% of the shareholder votes cast supported our executive compensation program in an advisory "say-on-pay" vote. We considered the results of that vote in deciding to make the changes to our compensation programs described below. 
Adient did not conduct shareholder calls specifically on compensation practices in fiscal year 2018. However, during regular shareholder calls in fiscal year 2018, we discussed and received comments on compensation practices. These comments plus the input received in fiscal year 2017 served as guidance for decisions in redesigning the fiscal year 2019 annual and long-term compensation plans.  Elements of our Total Rewards Program 
The chart below highlights the key elements of our total rewards program for fiscal year 2018 and how each is linked to executive compensation program objectives:

PSUs align executive compensation with the creation of shareholder value. PSUs  have a three-year cliff vesting cycle with the number of shares earned dependent on financial performance relative to pre-determined goals. Sales backlog (50% weight), EPS growth (25% weight), Relative TSR  (25% weight), and Absolute TSR (circuit breaker  if negative, the maximum award is capped at 100% for that year) are the performance measures used for this LTI component.1

Analysis of 2018 Compensation 
Base Salary 
Base pay recognizes each executive's role, skills, performance, contribution, leadership and potential. It is the only portion of executive total direct compensation that is not "at risk," and helps us attract and retain individuals who have the leadership and management skills to drive the growth and success of our business. 
NEOs serving at the start of fiscal year 2018 received base salary increases to better align their pay with median compensation paid to executives with comparable responsibility and experience. In the case of Messrs. Foster and Mitchell, the increases were intended to recognize the increased scope of their roles.

 Mr. Henderson received a monthly base salary of $80,000 as part of his interim CEO compensation arrangement effective June 11, 2018. A description of the compensation arrangements agreed upon with Mr. Henderson for the interim CEO role can be found under the heading "CEO Transition" below. 
Annual Incentive Performance Program (AIPP) 
Fiscal year 2018 AIPP measured executive performance in the following three areas: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Financial Metrics: net debt/adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization  (adjusted EBITDA), adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (adjusted EBIT), and return on sales (ROS) results. Overall performance for these metrics resulted in achievement of 0% of target  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Non-Financial / Other Metrics (which modify the financial metric  results): executive diversity, product launch and Futuris EBITDA (+/-5% each). Because achievement under the Financial Metrics was 0%, these modifiers have no effect  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Individual Modifier: each NEO's award would further have been adjusted up or down to a maximum of +/-10% to reflect their individual contributions in the fiscal year and their success in driving Adient's culture and values. Since the performance against the Financial Metrics was 0%, these modifiers were not  applied  
[END TABLE]
The total of non-financial / other results and individual modifier may move an individual's annual incentive award based on financial metric achievement, up or down a maximum of 25%. 
Mr. Henderson was not eligible to participate in the AIPP as part of his interim CEO compensation arrangement, nor was Mr. McDonald under the terms of his retirement agreement.

(1) Mr. Henderson was not eligible under the FY2018 AIPP as part of his interim CEO compensation agreement. 
(2) Mr. McDonald was not eligible to receive any payout under the FY2018 AIPP as part of his retirement agreement. 
(3) Mr. Mitchell was eligible for a pro-rated payout under the FY2018 AIPP as part of his severance agreement if any bonus were paid.  Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI) 
The Committee approved two forms of LTI awards in fiscal year 2018 and increased the portion of the awards tied to performance metrics by adjusting the split between RSUs and PSUs from 50% / 50% in fiscal year 2017 to 40% / 60% in fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• RSUs vest one-third per year over three years and provide additional  value to the holder when the stock price rises. By awarding RSUs, we can link LTIs directly to stock price. If the stock price decreases, so does the value of the executive's compensation. RSUs can help to maintain competitive compensation  levels in the market and retain high-performing employees through multi-year vesting requirements.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• PSUs vest at the end of the three-year performance period (FY2018 — FY2020). In response to  shareholder feedback, we introduced two additional metrics – TSR and EPS growth to the PSU grants. The final award payouts are based on achieving growth in sales backlog, EPS growth, and relative TSR objectives. If absolute TSR for the fiscal  year is negative, the maximum payout is capped at 100% for that year. The Committee set the thresholds, targets and maximums for the fiscal years 2018-2020 LTI performance period based on Adient's long-term strategic plan. This approach ensures  that we provide competitive incentive compensation based on market competitive performance while continuing to focus on strategic long-term deliverables.  
[END TABLE]
In total, we believe these grants provide a balanced focus on shareholder value creation and retention of key executives over the course of the vesting period. They are also reflective of market practice within our industry. The size of the grants is based on a combination of market practice and the relative importance of the objectives behind each of the grants. The PSU will be earned or forfeited based on performance achievement. Furthermore, all awards are impacted by changes in Adient share price. 
The Committee approved the following grants for fiscal year 2018: 
(1) Mr. Henderson was not eligible to participate in the annual LTI grant as part of his interim CEO compensation arrangement. 
*Note: These grants are reflected in the Fiscal Year 2018 Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table. 
The target value granted for PSUs shown in the table above is based on the actual grant date values approved by the Committee. The amounts shown in the Summary Compensation Table and the Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table below reflect the Monte Carlo valuation on the relative TSR portion of the PSUs. 
PSU award performance for fiscal year 2018 will make up one-third of the total payout for the fiscal year 2018 – 2020 performance cycle and one-third of the total payout for the fiscal year 2017-2019 performance cycle. The goals set for fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018 were strategically important for the business and deemed at the time the grants were approved to be reasonably rigorous by the Committee. The rigor of our goals is demonstrated by the below target achievement (25% of target) of the fiscal year 2018 PSU grant against their fiscal year 2018 PSU goals. 
Mr. Henderson was not eligible to participate in the annual LTI grant as part of his interim CEO compensation arrangement. Mr. Henderson received monthly share awards with a value of $150,000 issued on the last pay date of each month. Mr. Henderson's monthly awards were pro-rated based on business days worked in June 2018   when he transitioned into the interim CEO role. These share awards were fully vested upon grant. The closing stock price the day before the last pay date of each month was used as the fair market value to calculate the number of shares of stock issued. 
CEO Transition 
As previously disclosed, Mr. McDonald stepped down as Chairman and CEO effective June 11, 2018 and continued employment in a non-executive officer role as a senior advisor to the CEO until Mr. McDonald's retirement on September 30, 2018. In connection with his transition to senior advisor, Mr. McDonald entered into a retirement agreement, which set forth the terms of his advisory role. Under the retirement agreement, Mr. McDonald continued to be paid his then-current base salary and continued to be eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan and welfare benefits plans. He also continued to participate in the perquisite allowance and car lease programs but was not eligible to receive a payment under the AIPP for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Upon his retirement, Mr. McDonald's outstanding equity awards granted before 2017 received "retirement" vesting treatment as described below under the heading "Potential Payments upon Termination and Change of Control," and his equity awards granted in 2017 were forfeited. Under the terms of Mr. McDonald's retirement arrangement, some long-term equity incentive awards will continue to vest beyond his retirement date and PSU awards will be subject to the final performance achievement multiplier. He was not entitled to any cash severance or other severance benefits upon his retirement. Since Mr. McDonald had recently relocated to Michigan to assume the CEO role, he was paid $250,000 for relocation expenses in October 2018 to allow him to relocate. He remains subject to his existing restrictive covenants and was required to execute a release of claims to receive the benefits under the retirement agreement. 
The Board appointed Mr. Henderson interim CEO effective June 11, 2018. On June 18, 2018, the Board approved compensation to be paid to Mr. Henderson for his service as interim CEO, which was documented in the form of a term sheet. During Mr. Henderson's service as interim CEO, and as outlined in the term sheet, he received a monthly base salary of $80,000 and fully vested Adient ordinary shares in the amount of $150,000 per month. We pro-rated these amounts for the month of June 2018 based on the number of business days during which he served as interim CEO, and we determined the number of shares granted each month using the closing share price the day before the last pay date of each month. While he served as interim CEO, Mr. Henderson was eligible to participate in Adient's health and welfare plans, 401(k) Plan and Retirement Restoration Plan. He was not eligible to participate in the AIPP, LTI, perquisite allowance or car lease programs, but he received payments to cover temporary housing. The amount of the payment to cover temporary housing is reflected below in the "All Other Compensation" column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
In establishing the compensation to be paid to Mr. Henderson for his service as interim CEO, the Committee considered the financial challenges faced by Adient, the expected temporary nature of the position, market data provided by Willis Towers Watson concerning other interim CEO compensation arrangements and Mr. Henderson's input. In light of the expected temporary nature of Mr. Henderson's position, and at Mr. Henderson's request, the Committee set his compensation at a level lower than the median of the market data. The Committee also determined that, due to the expected short-term duration of Mr. Henderson's role as interim CEO, his total direct compensation should consist solely of a fixed base salary, fully vested share awards and temporary housing to promote stability and alignment of interests with shareholders. 
Mr. Henderson ceased to serve as interim CEO at the end of fiscal year 2018 and was succeeded by Mr. Del Grosso, who became President and CEO effective on October 1, 2018. In connection with Mr. Del Grosso's appointment, we provided to Mr. Del Grosso a written offer letter (the "Offer Letter") that specified certain compensation terms beginning in fiscal year 2019: Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Del Grosso's initial base salary is $1,150,000 per year, and he is eligible to participate in Adient's performance-based cash incentive bonus program, with a target annual bonus equal to 150% of his base salary and an opportunity to earn up to 200% of base salary for performance above target, subject to the performance metrics determined annually by the Committee. Mr. Del Grosso is also eligible to receive annual long-term equity incentive awards with applicable performance goals to be determined by the Committee and as granted in accordance with normal equity grant practices, with a target grant date value of $7,300,000. He is also eligible for standard employee benefits as in effect from time to time on the same basis as generally made available to other senior management.  In addition, to compensate Mr. Del Grosso for equity awards and other dividend compensation that he had the opportunity to earn at his previous employer but that were forfeited in connection with his change in employment, he was granted a one-time equity award in the form of PSUs issued under the Adient plc 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan with a grant date target value of $5,100,000 (reflecting a reduction of $1,900,000 from the original $7,000,000 value for additional compensation received from Mr. Del Grosso's previous employer). The PSUs will be earned and become vested based on the difference in (1) the average closing price of ordinary shares over the ten trading days before and ten trading days after Mr. Del Grosso's start date with us (the "Starting Price") and (2) the average closing price of ordinary shares over the 10 trading days before and 10 trading days after the third anniversary of the grant date as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   Ending Price as a Percent of Starting Price         Multiplier Against Granted PSUs   
   Ending Price as a Percent of Starting Price         Multiplier Against Granted PSUs   
   Ending Price as a Percent of Starting Price         Multiplier Against Granted PSUs   
 Less than Starting Price     75% 
 Equal to Starting Price     90% 
 Over 100% up to 150%     100% 
 Over 150% up to 200%     135% 
 Over 200% up to 250%     175% 
 Over 250%     250% 
[END TABLE]
For Mr. Del Grosso to earn the full target value of the PSUs, the average closing price of an ordinary share must be greater (as calculated by the formula discussed above) at the time of the third anniversary of the grant date than it was at the grant date. In addition, the PSUs will be forfeited by Mr. Del Grosso if he separates from service with us prior to the third anniversary of his start date unless due to death or disability. 
Mr. Del Grosso also received a one-time cash bonus of $800,000 (reflecting a reduction of $500,000 from the original $1,300,000 bonus amount for additional compensation received from his previous employer) to compensate him for a forfeited 2018 bonus and forfeited dividends from his previous employer. This cash bonus is subject to repayment in full if Mr. Del Grosso's employment ends for any reason other than termination by us without cause or due to death or disability prior to the second anniversary of his start date. 
We entered into a standard Key Executive Severance and Change of Control Agreement ("Severance and Change of Control Agreement") with Mr. Del Grosso, the terms of which are generally consistent with the terms of the agreements with our NEOs described below under the heading "Severance and Change of Control Agreements." Under his Severance and Change of Control Agreement, Mr. Del Grosso's severance upon a qualifying termination other than in connection with a change of control would be equal to one and one-half times his base salary, and he would receive a benefits replacement payment equal to 18 months' benefits. His severance upon a qualifying termination during the two years following a change of control would be equal to three times the sum of his base salary and average bonus, and he would receive a benefits replacement payment equal to 36 months' benefits. 
Other Policies and Benefits 
Share Ownership Guidelines 
We require executive officers to hold a significant amount of Adient stock. The guidelines below tie NEO compensation to stock performance because the increase or decrease in stock price impacts their personal holdings. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
   NEO       Required Minimum Ownership 
   NEO       Required Minimum Ownership 
 Non-interim CEO     10x base salary 
 Jeffrey M. Stafeil     5x base salary 
 Neil E. Marchuk     5x base salary 
 Byron S. Foster     5x base salary 
 Cathleen A. Ebacher     3x base salary 
[END TABLE]
 These ownership requirements are higher than general market practice, reflecting our culture and demonstrating a strong commitment to Adient. Each participant covered by the ownership requirement must reach their ownership within a five-year "grow in" period. Mr. Del Grosso has five years from his appointment as President and CEO to reach the level of required ownership indicated above. 
Participants not meeting their required ownership level within the applicable "grow-in" period: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• May not be granted additional long-term awards until the ownership requirements are met  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With regard to share options or stock appreciation rights settled in shares, may only be permitted to exercise  and hold the resulting after-tax shares; and/or  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• With regard to shares issued under an Adient RSU or PSU award, may only be permitted to hold their shares with a  designated broker and not permitted to sell such shares until share ownership requirements are met  
[END TABLE]
As interim CEO, Mr. Henderson was not subject to the executive share ownership requirements; however, he remained subject to the share ownership requirements as a member of the Board of Directors. 
Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy 
Our Insider Trading Policy prohibits all employees, including NEOs, from engaging in hedging transactions relating to Adient securities or pledging Adient securities as collateral. As described above under "Other Key Decisions – Hedging and Pledging Policy," in fiscal year 2018 we amended the Policy to remove the remaining limited potential for exceptions to the pledging prohibition. 
Incentive Compensation Recoupment Policy 
We have a "claw back" policy that applies to all performance incentives (including PSUs) awarded on or after October 31, 2016. This "claw back" policy serves to increase transparency and discourage executives from engaging in behavior that could potentially harm Adient or its shareholders. 
Under the policy, the Committee requires all officers (within the meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act) elected by the Board to reimburse us for any overpayments or excess shares delivered under any performance incentives if: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The payment or delivery of shares was based on the applicable performance period's financial results that  were subsequently the subject of a material restatement, other than a restatement due to changes in accounting policy  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Committee believes the covered officer engaged in conduct that caused, or even partially caused, the need for  the restatement  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A lower payment would have been made, or fewer shares delivered, to the covered officer based upon the restated  financial results  
[END TABLE]
In addition, if we are required to prepare an accounting restatement due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws as a result of misconduct, then we will also seek to recover any compensation received by the CEO and CFO (consistent with Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002). 
When the SEC adopts final rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the recovery of incentive compensation, we intend to review and revise our policy to the extent required to comply with such rules. 
Retirement Benefit Plans 
The three retirement plans described below are broadly applicable to all executives. We regularly evaluate the effectiveness of our retirement program and consider changes as needed. 
401(k) Plan 
All U.S. employees are eligible for the 401(k) Plan, including executives. Participants can contribute up to 25% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis; however, executives can contribute only up to 6% of their   eligible compensation. The Adient match is $.75 on each dollar contributed up to 6% of the employee's eligible compensation. A variable match may be available based on Adient performance whereby Adient may match up to 100% of each dollar contributed, up to 6% of the employee's eligible compensation. 
In addition, Adient makes a varied annual retirement contribution for eligible employees, including all executives. The contribution is between 1% and 7% of the participant's eligible compensation and is based on the participant's age and service. Both the matching contribution and the annual retirement income contribution are subject to vesting requirements. 
Retirement Restoration Plan 
Code sections 402(g) and 401(a)(17) limit the benefits companies can provide to employees under a 401(k) plan. Thus, Adient sponsors the Retirement Restoration Plan, which allows certain employees who are affected by these Code limits to obtain the full intended benefit from the 401(k) without regard to such limits. 
Under the plan, executives are eligible to defer up to 6% of their eligible compensation to the Retirement Restoration Plan (without regard to the limits imposed on deferrals under the 401(k) Plan) and receive a matching contribution (at the same rate as provided under the 401(k) Plan) on those deferrals. In January 2017, the Committee amended the Retirement Restoration Plan's retirement income allocation to support the retention of selected executives including the NEOs. Selected executives are eligible for an allocation under the Retirement Restoration Plan equal to the difference between (i) 12% of their base salary and bonus compensation paid during the year and (ii) the amount of retirement income contributions actually credited to their 401(k) Plan account for that year. The Retirement Restoration Plan's retirement income allocation was suspended for calendar year 2018 only in light of company financial results. 
All matching contributions and retirement income contributions made under the Retirement Restoration Plan are subject to the same vesting requirements as the 401(k) Plan, except that vesting is not accelerated as a result of an individual's death while employed. 
Executive Deferred Compensation Plan 
The Executive Deferred Compensation Plan assists executives, including NEOs, with personal financial planning by allowing participants to defer compensation and associated taxes until retirement or termination of employment. It also assists executives in the management of their executive stock ownership requirements. Investment options in the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan generally mirror investment options available in the 401(k) Plan, except that deferrals arising from PSUs granted on and after October 1, 2018 and deferrals arising from RSUs granted on or after October 1, 2019 will automatically be deemed invested in Adient shares and cannot be reallocated to other investment options. 
Employment Agreements 
We do not maintain employment agreements with our NEOs. However, we do maintain arrangements under which the NEOs (other than the interim CEO) may become entitled to receive severance benefits upon a qualifying termination of employment, as described below under "Severance and Change of Control Agreements." In addition, as described above under "CEO Transition," we documented Mr. Henderson's compensation arrangements in a term sheet, and we generally provide offer letters to newly hired executive officers in connection with their recruitment. Substantially all of the compensation obligations under our offer letters to NEOs lapsed or were satisfied prior to fiscal year 2018, except for one cash payment to Mr. Marchuk in the amount of $400,000, which was made in December 2017.  Severance and Change of Control Agreements 
Consistent with market practice, we implemented the following Severance and Change of Control agreements intended to retain the executives before and after a change of control and encourage the executives to maximize the value of any change of control transaction for shareholders in the long-term (references to the CEO in the table below represent the agreement with Mr. McDonald during his tenure as CEO and do not include Mr. Henderson as the interim CEO or Mr. Del Grosso, who did not become CEO until after the end of fiscal year 2018):

Perquisite Program 
We have a Flexible Perquisites Program that limits the perquisite cash allowance to 5% of base salary. Adient does not reimburse for other expenses such as financial planning, security, club dues, etc. In addition to the cash allowance, other perquisites include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Corporate aircraft: this benefit provided the CEO with unlimited access to the aircraft as well as an  ability to authorize use for other executives; in all cases, the executive was responsible for taxes. This perquisite was discontinued effective as of the second quarter of fiscal year 2018

Compensation and Risk Assessment 
The Committee has assessed the risks associated with our compensation programs, policies and practices and, based on its assessment, does not believe that such compensation programs, policies and practices create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Adient. 
CEO Pay Ratio 
As required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the ratio of the annual total compensation of the median Adient employee to the annual total compensation of the CEO. 
As permitted by SEC regulations in cases where there has been more than one CEO during the year, for the annual total compensation of our CEO, we elected to add the compensation of both individuals who served in the CEO and interim CEO role during fiscal year 2018. 
For fiscal year 2018: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 The Total Compensation of our CEOs   $14,738,869         
 The  Annual Total Compensation of our Median Employee   $18,861 
 The Ratio  of the CEO's to the Median Employee's Annual Total Compensation   782:1 
[END TABLE]
We believe the pay ratio reported above, which is based on the methodologies and assumptions described below, is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. SEC rules identifying the median employee and determining the pay ratio permit companies to employ a wide-range of methodologies, estimates and assumptions. As a result, the pay ratio reported by other companies, which may have utilized other permitted methodologies or assumptions, and which may have a significantly different workforce structure from ours, are likely not comparable to our CEO pay ratio.  With respect to the identification of the median compensation of all employees (excluding the CEOs), the methodology and the material assumptions, adjustments, and estimates that we used to identify the median and determine total compensation (or any elements of total compensation) were as follows: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• For fiscal year 2018, we determined on July 1, 2018 that Adient's total global employee population  consisted of 85,023 full-time, part-time and temporary employees in the U.S. and 34 other countries.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• As permitted by SEC rules, under the 5% "de minimis exception" we excluded 4,204 non-U.S. employees, representing 4.95% of Adient's total workforce. Employees from the following countries were excluded: Lesotho (55), Turkey (577), Russia (187), Macedonia (3,355), and Morocco (30). After  excluding the employees in these countries pursuant to the de minimis exception, the employee population as of July 1, 2018, consisted of 80,819 employees, including 12,030 employees in the U.S. (14.15%) and 68,789 employees outside the U.S.  (80.59%).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The consistently applied compensation measure ("CACM") we used to determine the median employee  was base salaries and wages collected from payrolls in all countries from the dates of July 1, 2017 to July 1, 2018. We evaluated multiple approaches for the CACM and we concluded base salary and wages were the most consistent pay elements  across all 35 countries' payrolls.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We annualized the compensation of permanent employees who did not work the full fiscal year (e.g., new hires and  employees on leave).  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We did not apply cost-of-living  adjustments to non-U.S. countries in identifying the median employee.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• After identifying the median employee, we calculated the median employee's annual total compensation for  fiscal year 2018 in accordance with the SEC's requirements governing preparation of the Summary Compensation Table. We calculated the annual total compensation of the CEO by adding together the total compensation for each individual who served  in the CEO role during fiscal year 2018 as shown in the Summary Compensation Table.  
[END TABLE]
Tax and Accounting Rules and Regulations 
When determining total direct compensation packages for fiscal year 2018, Adient considered all factors that may impact financial performance, including tax and accounting rules and regulations under Section 162(m) of the Code. For fiscal year 2018, Section 162(m) of the Code limits Adient from deducting compensation in excess of $1 million paid to the CEO or to the other three highest-paid executive officers (other than the chief financial officer). However, compensation that we are otherwise able to deduct in fiscal year 2018 that qualifies as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) will be fully deductible. 
Adient's compensation philosophy for fiscal year 2018 emphasized performance-based compensation for executive officers, thus lessening the consequences of the Section 162(m) limitation described above. 
As a result of changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, starting with compensation paid in fiscal year 2019 (the year starting October 1, 2018 and ending September 30, 2019), Section 162(m) will limit Adient from deducting compensation, including performance-based compensation, in excess of $1 million paid to anyone who, starting with fiscal year 2018, serves as the chief executive officer or chief financial officer, or who is among the three most highly compensated executive officers for any fiscal year. The only exception to this rule is for compensation that is paid pursuant to a binding contract in effect on November 2, 2017, that would otherwise have been deductible under the prior Section 162(m) rules. 
Going forward, the Committee will retain full discretion to award compensation packages that best attract, retain, and reward successful executive officers. Therefore, the Committee may award compensation that is not fully deductible under Section 162(m) if the Committee believes it will contribute to the achievement of our business objectives.  EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES 
The following table sets forth information regarding the compensation of the named executive officers of Adient in fiscal year 2018: Frederick A. Henderson, Interim Chief Executive Officer; R. Bruce McDonald, Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jeffrey M. Stafeil, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Neil E. Marchuk, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer; Byron S. Foster, Executive Vice President; Eric S. Mitchell, Executive Vice President; and Cathleen A.

(3) Stock/Unit Awards: The amounts in column (e) for fiscal year 2018 reflect the fair value of equity awards granted during the fiscal year, which consisted of restricted share units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) and, in the case of Mr. Henderson, fully vested Adient ordinary shares in the amount of $150,000 per month in accordance with the term sheet we entered into with him in connection with his service as interim CEO. These amounts represent the fair value of the entire amount of the award calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC Topic 718, excluding the effect of estimated forfeitures. For RSUs, fair value is computed by multiplying the total number of shares subject to the award by the closing market price of an ordinary share on the date of grant. In the case of PSUs, the amounts are based on the probable outcome of performance conditions, consistent with the estimate of aggregate compensation cost to be recognized over the service period determined as of the grant date under FASB ASC Topic 718, excluding forfeitures. Footnote 11 to the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 which appear in Adient's Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 29, 2018 includes assumptions that were used in the calculation of the equity award values.  (4)Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation: The amounts reported in column (g) reflect annual cash incentive compensation, if any, earned in the fiscal year (which was based on Company and individual performance in the fiscal year indicated and paid in the first quarter of following fiscal year). Annual incentive compensation is discussed in further detail above under the heading 'Annual Incentive Performance Program.' 
(5) Change In Pension Value: Adient does not offer a defined benefit pension. No NEO received preferential or above market earnings on nonqualified deferred compensation. 
(6) All Other Compensation: The fiscal year 2018 amounts reported in column (i) for each named executive officer represent consist of the following:

(1) Certain amounts that appear in the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation table also appear in the Summary Compensation Table as compensation that an NEO earned in fiscal year 2018. Messrs. McDonald's, Stafeil's, Marchuk's, Foster's and Mitchell's and Ms. Ebacher's Executive Contributions include $359,335, $125,685, $95,194, $121,782, $91,618, $84,614, respectively, that is also reported in the Salary and Non-Equity Incentive Compensation columns in the Summary Compensation Table for fiscal year 2018. 
(2) Amounts shown include the company matching contributions that we make under the Retirement Restoration Plan because the Code limits such contributions under the 401(k) plan. Messrs. McDonald's, Stafeil's, Marchuk's, Foster's and Mitchell's and Ms. Ebacher's Registrant Contributions include $1,075,535, $365,517, $294,955, $358,023, $321,256, $237,381, respectively, that is also reported in the All Other Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table. 
(3) The Aggregate Earnings are not "above-market or preferential earnings" and therefore we do not need to report them in the Summary Compensation Table. The Aggregate Earnings represent all investment earnings, net of fees, on amounts that an NEO has deferred. Investment earnings include amounts relating to appreciation in the price of ordinary shares, and negative amounts relating to depreciation in the price of ordinary shares, because the deferred amounts include deferred stock units, the value of which is tied to the value of ordinary shares. Aggregate Earnings also include dividends that we pay on restricted stock that has not yet vested, which we credit to an NEO's deferred compensation account subject to vesting. 
(4) The Aggregate Balance at Last FYE includes amounts transferred from legacy Johnson Controls deferred compensation plans in connection with our spin-off from Johnson Controls. Amounts included in this column that have been reported in the Summary Compensation Table since fiscal year 2016 for each NEO are: for Messrs. McDonald, Stafeil, Marchuk, Foster and Mitchell and Ms. Ebacher, $3,002,150, $668,802, $579,051, $708,190, $596,366, $321,994, respectively. 
Adient maintains the following two nonqualified deferred compensation plans under which selected executives, as determined by the Compensation Committee, including NEOs, could elect to defer their compensation. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Adient US LLC Executive Deferred Compensation Plan allows selected executives to defer up to 100% of their  long-term performance share units and restricted stock awards.  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• The Adient US LLC Retirement Restoration Plan allows selected executives to defer 6% of their compensation that  is not eligible to be deferred into the 401(k) plan because of qualified plan limits that the Code imposes. The Retirement Restoration Plan also credits participants with a company contribution equal to the difference between the amount of matching  contribution made under the 401(k) plan and what such matching contribution would have been without regard to any limitation that the Code imposes on either the amount of matching contribution or the amount of compensation that can be considered,  and determined as if the amount the participant deferred under the Retirement Restoration Plan had been deferred into the 401(k) plan. Each allocation period the executive's account is also credited with an amount equal to the difference  between (i) 12% of base salary and annual bonus compensation paid during such allocation period and (ii) the amount of non-elective Retirement Income Contributions actually credited to the  executive's 401(k) Plan account for the allocation period. Due to business performance, this company elective contribution was suspended for calendar year 2018 and will not be credited to employee accounts in FY2019.

 Potential Payments upon Termination and Change in Control 
The following table summarizes the severance and other enhanced benefits that would have been payable to the NEOs upon termination of employment or upon the occurrence of a change in control of Adient, assuming the triggering event, or events, occurred on September 28, 2018. Equity award amounts are based on the closing price of Adient's ordinary shares of $39.31 on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on September 28, 2018. The arrangements under which the severance and other enhanced benefits would have been paid are described in the footnotes to the table. In addition, the benefits received by Messrs. McDonald and Mitchell as a result of their separations are discussed in the narrative following the table.

(1) In the event of a change in control and an involuntary termination other than for cause, disability or death, or a resignation for good reason, within the two years following the change in control, in each case as defined in our Severance and Change of Control Agreements and described in CD&A under the heading "Severance and Change of Control Agreements" (a "Qualified Termination"), the NEOs would be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• lump sum severance payment equal to three times the NEO's annual cash compensation, which includes the  NEO's annual base salary and the average of the NEO's annualized annual cash bonuses for the three fiscal years preceding the change in control (pursuant to our Severance and Change of Control Agreements, the average bonus amount only  includes bonuses paid or earned after October 31, 2016); and a cash payment of his or her annual bonus for fiscal year 2018 (which amount is not reflected in this Potential Payments and Benefits Upon Termination or a Change In Control table as  it is deemed earned as of September 30, 2018 and reported in the Summary Compensation Table)  
• cash payment equal to the lump sum value of 36 months of additional medical, dental, vision, life insurance and  disability coverage, employer contributions made to the NEO's qualified and nonqualified retirement accounts, perquisite program allowance, and employer payment for NEO's car lease  
• accelerated vesting of the NEO's stock options  
• accelerated vesting of unvested RSUs granted pursuant to the 2012 JCI Omnibus Incentive Plan (prior to  September 2, 2016) and pro-rata vesting of unvested RSUs and PSUs granted pursuant to Adient's 2016 Omnibus Incentive Plan  
[END TABLE]
All applicable dividend equivalents of the equity awards receive the same treatment as the related equity awards. These payments are subject to possible reduction if the excise tax under Section 4999 would apply. 
Specifically, if any payment to or for the benefit of the NEO, whether paid or provided pursuant to the terms of the Severance and Change of Control Agreement or otherwise (the "Payments") would subject the NEO to an excise tax under Code Section 4999, then the aggregate present value of the benefits provided to the NEO pursuant to the Severance and Change of Control Agreement (the "Benefit  Payments") will be reduced to an amount which maximizes the aggregate present value of Benefit Payments without causing any of the Payment to be subject to such tax by the NEO (the "Reduced Amount"). That reduction will not apply if the value of such Payments (after payment of all federal, state and local income taxes, federal employment taxes and the excise taxes due under Code Section 4999) would exceed the after-tax value of the Reduced Amount. 
(2) In the event of an involuntary termination without cause or for good reason not in connection with a change in control, in each case as defined in our Severance and Change of Control Agreements and described in CD&A under the heading "Severance and Change of Control Agreements," NEOs would be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• lump sum severance payment equal to 18 months of base salary continuation  
• cash payment equal to the lump sum value of 18 months of additional medical, dental, vision, life insurance and  disability coverage, employer contributions made to the NEO's qualified and nonqualified retirement accounts, perquisite program allowance, and employer payment for NEO's car lease  
• pro-rata vesting of the NEO's unvested stock options   
• pro-rata vesting of the NEO's unvested RSUs and PSUs   
• all applicable dividend equivalents of the equity awards receive the same treatment as the related equity awards   
[END TABLE]
(3) In the event of retirement, NEOs (only Mr. Marchuk is eligible for retirement with respect to RSUs and PSUs granted on or after October 1, 2017) would be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• the vesting of any unvested stock options that were granted to the NEO under the JCI 2012 Omnibus Incentive Plan  that have been outstanding for at least one full calendar year after the year of grant will accelerate so that all of the options are exercisable in full (and the NEO will forfeit all other options that have not been outstanding for at least one  full calendar year after the date of grant)  
• pro-rata vesting for RSUs and PSUs granted on or after October 1,  2016 and only if the NEO's employment terminates due to retirement after the first anniversary of the grant date (based on actual performance in the case of PSUs); any RSUs or PSUs granted on or after October 1, 2016 that do not become  vested as a result of the retirement shall automatically be forfeited. If the NEO engages in inimical conduct (as determined by the plan administrator) after his or her retirement; any RSUs and PSUs that have not yet been settled (or earned, in the  case of PSUs) shall automatically be forfeited  
• all applicable dividend equivalents of the equity awards receive the respective treatment  
• his account balance under the Retirement Restoration Plan  
• continued vesting of restricted stock and RSUs and PSUs granted on or after October 2, 2017 (contingent on  actual performance in the case of PSUs), if the NEO's employment terminates due to retirement after the first anniversary of the grant date and the NEO is at least age 60  
• all applicable dividend equivalents of the equity awards receive the same treatment as the related equity awards   
• the NEO is entitled to his or her account balance under the Retirement Restoration Plan  
[END TABLE]
(4) In the event of a death or disability, NEOs would be entitled to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• accelerated vesting of the NEO's stock options so that all of the options are exercisable in full   
• full vesting of all unvested RSUs

R. Bruce McDonald Retirement 
As previously disclosed, Mr. McDonald stepped down as Chairman and CEO effective June 11, 2018 and continued employment in a non-executive officer role as a senior advisor to the CEO until his retirement on September 30, 2018. In connection with his transition to senior advisor, Mr. McDonald entered into a retirement agreement, which set forth the terms of his advisory role. Under the retirement agreement, Mr. McDonald continued to be paid his then-current base salary and continued to be eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan and welfare benefits plans. He also continued to participate in the perquisite allowance and car lease programs but was not eligible to receive a payment under the AIPP for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. 
Upon his retirement, Mr. McDonald's outstanding equity awards granted before 2017 received "retirement" vesting treatment as described in footnote 3 to the preceding table, and his equity awards granted in 2017 were forfeited. The value of the retirement vesting treatment of Mr. McDonald's outstanding equity awards granted before 2017 was $8,661,934, assuming target performance in the case of PSUs and based on the closing price of Adient's ordinary shares of $39.31 on the NYSE on September 28, 2018. 
In total, Mr. McDonald forfeited awards covering 191,854 shares, with a value of $7,541,787 (based on the closing price of Adient's ordinary shares of $39.31 on the NYSE on September 28, 2018 and assuming target performance in the case of PSUs), as a result of his retirement.  Mr. McDonald was not entitled to any cash severance or other severance benefits upon his retirement. Since Mr. McDonald had recently relocated to Michigan to assume the CEO role, he was paid $250,000 for relocation expenses in October 2018 to allow him to relocate. He remains subject to his existing restrictive covenants and was required to execute a release of claims to receive the benefits under the retirement agreement. 
Eric S. Mitchell Separation 
As previously disclosed, Mr. Mitchell's employment ended on July 15, 2018. In connection with his departure, Mr. Mitchell entered into a separation agreement and release of all claims with us (the "Mitchell Separation Agreement"). 
The Mitchell Separation Agreement provided that Mr. Mitchell would receive the following in accordance with the terms of his existing Severance and Change of Control Agreement: (a) salary replacement benefits in the amount of $1,125,000 and (b) a benefits replacement payment in the amount of $167,967. The Mitchell Separation Agreement further stated that, consistent with the Severance and Change of Control Agreement, to the extent a bonus is paid under our AIPP for the performance period ending September 30, 2018, Mr. Mitchell would receive a prorated award that is based on the portion of the performance period that he has completed at the time of his separation from service. No such bonus was earned. Additionally, and also consistent with the terms of the Severance and Change of Control Agreement, all of Mr. Mitchell's PSUs will vest on a prorated basis based on the portion of the performance period that Mr. Mitchell has completed at the time of his separation of service, only if and to the extent the performance goals thereunder are achieved; provided, however, that the second and third tranche of his founder's grant award of RSUs will vest as scheduled on October 31, 2018 and October 31, 2019, respectively. The value of these equity-based awards that remained outstanding, assuming target performance in the case of PSUs, based on the closing price of Adient's ordinary shares of $48.58 on the NYSE on July 13, 2018, the last trading day prior to the date of Mr. Mitchell's termination of employment, was $1,767,229. Following his separation from employment with Adient, Mr. Mitchell remained subject to restrictive covenants, and he also executed a release of claims in order to receive the benefits described above. In total, Mr. Mitchell forfeited awards covering 34,299 shares, with a value of $1,666,245 (based on the closing price of Adient's ordinary shares of $48.58 on the NYSE on July 13, 2018, the last trading day prior to the date of Mr. Mitchell's termination of employment, and assuming target performance in the case of PSUs), as a result of his termination.  NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION 
Non-employee director annual compensation for fiscal year 2018 consisted of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A retainer at an annual rate of $290,000, $145,000 of which is paid in cash and $145,000 is paid in the form of  our ordinary shares at the then current market price, issued under the Adient plc 2016 Director Share Plan;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A committee chair fee at an annual rate of $10,000, payable in cash, for each of the chairs of the Audit  Committee, Compensation Committee and Corporate Governance Committee; and  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
• A Lead Director fee at an annual rate of $30,000, payable in cash, provided that a  non-employee Lead Director will not receive any committee chair fees described above.  
[END TABLE]
In connection with the appointment of an independent Board Chair effective October 1, 2018, the Board approved changes to our non-employee director annual compensation to add a Board Chair fee (in addition to the annual retainer described above) at an annual rate of $170,000, $85,000 of which is paid in cash and $85,000 of which is paid in the form of our ordinary shares at the then-current market price, issued under the Adient plc 2016 Director Share Plan, and to indicate that the Lead Director fee will be paid only during periods in which we have a Lead Director. 
We pay the cash retainer fee and committee chair fee, and we issue the ordinary share portion of the annual retainer, in advance at or as soon as practicable after, the date of each annual general meeting of shareholders, subject to exceptions described in our Non-Employee Directors Compensation Summary and Ownership Guidelines. We paid the Lead Director fee at the time of the 2018 Annual General Meeting, and we intend to pay the Board Chair fee at the time of the Annual General Meeting. We also paid a pro rata portion of the Board Chair fee to Mr. Henderson following his appointment as our independent Board Chair in fiscal year 2019. In addition to providing the retainers described above, we reimburse non-employee directors for any reasonable expenses relating to their service as directors. Non-employee directors do not receive any additional meeting fees for attendance at meetings of the Board or its committees. A director who is also an employee of Adient receives no additional remuneration for services as a director of Adient, although Mr. Henderson was permitted to retain his previously paid annual retainer during his service as interim CEO because he continued to serve on the Board. Mr. Henderson repaid a prorated portion of the committee chair fee he received at the time of the 2018 Annual General Meeting with respect to his service as chair of the Corporate Governance Committee for the period of October 1, 2018 to March 11, 2019 because he did not serve in that role following his appointment as our Non-Executive Chair in fiscal year 2019. 
We maintain a director share ownership policy that requires our directors to hold significant amounts of our ordinary shares. Our current share ownership policy requires our directors to hold an amount of Adient ordinary shares equal to five times the annual cash retainer within five years of their election or appointment to the Board. All of our directors either hold sufficient shares to comply with the share ownership policy guidelines or have additional time to acquire sufficient shares.

(1) Amounts shown in this column reflect the cash portion of the annual retainer and the committee chair and Lead Director fees earned for service during fiscal year 2018. Because we paid these amounts quarterly in arrears until our 2018 Annual   General Meeting, at which time we transitioned to paying them annually in advance as described in the narrative preceding the table, these amounts for fiscal year 2018 include (i) a full payment for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, (ii) a pro rata quarterly payment for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 through the date of the 2018 Annual General Meeting and (iii) the portion of the full year payments made at the time of the 2018 Annual General Meeting attributable to services performed during fiscal year 2018. For Mr. Carlin, the amount reflects the portion of his pro rata payment made in connection with his election to the Board attributable to services performed during fiscal year 2018. The Lead Director did not receive any committee chairperson fees described above. 
(2) Amounts shown in this column reflect the aggregate grant date fair value of stock awards computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. The equity grant portion of the regular annual retainer was granted on March 12, 2018 with a stock price of $61.65. 
(3) Mr. Barth did not receive any additional fees during his service as interim Chair, but retained his previously paid Lead Director fee. 
(4) In connection with Mr. Carlin's election to the Board, he received a pro rata portion of the $145,000 annual cash retainer and the annual $145,000 retainer that is paid in ordinary shares of Adient. Mr. Carlin's pro rata portion of the annual retainer was granted on August 8, 2018 with a stock price of $54.38. 
(5) During fiscal year 2018, Mr. Henderson served as a non-employee director and Chair of the Corporate Governance Committee until his appointment as the interim Chief Executive Officer of Adient in June 2018. Mr. Henderson retained his previously paid annual retainer while serving as the interim CEO of Adient. The director compensation paid to him in fiscal year 2018 is reported along with his other compensation in the Summary Compensation Table.

These amounts do not represent voting rights and are not included in the amounts in the "Ordinary Shares Beneficially Owned" column. 
(3) Reflects ownership information based on the Form 4 filed by Mr. McDonald with the SEC on November 29, 2017, which was the last Form 4 filed prior to Mr. McDonald's retirement on September 30, 2018, and subsequent transactions through September 30, 2018 of which Adient is aware. 
(4) Reflects ownership information based on the Form 4 filed by Mr. Mitchell with the SEC on November 21, 2017, which was the last Form 4 filed before Mr. Mitchell left Adient's employment on July 15, 2018, and subsequent transactions through July 15, 2018 of which Adient is aware. 
SECTION 16(a) BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP REPORTING COMPLIANCE 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires that our directors and certain of our officers file reports of ownership and changes of ownership of our ordinary shares with the SEC and the NYSE. We believe that during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 our officers and directors complied with all such filing requirements except for one Form 4 filed late for Mr. McDonald to report a transaction under our deferred compensation plan because of an administrative error.
