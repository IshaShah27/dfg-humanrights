at Resorts World Catskills 
888 Resorts World Drive 
Monticello, New York 12701 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THESE PROXY MATERIALS 
Why am I receiving these materials? 
The Company has made these materials available to you on the Internet or, upon your request, has delivered printed versions of these materials to you by mail, in connection with the Company's solicitation of proxies for use at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on Monday, May 6, 2019, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Daylight Time, at Resorts World Catskills, located at 888 Resorts World Drive, Monticello, New York 12701, and at any postponement(s) or adjournment(s) thereof. These materials are first being sent or given to stockholders on or about March 25, 2019. This proxy statement gives you information on the proposals to be presented at the Annual Meeting so that you can make an informed decision. 
In this proxy statement, we refer to Empire Resorts, Inc. as the "Company," "we," "us" or "our." 
What is included in these materials? 
These materials include: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• This Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting; and  
• The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended  December 31, 2018, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on March 15, 2019 (the "Annual Report").  
[END TABLE]
If you requested printed versions of these proxy materials by mail, these materials also include the proxy card or voting instruction form for the Annual Meeting. 
Why did I receive a one-page notice in the mail regarding the Internet availability of proxy materials instead of a full set of proxy materials? 
Pursuant to rules adopted by the SEC, the Company has elected to provide access to its proxy materials via the Internet instead of mailing printed copies. Accordingly, the Company is sending a Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials (the "Internet Availability Notice") to the Company's stockholders. Most stockholders will not receive printed copies of the proxy materials   unless they request them. Instead, instructions on how to access the proxy materials over the Internet or to request a printed copy may be found in the Internet Availability Notice. All stockholders will have the ability to access the proxy materials on the website referred to in the Internet Availability Notice or request to receive a printed or electronic set of the proxy materials. Stockholders may request to receive proxy materials in printed form or electronically by email, by telephone, mail or by logging on to http://www.cstproxy.com/empireresorts/2019. The Company encourages stockholders to take advantage of the availability of the proxy materials on the Internet to help reduce the environmental impact of our annual meetings. 
How can I get electronic access to the proxy materials? 
The Internet Availability Notice will provide you with instructions regarding how to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• View the Company's proxy materials for the Annual Meeting on the Internet; and  
• Instruct the Company to send future proxy materials to you electronically by email.  
[END TABLE]
Choosing to receive future proxy materials by email will save the Company the cost of printing and mailing documents to you and will reduce the impact of the Company's annual meetings on the environment. If you choose to receive future proxy materials by email, you will receive an email message next year with instructions containing a link to those materials. Your election to receive proxy materials by email will remain in effect until you terminate it. 
What items of business will be voted on at the Annual Meeting? 
The items of business scheduled to be voted on at the Annual Meeting are: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
  1.  To elect seven directors to serve on the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") until the  2020 annual meeting of stockholders or until their successors are elected and qualified;  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
  2.  To ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public  accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019;

[END TABLE]
How does the Board of Directors recommend that I vote? 
Election of Directors 
Our Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" each of the nominees for director.  Ratification of Ernst & Young LLP 
Our Board unanimously recommends that the stockholders vote "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. 
Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
Our Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" the approval of our 2018 executive compensation. 
Frequency of Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation 
Our Board unanimously recommends that stockholders vote "THREE YEARS" on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Who can vote at the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders? 
Stockholders who owned shares of our common stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"), Series B Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Series B Preferred Stock") or Series F Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ("Series F Preferred Stock," and collectively with the Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the "Voting Stock") on March 13, 2019 (the "Record Date") may attend and vote at the Annual Meeting. 
How many votes am I entitled to per share? 
Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to fifty-four thousandths (.054) of one vote, and each share of Series F Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to 5,000 votes. There were 34,423,250 shares of Common Stock, 44,258 shares of Series B Preferred Stock and 320 shares of Series F Preferred Stock outstanding on the Record Date. All Voting Stock votes together as a single class. Information about the stock holdings of our directors and executive officers is contained in the section of this proxy statement entitled "Other Information—Principal Stockholders" on page 39 of this proxy statement. 
What is the difference between a stockholder of record and a beneficial owner of shares held in street name? 
Stockholder of Record. If your shares are registered directly in your name with the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, you are considered the stockholder of record with respect to those shares, and the Internet Availability Notice was sent directly to you by the Company. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a proxy card. 
Beneficial Owner of Shares Held in Street Name. If your shares are held in an account at a brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization, then you are the beneficial owner of shares held in "street name," and the Internet Availability Notice was forwarded to you by that organization. The organization holding your account is considered the stockholder of record for purposes of voting at the Annual Meeting. As a beneficial owner, you have the right to instruct that organization on how to vote the shares held in your account. Those instructions are contained in a "voting instruction form." If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you will receive a voting instruction form.  If I am a stockholder of record of the Company's Voting Stock, how do I vote? 
There are three ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. If you are a stockholder of record, you may vote in person at the Annual Meeting. The Company  will give you a ballot when you arrive if you have not previously sent in your proxy.  
• Via the Internet. You may vote by proxy via the Internet by following the instructions provided with the  Internet Availability Notice.  
• By Mail. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by filling  out the proxy card and sending it back in the envelope provided.  
[END TABLE]
Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is strongly recommended you vote by proxy via the Internet or complete and return your proxy card before the Annual Meeting date just in case your plans change. 
If I am a beneficial owner of shares held in street name, how do I vote? 
There are three ways to vote: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• In person. If you are a beneficial owner of shares held in street name and you wish to vote in person at  the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from the brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares. Please contact that organization for instructions regarding obtaining a legal proxy.   
• Via the Internet. You may vote by proxy via the Internet by following the instructions provided by your  brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares.  
• By Mail. If you request printed copies of the proxy materials by mail, you may vote by proxy by filling  out the voting instruction form and sending it back in the envelope provided by your brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer or other similar organization that holds your shares.  
[END TABLE]
What is the proxy? 
The vote by proxy via the Internet and the vote by proxy card each enable you to appoint each of Ryan Eller, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Emanuel R. Pearlman, the Executive Chairman of our Board, as your representatives at the Annual Meeting. By voting by proxy via the Internet or completing and returning the proxy card, you are authorizing these persons to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in accordance with your instructions. This way your shares will be voted whether or not you attend the Annual Meeting. Even if you plan to attend the Annual Meeting, it is strongly recommended you vote by proxy via the Internet or complete and return your proxy card before the Annual Meeting date just in case your plans change. If a proposal comes up for vote at the Annual Meeting that is not listed on the Internet or on the proxy card, the proxies will vote your shares, under your proxy, according to their best judgment. 
I share an address with another stockholder and we received only one paper copy of the proxy materials. How may I obtain an additional copy of the proxy materials? 
We have adopted a procedure called "householding," which the SEC has approved. Under this procedure, we deliver a single copy of the Internet Availability Notice and, if applicable, the proxy   materials to multiple stockholders who share the same address unless we receive contrary instructions from one or more of the stockholders. This procedure reduces our printing costs, mailing costs, and fees. Stockholders who participate in householding will continue to be able to access and receive separate proxy cards. Upon written request, we will deliver promptly a separate copy of the Internet Availability Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials to any stockholder at a shared address to which we delivered a single copy of any of these documents. To receive a separate copy of the Internet Availability Notice and, if applicable, the proxy materials, stockholders may contact us as follows: 
Empire Resorts, Inc. 
c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway 
204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013 
Monticello, New York 12701 
Attention: Secretary 
Stockholders who hold shares in street name (as described below) may contact their brokerage firm, bank, broker-dealer, or other similar organization to request information about householding. 
How do I request a paper copy of the proxy materials? 
There are four ways to request a paper copy of proxy materials: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• By mail: You may obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials by writing to us at Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o  Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701, Attn: Secretary.  
• By telephone: You may obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials by calling 1-888-221-0691.   
• Via the Internet: You may obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials by logging on to  http://www.cstproxy.com/empireresorts/2019  
• By Email: You may obtain a paper copy of the proxy materials by email at proxy@continentalstock.com.   
[END TABLE]
Please make your request for a paper copy as instructed above on or before April 19, 2019 to facilitate timely delivery. 
Can I change my vote after I have voted? 
You may revoke your proxy and change your vote at any time before the final vote on each proposal at the Annual Meeting. You may vote again on a later date via the Internet (in which case only your latest Internet proxy submitted prior to the Annual Meeting will be counted), by signing and returning a new proxy card or voting instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person if you are a stockholder of record. However, your attendance at the Annual Meeting will not automatically revoke your proxy unless you vote again at the Annual Meeting or specifically request that your prior proxy be revoked by delivering to the Company's Secretary, at c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701, a written notice of revocation prior to the Annual Meeting. 
Please note, however, that if your shares are held of record by a brokerage firm, bank or other nominee, you must instruct your broker, bank or other nominee that you wish to change your vote by following the procedures on the voting instruction form provided to you by the broker, bank or other   nominee. If your shares are held in street name, and you wish to attend the Annual Meeting and vote at the Annual Meeting, you must bring to the Annual Meeting a legal proxy from the broker, bank or other nominee holding your shares, confirming your beneficial ownership of the shares and giving you the right to vote your shares. 
How many shares must be present or represented to conduct business at the Annual Meeting? 
The quorum requirement for holding the Annual Meeting and transacting business is that holders of a majority of the Voting Stock outstanding as of the Record Date must be present in person or represented by proxy. "Broker non-votes," which are described below, and abstentions are counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum. 
How are votes counted? 
You may vote "for," "against," or "abstain" on each of the first three proposals being placed before our stockholders and may vote "one year," "two years," "three years" or "abstain" in the case of the proposal to determine the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation. If you provide specific instructions with regard to certain items, your shares will be voted as you instruct on such items. 
If you hold shares beneficially in street name and do not provide your broker with voting instructions, your shares may constitute "broker non-votes." Broker non-votes occur when brokers or others hold shares in street name for a beneficial owner that has not provided instructions on how to vote on a particular matter. Matters on which a broker is not permitted to vote without instructions from the beneficial owner and instructions are not given are referred to as "non-routine" matters. The election of directors, advisory vote to approve 2018 executive compensation and vote on the frequency of when to hold such advisory vote on executive compensation are "non-routine." In tabulating the voting result for the election of directors, the advisory vote to approve executive compensation and the advisory vote to approve the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, shares that constitute broker non-votes and abstentions are not considered votes cast. The ratification of auditors is "routine." In tabulating the voting results for the ratification of auditors, broker non-votes are considered votes cast. 
How many votes are required to approve each of the proposals? 
Election of Directors 
Seven directors are nominated for election to the Board to serve for the next year and until their respective successors are elected and qualified. The seven persons receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Annual Meeting voting as one class will be elected. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of the election. 
Ratification of Ernst & Young LLP 
The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of the proposal to   ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP. In tabulating the voting results for the ratification of auditors, broker non-votes are considered votes cast and therefore will have an effect on the outcome of such proposal. 
Advisory Vote on 2018 Executive Compensation 
The non-binding approval of the advisory vote on our 2018 executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Annual Meeting voting as one class. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are not considered "votes cast," will reduce the absolute number, but not the overall percentage, of affirmative votes required to approve the advisory vote on executive compensation. Therefore, in tabulating the voting results for the advisory vote on executive compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. 
Frequency of Advisory Votes on Executive Compensation 
In the case of the proposal to determine the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, the frequency that receives the highest number of votes cast will be deemed to be the frequency selected by stockholders. In tabulating the voting results for the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. 
Will my shares be voted if I do not sign and return my proxy card? 
If your shares are held in street name or in your name and you do not vote by proxy via the Internet or sign and return your proxy card, your shares will not be voted unless you vote in person at the Annual Meeting. 
What happens if I do not indicate how to vote my proxy? 
If you just sign your proxy card without providing further instructions, your shares will be voted "FOR" for all the director nominees, "FOR" the ratification of appointment of the Company's independent auditor and "THREE YEARS" on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Is my vote kept confidential? 
Proxies, ballots and voting tabulations identifying stockholders are kept confidential and will not be disclosed except as may be necessary to meet legal requirements. 
Where do I find the voting results of the Annual Meeting? 
We will announce voting results at the Annual Meeting. The final voting results will be tallied by the inspector of election and published in a Current Report on Form 8-K, which the Company is required to file with the SEC within four business days following the Annual Meeting.

Record Date, Voting and Quorum 
Our Board fixed the close of business on March 13, 2019, as the Record Date for the determination of holders of our outstanding Voting Stock entitled to notice of and to vote on all matters presented at the Annual Meeting. As of the record date, there were 34,423,250 shares of Common Stock, 44,258 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and 320 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to fifty-four thousandths (.054) of one vote, and each share of Series F Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to 5,000 votes. Accordingly, a total of 36,025,640 votes may be cast at the Annual Meeting. 
The holders of Voting Stock entitled to cast a majority of all votes that could be cast by the holders of all of the outstanding Voting Stock, present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting, constitute a quorum. 
Required Vote 
The seven persons receiving the highest number of affirmative votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote thereon at the Annual Meeting voting as one class will be elected to the Board. Abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal.  The ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on such proposal. Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. Such proposal is a "routine" matter on which brokers and nominees can vote on behalf of their clients if clients do not furnish voting instructions, therefore broker non-votes will have an effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
The approval on an advisory basis of our 2018 executive compensation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote on this matter at the Annual Meeting. In the case of the proposal to determine the frequency of future stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation, the frequency that receives the highest number of votes cast will be deemed to be the frequency selected by stockholders. Such proposals are "non-routine" matters on which brokers and nominees cannot vote on behalf of their clients if clients do not furnish voting instructions, therefore broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of these proposals. Abstentions and broker non-votes, which are not considered "votes cast," will reduce the absolute number, but not the overall percentage, of affirmative votes required to approve the advisory vote on executive compensation and will have no effect on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Voting 
You can vote your shares at the Annual Meeting by proxy or in person. 
You can vote by proxy by having one or more individuals who will be at the Annual Meeting vote your shares for you. These individuals are called "proxies" and using them to cast your ballot at the Annual Meeting is called voting "by proxy." If you wish to vote by proxy, you must do one of the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Use the Internet to vote by going to the Internet address listed on your proxy card or Internet Availability  Notice;  
  ¡     Have your proxy card or Internet Availability Notice in hand as you will be prompted to enter your control number  and to create and submit an electronic vote; or  
• Complete the enclosed form, called a "proxy card," and mail it in the envelope provided.   
[END TABLE]
If you do one of the above, you will designate each of our President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Chairman of the Board to act as your proxies at the Annual Meeting. One of them will then vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in accordance with the instructions you have given them via the Internet or on the proxy card with respect to the election of directors. Proxies will extend to, and be voted at, any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) of the Annual Meeting. 
Alternatively, you can vote your shares in person by attending the Annual Meeting. You will be given a ballot at the Annual Meeting. 
While we know of no other matters to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting, it is possible that other matters may be presented at the Annual Meeting. If that happens and you have voted via the Internet or signed a proxy card, and not revoked your proxy, your proxy will vote on such other matters in accordance with your proxies' best judgment.  A special note for those who plan to attend the Annual Meeting and vote in person: if your shares are held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee, you must bring a statement from your brokerage account or a letter from the person or entity in whose name the shares are registered indicating that you are the beneficial owner of those shares as of the Record Date. In addition, you will not be able to vote at the Annual Meeting unless you obtain a legal proxy from the record holder of your shares. 
Our Board is asking for your proxy. Giving the Board your proxy means you authorize it to vote your shares at the Annual Meeting in the manner you direct. You may vote for or withhold your vote for each nominee or the other proposals to be submitted at the Annual Meeting or you may abstain from voting. All valid proxies received prior to the Annual Meeting will be voted. All shares represented by a proxy will be voted, and where a stockholder specifies by means of the proxy a choice with respect to any matter to be acted upon, the shares will be voted in accordance with the specification so made. If no choice is indicated on the proxy, the shares will be voted "FOR" the election of each nominee for Director, "FOR" the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, "FOR" the approval of our 2018 executive compensation, and "THREE YEARS" on the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation. 
Stockholders who have questions or need assistance in completing or submitting their proxy cards should contact Nanette L. Horner, Secretary of the Company, at (845) 807-0001. 
Stockholders who hold their shares in "street name," meaning the name of a broker or other nominee who is the record holder, must either direct the record holder of their shares to vote their shares or obtain a proxy or voting instruction form from the record holder to vote their shares at the Annual Meeting. 
Revocability of Proxies 
Any proxy may be revoked by the person giving it at any time before the polls close at the Annual Meeting. A proxy may be revoked by filing with our Secretary (Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701) either (i) a written notice of revocation bearing a date later than the date of such proxy or (ii) a subsequent proxy relating to the same shares, or (iii) by attending the Annual Meeting and voting in person. 
Simply attending the Annual Meeting will not constitute revocation of your proxy. If your shares are held in the name of a broker or other nominee who is the record holder, you must follow the instruction of your broker or other nominee to revoke a previously given proxy. 
Attendance at the Annual Meeting 
Only holders of Voting Stock, their proxy holders and guests may attend the Annual Meeting. If you wish to attend the Annual Meeting in person but you hold your shares through someone else, such as a broker, you must bring proof of your ownership and identification with photo identification at the Annual Meeting. For example, you may bring an account statement showing that you beneficially owned Voting Stock as of the Record Date as acceptable proof of ownership. 
Solicitation of Proxies and Expenses 
The cost of preparing, assembling, printing and mailing this proxy statement and the accompanying form of proxy, and the cost of soliciting proxies relating to the Annual Meeting, will be   borne by the Company. Some banks and brokers have customers who beneficially own Voting Stock listed of record in the names of nominees. We intend to request banks and brokers to solicit such customers and will reimburse them for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses for such solicitations. If any additional solicitation of the holders of our outstanding shares of Voting Stock is deemed necessary, we (through our directors and officers) anticipate making such solicitation directly. The solicitation of proxies by mail may be supplemented by telephone, email and personal solicitation by officers, directors and regular employees of the Company, but no additional compensation will be paid to such individuals. 
No Right of Appraisal 
None of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation nor our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for appraisal or other similar rights for dissenting stockholders in connection with the election of directors, the ratification of the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, the non-binding advisory vote on the Company's 2018 executive compensation and the non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on the Company's executive compensation. Accordingly, our stockholders will have no right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares. 
Other Business 
We are not currently aware of any business to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting other than the election of directors, ratification of Ernst & Young LLP, non-binding advisory vote on our 2018 executive compensation and non-binding advisory vote on the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, which are discussed in this proxy statement. The form of proxy accompanying this proxy statement confers discretionary authority upon the named proxy holders with respect to amendments or variations to the matters identified in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting and with respect to any other matters which may properly come before the Annual Meeting. If other matters do properly come before the Annual Meeting, or at any adjournment(s) or postponement(s) of the Annual Meeting, shares of our Voting Stock, represented by properly submitted proxies, will be voted by the proxy holders in accordance with the recommendations of

Corporate Governance 
Director Independence 
The Board evaluates the independence of each nominee for election as a director of our Company in accordance with the Listing Rules (the "Nasdaq Listing Rules") of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC ("Nasdaq"). Pursuant to these rules, a majority of our Board must be "independent directors" within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules, and all directors who sit on our Audit Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and Compensation Committee must also be independent directors. 
The Nasdaq definition of "independence" includes a series of objective tests, such as the director or director nominee is not, and was not during the last three years, an employee of the Company and has not received certain payments from, or engaged in various types of business dealings with, the Company. In addition, as further required by the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Board has made a subjective determination as to each independent director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of the Board, would interfere with such individual's exercise of independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities as a director. In making these determinations, the Board reviewed and discussed information provided by the directors with regard to each director's business and personal activities as they may relate to Company and its management. 
As a result, the Board has affirmatively determined that none of our directors or director nominees has a material relationship with the Company other than Messrs. Eller, Lim and Pearlman. The Board has also affirmatively determined that all members of our Audit Committee, Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and Compensation Committee are independent directors. 
Meetings of the Board and Committees 
The Board met on 15 occasions during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 with one unanimous written consent. Each of the members of the Board in 2018 attended at least 93% of the meetings held by the Board during the time such directors served as a member of the Board.
There are five committees of the Board: the Audit Committee, the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Regulatory Compliance Committee and the Strategic Development Committee.  Our last annual meeting of stockholders was held on November 5, 2018, and all members of our Board in 2018 attended that meeting.

The Audit Committee currently consists of Messrs. Horn and Polle and Ms. Palumbo, each of whom is independent within the meaning of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

Mr. Horn serves as chairperson of the Audit Committee. 
The primary purpose of the Audit Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibility to oversee our financial reporting activities.

More specifically, the Compensation Committee has sole authority to determine the Chief Executive Officer's compensation level, which is subject to ratification by the Company's independent directors. In determining the long-term incentive component of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation, the Compensation Committee considers, among other factors, the Company's performance and relative stockholder return, the value of similar incentive awards to chief executive officers at comparable companies, the awards given to the Chief Executive Officer in past years, and such other factors as the Compensation Committee may determine to be appropriate. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation of all other officers of the Company. The Compensation Committee may invite the Company's Chief Executive Officer to participate in meetings of the Compensation Committee relating to discussions other than his compensation, but if present during any deliberations of the Committee, the Chief Executive Officer may not vote. The Compensation Committee also reviews and approves any severance or similar termination payments proposed to be made to any current or former executive officer. 
The Compensation Committee has the authority to directly engage, at our expense, any compensation consultants or other advisers as it deems necessary to assist in the evaluation of director, Chief Executive Officer or executive officer compensation. The Compensation Committee did not engage any advisory firm as a compensation consultant in fiscal 2018.

Audit Committee Report* 
The Audit Committee has reviewed and discussed our audited financial statements with management, and has discussed with our independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended (Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, AU 380), as adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight   Board (the "PCAOB") in Rule 3200T. Additionally, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from our independent registered public accounting firm, as required by the applicable requirements of the PCAOB, and has discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the independent registered public accounting firm's independence. Based upon such review and discussion, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board that the audited financial statements for the last fiscal year be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for filing with the SEC.

Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight 
Although we do not require separation of the offices of the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, we currently have a different person serving in each such role—Mr. Pearlman is our Executive Chairman, and Mr. Eller is our President and Chief Executive Officer. The decision whether to combine or separate these positions depends on what our Board deems to be in the long-term interest of stockholders in light of prevailing circumstances. Mr. Pearlman served as non-executive Chairman of the Board since September 8, 2010 and has served as Executive Chairman of the Board since June 1, 2016. Mr. Eller served as our President and Chief Operating Officer from March 2017 to June 2017. Since June 2017, Mr. Eller has served as our President and Chief Executive Officer. This arrangement has and will continue to allow our Executive Chairman to lead the Board, while our Chief Executive Officer focuses primarily on managing the operations of the Company. The separation of duties provides strong leadership for the Board while allowing the Chief Executive Officer to be the leader of the Company, focusing on its customers, employees, and operations. Our Board believes the Company is well-served by this flexible leadership structure and that the combination or separation of these positions should continue to be considered on an ongoing basis. 
Pursuant to that certain investment agreement, dated November 12, 2009 (the "Investment Agreement"), between the Company and Kien Huat, our largest stockholder, Kien Huat is entitled to recommend three nominees, whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board, subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of the Board, for so long as Kien Huat maintains ownership of at least 24% of the voting power of our capital stock outstanding at such time. For as long as Kien Huat is entitled to designate nominees for directors to the Board, it will have the right to nominate one of its nominees elected to serve as a director to serve as Chairman of the Board. Each of Messrs. Lim, Eller and Pearlman were designated as nominees by Kien Huat pursuant to this right. In addition, for so long as Kien Huat owns capital stock with at least 30% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock outstanding at such time, certain decisions   made by the Board relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters require the approval of the directors designated for nomination by Kien Huat. We believe that this arrangement is an appropriate reflection of the Company's underlying ownership structure. 
The Board is actively involved in overseeing our risk management processes. The Board focuses on our general risk management strategy and ensures that appropriate risk mitigation strategies are implemented by management. Further, operational and strategic presentations by management to the Board include consideration of the challenges and risks of our businesses, and the Board and management actively engage in discussion on these topics. In addition, each of the Board's committees considers risk within its area of responsibility. For example, the Audit Committee provides oversight to legal and compliance matters and assesses the adequacy of our risk-related internal controls. The Compensation Committee considers risk and structures our executive compensation programs to provide incentives to reward appropriately executives for growth without undue risk taking. 
Consideration of Director Nominees 
Stockholder Recommendations and Nominees 
The policy of our Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee is to consider properly submitted recommendations for candidates to the Board from stockholders. Any stockholder recommendations for consideration by the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee should include the candidate's name, biographical information, information regarding any relationships between the candidate and the Company within the last three years, a description of all arrangements between the candidate and the recommending stockholder and any other person pursuant to which the candidate is being recommended, a written indication of the candidate's willingness to serve on the Board, any other information required to be provided under securities laws and regulations, and a written indication to provide such other information as the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may reasonably request. There are no differences in the manner in which the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates nominees for director based on whether the nominee is recommended by a stockholder or otherwise. Stockholder recommendations to the Board should be sent to: 
Empire Resorts, Inc. 
c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway 
204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013 
Monticello, New York, 12701 
Attention: Secretary 
In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws permit stockholders to nominate directors for consideration at an annual meeting of stockholders. Stockholders wishing to nominate a candidate for director at the annual meeting of stockholders must give written notice to Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York, 12701, Attention: Secretary, either by personal delivery or by United States mail, postage prepaid. The stockholder's notice must be received by us not less than 120 or more than 180 days prior to the first anniversary (the "Anniversary") of the date on which we first mailed our proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders. However, if the date of the annual meeting of stockholders is advanced more than 30 days prior to or delayed by more than 30 days after the Anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders, then, to be timely, notice by the stockholder must be delivered not later than the close of business on the later of (i) the 90th day prior   to such annual meeting of stockholders or (ii) the 15th day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. To be in proper form, a stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall be in writing and shall set forth (i) the name and address of the stockholder who intends to make the nomination(s) and of the person or persons to be nominated, (ii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of record of stock of the Company, that the stockholder intends to vote such stock at such annual meeting of stockholders and intends to appear in person or by proxy at the annual meeting of stockholders to nominate the person or persons specified in the notice, (iii) a description of all arrangements or understandings between the stockholder and each nominee or any other person or persons (naming such person or persons) pursuant to which the nomination or nominations are to be made by the stockholder, (iv) such other information regarding each nominee as would be required to be included in a proxy statement filed pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, had the nominee been nominated, or intended to be nominated, by the Board, (v) the class and number of shares of capital stock that are owned of record and beneficially owned by the stockholder and (vi) the written consent of each nominee to serve as a director of the Company if so elected. 
Because the date of the 2019 Annual Meeting was changed by more than 30 days from the date of the 2018 annual meeting of stockholders, stockholders of the Company who wished to nominate a person for election as a director or propose business to be brought before the 2019 Annual Meeting had to have submitted written notice of such nomination or proposed business, as the case may be, was received by the Company's Secretary at Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701 on or before the close of business on February 5, 2019, which the Company announced on a Current Report on Form 8-K as filed on January 7, 2019.  
Director Qualifications 
The Board believes that all directors should have the highest personal integrity and have a record of exceptional ability and judgment. The Board also believes that directors should ideally reflect a mix of experience and other qualifications. There is no firm requirement of minimum qualifications or skills that candidates must possess. The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee evaluates director candidates based on a number of qualifications, including their independence, judgment, leadership ability, expertise in the industry, experience developing and analyzing business strategies, financial literacy, risk management skills, and, for incumbent directors, his or her past performance. While neither the Board nor the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee has adopted a formal policy with regard to the consideration of diversity when evaluating candidates for election to the Board, it is our goal to have a balanced Board, with members whose skills, background and experience are complimentary and, together, cover the variety of areas that impact our business. 
The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee initially evaluates a prospective nominee on the basis of his or her resume and other background information that has been made available to the committee. A member of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee will contact for further review those candidates who the committee believes are qualified, who may fulfill a specific board need and who would otherwise best make a contribution to the Board. If, after further discussions with the candidate, and other further review and consideration as necessary, the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee believes that it has identified a qualified candidate, it will make a recommendation to the Board.  Code of Business Conduct and Ethics 
We adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, applicable to all employees, and a Code of Ethics for the Principal Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officer(s), each of which is available on our Website (www.empireresorts.com) and will be provided in print without charge to any stockholder who submits a request in writing to Empire Resorts, Inc., Investor Relations, c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701. Any amendment to and waivers from the Code of Ethics with respect to the Company's Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer will be posted on the Company's Website. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics provides that any waiver thereof may be made only by the Board or, in cases not involving an executive officer or member of the Board, by the Company's Chief Compliance Officer. 
Procedures for Contacting Directors 
The Board has established a process for stockholders to send communications to the Board. Stockholders may communicate with the Board generally or a specific director at any time by writing to: Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York, 12701, Attention: Investor Relations. We review all messages received, and forward any message that reasonably appears to be a communication from a stockholder about a matter of stockholder interest that is intended for communication to the Board. Communications are sent as soon as practicable to the director to whom they are addressed, or if addressed to the Board generally, to the Chairman of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee. Because other appropriate avenues of communication exist for matters that are not of stockholder interest, such as general business complaints or employee grievances, communications that do not relate to matters of stockholder interest are not forwarded to the Board.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis 
Objectives of Our Compensation Program 
Our compensation programs are intended to encourage executives and other key personnel to create sustainable growth in value for our stockholders. In particular, the objectives of our programs are to: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• attract, retain, and motivate superior talent;  
• ensure that compensation is commensurate with our performance and stockholder returns;  
• provide performance awards for the achievement of strategic objectives that are critical to our long-term growth;  and  
• ensure that our executive officers and key personnel have financial incentives to achieve sustainable growth in  stockholder value.  
[END TABLE]
Executive Compensation Decisions—The Role of the Compensation Committee, the Chief Executive Officer and Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation 
The Compensation Committee is responsible for evaluating and approving the compensation of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee considers recommendations from our President and Chief Executive Officer with respect to executive compensation matters, except regarding his own compensation. Although the advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation is non-binding, the Committee has considered, and will continue to consider, the outcome of this vote when making compensation decisions for our Chief Executive Officer and other "named executive officers" as defined in item 402(a)(3) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act ("Named Executive Officers"). At our annual meeting of shareholders held on November 1, 2016, approximately 99.8% of the shareholders who voted on the "say-on-pay" proposal approved the compensation of our Named Executive Officers. At our annual meeting of shareholders held on November 11, 2013, the Company's shareholders approved, on an advisory basis, a frequency of every three years for future votes on executive compensation. Thus, the Company is holding a vote on such matters at the Annual Meeting. 
Our Executive Compensation Program and Risk 
We do not believe that our compensation programs are structured to reward inappropriate risk-taking, and have concluded that our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect on our businesses, for several reasons, including the following: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• We provide a mix of variable performance-based annual cash compensation (at the discretion our Compensation  Committee), fixed cash compensation in the form of base salaries, and long-term equity compensation in the form of equity awards. We believe this combination of variable and fixed cash compensation and a long-term equity interest which vest over  time, provides appropriate incentives and rewards management while at the same time encourages appropriate-but not excessive-levels of risk assumption.  
• The design of our compensation programs, including with respect to the variety of performance criteria  established under our plans, encourages executives to remain focused on both the short-term and long-term success of the Company's operational and development objectives; as a result, any incentive to take short-term risks is mitigated by the  necessity for us to achieve success and maintain shareholder value over the long-term. In this regard, a portion  
[END TABLE]
[BEGIN TABLE]
     of compensation is delivered to executives in the form of an annual bonus as well as equity grants, and a portion of the compensation of our senior executives is based on meeting longer term  goals.  
• A portion of compensation to our senior executives is delivered through the use of equity awards, which generally  vest in equal annual installments over a three-year period. The Compensation Committee believes that these equity incentive awards focus our executives on the long-term success of the Company, align their interests with those of our shareholders  and, because of the multi-year vesting feature, subject management to the long-term consequences of risks undertaken to achieve short-term objectives.  
[END TABLE]
Determination of Compensation Levels 
In setting compensation levels, including bonus for our senior executives and the mix of compensation for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee considered several factors. These include cash bonuses based on the Company's results of operations of the casino at Resorts World Catskills, as well as the progress with the planning and design of the Company's development projects, including a 101-room lifestyle hotel called The Alder and the golf course still under development, existing employment agreements with individual executives, the desire to motivate the executives and align the compensation of the executives with the financial performance of the Company by providing incentives, and the Compensation Committee's subjective assessment of the individual's experience, responsibilities, management, leadership abilities and job performance. The Compensation Committee has, from time to time, used focused marketplace compensation analysis and reviewed compensation levels at companies of similar type and size for comparison purposes in connection with the recruitment and retention of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee did not engage any advisory firm as a compensation consultant in fiscal 2018. 
Elements of Our Executive Compensation Structure 
Our compensation structure consists of two tiers of remuneration. The first tier consists of base pay, and retirement, health, and welfare benefits. The second tier consists of both short and long-term incentive compensation. 
Base Pay 
Base compensation for each of our Named Executive Officers, other than Mr. Pearlman, has been established pursuant to their respective employment agreements with the Company. Base pay and benefits are designed to be sufficiently competitive to attract and retain world class executives. In the past, the Compensation Committee has retained the discretion to review Named Executive Officers' base pay, and to make increases based on executive performance and market norms. In January 2018 and March 2018, the Compensation Committee took action to increase the base salaries of Ms. Horner and Mr. Pearlman, respectively. The Compensation Committee has also recommended increases when executives have been promoted, or their responsibilities have otherwise been expanded. 
Mr. Pearlman receives an annual base salary of $682,500. Pursuant to Mr. Eller's employment agreement, Mr. Eller receives on annual base salary of $600,000. Pursuant to Ms. Horner's employment agreement, Ms. Horner receives an annual base salary of $300,000. Pursuant to Mr. Sanko's employment agreement, through December 31, 2018, Mr. Sanko received an annual base salary of $250,000. From January 1, 2019 through the remainder of the term of his employment agreement, Mr. Sanko receives an annual base salary of $400,000. Pursuant to Mr. Kline's employment agreement, Mr. Kline receives an annual base salary of $400,000.  Equity-based Compensation 
Equity-based compensation is designed to provide incentives to our executive officers to build stockholder value over the long-term by aligning their interests with the interest of stockholders. Since 2005, we have granted equity-based awards in the form of restricted stock, options and restricted stock units, as the Compensation Committee determined this was an effective vehicle for the motivation and retention of our executive officers. 
On January 21, 2019, Mr. Pearlman was granted 50,000 restricted stock units ("RSUs") under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, one-third of such RSUs, or 16,666.67 RSUs, will vest annually over the three-year period ending January 21, 2022, subject to Mr. Pearlman's continued employment or service to the Company during that period. The RSUs are subject to immediate vesting in the event of a Change in Control, as such term is defined in the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, subject to Mr. Pearlman's continued employment or service to the Company. In addition, subject to Mr. Pearlman's continued employment with the Company, each vested RSU will be settled on March 21, 2022, which is the third anniversary of the grant date, in cash or shares at the discretion of the Company.

In September 2015, the Board approved and, in November 2015, stockholders approved, the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, pursuant to which any future equity incentive awards will be made to the Named Executive Officers. At March 11, 2019, a total of 2,097,201 shares were available for future issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. 
The Compensation Committee may grant awards of Non-Qualified Stock Options, Incentive Stock Options, Stock Appreciation Rights, Restricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units, Stock Bonus Awards, Performance Compensation Awards (including cash bonus awards) or any combination of the foregoing. 
The Compensation Committee believes that equity-based compensation provides an incentive that focuses the executive's attention on managing our Company from the perspective of an owner with an equity stake in the business. In determining the amount of equity-based compensation to be awarded to our Named Executive Officers, the Compensation Committee takes into consideration, among other things, the level of the officer's responsibility, performance of the officer, other compensation elements and the amount of previous equity grants awarded to the individual. In addition, with respect to recruiting an executive officer to join our Company, the amount of equity consideration may be negotiated to reflect the amount necessary to hire the desired person. The size of such awards would be based on the Compensation Committee view on the prospective officer's potential to have an impact on our profitability, growth and financial position. 
Cash Bonus for Senior Executives 
After the conclusion of fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee held meetings to consider the extent to pay bonuses to senior executives. The 2018 bonuses for the senior executives were discretionary and based primarily upon a subjective analysis by the Compensation Committee of the Company's operational performance and the individual performance of each senior executive. Cash awards were paid in the first quarter of the current fiscal year and are reflected in the Summary Compensation Table below.  Pay Ratio Disclosure 
In August 2015, pursuant to a mandate of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring annual disclosure of the ratio of the median employee's annual total compensation to the total annual compensation of the principal executive officer ("PEO"). The Company's PEO is Mr. Eller. The purpose of the new required disclosure is to provide a measure of the equitability of pay within the organization. 
We identified the median employee by examining the 2018 total cash compensation for all individuals, excluding our Chief Executive Officer, who were employed by us as of December 31, 2018. We included all employees, whether employed on a full-time, part-time, or seasonal basis. We did not make any assumptions, adjustments, or estimates with respect to total cash compensation, and we annualized the compensation for any full-time employees that were not employed by us for all of 2018. We believe the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure because we do not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees. Approximately 1% percent of our employees receive annual equity awards. 
After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, we calculated annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology we use for our Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2018 Summary Compensation Table later in this proxy statement. For simplicity, the value of the Company's 401(k) plan and medical benefits provided was excluded as all employees including the PEO are offered the exact same benefits and the Company utilizes the Internal Revenue Service safe harbor provision for 401(k) discrimination testing. 
As illustrated in the table below, our 2018 PEO to median employee pay ratio is 20.42:1:00. 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Median Employee total annual compensation    $ 31,200   
 Mr. Eller ("PEO") total annual compensation    $ 637,200   
 Ratio of PEO to Median Employee Compensation      20.42 to 1.00

The Compensation Committee believes that the Company's compensation policies and practices do not encourage unnecessary or excessive risk taking and that any risks arising from the Company's compensation policies and practices for its employees are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires our executive officers and directors, and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our Common Stock, to file initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership with the SEC. Executive officers, directors and greater than ten percent beneficial owners are required by SEC regulations to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based upon a review of the copies of such forms furnished to us, we believe that all filings required to be made pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act during the year ended December 31, 2018 were filed in a timely manner.  OTHER INFORMATION 
Principal Stockholders 
The following table sets forth information concerning beneficial ownership of our capital stock outstanding at March 20, 2019, by: (i) each stockholder known to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent of any class of our voting stock then outstanding; (ii) each of our directors and nominees to serve as director; (iii) each of our Named Executive Officers; and (iv) our current directors and executive officers as a group. 
As of March 20, 2019, there were 34,423,250 shares of our Common Stock, 44,258 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, and 320 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and entitled to notice of and to vote on all matters presented to stockholders. Each share of Common Stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote, each share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to fifty-four thousandths (.054) of one vote and each share of Series F Preferred Stock entitles the holder thereof to 5,000 votes. 
The information regarding beneficial ownership of our Voting Stock has been presented in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Under these rules, a person may be deemed to beneficially own any shares of capital stock as to which such person, directly or indirectly, has or shares voting power or investment power, and as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days through the exercise of any stock option or other right. The percentage of beneficial ownership as to any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing (a) (i) the number of shares beneficially owned by such person plus (ii) the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days by (b) the total number of shares outstanding as of such date, plus any shares that such person has the right to acquire from us within 60 days. Including those shares in the tables does not, however, constitute an admission that the named stockholder is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of those shares. Unless otherwise indicated, each person or entity named in the table has sole voting power and investment power (or shares that power with that person's spouse) with respect to all shares of capital stock listed as owned by that person or entity.

 Certain Relationships and Related Transactions 
Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter 
On November 6, 2018, the Company and Kien Huat entered into a commitment letter (as amended and restated on November 9, 2018, (the "2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter"), the Company's largest stockholder, pursuant to which Kien Huat committed to provide equity financing in support of the general corporate and working capital requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
Pursuant to the 2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter, Kien Huat agreed to purchase up to $126 million (the "Commitment Amount") of Series F Preferred Stock of the Company on the terms set forth in the 2018 Kien Huat Preferred Stock Commitment Letter, Kien Huat committed to purchase up to the Commitment Amount of the Series F Preferred Stock pursuant to the following schedule: (i) up to $12 million no earlier than November 9, 2018; (ii) up to $20 million no earlier than February 15, 2019; (iii) up to $20 million no earlier than May 15, 2019; (iv) up to $15 million no earlier than August 15, 2019; (v) up to $37 million no earlier than November 15, 2019; and (vi) up to $22 million no earlier than March 15, 2020. 
The Company agreed to use its reasonable efforts to secure third-party financing in an amount equal to the Commitment Amount, and the Commitment Amount will be reduced by the amount of any third-party financing raised by the Company. However, any equity financing raised by the Company from any person entering into a commercial agreement relating to online gaming and sports betting at Resorts World Catskills in an amount up to $29 million will not reduce the Commitment Amount. 
On November 14, 2018, an affiliate of bet365 Group Limited ("bet365") entered into a common stock purchase agreement (the "bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement") to purchase up to $50 million in shares of common stock of the Company in connection with the Company's collaboration with another bet365 affiliate (the "Collaboration Agreement") to develop a physical and online sportsbook and digital gaming services at Resorts Word Catskills. Approximately $33.7 million (the "bet365 proceeds") of the $50 million was purchased on November 14, 2018, with the balance to acquire at a future date, subject to certain conditions. In accordance with the KH 2018 Preferred Stock Commitment Letter, the Commitment Amount was reduced by the amount of bet365 proceeds exceeding $29 million, from $126 million to $121.28 million. Any future sales to bet365 pursuant to the bet365 Common Stock Purchase Agreement would further reduce the Commitment Amount by such additional amount. 
Kien Huat is entitled to a funding fee in the amount of 1% of the portion of the Commitment Amount funded by Kien Huat at the time of any such funding. Unless earlier terminated by mutual agreement, the KH 2018 Preferred Stock Commitment Letter will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the Company's receipt of third-party financing in the Commitment Amount or (b) April 15, 2020.

On July 5, 2018, the Company borrowed $5 million and, on July 31, 2018, the Company borrowed an additional $5 million. The Company expects to borrow the two remaining installments of $10 million each on or about the scheduled installment dates of September 4, 2018 and September 17, 2018, respectively. The Company paid Kien Huat a commitment fee of $300,000 (or 1% of the principal amount) out of the proceeds of the first advance. 
The Kien Huat Subordinate Loan bears interest at a rate of 12% per annum, compounded monthly, and will be payable monthly in arrears. Prior to the maturity of the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan, interest will not be required to be paid in cash and will be added to the outstanding principal of the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan and will thereafter be deemed to be part of the principal indebtedness due thereunder upon maturity. The Kien Huat Subordinate Loan may be repaid in full or in part at any time without premium or penalty. 
The Kien Huat Subordinate Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including a restriction on the use of the proceeds of the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan as described above. Obligations under the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan Agreement may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as applicable), including among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of the affirmative covenants; and a default in payment of or acceleration of the Bangkok Bank Loan. Additionally, any future amendments to the Bangkok Bank Loan Agreement relating to default provisions thereunder, prepayment provisions or an increase of the maximum principal amount thereunder will be subject to Kien Huat's prior written consent. 
The Company agreed to indemnify and defend Kien Huat and its affiliates from negligent acts or omissions of the Company and its affiliates, any failure of the Company to comply with the terms of the Kien Huat Subordinate Loan Agreement and any failure of the Company to comply with any laws, except to the extent resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Kien Huat or its affiliates.  Subsidiary Revolving Loan Agreement 
On November 30, 2018, the Company entered into a Revolving Loan Agreement (the "Sub Revolving Loan Agreement") with its indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, Montreign Operating Company, LLC ("Montreign Operating"). The Sub Revolving Loan Agreement provides for loans (in the aggregate, the "Sub Revolving Loan") to Montreign Operating in an aggregate principal amount of up to $10 million (the "Subsidiary Loan Amount"). Interest will accrue on outstanding borrowings at a rate of 7% per annum and will be payable beginning on the last day of each calendar quarter beginning on March 31, 2019. Of that interest, 1% will be payable in cash and 6% will accrue and remain outstanding until paid in full (and continue to bear interest). The Sub Revolving Loan, together with interest accrued and yet unpaid, will be due and payable on April 25, 2023. 
As a condition to each advance under the Sub Revolving Loan, (i) Montreign Operating is required to deliver a written request for an advance three days before the date on which the advance is made; (ii) after giving effect to the advance, the principal amount outstanding will not exceed the Loan Amount, and (iii) no event of default will have occurred and be continuing, or would occur after giving effect to the advance, on the date of the advance request. 
The Sub Revolving Loan Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and affirmative covenants, including representations, warranties and covenants on organization, authorization, enforceability and maintenance of existence. The Sub Revolving Loan is secured by a security interest in all personal property of Montreign Operating subject to the limitations and exceptions described in the Sub Revolving Loan Agreement. Obligations under the Sub Revolving Loan Agreement may be accelerated upon certain customary events of default, including, among others: nonpayment of principal, interest or fees; breach of any term, covenant, or agreement under the Sub Revolving Loan Agreement; a bankruptcy proceeding involving Montreign, whether voluntary or involuntary; or the acceleration of any indebtedness in excess of $10 million. 
Montreign Operating agreed to indemnify the Company and its officers, partners, members, directors, employees and agents (together, the "Indemnified Parties" and each an "Indemnified Party") against any and all damages arising out of any negligence or tortious acts or omissions by Montreign Operating or its agents, contractors, servants or employees, any failure by Montreign Operating to comply with the terms of the Sub Revolving Loan Agreement, and any failure by Montreign Operating to comply with the law, except to the extent any such damages result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of an Indemnified Party. 
On November 30, 2018 and December 7, 2018, the Company advanced an aggregate of $10 million to Montreign Operating pursuant to a request for advance under the Sub Revolving Loan. 
Moelis & Company Agreements 
2019 Moelis Letter Agreement 
On February 15, 2019, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Moelis & Company LLC ("Moelis") (the "2019 Moelis Letter Agreement"), pursuant to which Moelis will act as the Company's financial advisor to review and analyze the Company's historical results, financial projections and business plan, conduct a business and financial analysis of the Company's prospective online gaming and sports betting business, and evaluate the capital structure of the Company and/or its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the 2019 Moelis Letter Agreement, we paid Moelis a general advisory fee of approximately $350,000 upon execution of the agreement.  2018 Moelis Letter Agreement 
On August 7, 2018, the Company and Moelis entered into an engagement agreement (the "2018 Moelis Letter Agreement") to act as the Company's exclusive financial advisor in its review of opportunities in online gaming, sports betting and interactive gaming. Pursuant to the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement, Moelis was engaged as exclusive financial advisor with respect to a strategic financing transaction for the Company, if any. Pursuant to the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement, we paid Moelis a retainer fee of $100,000 upon execution of the agreement. In the event a transaction was to be consummated, the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement contemplated additional transaction-based fees would be earned by Moelis. On November 9, 2018, the Company and Moelis entered into an amendment (the "2018 Moelis Letter Agreement Amendment") to the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement. Pursuant to the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement Amendment, the parties agreed no fee would be payable to Moelis in connection with any equity investment in connection with a strategic agreement relating to sports betting. In addition, pursuant to the 2018 Moelis Letter Agreement Amendment, the fee payable to Moelis with respect to the Collaboration Agreement was increased from $3 million to $4 million. In November 2018, the Company paid approximately $4.1 million to Moelis upon the consummation of the Collaboration Agreement to pay fees and expenses due. 
Mr. Polle, one of the directors of the Company, is a Managing Director of Moelis. Mr. Polle refrained from participating in the discussion of, and the determination of whether to enter into each agreement. 
Genting Americas Severance Payment to Mr. Sanko 
Pursuant to an amended severance agreement with Genting Americas, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Genting Malaysia Berhad, an affiliate of Tan Sri Lim Kok Thay who is the beneficiary of, and indirectly controls, Kien Huat, the Company's largest stockholder, in January 2018, Mr. Sanko received a one-time cash payment of $250,000 plus the value of accrued benefits, including accrued paid time off. In addition, in January 2018, Mr. Sanko received a cash bonus of $212,500 under a Genting Americas bonus plan in which he was an eligible participant. 
Audit Committee Review 
Our Audit Committee Charter provides that the Audit Committee will review and approve all transactions between the Company and its officers, directors, director nominees, principal stockholders and their immediate family members. We intend that any such transactions will be on terms no less favorable to the Company than the Company could obtain from unaffiliated third parties.  PROPOSALS TO BE VOTED ON 
PROPOSAL NUMBER ONE—ELECTION OF DIRECTORS 
Introduction and Nominees 
The Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of our Board has nominated each of Emanuel R. Pearlman, Ryan Eller, Keith Horn, Edmund Marinucci, Nancy A. Palumbo, Gregg Polle and Gerard Ewe Keng Lim to serve as directors until the 2020 annual meeting of stockholders (subject to their respective earlier removal, death or resignation) or until their successors are elected and qualified. 
We have been advised by each of Messrs. Pearlman, Eller, Horn, Marinucci, Polle and Lim and Ms. Palumbo that they are willing to be named as a nominee and each are willing to continue to serve as a director if elected. Unless you indicate otherwise, shares represented by executed proxies will be voted for the election as directors of each nominee (each of whom is now a director) unless any such nominee shall be unavailable, in which case such shares will be voted for a substitute nominee designated by the Board. We have no reason to believe that any of the nominees will be unavailable or, if elected, will decline to serve. 
Agreement with Investor 
Pursuant to that certain Investment Agreement, Kien Huat is entitled to recommend three nominees, whom we are required to cause to be elected or appointed to our Board, subject to the satisfaction of all legal and governance requirements regarding service as a director and to the reasonable approval of the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee of the Board, for so long as Kien Huat maintains ownership of at least 24% of the voting power of our capital stock outstanding at such time. For as long as Kien Huat is entitled to designate nominees for directors to the Board, it will have the right to nominate one of its nominees elected to serve as a director to serve as Chairman of the Board. Each of Messrs. Eller, Lim and Pearlman have been designated as nominees by Kien Huat pursuant to this right. In addition, for so long as Kien Huat owns capital stock with at least 30% of the voting power of our capital stock outstanding at such time, certain decisions made by the Board relating to fundamental transactions involving us and our subsidiaries and certain other matters require the approval of the directors designated by Kien Huat. We believe that this arrangement is an appropriate reflection of the Company's underlying ownership structure. 
The sections titled "Directors and Executive Officers" and "Director Qualifications" on pages 12 and 23, respectively, of this proxy statement contain more information about the leadership skills and other experiences that caused the Corporate Governance and Nominations Committee and the Board to determine that these nominees should serve as directors of the Company. 
Required Vote 
The seven nominees receiving the highest number of affirmative votes shall be elected as directors. Unless marked to the contrary, proxies received will be voted "FOR" these nominees. 
For the purposes of election of each director, although abstentions and broker non-votes will count toward the presence of a quorum, they will not be counted as votes cast on this proposal and therefore will have no effect on the result of the vote for the election of directors.  Recommendation 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the election to the Board of each of the abovementioned nominees.  PROPOSAL NUMBER TWO—RATIFICATION OF AUDITOR 
Introduction 
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 and recommends that stockholders vote "FOR" ratification of this appointment. Although stockholder approval of this appointment is not required by law and is not binding on the Company, the Audit Committee will take your vote on this proposal into consideration when appointing the independent registered public accounting firm in the future. Even if you ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP, the Audit Committee may, in its sole discretion, terminate such engagement and direct the appointment of another independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the year, although it has no current intention to do so. Ernst & Young LLP was initially appointed by the Audit Committee on March 20, 2012. Representatives of Ernst & Young LLP are expected to be present at the Annual Meeting, with the opportunity to make a statement if they desire to do so, and are expected to be available to respond to appropriate questions. 
Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
On March 11, 2019, the Audit Committee of the Board appointed the firm of Ernst & Young LLP ("E&Y") to serve as our independent auditors for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2019. The independent accountant's report of E&Y on our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. 
As discussed in greater detail below, the following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us to E&Y and during the indicated periods: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
 Audit Fees (1)      $ 1,087,000      $ 845,000      $ 911,000

  (2)  Comprised of services rendered in connection with our audit of the Company's employee benefit plan.   
  (3)  Comprised of services for tax compliance and tax return preparation.  
[END TABLE]
Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures 
All audit and non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm must be approved in advance by the Audit Committee. Consistent with applicable law, limited amounts of services, other than audit, review or attest services, may be approved by one or more members of the Audit Committee pursuant to authority delegated by the Audit Committee, provided each such approved service is reported to the full Audit Committee at its next meeting.  All of the engagements and fees for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 were approved by the Audit Committee. In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, E&Y only used full-time, permanent employees. 
Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. 
None. 
Required Vote 
The proposal to ratify the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for 2019 requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of votes cast by holders of Voting Stock present, in person or by proxy, and entitled to vote on the proposal. 
Abstentions will have no effect on the outcome of this proposal. In addition, this proposal is a "routine" matter on which brokers and nominees can vote on behalf of their clients if clients do not furnish voting instructions, therefore, broker non-votes are considered votes cast and will have an effect on the outcome of this proposal. 
Recommendation 
Our Board recommends a vote "FOR" the ratification of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019.  PROPOSAL NUMBER THREE—APPROVAL OF OUR 2018 EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION 
Introduction 
As required by the SEC's proxy rules, we are seeking an advisory, non-binding stockholder vote with respect to compensation awarded to our Named Executive Officers for 2018. 
Our executive compensation program and compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers are described starting on page 24 of this proxy statement. Our compensation programs are overseen by the Compensation Committee and reflect our philosophy to pay all of our employees, including our Named Executive Officers, in ways that support three primary business objectives: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• Attract and retain the best talent.  
• Support our culture of performance.  
• Align employee interests with long-term stockholder interests in the overall success of the Company.   
[END TABLE]
To help achieve these objectives, we structure our Named Executive Officers' compensation to reward the achievement of short-term and long-term strategic and operational goals. Stockholders are being asked to approve the following resolution at the Annual Meeting: 
Resolved, that the stockholders approve the compensation awarded to the Company's Named Executive Officers in 2018, as disclosed under SEC rules, including the compensation tables and related narrative disclosures included in this proxy statement. 
Required Vote 
The affirmative "FOR" vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting by the holders of the Voting Stock present in person or represented by proxy and entitled to vote at the Annual Meeting, voting as one class, is required for approval of the advisory vote on executive compensation. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon our Board. However, the Compensation Committee will consider the outcome of the vote, along with other relevant factors, in evaluating its executive compensation program. In tabulating the voting results for the advisory vote on executive compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. 
Recommendation 
THE BOARD RECOMMENDS THAT OUR STOCKHOLDERS VOTE "FOR" THE APPROVAL OF THE FOREGOING RESOLUTION.  PROPOSAL NUMBER FOUR— DETERMINE FREQUENCY OF STOCKHOLDER 
ADVISORY VOTE REGARDING COMPENSATION AWARDED TO NAMED EXECUTIVE 
OFFICERS 
Introduction 
As required by the SEC's proxy rules, we are seeking an advisory, non-binding stockholder vote about how often we should present stockholders with the opportunity to vote on compensation awarded to our Named Executive Officers. You may elect to have the vote held every year, every two years, or every three years, or you may abstain. We recommend that this advisory vote be held once every three years, but stockholders are not voting to approve or disapprove of that recommendation. We believe that a triennial voting frequency will provide our stockholders with sufficient time to evaluate the effectiveness of our overall compensation philosophy, policies, and practices in the context of our long-term business results for the corresponding period, while avoiding over-emphasis on short-term variations in compensation and business results. We also believe that a three-year timeframe provides a better opportunity to observe and evaluate the impact of any changes to our executive compensation policies and practices that have occurred since the last advisory vote. 
Required Vote 
The frequency that receives the highest number of votes cast will be deemed to be the frequency selected by the stockholders. Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon our Board. However, the Board will consider the outcome of the stockholder vote, along with other relevant factors, in recommending a voting frequency to our Board of Directors. In tabulating the voting results for the frequency of advisory votes on executive compensation, abstentions and broker non-votes will have no effect on the outcome of such proposal. 
Recommendation 
Our Board of Directors recommends a vote for a frequency of once every "THREE YEARS" for the stockholder advisory vote on compensation to our Named Executive Officers.  OTHER MATTERS 
The Company knows of no other matters to be submitted to the shareholders at the Annual Meeting. If any other matters properly come before the shareholders at the Annual Meeting, it is the intention of the persons named on the proxy to vote the shares represented thereby on such matters in accordance with their best judgment. 
Stockholder Proposals 
For any proposal to be considered for inclusion in our proxy statement and form of proxy for submission to the stockholders at our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, it must be submitted in writing and comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of the Exchange Act. Such proposals must be received by the Company at its offices at c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701 no later than November 23, 2019. 
In addition, our Third Amended and Restated Bylaws provide notice procedures for stockholders to nominate a person as a director and to propose business to be considered by stockholders at a meeting. Notice of a nomination or proposal must be delivered to us not less than 120 days and not more than 180 days prior to the date we first mailed our proxy materials for the preceding year's annual meeting of stockholders, or not more than 15 days from the public announcement of the meeting if the meeting is first publicly announced less than 90 days prior to the date of the meeting. Accordingly, for our 2020 annual meeting, notice of a nomination or proposal must be delivered to us no later than November 23, 2019 and no earlier than September 24, 2020. Nominations and proposals also must satisfy other requirements set forth in the Third Amended and Restated Bylaws. If a stockholder fails to comply with the foregoing notice provision or with certain additional procedural requirements under SEC rules, the Company will have authority to vote shares under proxies we solicit when and if the nomination or proposal is raised at the annual meeting of stockholders and, to the extent permitted by law, on any other business that may properly come before the annual meeting of stockholders and any adjournments or postponements. The Executive Chairman of the Board may refuse to acknowledge the introduction of any stockholder proposal not made in compliance with the foregoing procedures. 
Householding Information 
Unless we have received contrary instructions, we may send a single copy of this proxy statement to any household at which two or more stockholders reside if we believe the stockholders are members of the same family. This process, known as "householding," reduces the volume of duplicate information received at any one household and helps to reduce our expenses. However, if stockholders prefer to receive multiple sets of our disclosure documents at the same address this year or in future years, the stockholders should follow the instructions described below. Similarly, if an address is shared with another stockholder and together both of the stockholders would like to receive only a single set of our disclosure documents, the stockholders should follow these instructions: 
[BEGIN TABLE]
• If the shares are registered in the name of the stockholder, the stockholder should contact us at Empire Resorts,  Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701, to inform us of their request; or  
• If a bank, broker or other nominee holds the shares, the stockholder should contact the bank, broker or other  nominee directly.  
[END TABLE]
 Where You Can Find More Information 
We file annual and quarterly reports and other reports and information with the SEC. We distribute to our stockholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and, upon request, quarterly reports for the first three quarters of each fiscal year containing unaudited financial information. In addition, the reports and other information are filed through Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (known as "EDGAR") system and are publicly available on the SEC's site on the Internet, located at www.sec.gov. We will provide without charge to you, upon written or oral request, a copy of the reports and other information filed with the SEC. 
Any requests for copies of information, reports or other filings with the SEC should be directed to Empire Resorts, Inc., c/o Monticello Casino and Raceway, 204 State Route 17B, P.O. Box 5013, Monticello, New York 12701, Attn: Secretary.  YOUR VOTE IS IMPORTANT. PLEASE VOTE TODAY.
